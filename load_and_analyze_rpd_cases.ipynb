    "Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Data Source: In the fall of 2022 the Immigration and Refugee Board provided the RLL with a full backlog of approximately 116k published decisions from all divisions (RAD, RPD, ID, IAD). Because the IRB no longer regularly publishes RPD decisions, the dataset is no longer being updated, which is why we refer to the \n",
    "dataset as a legacy dataset. For more recent RPD decisions (obtained via Access to Information Requests), \n",
    "see the RLLR dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Unofficial Data: The data are unofficial reproductions. For official versions, please contact the Immigration and Refugee Board. \n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Non-Affiliation / Endorsement: The data has been collected and reproduced without any affiliation or endorsement from the Immigration and Refugee Board.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Non-Commerical Use: As indicated in the license, data may be used for non-commercial use (with attribution) only. For commercial use, please contact the Immigration and Refugee Board. \n",
    "\n",
    "(5) Accuracy: Data was collected and processed programmatically for the purposes of academic research. While we make best efforts to ensure accuracy, data gathering of this kind inevitably involves errors. As such the data should be viewed as preliminary information aimed to prompt further research and discussion, rather than as definitive information.\n",

      "REASONS FOR DECISION\n",
      "[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX is a citizen of China. He claims for refugee protection pursuant to sections 96, 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\n",
      "ALLEGATIONS\n",
      "[2] The claimant alleges that around XXXX 2010, the village head gave his family a written notice to move out of their property by XXXX XXXX, 2011 because the government had planned to build a XXXX running through their property. His family was told that the compensation for that property to them would be XXXX XXXX XXXX RMB.\n",
      "[3] On XXXX XXXX, 2011, they were informed by the real estate company they visited, to obtain assessment of their property, that the compensation that they were being offered was low. The real estate company assessed their property to be between XXXX XXXX XXXX RMB and XXXX XXXX XXXX RMB.\n",
      "[4] On XXXX XXXX, 2011, property owners affected by the government's decision to build a XXXX visited the town government offices where they were told that the amount offered to them could not be changed since the compensations offered were assessed collectively. They were advised to return to the town government at a later date.\n",
      "[5] A week later the property owners returned to the government offices where they were told that the compensation amount for their properties would not change. The property owners shouted at the head of the town government and as a result the security guards kicked them out of the building.\n",
      "[6] On XXXX XXXX, 2011, the head of the village came with security guards to the village to remind them about moving out by XXXX XXXX, 2011 or face consequences. On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2011, the head of the village came with trucks and bulldozers to demolish their properties. The property owners confronted the head of the village and the security who accompanied him resulting in arrests of some of his neighbours and his father.\n",
      "[7] After his father's arrest the claimant decided to go into hiding at his cousin's place. On XXXX XXXX, 2011, his mother called the claimant at his cousin's home to inform him that the Public Security Bureau (PSB) had been to their home and had left a summons for him. At that point, his cousin arranged for a smuggler to exit him from China.\n",
      "[8] Detailed Personal Information Form (PIF) narrative can be found in Exhibit C-1.\n",
      "DETERMINATION\n",
      "[9] For the reasons that follow, the panel finds that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n",
      "ANALYSIS\n",
      "Identity\n",
      "[10] The identity documents2 provided establishes that the claimant is a citizen of China.\n",
      "Credibility\n",
      "[11] The determinative issue in this claim is credibility whether the claimant's evidence is credible and trustworthy. The panel finds that the claimant is not a credible witness and is not currently wanted for arrest by the PSB on account of his alleged confrontation with the village head on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2011. As such, the panel finds that there is not a serious possibility that he would be persecuted by the PSB in China.\n",
      "[12] In assessing credibility, the panel was mindful of the claimant's age, education, and background. He alleges that he has 9 years of formal education. In addition, the panel is cognizant of the many difficulties faced by a claimant in establishing a claim, including cultural factors, the milieu of the hearing room, and the stress inherent in responding to oral questions through an interpreter and nervousness. The panel has taken these considerations into account in arriving at negative credibility findings.\n",
      "[13] The reasons for this negative decision are noted below.\n",
      "[14] At the hearing the claimant was asked if he had provided documentary evidence regarding the offer the Chinese government had made to expropriate his father's property. Counsel indicated that he had not submitted such document to the RPD. The claimant pulled out a document in Chinese, not translated in English, to indicate the offer the Chinese government had made to expropriate his father's property.\n",
      "[15] When asked to explain why he had not submitted the document to the RPD in accordance with the RPD rules, the claimant indicated that he had given the document to his counsel, implying his counsel had not submitted the document to the RPD. Upon examining the document, the panel found that the document was a computer printout having no signature(s) of the individual(s) who had written the document. At no time during the hearing did the claimant's counsel indicate that he had received the document and it was he who did not submit it to the RPD.\n",
      "[16] Information about expropriation of the claimant's father's property is central and material to the claimant's claim. The onus is on the claimant to establish persuasively that his father's property was being expropriated. Since the document the claimant provided during the hearing was not provided within the time limit of RPD rules and the panel felt it was computer generated and not signed, the panel gives no weight to that document.\n",
      "[17] The assessment document3 from the real estate company is also computer generated and that document does not show why it was obtained other than simply assessing his father's property at that time. The panel has no other documentary evidence to show that the government of China was expropriating the claimant's father's property.\n",
      "[18] As a result, the panel is not persuaded to believe that the Chinese authorities had issued expropriation notice to the claimant's father and therefore, the documents4 regarding his father's arrest are not as a result of confronting the Chinese officials who were allegedly trying to demolish his father's property.\n",
      "[19] Furthermore, at the hearing, the claimant indicated that he lived with his father and his mother at the property that was being expropriated by the Chinese government. He indicated that that property was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX City.\n",
      "[20] He testified that his family was being offered less compensation than that assessed by a real estate company. As a result, his father, he and other property owners in the village confronted the head of the village and members of the security who had gone to demolish their properties on XXXX XXXX, 2011. Because of that confrontation, the security had arrested his father. He was able to escape to his cousin's home and while he lived with his cousin, his mother, still living at his father's property, informed him that the PSB were looking for him.\n",
      "[21] At the hearing, the claimant did not provide a notarized affidavit from his mother indicating that the PSB were looking for the claimant and had left a summons against him. There is no notarized affidavit from his cousin to indicate that he fled to his cousin's home and it was his cousin who found a smuggler to exit him from China. His cousin's notarized affidavit would have helped the panel to determine that the claimant went into hiding at his home on XXXX XXXX, 2011.\n",
      "[22] When asked to explain why he had not obtained these affidavits, the claimant indicated that he had no idea that he had to provide such documents. His response is not reasonable since he was represented by a counsel and was instructed in question 31 in his PIF to provide documentary evidence to establish his claim.\n",
      "[23] With the absence of notarized affidavits from his mother and his cousin the claimant has not established persuasively that he lived in hiding at his cousin's home and the PSB were seeking his whereabouts from his mother and had left a summons for him.\n",
      "[24] Based on the evidence adduced, the panel is not persuaded to believe that the claimant lived in hiding with his cousin and the PSB were seeking his whereabouts from his mother. As a result, the panel finds that the summons5 provided by the claimant is not a genuine document. It is fabricated for the purpose of the claimant's refugee claim.\n",
      "[25] In regards to his residence, the claimant's original PIF6 does not indicate that his mother and he lived at the property that was allegedly being expropriated by the Chinese government. His port of entry (POE)7 documents, declared by him to be complete, true and correct, also do not indicate that his mother and he lived with his father at the property that was being expropriated by the Chinese government.\n",
      "[26] The copy of the hukou8 he provided also does not indicate that his mother and he lived with his father at the property that was being expropriated. His hukou indicates that a person by the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX lived with his father. Although in his testimony the claimant indicated that he had a brother called XXXX XXXX XXXX who lived in a different province, the hukou he provided does not indicate that to be so. Moreover, his original PIF and his POE documents do not indicate that he had any siblings.\n",
      "[27] When asked to explain why his and his mother's name did not appear in the hukou9 he had provided. He indicated he had given his original hukou to the immigration officer at the POE. His response is not reasonable since the POE documents provided do not contain the claimant's hukou, as a result the panel disbelieves that the claimant's hukou was taken by the immigration officer at POE.\n",
      "[28] Although the claimant's Resident Identification Card (RIC)10 shows that he lived with his father at the time he obtained his RIC, that document dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2006, does not indicate where he lived thereafter. At the hearing the claimant indicated that he had no other documentary evidence to persuade the panel into believing that his mother and he lived with his father at the time his father's property was being expropriated.\n",
      "[29] Therefore, based on the evidence adduced the panel is not persuaded to believe that the claimant and his mother lived with the claimant's father in the home that was allegedly being expropriated by the Chinese government.\n",
      "[30] The claimant provided an amended PIF11 on the day of the hearing contrary to the PRD rules for providing documentary evidence. The claimant represented by a counsel, did not inform the RPD division that an amended PIF would be provided at the hearing. The panel is of the opinion that the claimant provided an amended PIF on the day of the hearing to undermine the RPD rules.\n",
      "[31] As a result, the panel does not give any weight to the documentary evidence12 and hence the panel finds that the claimant has fabricated his story about living at his father's property for the purpose of his refugee claim. Therefore, the panel finds that the claimant and his mother did not live with his father at the property that was allegedly being expropriated.\n",
      "[32] Without persuasive documentary evidence the panel is not persuaded to believe where in China the claimant and his mother lived and hence the panel does not find it plausible that the claimant was involved with his father in confronting the village head and the members of the security on XXXX XXXX, 2011 as alleged.\n",
      "[33] Also, based on aforementioned, the panel is not persuaded into believing that the PSB met with the claimant's mother looking for the claimant since the panel has no persuasive documentary evidence to indicate where she lived in China, since the panel disbelieves that she lived with her husband and received summons13 on behalf of the claimant.\n",
      "[34] As a result, the panel finds that the summons14 the claimant provided is fabricated for the purpose of his refugee claim. Since the panel disbelieves that the PSB were looking for the claimant and had issued a summons against him, it finds that the PSB has no interest to harm the claimant in China and as a result, his fear of persecution at the hands of the PSB is not objectively well-founded.\n",
      "[35] Since the panel does not find that the claimant's father's property was being expropriated by the Chinese government and the claimant's fear of persecution at the hands of the PSB is not objectively well founded, the panel does not find that the claimant feared the PSB when he was exiting China. As a result, the panel finds that the claimant's story about using a smuggler to exit china using a fraudulent passport is also fabricated to bolster his refugee claim.\n",
      "[36] Based on the totality of the evidence adduced, since the panel finds that the claimant's fear of persecution at the hands of the PSB is not objectively well-founded, the panel finds that there is less than a mere possibility that he would be persecuted by the PSB in China.\n",
      "[37] The panel's credibility findings also apply to the claimant's assertion that he faces a risk to his life or of being subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in China. Since the claimant is not a credible witness and his fear of persecution at the hands of the PSB is not objectively well-founded, the panel finds that the claimant does not face a risk to his life or to being subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or to a danger of being tortured, should he return to China.\n",
      "[38] Also, the panel has reviewed all of the documentation entered as exhibits in this case. Based on the documentary evidence, there is no persuasive evidence to indicate that the claimant will be subjected to any other risk, other than the risk of general violence which all citizens in China are subjected to.\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "[39] Therefore, the panel finds that XXXX XXXX XXXX is not a Convention refugee, nor is he a person in need of protection pursuant to sections 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b) of the IRPA.\n",

      "TA0-17763\n",
      "Basis of the Claim\n",
      "The claimant, XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, is a citizen of India. She left that country, with the assistance of a smuggler, on XXXXX, 2000 and arrived in Canada five days later. She made her application for refugee protection at the POE asserting a fear of terrorists because she refused to make food for them.1\n",
      "Before the Board the claimant alleged she is the survivor of an abusive marriage. The claimant separated from her husband in 19962 and, with his consent, the couple divorced in 1999.3 The ex-husband maintained a violent pursuit of the claimant both before and after their divorce. The claimant says she twice attempted to relocate elsewhere in India but each time her former spouse tracked her down and physically assaulted her. The claimant states, further, that since leaving India her ex-spouse has attacked and threatened her family members.4 The claimant alleges her brother was involved in a fight with the ex-husband in 2005, suffered a heart attack as a result and died.5 The claimant fears she will be killed or seriously harmed by her ex-husband and/or his associates if she returns to India. She does not believe the Indian authorities are able to adequately protect her from her former husband.\n",
      "Procedural History\n",
      "This claim was originally heard and determined by another panel of the then Convention Refugee Determination Division.6 That panel rejected the claim finding that, while the allegation of an abusive marriage was credible, the claimant's evidence with respect to the ongoing risk following her divorce was not believable and, therefore, she had no well-founded fear of persecution if she returned to India.\n",
      "That decision was successfully challenged before the Federal Court and remitted back for re-hearing before a differently constituted panel of the Board.7\n",
      "The hearing came on before me on December 13, 2004. Counsel examined the claimant first. The claimant was very emotional during questioning by both her counsel and the RPO. We took two extended breaks to allow her to compose herself. Upon resuming after the second break it was obvious to everyone we would be unable to complete the evidence that day. In the circumstances we adjourned and I asked the RPO to have the police reports concerning the incidents of abuse during the marriage verified by the Mission in Dehli. In doing so I explained that I hoped further oral testimony with respect to those incidents of alleged persecution would be unnecessary and, upon resumption, the evidence could focus on the reasonableness of the claimant's forward-looking fear of persecution and the availability of state protection. The claimant consented to this procedure and signed a formal AIF request.\n",
      "The hearing was scheduled to resume in April 2005 but, as the results of the AIF had not been received, that date was adjourned to September 2005. The hearing proceeded in September although the AIF results were still outstanding. RPO completed her examination of the claimant and both counsel and the RPO examined with respect to the attack on the brother. We also heard the testimony of two witnesses. The RPO provided her observations and counsel made her submissions.\n",
      "The matter was again adjourned pending receipt of the AIF results. If those results were not received by December 15 I directed the RPO, with counsel's consent, to cancel the AIF request following which the claim would be placed on reserve.\n",
      "By memo dated 13 December 2005 results of the AIF verifications were provided to the RPO8. These were forwarded to counsel by letter dated December 21, 2005 with instructions to advise the Board if counsel wished to resume the hearing after reviewing the results. Counsel did so. The matter resumed, without the RPO, on February 23, 2006.\n",
      "Determination\n",
      "In making my decision I have considered the Chairperson's Guidelines with respect to the determination of claims by women fearing gender related persecution particularly as they speak to challenges in assessing the testimony of victims of domestic violence. I am not satisfied the claimant has provided sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to support her claim. Consequently, I find she does not have a well-founded fear of persecution if returned to India and is not a person in need of protection within the meaning of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Her claim is rejected. My reasons follow.\n",
      "Analysis\n",
      "The determinative issue in this claim is credibility. As noted above, the claimant testified in a very emotional manner. She wept uncontrollably at several points during the sittings, required questions to be repeated or was unresponsive to questions. Her evidence disclosed omissions from the PIF with respect to alleged incidents of persecution occurring between the divorce and her departure for Canada, an obvious inconsistency between her POE statement and the basis of the claim asserted in her PIF, inconsistencies with respect to the sequence of important events, inconsistencies between her original PIF and the divorce judgement, and issues with respect to the plausibility of her allegations.\n",
      "The claimant's highly emotional state while testifying seemed inconsistent with the fact the events recounted occurred well in the past. Further, she had been safe in Canada for over four years prior to the commencement of the hearing before me, was assisted by obviously compassionate counsel, questioned most gently by the RPO, and had already experienced a hearing before the Board so was in a position to know what to expect from the process.\n",
      "The claimant had difficulty providing spontaneous or reasonable explanations for the problems with her evidence. Had there been no other evidentiary concerns I might have accepted the explanation for the inconsistency between the POE and PIF. However, the mischaracterization of her divorce in the initial PIF and omission of the alleged attacks on the claimant following her divorce were significant. Evidence of the alleged attacks was particularly important as they supported the ex-husband's refusal to accept the divorce as ending his control over the claimant, purportedly caused the claimant's family to send her to Canada, and were more recent than the other incidents.\n",
      "Still, I am the first to agree that demeanour is not the most reliable tool by which to assess credibility and, as noted above, am mindful of the caution necessary when assessing testimony and behaviour in gender-related claims. Responses to stressful situations vary between individuals and may include inappropriate emotional reactions such as tears or laughter. The claimant's 2004 psychological report records frequent crying spells as a symptom of her depression and post-traumatic stress.9 Moreover, the passage of time might not insulate the claimant from an emotional reaction to describing the horrific incidents of persecution she allegedly endured and could account for her inability to provide her testimony in a clear and coherent fashion. In these circumstances I was reluctant to make negative credibility findings without the results of the AIF inquiry. If the AIF results were positive I was prepared to afford the claimant the benefit of the doubt with respect to her ex-husband's violence. Given very patriarchal society from which she fled, if credible with respect to the violence during marriage the possibility that violence would continue after the marriage ended was reasonably plausible based on my knowledge and understanding of the objective conditions facing Indian women.\n",
      "The Mission's investigation disclosed the three FIRs10 sent for verification were not genuine. Names of the complainant and accused and nature of the alleged crimes were entirely different.11 Counsel did not dispute the results of the verification. The claimant explained her father had obtained the FIRs on her behalf. She had no personal knowledge of how he had done so. Although counsel initially advised the Board of his intention to have the father testify on this point by way of telephone conference call, and arrangements were made for this purpose, he chose not to do so at the hearing. I draw a negative inference as a result.\n",
      "Claimant produced an affidavit from her father explaining the family had used XXXXX XXXXX to make their complaints to the police but were not sure whether the FIRs had actually been filed.12 A 2001 affidavit from a XXXXX XXXXX makes no reference to going to the police or being asked to go to the police by the family and does not refer personal knowledge of the 1996 attack.13 The FIRs make no reference to XXXXX as a reporter of the complaints and appear to record interviews with the claimant and her father. That version of the evidence is consistent with the claimant's oral testimony. XXXXX may have been the unidentified friend who was asked to follow up with the police, although the claimant's evidence on this point was incredibly vague, but there is no question her earlier testimony was she had personally made two reports to the police and her father had made one. In the circumstances I do not accept the explanation for the AIF results as reasonable. Moreover, I find, on a balance of probabilities given the claimant's previous testimony with respect to having made reports to the police, she was aware these documents were not genuine yet sought to rely on them in support of her claim. By doing so she seriously undermined the credibility of her allegations. This in itself is sufficient to conclude the claimant is not credible.\n",
      "Counsel submitted that, while the FIRs were unreliable, the claimant had produced numerous other documents to corroborate her claim including the psychological assessments prepared by Dr. XXXXX. The witnesses presented at the September 2005 also corroborated the claimant's testimony. In sum, therefore, counsel submitted there was sufficient credible evidence to support her claim.\n",
      "After reviewing the remaining documents and the evidence I am unable to accept counsel's submissions. If genuine, the FIRs would corroborate the violent nature of the claimant's marriage and recourse to the police for protection. Nothing objectively reliable remains before the Board to corroborate those allegations. The claimant's other documents, with the exception of the divorce certificate14, all post-date her departure from India.15 Like the FIRs, the claimant obtained these documents with the assistance of her family in India.16 I find the claimant's reliance on the fraudulent FIRs casts considerable doubt on the authenticity of her other documents. The affidavits produced are from her\n",
      "parents17, family members,18 or persons alleged to be neighbours.19 Family members have an obvious interest in the outcome of the claim. The affidavit of XXXXX is clearly inconsistent with the information contained in the parent's 2006 affidavit.20 The neighbours' affidavits purport to corroborate events leading to the filing of the FIRs. The FIRs are not reliable and, consequently, the information in those affidavits is equally suspect. I give them little or no weight in the circumstances. There is no credible or trustworthy evidence the claimant was the victim of domestic violence. That finding, in itself, is sufficient to dispose of the claim.\n",
      "With respect to the allegations of persecution following the divorce, given the absence of any reasonable explanation for their omission from the both PIF and the numerous amendments to the PIF, I do not accept there is credible evidence the ex-husband attacked the claimant twice in the market and once at home prior to her departure from India. I find, on a balance of probabilities, there is no credible evidence to support the alleged pursuit of the claimant following the uncontested divorce in 1999.\n",
      "The brother's death certificate gives no cause of death21. Without a reliable medical report connecting the brother's death with the attack by the ex-husband I give the death certificate no weight as corroborating the alleged attack on the brother.\n",
      "The evidence of the two witnesses is insufficient to offset the obvious credibility concerns identified above. One witness has a close, although not blood, relationship with the claimant and they presently live in the same residence. I find he has an interest in the outcome of the claim. The other witness, XXXXX XXXXX, testified he happened to be present at the claimant's parents' home during an altercation with the ex-husband in 2003. The witness' testimony and the amendments to the PIF concerning this incident differ somewhat with respect to how the incident was resolved and his role in it.22 This witness' testimony is the only allegedly objective evidence to refute the negative credibility findings concerning both the violence in the marriage and the violence following the divorce. The likelihood this witness, someone allegedly previously completely unknown to the claimant's family, would be visiting the claimant's parents on the very day and time the ex-husband showed up to harass them is extremely remote. I am unable to accept this evidence as sufficiently plausible to offset the numerous negative credibility findings made earlier.\n",
      "In further support for concluding the ex-husband is not a continuing threat to the claimant or her family, there is no evidence the claimant's family ever approached the police for assistance concerning the ex-husband's ongoing harassment. The ex-husband's behaviour as it relates to the family members cannot be construed as a \"domestic\" problem. The family has no reason to believe the police would refuse to assist them. The earlier FIRs cannot be relied on in this regard. Thus, the failure to approach the police for assistance particularly where they allege the son's death was as a result of the fight with the ex-husband, entirely undermines the credibility of the alleged incidents of harassment and violence by the ex-husband toward the claimant's family members.\n",
      "I am not in a position to question Dr. XXXXX diagnosis of the claimant's mental state. However, given my credibility findings, I am unable to accept, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant's mental problems are the consequence of the alleged incidents of persecution.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "For the above reasons I find there is no credible evidence to support the claim. The claimant has not established a well-founded fear of persecution and is not a person in need of protection. Her claim is rejected.\n",

      "REASONS AND DECISION\n",
      "[1] This is the decision in the claims of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX(\"the claimant\"),XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX(\"the female claimant\"), XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXand XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, citizens of Egypt, who are claiming refugee protection pursuant to s. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.1\n",
      "[2] These claims were joined according to Rule 49(1) of the Refugee Protection Division Rules, and the claimant was appointed as the Designated Representative for the minor children.\n",
      "ALLEGATIONS\n",
      "[3] These allegations of the claimants are from the two versions of their Basis of Claim forms (\"BOC\") filed with the Board, and from the testimony provided at their hearing. The claimants initially made a refugee claim on August 20, 2013. The BOC's they filed at that time indicated the current situation in Egypt to be generally problematic. Under the question \"have you or your family ever been harmed, mistreated or threatened by any person or group\" the claimant answered that his wife, the female claimant, experienced sexual harassment in Egypt due to the fact she does not wear a veil. The response to this question also includes the allegation that the claimants' neighbours are not friendly to them because they are liberal Muslims and these neighbours are Islamic Brotherhood followers.\n",
      "[4] After retaining counsel, the claimants filed Amended BOC's on October 23, 2013. These documents indicate, in response to the question \"have you or your family ever been harmed, mistreated or threatened by any person or group\" that the claimants have been targeted because of the claimant's public work in his field and because they are atheists. This document includes a narrative which indicates that the claimant did not include the details about what had happened to him because he was very afraid. He alleges that his work on XXXX XXXX has exposed him to the ire of radical Islamists in Egypt as they believe his views and work are anti-Islam. The claimant indicated that his car was damaged by the Muslim Brotherhood and he himself was attacked in XXXX 2012 by these radical Islamists. In XXXX of 2012, the female claimant was accosted and a man tried to kidnap her. The claimant's daughter was almost kidnapped in XXXX 2012. In XXXX of 2013 the female claimant was accosted by two men on a motorcycle who threw a bottle of dirty water in her face while shouting obscenities.\n",
      "[5] Fortunately, the male claimant had a job offer as a visiting XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and he left Egypt in XXXX of 2013 to begin his work in Canada, leaving his family behind. The claimant's wife remained in Egypt with the children until the school year had ended in XXXX of 2013, at which time she joined her husband in Canada.\n",
      "[6] When in Canada, the family received three threats against their lives from unknown parties in Egypt. The claimant moved house as a result but continued to receive these threats.\n",
      "DETERMINATION\n",
      "[7] The panel finds that the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. Furthermore, the panel finds the claim to have no credible basis, as per IRPA, Section 107(2). The determinative issues in this claim are credibility and subjective fear.\n",
      "ANALYSIS\n",
      "Identity\n",
      "[8] The panel finds that the claimants are all nationals of Egypt as is established by testimony and the supporting documentation filed, namely, the certified copies of their Egyptian passports.2\n",
      "Gender-Related Claim\n",
      "[9] Since the claims of the two female claimants potentially involve gender-related violence, the panel considered the Chairperson's Guidelines on gender-related persecution in reaching a decision in this claim.3\n",
      "Credibility\n",
      "[10] The panel finds that the claimants' story is not credible. Their testimony was delivered in a passionate fashion, but impassioned responses cannot compensate for egregious contradictions, omissions and behaviours which indicate a lack of subjective fear, especially when the claimants' explanations about these behaviours were not reasonable. There were many issues with the claimants' allegations, but the most glaring can be grouped into four categories: different allegations in the BOC's filed; the reason the Muslim Brotherhood are pursuing the claimants; the behaviour of the claimants in response; and the claimants' behaviour in response to the threats received in Canada.\n",
      "Differing Allegations between BOC's:\n",
      "[11] The panel has grave concerns about the shifting evidence provided by the claimants in their two BOC's, as noted in the allegations above. The claimant was asked why he has filed two different stories. His response was that when the family claimed initially, they filled in five different application forms and they were terrified. The panel rejects this explanation as unreasonable. The claimant attested that at the time he filled in these forms he was safely ensconced in Canada. Both adult claimants possess XXXX XXXX XXXX and were working in XXXX in Egypt. The claimant and the female claimant are in Canada working as XXXXfellows at the XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimant lived in the Czech Republic for a number of years as well. The panel finds that if anybody should realize that they are safe to tell their story in Canada, it would be this particular claimant. This has a negative impact on his credibility.\n",
      "[12] The claimant was asked why he indicated he was Muslim in his original BOC if he is actually an atheist, as he alleged later. The claimant answered that he was doubtful that he would be safe in Canada and he was worried that he would be assassinated here in Canada for holding such beliefs. If this were in fact true, it makes no sense that the claimant would seek refugee protection in Canada. In other words, if the claimant truly felt that Canada could not protect him, why would he seek such protection? This makes no sense to the panel and it has a negative impact on the claimant's credibility.\n",
      "[13] The claimant's original BOC does not indicate that the claimant sought the assistance of police in Egypt. In his amended BOC, he indicates that he went to the police on at least two occasions, once when he received threatening letters, once after his car was vandalized, allegedly by members of the Muslim Brotherhood, and once when he was attacked outside his home. In his testimony the claimant was asked how many times he went to the police and he stated he went on only one occasion in order to report the threatening letters. He was asked if he had either a police report or the threatening letters to provide to the panel. He indicated that he did not have a police report because the police station was burned three times. As for the threatening letters while he was in Egypt, the claimant indicated that he did not keep them. The panel views this assertion dubiously but does not make a negative inference against the claimant for the absence of these documents.\n",
      "Reason the Muslim Brotherhood are after the claimants:\n",
      "[14] The claimant indicated at the hearing that he is being persecuted due to his XXXX XXXX and beliefs. He submitted his XXXX XXXX4 to the panel in order to illustrate why he is being pursued. The claimant testified that he XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\" He was asked what in the XXXX exposes him to danger and he indicated that the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimant cited the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as the one that would expose him to risk. This XXXX is entitled \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\" The panel finds the claimant's allegation that the Muslim Brotherhood would be pursuing him for his XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n",
      "[15] The panel asked the claimant if others were XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX in Egypt. He replied in the affirmative. He was asked whether they had been persecuted for their work in this area. He responded that they don't talk about the XXXX XXXX XXXX-that they avoid talking about it. The panel finds this answer to be evasive. The panel finds the claimant's evidence about his fear in Egypt to be both specious and speculative. The panel rejects the argument that the claimant has been or would be targeted by the Islamists in Egypt for his work on XXXX XXXX to be not credible.\n",
      "Response by the claimants to threats received from Brotherhood:\n",
      "[16] In addition to not finding the reasons the Muslim Brotherhood would pursue the claimants to be credible, the panel also finds that the claimants took a number of questionable actions which the panel has found demonstrate a lack of subjective fear in Egypt. For the sake of brevity, the panel will outline these in point form:\n",
      "o the claimant testified that, inter alia, the most memorable incident of persecution he experienced in Egypt was when the Islamists attempted to kidnap his daughter in XXXX of 2012. This notwithstanding, this daughter continued to go to her same school. In addition, even though the claimant testified that the radicals had attempted to kidnap his daughter and were threatening his wife, the claimant himself left his wife and three young children behind when he came to Canada alone in XXXX of 2013.\n",
      "o The claimant testified that he was attacked in XXXX of 2012. During this attack he was injured badly enough that he stayed home for a week. He testified that he was attacked on this occasion due to his work and for being an atheist. He was told he would be killed. This notwithstanding, a few weeks later, the claimant went XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The panel asked why he would do this and say things that will make the Islamists angrier. His response was that it was a rare chance XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that if he started something he should finish it, and finally, that this XXXX was his way of hitting back against the radical Islamists. The panel views this explanation with incredulity, especially when considered in light of the claimants allegedly crippling fear of talking about his situation in Egypt once he arrived in Canada.\n",
      "o When asked why he left his family behind if he was so worried about them, the claimant stated that he did not have a house in Canada yet and if he took his daughter out of school at that juncture, he believed she would lose a full year of school when she came to Canada. The panel takes a dim view of this explanation. The entire family had visas to come to Canada as of XXXX 2013. If the threat explained by claimant was real and they had the opportunity to leave, being concerned that his daughter would lose a year of school makes no sense. Choosing to risk your daughter's life so she does not lose a year of school in a new country is a questionable course of action which totally undermines both the credibility of the claimant and the subjective basis of the claim.\n",
      "[17] The female claimant was left behind in Egypt once the claimant left for Canada. Her testimony about her actions once she was alone in Egypt undermines her credibility and demonstrates a lack of subjective fear. The panel will explain, again in point form.\n",
      "o She testified that she was telephoned at the family home in Egypt every single day and was told she was a whore and she and the children were threatened with death. The panel expects that for most mothers, this would lead them to take action. However, the claimant remained in the family home for the entire three month period until they left for Canada. The panel finds this to be a questionable course of action if these threats were legitimate and had actually occurred.\n",
      "o The female claimant was asked why she stayed in the house if this were so. She stated that she did not have another place to go. She was asked if she could have gone to her parents' house. She said she could not have because their house is small and the parents are old and the kids are too noisy. The panel views this explanation with sceptiscm. Surely if the lives of their daughter and grandchildren were being threatened, the grandparents would provide sanctuary to them. The female claimant also testified that her parents would babysit for her when required, so it is clear to the panel that the familial relationship is intact. This has a negative impact on the claimants' credibility.\n",
      "o The claimant was asked why she did not leave with her husband in XXXX of 2013. She echoed the claimant's testimony that they were worried about their daughter losing a year of school if she left at that point. The panel rejects this explanation for the same reason noted above and finds that it is non-sensical if the threats had actually occurred.\n",
      "[18] The female claimant accepted and adopted the testimony of her husband as her own. In order to assess whether her risk is different as a woman, the panel asked the claimant about her risk and that of her daughter in order to reach a conclusion under this heading. However, having found both the claimant and the female claimant to be utterly lacking in credibility, the panel finds that any allegations advanced by the claimant about being harassed or abused in Egypt due to her not wearing a veil or being a woman are entirely without foundation.\n",
      "Threats received in Canada and claimants' response:\n",
      "[19] The claimant alleged that he received three letters containing threats from Egypt since he has been in Canada. He provided a copy of the letters and the envelopes they came in to the panel.5 The claimant indicated that he had received one of these letters when he filed his refugee claim. The letter the claimant had received was one where it stated that his neck would be cut with a sword. The panel asked him why he did not refer to this death threat in his claim. The claimant indicated that he was very worried as he had been threatened and he was going to keep quiet until his hearing. The panel views this explanation with extreme sceptiscm. He further stated that he thought he could just apply for a refugee claim if there were threats against your life. Again, the claimant has a XXXX. He testified in English and his XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The panel finds that this is not a reasonable explanation for not including the fact that there had been recent threats against the claimant when he was in Canada in the document where he was seeking Canada's protection. The claimant's testimony here severely impugns his credibility.\n",
      "[20] The claimant produced three death threat letters he received once he was in Canada. The claimant was asked if he reported these letters to the XXXX. He replied that he did not, as he was worried that doing so would preclude the XXXX from ever hiring another African. He testified that he hid the whole thing and did not know what would be the point of advising anybody at the XXXX. The panel finds this course of action to only make sense if these threats were manufactured for the purpose of bolstering the claimant's refugee claim. The panel rejects the claimant's response to this question and finds that it further undermines his credibility.\n",
      "[21] The claimant was asked if he reported these death threats to the police. His responses to this question absolutely decimate his credibility. He replied that he did not know what to do, that his lawyer had told him to keep silent and not to talk to anyone. This explanation defies all logic. If the claimant was being threatened in Canada, he should have sought protection from the police. The panel does not know and did not ask about the communications between the claimant and his counsel, but finds that if the claimant's life was threatened and it was a real threat, he should have sought assistance. The claimant made a refugee claim because he thought that the Canadian government would provide safe haven to him in the face of these threats. The fact he did not contact the police in Canada suggests at best, that the letters are fraudulent. The panel unequivocally rejects these letters and finds that they have been produced merely for the purpose of bolstering the claimant's refugee claim. Such actions seriously impugn the credibility of the claimant.\n",
      "Conclusion on Credibility\n",
      "[22] With regard to the totality of the evidence the claimants have submitted in relation to the BOC's, their oral testimony and their inconsistent and contradictory responses, the panel refers to the case of Dan-Ash6 for the principle that:\n",
      "... unless one is prepared to postulate (and accept) unlimited credulity on the part of the Board, there must come a point at which a witness's contradictions will move even the most generous trier of fact to reject his evidence.\n",
      "The Panel has also considered the case of Sheikh7 which states:\n",
      "... even without disbelieving every word [a claimant] has uttered, a ... panel may reasonably find him so lacking in credibility that it concludes there is no credible evidence relevant to his claim... In other words, a general finding of a lack of credibility on the part of the [claimant] may conceivably extend to all relevant evidence emanating from his testimony.\n",
      "[23] In the context of the totality of the cumulative determinations and negative inferences which are outlined above with regard to the claimants' oral testimony and documentary evidence, and considering the case law which is noted above, the panel determines, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants' evidence with regard to specific and alleged events in Egypt is neither credible nor trustworthy, and did not occur as described, if at all. The panel further determines that the claimants have not been credible or trustworthy witnesses in this proceeding.\n",
      "[24] Furthermore, in having found (a) the claimants to be generally lacking in credibility; and (b) that there is no credible or trustworthy evidence upon which the panel could have made a favorable decision; and, (c) having found that there is no residual profile that the claimants can rely upon to save their refugee claim, the panel rejects this claim as having no credible basis under either Section 96 or 97, and invokes Section 107.2 of the IRPA, to reject these claims.\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "[25] There is not a serious possibility of persecution and the claimants would not be subjected personally, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture, should they return to Egypt. Accordingly, the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n",
      "[26] The claims are rejected.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION\n",
      "[1] The claimant, XXXX XXXX, is a citizen of Sri Lanka. He seeks refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\n",
      "ALLEGATIONS\n",
      "[2] The claimant alleges as follows:\n",
      "[3] He is a male Tamil from northern Sri Lanka, born on XXXX XXXX, 19XXXX.\n",
      "[4] In late 1996, the claimant and his brother-in-law were taken by Sri Lankan soldiers for questioning. On the way, his brother-in-law was shot while trying to escape. The claimant was subsequently beaten and threatened.\n",
      "[5] In the years that followed, the claimant got married and, together with his wife and son, moved around to various locations in an effort to escape the ongoing conflict between the Sri Lankan forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). In XXXX 2009, he and his family surrendered to the Sri Lankan army and were taken to a camp for displaced persons.\n",
      "[6] While at the camp, the claimant was threatened and beaten, and told that he would be released if he paid 150,000 rupees to his captors. After negotiating an amount of 80,000 rupees, he was released and allowed to live in XXXX. While there, he was visited by members of the Criminal Investigations Department (CID), who asked how he had managed to get out of the camp and told that the army would not have released him without a proper inquiry.\n",
      "[7] He was taken for questioning and asked about the identities of individuals in photographs that were shown to him. When he replied that he did not know any of the individuals, he was accused of lying and warned that he would be required to attend an inquiry in XXXX 2010. He was also informed that he would be killed if it was discovered that he had been involved with the LTTE. Fearing for his safety, the claimant's mother advised him to flee the country. After arrangements were made, he left for Canada by ship via Thailand.\n",
      "DETERMINATION\n",
      "[8] The panel finds that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee in accordance with section 96 nor a person in need of protection in accordance with section 97(1) (a) and (b) of the IRPA.\n",
      "MINISTER'S INTERVENTION\n",
      "[9] Pursuant to subsection 170 (e) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and rule 25 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules, the Minister has intervened in this case and participated in person at the hearing.\n",
      "ANALYSIS\n",
      "Identity\n",
      "[10] Various documents2 were available in support of the claimant's identity. The panel is persuaded, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is who he claims to be and is a citizen of Sri Lanka.\n",
      "Credibility\n",
      "[11] When reviewing the claimant's interviews with the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA), his written Personal Information Form (PIF) narrative, and his oral testimony at his refugee determination hearing, the panel finds that there were a number of inconsistencies. The Minister has pointed out a number of inconsistencies with respect to dates and treatment at the hands of authorities. As well, she highlights a photograph, submitted to Canadian authorities that had been clearly manipulated to produce a single family portrait.3\n",
      "[12] While recognizing the claimant's lack of formal education as well as his anxiety during questioning by Canadian officials as highlighted by his counsel, the panel nonetheless has some concerns with the claimant's account of events. In the end, however, the panel did not find the credibility concerns determinative.\n",
      "Well-foundedness\n",
      "[13] In examining the claimant's experiences in Sri Lanka and after carefully considering his testimony as well as the written submissions of both the Minister and the claimant's counsel, the panel finds that the claimant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution.\n",
      "[14] On December 21 2012, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) released a new set of Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Asylum Seekers from Sri Lanka (UNHCR Guidelines).4 The UNHCR Guidelines recognized that individuals with certain profiles may require international refugee???? depending on the individual circumstances of their case, and identified the following eight potential risk profiles as requiring particularly careful examination:\n",
      "1. persons suspected of certain links with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)\n",
      "2. certain opposition politicians and political activists\n",
      "3. certain journalists and other media professionals\n",
      "4. certain human rights activists\n",
      "5. certain witnesses of human rights violations and victims of human rights violations\n",
      "seeking justice\n",
      "6. women in certain circumstances\n",
      "7. children in certain circumstances\n",
      "8. lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) individuals in certain circumstances.\n",
      "[15] The claimant's counsel submits that the claimant would be at risk were he to be returned to Sri Lanka. He arrives at this conclusion based on the claimant's profile of being a young Tamil man who has been beaten and interrogated several times, of having failed to attend an inquiry as directed by Sri Lankan officials, and of having travelled to a Canada aboard the Sun Sea - a ship suspected of carrying supporters/members of the LTTE. His counsel's conclusions would suggest that the claimant would fit the UNHCR risk profile of \"persons suspected of certain links with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).\"\n",
      "[16] The Minister, however, argues that, although the claimant was interrogated, he was released and allowed to leave the country despite having been photographed and fingerprinted on more than one occasion. The Minister further points out that the claimant has testified that neither he, nor any member of his family, is a member or supporter of the LTTE. She concludes that the claimant has not proffered any credible or persuasive evidence to indicate that he would fit any of the risk profiles identified in the UNHCR Guidelines.\n",
      "[17] In making a final determination, the panel has examined the elements of the claimant's individual risk profile in its analysis under the headings of Failed Asylum Seekers, Sur Place, and Compelling Reasons.\n",
      "Failed Asylum Seekers\n",
      "[18] In January 2012, the government of Canada and the IOM signed an Assisted Voluntary Returns Agreement in which the IOM would facilitate the voluntary return of Sri Lankans from Africa to Colombo. Canadian officials reported that sixty-six returnees were interviewed at the airport and released without any difficulties.5\n",
      "[19] Documentary sources state that returning Tamils are subjected to the same screening process for all persons returning to Sri Lanka, regardless of whether they are returning on a voluntary basis or as the result of a failed refugee claim.6 Once returnees' rights to enter the country have been established, they are then interviewed at the airport by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID), followed by an interview by the State Intelligence Service (SIS). The CID conducts criminal background checks of returnees by contacting the police stations in all the districts in which the returnee lived. Generally, these police record checks may be completed in a few hours, but can last 24 to 48 hours.7 However, in circumstances where it is difficult to obtain security clearance, these detainments may at times last for periods up to some months.8 The Canadian High Commission has noted, as well, that there have only been four cases of persons having been detained upon arrival of which the Canada High Commission is aware of, and these cases involved outstanding criminal charges in-country and were not related to their overseas asylum claims or their ethnicity.9 Furthermore, documentary evidence10 indicates that returnees who left the country legally and who have genuine documents generally have little difficulty passing through airport security upon their return to Sri Lanka. The panel notes that the claimant was issued a passport and a visa to Thailand, and left the country legally in 2010, using his own genuine passport. As the Minister has submitted, the claimant was photographed and fingerprinted several times. Had Sri Lankan authorities been interested in the claimant, he would have been stopped at the airport when leaving the country.\n",
      "[20] Nonetheless, the panel has considered reports, referenced by the claimant's counsel in his submissions,11 which suggest that returnees are at a heightened risk of being detained at the airport and at risk of torture - especially if they have connections to the LTTE.12 The panel notes, however, that the claimant does not have any direct ties to the LTTE, nor does he have a history of having opposed the government - either in Sri Lanka or during his time in Canada. The Landinfo Report, 2012 (as quoted in the United Kingdom's Home Office Operational Guidance Notes, April 2012) further states that: \"There is nothing to indicate that returning Tamils are treated specially or are at risk of abuse.\"13\n",
      "[21] The claimant's counsel referenced a report from the Director of the Edmund Rice Centre, an Australian research, advocacy and networking organization that works with asylum seekers and refugees, which states that Sri Lanka is \"not safe for deported asylum seekers\"14 especially for those \"connected to the Tamil Tigers or who left the country illegally.\"15 The claimant, however, has no apparent connection to the LTTE, was never arrested, and, after questioning by Sri Lankan authorities, was released. Despite his allegation that authorities wanted to either arrest or kill him, he had no problems travelling within Sri Lanka on his genuine identification documents and left Sri Lanka using his own genuine passport, without being challenged. Further, a report16 on security controls at Sri Lankan ports of entry indicates that all passports are swiped through the Computerized Passenger Clearance System which maintains an entry/exit record for all persons travelling through the ports of entry. If, in fact, as the claimant testified, Sri Lankan authorities wanted to arrest and possibly kill him, why would they have released him after questioning. Also, as indicated earlier, if indeed he was wanted by authorities, one would have expected his passport to be flagged on exiting the country through the airport. The claimant, however, applied for a passport without any problems and passed through airport security without incident when leaving the country.\n",
      "[22] The United Kingdom's (UK) Home Office Operational Guidance Notes, April 2012 has included a number of significant conclusions established by the UK Tribunal in assessing recent, independent reports on Sri Lanka:\n",
      "* The government's concern now is not with past membership or sympathy, but with whether a person is a destabilising threat in post-conflict Sri Lanka.\n",
      "* It is not established that previous LTTE connections or sympathies (whether direct or familial), are perceived by the GOSL [Government of Sri Lanka] as indicating now that an individual poses a destabilising threat in post-conflict Sri Lanka.\n",
      "* Our overall conclusion regarding Diaspora activities is that the GOSL has sophisticated intelligence enabling it to distinguish those who are actively involved in seeking to revive and re-fund the separatist movement within the Diaspora, with a view to destabilising the unitary Sri Lankan state. Attendance at one or even several demonstrations in the Diaspora is not of itself evidence that a person is a committed Tamil activist seeking to promote Tamil separatism within Sri Lanka. That will be a question of fact in each case, dependent on any Diaspora activities carried out by such an individual.\n",
      "[23] The claimant was allowed to leave the country and has not participated or been involved in any anti-GOSL or pro-LTTE activities, either in Sri Lanka or since his arrival in Canada. The panel therefore concludes that the claimant is unlikely to face any additional scrutiny upon his return to Sri Lanka as a result of his activities while in Sri Lanka and subsequent to his departure from Sri Lanka.\n",
      "[24] The panel has considered the evidence regarding failed asylum-seekers, the particular circumstances of this claimant, and the risk profiles in the UNHCR Guidelines. In light of this information, the panel finds that the claimant is not, on a balance of probabilities, a person who is perceived to be linked to the LTTE by the Sri Lankan government, and determines that he does not have good grounds to fear persecution as a failed asylum-seeker were he to be returned to Sri Lanka.\n",
      "Sur Place\n",
      "[25] The claimant's counsel submits that a consideration of sur place in the context of the Sun Sea, arrivals is simple common sense. He references a recent decision17 by the Board which argued that the claimant's arrival on the Sun Sea as determinative in finding the claimant to be a refugee sur place.\n",
      "[26] In considering whether there are grounds for a sur place claim, the panel reviewed the United Nations Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status18 which outlines the criteria to be considered in the determination of a sur place claim. Specifically, Article 96 is particularly relevant to this claim. It states:\n",
      "A person may become a refugee \"sur place\" as a result of his own actions, such as associating with refugees already recognized, or expressing his political views in his country of residence. Whether such actions are sufficient to justify a well-founded fear of persecution must be determined by a careful examination of the circumstances. Regard should be had in particular to whether such actions may have come to the notice of the authorities of the person's country of origin and how they are likely to be viewed by those authorities.\n",
      "[27] The panel finds, however, that no credible, persuasive evidence has been proffered that the Government of Sri Lanka suspects individuals as having links to the LTTE by virtue of having been smuggled to Canada aboard a ship owned and operated by the LTTE. Although Sri Lankan authorities may come to know how the claimant came to Canada, the panel has considered if, in fact, the claimant faces an increased risk of persecution by having travelled aboard the Sun Sea.\n",
      "[28] Would Sri Lankan authorities now perceive the claimant to have LTTE links simply by virtue of his having travelled on the ship? Given that the claimant has little or no profile with Sri Lankan authorities, why now would he be arrested, detained, and possibly tortured for simply having arrived by ship, unless there were good reasons for believing that he had substantive LTTE connections or been involved in significant pro-LTTE activities while abroad? The claimant insists that neither he nor his family have any links to or sympathies with the LTTE. There is also no indication that he has been involved with or supportive of any pro-LTTE organization during his time in Canada. The panel finds therefore that there is insufficient credible evidence to suggest that, since he fled Sri Lanka, other than his presence on the Sun Sea, the Sri Lankan government has any reason to believe he is a member or supporter of the LTTE. A Report for the United Kingdom Border Agency states that:\n",
      "The principal focus of the authorities continues to be, not Tamils from the north (or east) as such, but persons considered to be either LTTE members, fighters or operatives or persons who have played an active role in the international procurement network responsible for financing the LTTE and ensuring it was supplied with arms.19\n",
      "[30] The Minister has argued20 that finding a claimant to be a refugee sur place by virtue of his being a Tamil male who travelled to Canada aboard the Sun Sea is insufficient in establishing a nexus to the Convention based on his being a member of a particular social group. To be a member of a particular social group under Section 96 of IRPA, an individual would need to be a person suspected of having links with the LTTE - thereby indicating a particular political opinion. Simply being a Tamil male who travelled to Canada aboard the Sun Sea, however, does not constitute becoming a member of a particular social group as contemplated by Section 96. The panel finds that there is insufficient evidence to suggest that Sri Lankan authorities would consider the claimant to be linked to the LTTE because of his having travelled to Canada aboard the Sun Sea, and concurs with the Minister's conclusions.\n",
      "[31] There is no doubt that the arrival of Sun Sea generated significant interest on the part of the public and government authorities in both Sri Lanka and here in Canada. Those who qualified, claimed refugee protection and were either afforded a hearing such as this claimant recently experienced, or will be afforded a hearing in the near future - notwithstanding the publicity, public interest, and comments by Sri Lankan and Canadian officials. Canadian law dictates that those individuals determined to be members of the LTTE could be either found to be ineligible to apply for refugee status or be excluded from refugee protection under Section 1F (a) of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees21 and Section 98 of the Act.\n",
      "[32] The claimant underwent an investigation conducted by Canadian officials. Considering that he was released and that the Minister did not pursue inadmissibility proceedings or argue before this panel that the claimant should be found exempt of refugee protection by virtue of Article 1(F)(a), there is only one logical conclusion to draw, and that is that this claimant was deemed by Canadian officials to have no affiliation to the LTTE.\n",
      "[33] If the Sri Lankan officials know or suspect that the claimant was aboard the Sun Sea, they would also have logically concluded that Canadian officials investigated whether or not he had ties to the LTTE and came to the conclusion that he did not, otherwise it is unlikely that he would have been released from custody. Indeed, the claimant could produce documentation, including the Immigration and Refugee Board's decision, to indicate that he has been found not to have any association with the LTTE. Despite Counsel's submission22 that Sri Lankan authorities would not relinquish their right to determine who is a security risk, having been subjected to rigorous scrutiny by Canadian officials and been subsequently released, may very well place him in a better light should he be returned to Sri Lanka.\n",
      "[34] After carefully considering the arguments and evidence regarding the consideration of the claimant as a refugee sur place, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the Sri Lankan government would not perceive the claimant to be a member or supporter of the LTTE simply on the basis of his travel on the Sun Sea.\n",
      "Compelling Reasons\n",
      "[35] The claimant's counsel argues that the claimant has suffered significantly. The claimant's father and two brothers-in-law were killed directly or indirectly by the Sri Lankan army. He, himself, was repeatedly interrogated, beaten, and accused of LTTE involvement.\n",
      "[36] The panel therefore considered whether his experiences are sufficient to demonstrate compelling reasons for granting him Convention refugee status. Section 108(4) of IRPA states that a person may be found to be a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection even if the reasons for which the person sought refugee protection have ceased to exist if the person establishes that:\n",
      "there are compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution, torture, treatment or punishment for refusing to avail themselves of the protection of the country which they left, or outside of which they remained , due to such previous persecution, torture, treatment, or punishment.\n",
      "[37] In considering, counsel's submissions23 and the Minister's submissions24 regarding compelling reasons, the panel has reviewed the claimant's experiences as described both during his oral testimony and in his PIF. The panel has also considered the case law, which indicates that the threshold necessary to demonstrate \"compelling reasons\" is a high one.\n",
      "[38] The panel recognizes that the claimant suffered as did many others as a consequence of the war - especially in the final stages where there were documented human rights abuses on both sides.25 The panel ultimately finds, however, that there is insufficient evidence to establish that the claimant has met the threshold as contemplated by compelling reasons.\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "[39] After careful consideration of all of the evidence, including the claimant's testimony, as well as final submissions made by both the claimant's counsel and the Minister, the panel determines that the claimant has not satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on Convention grounds, or that, on a balance of probabilities, he would be subject personally to a danger of torture, or face a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, if he were returned to Sri Lanka.\n",
      "[40] The panel therefore concludes that the claimant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection and rejects his claim.\n",

      "[1] Voici les motifs de la dÃ©cision rendue par la Section de la protection des rÃ©fugiÃ©s (SPR) concernant la demande d'asile de XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (le demandeur d'asile), un citoyen du Sri Lanka. La demande d'asile est prÃ©sentÃ©e suivant l'article 96 et le paragraphe 97(1) de la Loi sur l'immigration et la protection des rÃ©fugiÃ©s1 (la Loi).\n",
      "DÃ‰CISION\n",
      "[2] Je conclus que le demandeur d'asile n'a pas qualitÃ© de rÃ©fugiÃ© au sens de la Convention parce qu'il ne craint pas avec raison d'Ãªtre persÃ©cutÃ© au Sri Lanka pour l'un des motifs prÃ©vus dans la Convention. Je conclus Ã©galement que le demandeur d'asile n'a pas qualitÃ© de personne Ã  protÃ©ger, puisqu'il ne serait pas personnellement exposÃ©, par son renvoi au Sri Lanka, Ã  une menace Ã  sa vie ou au risque de traitements ou peines cruels et inusitÃ©s. En outre, il n'y a pas de motif sÃ©rieux de croire qu'il serait personnellement exposÃ©, par son renvoi au Sri Lanka, au risque d'Ãªtre soumis Ã  la torture.\n",
      "IDENTITÃ‰\n",
      "[3] Le demandeur d'asile a Ã©tabli son identitÃ© en tant que ressortissant du Sri Lanka au moyen de son tÃ©moignage et des documents versÃ©s au dossier, Ã  savoir son passeport, son certificat de naissance et sa carte d'identitÃ© nationale qui se trouvent dans le dossier de CitoyennetÃ© et Immigration Canada2 (CIC).\n",
      "ALLÃ‰GATIONS\n",
      "[4] Le demandeur d'asile, qui est Ã¢gÃ© de 55 ans, affirme qu'il ne peut retourner au Sri Lanka parce qu'il craint pour sa vie.\n",
      "[5] Le demandeur d'asile indique que, en XXXX 2005, il a mis sur pied sa propre entreprise XXXX XXXX aprÃ¨s avoir travaillÃ© pendant de nombreuses annÃ©es en tant que XXXX XXXX XXXX. Il indique que, pendant la guerre, certains clients n'avaient pas pu payer XXXX XXXX qu'ils avaient commandÃ©s et il avait dÃ» payer XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, ce qui lui avait causÃ© des difficultÃ©s financiÃ¨res. Il affirme que les hommes d'affaires musulmans Ã©taient souvent victimes d'une telle situation. Il s'Ã©tait donc adressÃ© Ã  des prÃªteurs pour payer les frais. Il ajoute que les prÃªteurs l'avaient poursuivi pour qu'il les paie et qu'ils avaient menacÃ© de tuer les membres de sa famille et lui si l'argent n'Ã©tait pas remboursÃ©. Le demandeur d'asile a dÃ©clarÃ© que le prÃªt a Ã©tÃ© remboursÃ© en entier et qu'il ne craint donc plus les prÃªteurs.\n",
      "[6] Le demandeur d'asile affirme avoir adhÃ©rÃ© au parti de l'union nationale (UNP) en XXXX 1988 et avoir Ã©tÃ© enlevÃ© et battu par les forces de l'opposition dans le cadre des Ã©lections de 1994.\n",
      "[7] Le demandeur d'asile indique craindre un groupe de voyous qui, selon lui, sont associÃ©s avec un membre du gouvernement, Mervyn Silva, qui s'oppose au gÃ©nÃ©ral Sarath Fonseka, que le demandeur d'asile affirme avoir appuyÃ©. Il mentionne que M. Silva est un chef de la pÃ¨gre parrainÃ© par le gouvernement qui commet des meurtres Ã  forfait commandÃ©s par les dirigeants du gouvernement.\n",
      "[8] Le demandeur d'asile indique avoir appuyÃ© M. Fonseka Ã  l'occasion des Ã©lections du 26 janvier 2010 et que, en XXXX 2009, M. Silva et ses voyous se sont introduits par effraction avec des hommes armÃ©s Ã  l'endroit oÃ¹ se tenait une rÃ©union de partisans de M. Fonseka. Il mentionne que c'est Ã  ce moment-lÃ  qu'il a Ã©tÃ© menacÃ©, tout comme d'autres partisans de M. Fonseka, et qu'il s'est fait dire qu'il figurait sur la liste des personnes condamnÃ©es Ã  mort par M. Silva. Il a dÃ©clarÃ© n'avoir participÃ© Ã  aucune activitÃ© politique depuis l'incident de XXXX 2009.\n",
      "[9] Le demandeur d'asile mentionne que, le XXXX XXXX 2011, il a Ã©tÃ© enlevÃ© et battu pour une demande d'extorsion (ranÃ§on) par des personnes qui avaient, selon lui, reÃ§u des ordres de M. Silva. Il affirme avoir Ã©tÃ© en mesure de nÃ©gocier un dÃ©lai de deux semaines pour verser la ranÃ§on. Il ajoute que les enlÃ¨vements contre ranÃ§on sont courants au Sri Lanka et que certaines des personnes visÃ©es sont tuÃ©es mÃªme aprÃ¨s que le paiement a Ã©tÃ© effectuÃ©.\n",
      "[10] Le demandeur d'asile dÃ©clare s'Ãªtre plaint Ã  la police Ã  plusieurs reprises, mais qu'aucune enquÃªte n'avait Ã©tÃ© menÃ©e. Il ajoute que la police n'a pas dÃ»ment consignÃ© ses dÃ©clarations et ne lui a pas permis de mentionner M. Silva dans ses plaintes.\n",
      "[11] Le demandeur d'asile affirme que sa famille (son Ã©pouse et ses enfants) est demeurÃ©e au Sri Lanka, mais qu'elle a dÃ©mÃ©nagÃ© occasionnellement en raison des demandes d'extorsion.\n",
      "[12] Le demandeur d'asile a beaucoup voyagÃ© : CorÃ©e (2001, 2002 et 2003), Singapour (2003), Chine (2005), Japon (2001, 2005 et 2009), Hong Kong (2004), ThaÃ¯lande (2002), Philippines (2004 et 2005), Europe (2009), Malaisie (deux fois en 2004), Abou Dhabi (2011) et Ã‰tats-Unis (Ã‰.-U.) (deux fois en 2007). Il n'a prÃ©sentÃ© aucune demande d'asile durant ces voyages.\n",
      "[13] Le demandeur d'asile a quittÃ© le Sri Lanka le XXXX XXXX 2011, est arrivÃ© au Canada le XXXX XXXX 2011 et a prÃ©sentÃ© sa demande d'asile le 6 janvier 2012.\n",

Il aurait pu demander l'asile dans n'importe lequel de ces pays, mais il ne l'a pas fait. La France, la Belgique, les Pays-Bas et la Suisse sont tous des pays signataires de la Convention. Le demandeur d'asile a dÃ©clarÃ© Ãªtre allÃ© en Europe pendant environ une semaine en 2009, lors de vacances avec un ami. PriÃ© d'indiquer si, pendant son sÃ©jour lÃ -bas, il s'Ã©tait renseignÃ© au sujet de la prÃ©sentation d'une demande de statut de rÃ©sident permanent, il a dÃ©clarÃ© ne pas l'avoir fait parce qu'il ne voyait pas la nÃ©cessitÃ© de demander la citoyennetÃ© Ã©tant donnÃ© qu'il avait un revenu suffisant dans son pays. InvitÃ© Ã  dire s'il s'Ã©tait renseignÃ© au sujet de la prÃ©sentation d'une demande d'asile, il a dÃ©clarÃ© ce qui suit : [traduction] \" Cette idÃ©e ne m'est pas venue Ã  l'esprit parce que je souhaite vivre avec ma famille en tout temps. \" QuestionnÃ© au sujet de la raison pour laquelle il Ã©tait retournÃ© au Sri Lanka, oÃ¹ il craignait d'Ãªtre persÃ©cutÃ© ou de subir un prÃ©judice en raison de ses activitÃ©s politiques, le demandeur d'asile a dÃ©clarÃ© ce qui suit : [traduction] \" Ã€ ce moment-lÃ , je n'avais aucun problÃ¨me, mes problÃ¨mes n'Ã©taient pas graves Ã  ce moment-lÃ , mes problÃ¨mes graves ont dÃ©butÃ© en 2011. \" J'ai trouvÃ© dÃ©raisonnable son explication concernant le fait qu'il n'avait pas demandÃ© l'asile, Ã©tant donnÃ© qu'il a dÃ©clarÃ© avoir Ã©prouvÃ© des problÃ¨mes aprÃ¨s avoir adhÃ©rÃ© au parti en 1988 et avoir fait l'objet de demandes d'extorsion aprÃ¨s avoir mis sur pied son entreprise en 2005.\n",

Le fait de ne pas avoir demandÃ© le statut de rÃ©fugiÃ© ni l'asile Ã  un endroit oÃ¹ il est possible de le faire n'est pas nÃ©cessairement fatal Ã  une demande d'asile, mais il est pertinent de le prendre en considÃ©ration lors de l'Ã©valuation de la crainte subjective.\n",
      "[20] J'estime que le fait que le demandeur d'asile n'a pas demandÃ© l'asile alors qu'il avait l'occasion de le faire et qu'il se soit rÃ©clamÃ© de nouveau de la protection de son pays Ã  plusieurs reprises aprÃ¨s avoir prÃ©tendument Ã©tÃ© persÃ©cutÃ© n'appuie pas ses allÃ©gations selon lesquelles il craignait d'Ãªtre persÃ©cutÃ© ou de subir un prÃ©judice dans son pays d'origine.\n",
      "Lien avec l'un des motifs prÃ©vus dans la Convention\n",
      "[21] Pour Ã©valuer si le demandeur d'asile a qualitÃ© de rÃ©fugiÃ© au sens de la Convention, je dois d'abord Ã©tablir si sa crainte est fondÃ©e sur l'un des cinq motifs prÃ©vus dans la Convention. En l'espÃ¨ce, le demandeur d'asile a dÃ©clarÃ© que sa crainte dÃ©coule de son appartenance Ã  l'UNP et du fait qu'il appuie le gÃ©nÃ©ral Sarath Fonseka et qu'il s'oppose Ã  Mervyn Silva. Il affirme que M. Silva est un chef de la pÃ¨gre parrainÃ© par le gouvernement qui commet des meurtres Ã  forfait commandÃ©s par des dirigeants du gouvernement.\n",
      "[22] Le demandeur d'asile a prÃ©sentÃ© en preuve une lettre datÃ©e du XXXX XXXX 2011 du conseil de la province occidentale membre de l'UNP, qui indique que le demandeur d'asile appuyait le parti depuis 19883, et une copie de sa carte de membre4. Il a dÃ©clarÃ© avoir adhÃ©rÃ© au parti en XXXX 1988 et que, en tant que membre, il avait participÃ© aux campagnes Ã©lectorales en faveur du gÃ©nÃ©ral Fonseka, qui s'opposait au parti au pouvoir, le nouveau front dÃ©mocratique.\n",
      "[23] Le demandeur d'asile a affirmÃ© que la derniÃ¨re activitÃ© politique Ã  laquelle il avait participÃ© avait eu lieu en XXXX 2009, lorsqu'il avait eu sa derniÃ¨re interaction avec son agent de persÃ©cution politique allÃ©guÃ©, M. Silva.\n",
      "[24] Le demandeur d'asile a Ã©galement mentionnÃ© des incidents de persÃ©cution qui se seraient produits deux ans plus tard, soit Ã  la fin de l'annÃ©e 2011. En XXXX 2011, le demandeur d'asile a Ã©tÃ© enlevÃ© par des inconnus, mÃªme s'il a affirmÃ© que les suspects Ã©taient liÃ©s Ã  M. Silva. Il n'a toutefois pas Ã©tÃ© en mesure d'Ã©tablir un lien avec M. Silva ou ses associÃ©s. Ã€ ce moment-lÃ , il a Ã©tÃ© battu et a fait l'objet d'une demande d'extorsion de fonds (ranÃ§on).\n",
      "[25] J'estime que les activitÃ©s politiques du demandeur d'asile n'ont aucun lien avec la raison pour laquelle il a quittÃ© son pays d'origine, Ã©tant donnÃ© qu'il a dÃ©clarÃ© que les actes de persÃ©cution auraient eu lieu Ã  la fin de l'annÃ©e 2011, soit deux ans aprÃ¨s qu'il a eu cessÃ© de participer Ã  des activitÃ©s politiques locales au Sri Lanka. Le demandeur d'asile a dÃ©clarÃ© craindre les personnes responsables de son enlÃ¨vement, des coups qu'il a subis et des demandes d'extorsion dont il a fait l'objet Ã  la fin XXXX 2011.\n",
      "[26] Par consÃ©quent, j'estime qu'il n'existe aucun lien avec l'un des motifs prÃ©vus dans la Convention. J'estime que la crainte du demandeur d'asile en tant que victime d'extorsion ou de ranÃ§on, soit celle de la criminalitÃ©, n'est pas liÃ©e Ã  l'un des cinq motifs Ã©numÃ©rÃ©s dans la dÃ©finition de rÃ©fugiÃ© au sens de la Convention. En l'espÃ¨ce, je conclus que ce qu'a vÃ©cu le demandeur d'asile ne correspond Ã  aucun des motifs prÃ©vus dans la Convention. Le restant de mon analyse portera sur l'article 97 de la Loi.\n",
      "Analyse suivant l'article 97\n",
      "[27] Le sous-alinÃ©a 97(1)b)(ii) de la Loi porte que la protection est rÃ©servÃ©e aux personnes qui sont personnellement exposÃ©es Ã  un risque alors que les autres personnes originaires du mÃªme pays ou qui s'y trouvent ne le sont gÃ©nÃ©ralement pas. La preuve doit dÃ©montrer que le demandeur d'asile est exposÃ© Ã  un risque diffÃ©rent de celui auquel est exposÃ©e la population en gÃ©nÃ©ral, ce qui exclut normalement les risques associÃ©s Ã  la criminalitÃ© endÃ©mique, Ã  l'abus de pouvoir ou Ã  la violence arbitraire. Le risque gÃ©nÃ©ralisÃ© se dÃ©finit en fonction de la nature du risque de prÃ©judice. Il est Ã©tabli que l'exception prÃ©vue au sous-alinÃ©a 97(1)b)(ii) exclut les risques gÃ©nÃ©ralisÃ©s associÃ©s Ã  la criminalitÃ© endÃ©mique, au crime organisÃ©, Ã  la violence, Ã  l'extorsion, Ã  la corruption policiÃ¨re et Ã  l'abus de pouvoir, aux violations des droits de la personne, Ã  l'insÃ©curitÃ© gÃ©nÃ©rale, au terrorisme, aux attentats suicides, Ã  l'extrÃ©misme politique et aux activitÃ©s des groupes militaires armÃ©s. Le mot \" gÃ©nÃ©ralement \" est communÃ©ment utilisÃ© dans le sens de \" courant \" ou \" rÃ©pandu \". Ainsi, mÃªme si le demandeur d'asile est personnellement exposÃ© Ã  un risque, sa demande d'asile sera rejetÃ©e si ce risque est un risque auquel les autres personnes qui se trouvent dans ce pays sont gÃ©nÃ©ralement exposÃ©es5. J'estime que, mÃªme s'il est possible que le demandeur d'asile ait personnellement Ã©tÃ© exposÃ© Ã  un risque, ce risque est un risque gÃ©nÃ©ralisÃ©, du fait de la nature et de la prÃ©valence de ce type de crime dans l'ensemble du Sri Lanka. Cette situation est visÃ©e par l'exception prÃ©vue Ã  l'article 97 de la Loi, qui porte sur les risques auxquels d'autres personnes sont gÃ©nÃ©ralement exposÃ©es.\n",
      "[28] En l'espÃ¨ce, je reconnais la violence gÃ©nÃ©rale qui est rÃ©pandue au Sri Lanka, en particulier la prÃ©valence de l'extorsion de ranÃ§ons. Selon les documents sur la situation dans le pays de la Commission de l'immigration et du statut de rÃ©fugiÃ© du Canada (la Commission) :\n",

      "Les disparitions forcÃ©es et involontaires constituaient toujours un problÃ¨me, mÃªme si leur nombre semblait Ã  la baisse par rapport aux annÃ©es prÃ©cÃ©dentes. Bon nombre de disparitions semblaient Ãªtre Ã  caractÃ¨re politique, mais, au cours de l'annÃ©e, de plus en plus de disparitions liÃ©es Ã  des demandes d'extorsion et Ã  d'autres activitÃ©s criminelles, impliquant parfois des membres du gouvernement, ont Ã©tÃ© signalÃ©es6.\n",
      "En juillet, un reprÃ©sentant de la police a dÃ©clarÃ© aux mÃ©dias qu'un rapport compilÃ© par le commissariat de police indiquait que 1 700 personnes avaient Ã©tÃ© enlevÃ©es en 2009-2010, dont 926 en 2009 et 774 en 2010. Selon la police, la plupart des enlÃ¨vements semblaient liÃ©s Ã  des demandes d'extorsion. La police a engagÃ© des poursuites dans 275 cas, alors que 202 suspects n'avaient toujours pas Ã©tÃ© identifiÃ©s. Dans son rapport annuel publiÃ© le 26 janvier, le Groupe de travail sur les disparitions forcÃ©es ou involontaires des Nations Unies a fait Ã©tat de 5 653 affaires en suspens au Sri Lanka Ã  la fin de l'annÃ©e 2010.\n",
      "Des groupes armÃ©s tamouls favorables au gouvernement continuaient Ã  opÃ©rer au Sri Lanka et Ã  perpÃ©trer des exactions et des violations, dont des agressions de personnes critiques envers les autoritÃ©s, des enlÃ¨vements contre ranÃ§on, des disparitions forcÃ©es et des homicides. Des membres des forces de sÃ©curitÃ© se sont rendus coupables de disparitions forcÃ©es et d'enlÃ¨vements contre ranÃ§on dans de nombreuses rÃ©gions du pays, en particulier dans le nord et l'est, ainsi qu'Ã  Colombo7.\n",
      "Un dÃ©fenseur des droits de la personne a dÃ©clarÃ© n'avoir reÃ§u aucun rapport direct concernant des enlÃ¨vements ou des disparitions Ã  Colombo depuis juin 2009. Il n'y a eu que des rapports des mÃ©dias, provenant normalement de sources tamoules. Le reprÃ©sentant de l'ambassade de la Suisse Ã  Colombo a indiquÃ© qu'aucune donnÃ©e fiable n'Ã©tait disponible. Il y avait une impression gÃ©nÃ©rale selon laquelle les enlÃ¨vements, en particulier Ã  Colombo, Ã©taient beaucoup moins nombreux comparativement Ã  l'annÃ©e 2007-2008. En rÃ¨gle gÃ©nÃ©rale, les parents communiquaient avec les autoritÃ©s ou avec le ComitÃ© international de la Croix-Rouge (CICR) lorsqu'aucun rapport de police n'avait Ã©tÃ© rÃ©digÃ© ou que le CICR n'avait pas consignÃ© l'affaire. Les autoritÃ©s suisses considÃ©raient que les plaintes de personnes concernant des disparitions ou des enlÃ¨vements n'Ã©taient crÃ©dibles que dans de trÃ¨s rares cas.\n",
      "L'agent de protection du Haut Commissariat des Nations Unies pour les rÃ©fugiÃ©s (HCR) a dÃ©clarÃ© qu'il n'avait eu vent d'aucun cas d'enlÃ¨vement et de disparition depuis juin 2009. Le nombre d'enlÃ¨vements et de disparitions avait chutÃ©, mais le problÃ¨me n'Ã©tait pas rÃ©glÃ©.\n",
      "Le responsable principal du renseignement a indiquÃ© que certains enlÃ¨vements Ã©taient des enlÃ¨vements contre ranÃ§on et que la police prenait des mesures pour enrayer ce problÃ¨me. Il n'a pas pu fournir de commentaires sur le caractÃ¨re politique de ces enlÃ¨vements. Les faits portent Ã  croire que les rÃ©centes affaires avaient davantage \" des raisons commerciales \", c'est-Ã -dire l'obtention d'une ranÃ§on. Dans certains cas, il semblait y avoir un important caractÃ¨re politique, lorsque des activitÃ©s liÃ©es aux mÃ©dias, Ã  la dÃ©fense des droits de la personne ou Ã  la politique Ã©taient visÃ©es. Toutefois, il semblait souvent y avoir un mÃ©lange de ces deux Ã©lÃ©ments. Parfois, la dÃ©nonciation et la vengeance personnelle pouvaient Ã©galement jouer un rÃ´le.\n",
      "L'agent de protection du HCR a indiquÃ© que certains cas avaient un caractÃ¨re politique, comme les cas bien connus de certains journalistes. Des cas d'extorsion dont des musulmans ont fait l'objet ont Ã©galement Ã©tÃ© signalÃ©s. Le centre des politiques alternatives (CPA) a dÃ©clarÃ© qu'il y avait eu un ou deux cas touchant des hommes d'affaires. Les personnes exerÃ§ant un travail particulier, par exemple le personnel des mÃ©dias, sont probablement davantage visÃ©es que les personnes qui sont enlevÃ©es contre ranÃ§on.\n",
      "L'ancien juge en chef, Sarath Silva, a dÃ©clarÃ© qu'il y avait eu des cas Ã  caractÃ¨re politique et d'autres relatifs Ã  l'argent, et que les deux Ã©lÃ©ments Ã©taient parfois liÃ©s [...] il y avait encore des enlÃ¨vements contre ranÃ§on. Ils se produisaient, mais il s'agissait plus probablement de cas d'intimidation seulement, oÃ¹ de l'argent Ã©tait exigÃ© en Ã©change d'une protection. Le dÃ©fenseur des droits de la personne a indiquÃ© qu'il avait l'impression que ces enlÃ¨vements contre ranÃ§on Ã©taient gÃ©nÃ©ralement perpÃ©trÃ©s par des personnes qui avaient des liens avec les forces de sÃ©curitÃ©, et non avec leur entiÃ¨re complicitÃ©, mais qu'elles avaient une certaine complicitÃ© avec elles parce qu'elles les laissaient faire ou les laissait franchir les points de contrÃ´le. Les disparitions Ã  caractÃ¨re politique se produisaient avec l'entiÃ¨re participation des autoritÃ©s [...] elles Ã©taient perpÃ©trÃ©es parfois par des gangs criminels, parfois par des groupes paramilitaires.\n",
      "Le responsable principal du renseignement a dÃ©clarÃ© que la police enquÃªtait sur toutes les plaintes et qu'il s'agissait d'une obligation. Le reprÃ©sentant de l'ambassade de la Suisse Ã  Colombo a affirmÃ© que la police ouvrait gÃ©nÃ©ralement un dossier et l'inscrivait dans le registre de la police. Une copie de cet enregistrement Ã©tait gÃ©nÃ©ralement remise au plaignant. L'ambassade n'avait jamais obtenu de rÃ©sultat d'enquÃªte, et des organisations non gouvernementales (ONG) ont confirmÃ© qu'aucune enquÃªte adÃ©quate n'Ã©tait effectuÃ©e. Le CPA a indiquÃ© que la majoritÃ© des enquÃªtes Ã©taient douteuses. Dans certains cas, la police essayait d'Ã©touffer l'affaire, et son rÃ´le Ã©tait diluÃ© entre les diffÃ©rents organismes gouvernementaux. Le personnel d'une ONG a mentionnÃ© que la police savait gÃ©nÃ©ralement qui Ã©tait responsable et que, s'il s'agissait d'un organisme de l'Ã‰tat, elle n'enquÃªtait pas [...] la police enquÃªtait, mais ce type d'enquÃªte n'Ã©tait pas traitÃ©e comme hautement prioritaire8.\n",
      "Le rapport de mission d'enquÃªte du Danemark datÃ© d'octobre 2010 indiquait que, selon un important dÃ©fenseur des droits de la personne, les groupes paramilitaires participaient Ã  des enlÃ¨vements et Ã  des activitÃ©s d'extorsion. La mÃªme source a indiquÃ© que ce type d'activitÃ© ne visait aucun groupe particulier, mais qu'il avait plutÃ´t un but gÃ©nÃ©ralisÃ©. La prÃ©sence de ces groupes constitue une prÃ©occupation et amÃ¨ne un sentiment d'insÃ©curitÃ© chez la population locale.

Le ministre Mervyn Silva est le chef de la pÃ¨gre parrainÃ© par le gouvernement qui commet des meurtres Ã  forfait commandÃ©s par des dirigeants du gouvernement. \"\n",
      "[30] Le demandeur d'asile a Ã©tÃ© invitÃ© Ã  dÃ©crire Mervyn Silva et son poste, et Ã  fournir la preuve de son ministÃ¨re ainsi que de sa rÃ©putation de tueur Ã  gages. Il a dÃ©clarÃ© que M. Silva est dÃ©signÃ© en tant que \" dutugemunu \", qu'il a expliquÃ© Ãªtre le nom d'un [traduction] \" ancien roi ayant Ã©galement commis des crimes contre l'humanitÃ© \". Il a indiquÃ© que M.

Le demandeur d'asile a Ã©tÃ© priÃ© d'expliquer la faÃ§on dont un ministre du gouvernement peut Ãªtre un tueur Ã  gages et la raison pour laquelle il n'a pas Ã©tÃ© accusÃ© des crimes qu'il a commis, ce Ã  quoi il a rÃ©pondu : [traduction] \" Tout le monde le connaÃ®t, mÃªme l'opposition, mais il est sous les directives du prÃ©sident et il est dans les bonnes grÃ¢ces de ce dernier... le prÃ©sident a besoin de son aide pour continuer Ã  diriger... la police ne tient compte d'aucune plainte contre lui parce qu'elle fait partie du gouvernement et que le gouvernement dirige la police. \" Le demandeur d'asile a fourni, Ã  titre d'Ã©lÃ©ments de preuve, divers articles de journaux qui dÃ©crivent des hommes d'affaires qui ont Ã©tÃ© enlevÃ©s contre ranÃ§on ainsi que des enlÃ¨vements qui ont lieu Ã  bord d'une camionnette blanche10. Dans un bref article, le nom du ministre Mervyn Silva est mentionnÃ© en tant que personne ayant menacÃ© des journalistes qui avaient insultÃ© le prÃ©sident du Sri Lanka dans leur reportage11. J'estime que, si M. Silva Ã©tait aussi cÃ©lÃ¨bre que le demandeur d'asile le prÃ©tend, son nom serait mentionnÃ© dans les documents sur la situation du pays fournis par la Commission, oÃ¹ sa carriÃ¨re politique et sa rÃ©putation en tant que criminel seraient dÃ©crites. Je suis Ã©galement d'avis qu'il serait normal de s'attendre Ã  ce que davantage de renseignements soient versÃ©s en preuve par le demandeur d'asile.\n",
      "[31] Toutefois, aucun des documents de la Commission ne corrobore la rÃ©putation de Mervyn Silva ou le fait qu'il est dÃ©putÃ© au Sri Lanka. J'estime que si M. Silva Ã©tait le dÃ©putÃ© cÃ©lÃ¨bre et corrompu que le demandeur d'asile prÃ©tend qu'il est, je devrais m'attendre Ã  ce que son nom, son poste et sa rÃ©putation soient mentionnÃ©s dans les documents de la Commission sur les conditions dans le pays; toutefois, comme les documents ne font pas Ã©tat de Mervyn Silva et qu'il incombe au demandeur d'asile de fournir des Ã©lÃ©ments de preuve Ã  l'appui de ses allÃ©gations, ce qu'il a Ã©tÃ© incapable de faire, je conclus que le demandeur d'asile a exagÃ©rÃ© la rÃ©putation de M. Silva ainsi que les menaces personnelles que ce dernier a formulÃ©es, afin d'Ã©tablir et d'Ã©tayer sa demande d'asile.\n",
      "[32] En outre, le demandeur d'asile a Ã©tÃ© questionnÃ© au sujet de la rÃ©putation et des accusations de corruption formulÃ©es contre son mentor, M. Fonseka, comme l'indique le rapport du DÃ©partement d'Ã‰tats des Ã‰tats-Unis (Ã‰.-U.) :\n",

      "Il y a eu des procÃ¨s durant l'annÃ©e dont l'issue semblait prÃ©dÃ©terminÃ©e. Par exemple, le 18 novembre 2010, une cour supÃ©rieure de Colombo a reconnu coupable l'ancien commandant de l'armÃ©e et candidat du parti de l'opposition Ã  l'Ã©lection prÃ©sidentielle, Sarath Fonseka, d'avoir fait circuler la rumeur du \" drapeau blanc \", qui \" pouvait susciter des sentiments communs \", aux termes du rÃ¨glement sur les mesures d'urgence qui est maintenant Ã©chu, et l'a condamnÃ© Ã  trois ans de prison. Tout le monde reconnaissait que le procÃ¨s avait Ã©tÃ© motivÃ© par des facteurs politiques.\n",
      "L'un des prisonniers politiques les plus marquants Ã©tait le principal candidat du parti de l'opposition Ã  l'Ã©lection prÃ©sidentielle de 2010, soit l'ancien commandant de l'armÃ©e Sarath Fonseka. L'armÃ©e a dÃ©tenu M. Fonseka en fÃ©vrier 2010, et il est demeurÃ© en dÃ©tention. Les accusations portÃ©es contre lui aprÃ¨s qu'il eut Ã©tÃ© initialement dÃ©tenu Ã©taient vagues, et des reprÃ©sentants du gouvernement avaient laissÃ© entendre qu'il avait complotÃ© un coup d'Ã‰tat. AprÃ¨s plus d'un mois, des accusations officielles ont Ã©tÃ© portÃ©es devant deux cours martiales, soit pour des actes de corruption dans le domaine de l'approvisionnement militaire et la violation des rÃ¨glements militaires par la participation Ã  des activitÃ©s politiques en tant qu'officier en service. M. Fonseka a par la suite Ã©tÃ© accusÃ© devant un tribunal civil en vertu de la loi sur la prÃ©vention du terrorisme (Prevention of Terrorism Act) pour avoir incitÃ© des troubles civils en formulant des dÃ©clarations Ã  la presse en 2009 au sujet d'un ordre qui aurait Ã©tÃ© formulÃ© par le secrÃ©taire Ã  la DÃ©fense, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, voulant que les cadres des Tigres libÃ©rateurs de l'Eelam tamoul (TLET) soient fusillÃ©s (l'incident du \" drapeau blanc \"). M. Fonseka a niÃ© avoir formulÃ© ces dÃ©clarations.\n",
      "En aoÃ»t 2010, les deux cours martiales ont reconnu M. Fonseka coupable de corruption et de participation Ã  des activitÃ©s politiques dans le cadre de son service militaire, et l'ont condamnÃ© Ã  30 mois de prison. Il a Ã©galement perdu son grade et sa pension de mÃªme que son siÃ¨ge au Parlement; en outre, toutes les rÃ©fÃ©rences Ã  M. Fonseka sur les plaques militaires, etc., ont dÃ» Ãªtre effacÃ©es. Le 18 novembre, la Cour supÃ©rieure de Colombo a reconnu M. Fonseka coupable d'avoir fait circuler la rumeur du \" drapeau blanc \" et l'a condamnÃ© Ã  trois ans de prison, peine qui devait Ãªtre purgÃ©e aprÃ¨s la peine infligÃ©e par les cours martiales. L'appel de M. Fonseka devant les cours martiales a Ã©tÃ© rejetÃ© par la Cour d'appel le 16 dÃ©cembre. La Cour a jugÃ© que M. Fonseka n'avait pas prouvÃ© son accusation selon laquelle les membres de la seconde cour martiale n'Ã©taient pas impartiaux.\n",
      "Plusieurs organisations de dÃ©fense des droits de la personne ont accusÃ© M. Fonseka d'avoir commis diverses violations des droits de la personne pendant la guerre, notamment des meurtres extrajudiciaires, des disparitions et des tueries systÃ©matiques de civils dans la zone de guerre. NÃ©anmoins, bon nombre d'observateurs indÃ©pendants ont conclu que M. Fonseka avait Ã©tÃ© dÃ©tenu, accusÃ© et condamnÃ© pour des motifs politiques, en raison du manque de clartÃ© initial dans les allÃ©gations portÃ©es contre lui, du fait qu'aucune accusation officielle n'avait Ã©tÃ© portÃ©e contre lui pendant plus d'un mois aprÃ¨s sa dÃ©tention, de la faÃ§on sÃ©lective dont la loi a finalement Ã©tÃ© appliquÃ©e (certains officiers militaires appuyant le gouvernement ont parlÃ© publiquement en faveur du prÃ©sident pendant la campagne et ils n'ont pas Ã©tÃ© accusÃ©s ni punis de la mÃªme faÃ§on) et de la nature disproportionnÃ©e des peines infligÃ©es par les cours martiales, qui semblaient avoir pour but d'humilier M. Fonseka.\n",
      "Les autoritÃ©s ont arrÃªtÃ© 22 autres personnes ayant participÃ© Ã  la campagne de M. Fonseka, la plupart en lien avec les allÃ©gations de tentative de coup d'Ã‰tat. Toutefois, en novembre 2010, ces 22 personnes avaient Ã©tÃ© libÃ©rÃ©es sans accusation en suspens, et seul M. Fonseka Ã©tait demeurÃ© en prison12.\n",
      "[33] MÃªme si le demandeur d'asile croit peut-Ãªtre qu'il a Ã©tÃ© visÃ© personnellement parce qu'il est un homme d'affaires et un ancien militant politique appuyant M. Fonseka, j'estime que le risque auquel il Ã©tait exposÃ© pendant les mois prÃ©cÃ©dant son dÃ©part n'a aucun lien avec ses anciennes activitÃ©s politiques et est plutÃ´t fondÃ© sur l'extorsion dont il a Ã©tÃ© victime en tant qu'homme d'affaires. Ainsi, j'estime que le risque auquel le demandeur d'asile Ã©tait exposÃ© Ã©tait un risque auquel Ã©taient gÃ©nÃ©ralement exposÃ©es d'autres personnes dans ce pays.\n",
      "[34] Le demandeur d'asile a Ã©tÃ© invitÃ© Ã  dire si l'extorsion et l'enlÃ¨vement contre ranÃ§on Ã©taient courants au Sri Lanka, et si d'autres personnes Ã©taient Ã©galement visÃ©es par des demandes d'extorsion, ce Ã  quoi il a rÃ©pondu ce qui suit : [traduction] \" Je n'Ã©tais pas le seul, d'autres personnes faisaient l'objet d'extorsion de ranÃ§on, beaucoup de gens Ã©taient enlevÃ©s et tuÃ©s... d'autres hommes d'affaires Ã©taient visÃ©s, toute entreprise ou toute personne participant Ã  des activitÃ©s politiques; le problÃ¨me existe... c'est-Ã -dire celui de la ranÃ§on; des gens ont pour emploi de demander des ranÃ§ons ou d'imposer une taxe... Ã  toute personne qui s'oppose au gouvernement au pouvoir, il peut s'agir d'hommes d'affaires ou d'autres personnes. \" Il a dÃ©clarÃ© qu'il croit avoir Ã©tÃ© pris pour cible parce que les personnes qui souhaitent le tuer veulent l'agresser et obtenir une ranÃ§on, mais leur objectif principal est de tuer; cependant, si par le fait mÃªme elles peuvent obtenir de l'argent, elles le feront. Comme il participait Ã  des activitÃ©s politiques, il Ã©tait leur ennemi. InvitÃ© Ã  dire la raison pour laquelle il avait Ã©tÃ© pris pour cible en XXXX 2011, moment auquel il a fait l'objet d'un enlÃ¨vement et d'une demande d'extorsion, le demandeur d'asile a indiquÃ© ce qui suit : [traduction] \" Non seulement moi, mais plusieurs autres personnes ont Ã©tÃ© enlevÃ©es, et certaines d'entre elles ont versÃ© une ranÃ§on et ont tout de mÃªme Ã©tÃ© tuÃ©es. \" Il a Ã©tÃ© invitÃ© Ã  dire si l'enlÃ¨vement contre ranÃ§on Ã©tait courant dans son pays d'origine, ce Ã  quoi il a rÃ©pondu par l'affirmative en ajoutant que la ranÃ§on visait Ã  soutirer de l'argent, mais que, de toute faÃ§on, des gens se faisaient tuer.\n",
      "[35] Ces dÃ©clarations ainsi que les articles de journaux fournis par le demandeur d'asile mettent encore plus l'accent sur la prÃ©valence des crimes d'extorsion de ranÃ§on au Sri Lanka en ce moment et sur le fait que la crainte formulÃ©e par le demandeur d'asile est une crainte Ã  laquelle est gÃ©nÃ©ralement exposÃ©e la population du Sri Lanka. La dÃ©claration du demandeur d'asile selon laquelle les personnes visÃ©es par des actes d'extorsion sont gÃ©nÃ©ralement prises pour cible pour des raisons politiques n'est pas corroborÃ©e par les documents de la Commission sur les conditions dans le pays, qui ont Ã©tÃ© citÃ©s prÃ©cÃ©demment. Selon les documents dont je dispose, les personnes visÃ©es par des actes d'extorsion sont parfois prises pour cible pour des raisons politiques, mais, en rÃ¨gle gÃ©nÃ©rale, elles le sont uniquement pour des raisons liÃ©es Ã  l'argent. En l'espÃ¨ce, j'estime que la raison pour laquelle le demandeur d'asile a Ã©tÃ© pris pour cible Ã©tait strictement liÃ©e Ã  l'argent, et non politique, puisque selon ce que le demandeur d'asile a lui-mÃªme indiquÃ©, il n'a pas participÃ© Ã  des activitÃ©s politiques depuis la fin de XXXX 2009.\n",
      "[36] Ã€ la lumiÃ¨re des Ã©lÃ©ments de preuve dont je dispose, je conclus donc que le demandeur d'asile a Ã©tÃ© victime de crimes, mais que ces crimes sont trÃ¨s rÃ©pandus au Sri Lanka et qu'il n'est pas la seule personne Ã  subir de tels prÃ©judices. La SPR n'a pas de mandat juridique prÃ©cis lui permettant d'accorder l'asile Ã  des personnes telles que le demandeur d'asile en l'espÃ¨ce. J'estime que le risque auquel le demandeur d'asile est exposÃ© est un risque gÃ©nÃ©ralisÃ©.\n",
      "[37] J'ai examinÃ© la jurisprudence se rapportant au risque gÃ©nÃ©ralisÃ© et j'ai, en l'espÃ¨ce, tenu compte de la dÃ©cision Vickram13, dans laquelle un homme d'affaires indo-guyanais a Ã©tÃ© menacÃ©, battu et harcelÃ© Ã  rÃ©pÃ©tition par un groupe de bandits de race noire en Guyana. Il a Ã©tÃ© Ã©tabli qu'il avait Ã©tÃ© victime de ces criminels en raison de son appartenance Ã  une riche famille du milieu des affaires. La Cour fÃ©dÃ©rale a confirmÃ© la dÃ©cision de la Commission concernant le fait que le risque auquel le demandeur d'asile14 Ã©tait exposÃ© Ã©tait liÃ© Ã  des activitÃ©s criminelles, que ce risque n'Ã©tait pas plus important que celui auquel la population dans son ensemble Ã©tait exposÃ©e et que la perception de richesse ne constitue pas un risque particulier suivant l'article 97. Dans la dÃ©cision Rodriguez15, le demandeur d'asile principal et son frÃ¨re, des citoyens du Guatemala, ont demandÃ© l'asile parce qu'ils craignaient le gang Mara qui leur extorquait de l'argent parce qu'ils possÃ©daient une Ã©picerie. MÃªme si ces affaires sont diffÃ©rentes de celle en l'espÃ¨ce, je suis d'avis que dans ce cas, le risque de violence, de blessure ou de crime est un risque auquel sont gÃ©nÃ©ralement exposÃ©s tous les citoyens du Mexique qui sont perÃ§us par les criminels comme des personnes relativement bien nanties ou comme des propriÃ©taires d'entreprises. Le fait qu'un nombre prÃ©cis de personnes puissent Ãªtre prises pour cible plus frÃ©quemment en raison de leur richesse, ou dans ce cas prÃ©cis, en tant que propriÃ©taire d'une petite entreprise, ne signifie pas qu'ils ne sont pas exposÃ©s Ã  un risque gÃ©nÃ©ralisÃ© de violence. Le fait que les personnes exposÃ©es Ã  un risque sont celles rÃ©putÃ©es Ãªtre relativement riches ou celles qui sont des propriÃ©taires d'entreprises et peuvent Ãªtre considÃ©rÃ©es comme un sous-groupe de la population gÃ©nÃ©rale signifie qu'elles sont exposÃ©es Ã  un risque gÃ©nÃ©ralisÃ©. Le fait qu'elles sont exposÃ©es au mÃªme risque que d'autres personnes dans une situation similaire ne signifie pas qu'elles sont personnellement exposÃ©es Ã  un risque donnant lieu Ã  une protection suivant l'article 97.\n",
      "[38] Par consÃ©quent, j'estime, selon la prÃ©pondÃ©rance des probabilitÃ©s, que le risque auquel est exposÃ© le demandeur d'asile est gÃ©nÃ©ralisÃ© et qu'il constitue un risque auquel est gÃ©nÃ©ralement exposÃ©e la population du Sri Lanka. En m'appuyant sur les faits propres Ã  l'espÃ¨ce, je ne suis pas convaincue que le demandeur d'asile Ã©tait personnellement exposÃ© Ã  un risque de prÃ©judice suivant l'article 97 de la Loi.\n",
      "[39] Pour tous ces motifs, j'estime que le demandeur d'asile n'a pas qualitÃ© de rÃ©fugiÃ© au sens de la Convention ni celle de personne Ã  protÃ©ger.\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "[40] AprÃ¨s avoir examinÃ© l'ensemble de la preuve en l'espÃ¨ce, et Ã  la lumiÃ¨re de l'analyse qui prÃ©cÃ¨de, je conclus que le demandeur d'asile, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, n'a pas qualitÃ© de rÃ©fugiÃ© au sens de la Convention ni celle de personne Ã  protÃ©ger. La prÃ©sente demande d'asile est donc rejetÃ©e.\n",
