Notes:

(1) Data Source: In the fall of 2022 the Immigration and Refugee Board provided the RLL with a full backlog of approximately 116k published decisions from all divisions (RAD, RPD, ID, IAD). Because the IRB no longer regularly publishes RPD decisions, the dataset is no longer being updated, which is why we refer to the dataset as a legacy dataset. For more recent RPD decisions (obtained via Access to Information Requests), see the RLLR dataset.

(2) Unofficial Data: The data are unofficial reproductions. For official versions, please contact the Immigration and Refugee Board. 

(3) Non-Affiliation / Endorsement: The data has been collected and reproduced without any affiliation or endorsement from the Immigration and Refugee Board.

(4) Non-Commerical Use: As indicated in the license, data may be used for non-commercial use (with attribution) only. For commercial use, please contact the Immigration and Refugee Board. 

(5) Accuracy: Data was collected and processed programmatically for the purposes of academic research. While we make best efforts to ensure accuracy, data gathering of this kind inevitably involves errors. As such the data should be viewed as preliminary information aimed to prompt further research and discussion, rather than as definitive information.
