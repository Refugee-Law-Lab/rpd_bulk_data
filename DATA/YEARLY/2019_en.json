She claims refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsections 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nPRELIMINARY MATTERS\n[2] This is a hearing de novo.\n[3] Counsel submitted post hearing documents which were accepted and considered.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The claimant alleges the following in her Personal Information Form (PIF):2\n[5] The claimant was raised by her grandmother who had been practicing Falun Gong (FG) since 1995. In 2006, the claimant reached puberty and began suffering from intense menstrual pain. The claimant's grandmother suggested she try FG to ease her menstrual pain. After three months of practice, the claimant only felt mild discomfort during menstruation. Practicing FG made the claimant a better person, and she felt optimistic and peaceful and, therefore, decided to practice FG for life. The claimant and her grandmother practiced at home, and on weekends, they practiced with other practitioners in their homes.\n[6] The claimant's grandmother was killed in a car accident in 2008, but the claimant found comfort in her FG practice. The claimant came to Canada to study in XXXX, 2009. On XXXX XXXX, 2009, the claimant received a telephone call from her mother informing her the Public Security Bureau (PSB) attended her family home to arrest her for participating in FG activities. The PSB told her mother that they had arrested many FG practitioners and urged her to tell the claimant to return to China and turn herself in.\n[7] The claimant made a claim for refugee protection on November 4, 2009.\nAmendment\n[8] In an amendment signed on October 24, 2011, the claimant indicated that the PSB returned to her home in XXXXand XXXXof 2010, and again in June of 2011, urging her mother to tell the claimant to turn herself in.\nDETERMINATION\n[9] I find that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[10] I find that the claimant has established her personal identity and her identity as a citizen of China through a certified copy of her passport,3 the original of which is with the CBSA.\nCredibility\n[11] While statements given under oath are presumed to be true, that presumption can be rebutted by contradictions or inconsistencies in the evidence.4 In reviewing the evidence, I may also conclude that \"a claimant's evidence is implausible, or improbable, or dubious, or untenable, or unreliable, or absurd, or unconvincing.\"5 I am \"also entitled, in assessing credibility, to rely on criteria such as rationality and common sense.\"6 I am aware that the real test of the truth of a story of a witness is that it be in harmony with the preponderance of probabilities, which a practical and informed person would readily recognize as reasonable in that place and in those conditions.7 I cannot be satisfied that, \"the evidence is credible or trustworthy, unless satisfied that it is probably so, not just possibly so.\"8 The determination, as to whether a claimant's evidence is credible, is made on a balance of probabilities.\n[12] In assessing credibility, I was mindful of the claimant's age, education, and background. The claimant alleges that she has 15 years of education, and that she obtained a diploma from the Guangdong Polytechnic Institute. In addition, I am cognizant of the many difficulties faced by a claimant in establishing a claim, including cultural factors, the milieu of the hearing room, and the stress inherent in responding to oral questions through an interpreter. I have also taken into account that the alleged events took place more than eight years ago, although the first hearing of the claim took place on November 7, 2011.\n[13] The onus is on the claimant to prove her case. I find that she has not done so, on a balance of probabilities.\n[14] As per Rule 11 of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) Rules, the claimant is expected to submit documents to prove the different aspects of her case, and if she does not, to explain what efforts she made to do so. The claimant produced no documents related to her FG practice in China. I find that her explanations for the absence of documents are not reasonable, and cumulatively with other findings, lead me to conclude that the claimant has not established, on a balance of probabilities, that she practiced FG in China and that she is wanted by the PSB on that account.\nReasons for coming to Canada\n[15] I find that the claimant has not provided sufficient, credible, and trustworthy evidence that she came to Canada to be a genuine student.\n[16] The claimant arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2009, ostensibly to study. She had been accepted into Sport and Event Marketing program at XXXX XXXX College and testified that she was to start at XXXX XXXX in August of 2009. The claimant was asked why she came in XXXX if her program started in XXXX. The claimant's explanation is that her parents bought her plane ticket for that date and she did not question them as to why they picked that date. I do not find it plausible that the claimant, who was 22 years old at the time, would not have discussed with her parents about the optimum time for her to go to Canada. I also find that her explanation as to why she did not attend XXXX XXXX not credible. She testified that she began attending Seneca College because she decided that XXXX College was academically superior. She testified that she made that decision after visiting XXXX XXXX and XXXX on one occasion. It is not likely that she could judge academic superiority in such a short time, and she did not give the basis for her conclusion. It is to be expected that she would have had advice about the appropriate school to attend in Canada before making her student visa application in China. As well, she just enrolled in an English as a second language program, and therefore academic superiority would likely not have been a criterion at the time she decided to change colleges.\n[17] There is also little evidence the claimant attended classes. She came to Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2009 and was supposed to attend XXXX XXXX in XXXX. She did not attend XXXX XXXX, and alleges she did not attend English classes at XXXX until XXXX. She studied only English, passed level 4, and failed level 5. She testified that she was already at level 4 according to the XXXX College admission test, but was urged to repeat level 4 as she did not write English well. The claimant did not complete level 5. There is no documentary evidence of her attendance during this period. There is no evidence what tuition was paid and when. The claimant testified that after XXXX she could no longer attend school because she was too upset when she learned that she was being pursued by the PSB and because she received no money from her parents because their bank account was frozen. Based on the above findings, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant was likely not a genuine student in Canada and was not intending to be a genuine student when she entered Canada.\n[18] Counsel submits that whether the claimant was a genuine student is irrelevant. I disagree. The purpose for which the claimant came to Canada is relevant, because if she did not come to be a student, then it is obvious that she came here for other reasons, and the most obvious one is that she came to be a refugee claimant, as having a student visa was likely the easiest way to enter Canada and immediately thereafter make a refugee claim. In this way, she did not expend much money on tuition, if she attended for a short time, and immediately after making her claim was supported by the Canadian government as a refugee claimant.\nNo documentary evidence of FG practice in China\n[19] I find that the claimant has not submitted sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence that she was a FG practitioner in China. The claimant submitted no medical evidence of her condition that caused her to start practicing FG, a very risky practice in China. She provided no documentary evidence of the existence of her introducer, no documentary evidence of the discovery of her FG practice, no documentary evidence of the situation of fellow practitioners, no documentary evidence that her family suffered any repercussions, and no documentary evidence that the PSB are pursuing her.\n[20] The claimant testified that, in 2006, she was introduced to FG by her paternal grandmother, who took her to her group practice in September of 2006. The claimant produced no documentary evidence that her grandmother was even alive in 2006, and no documentary evidence that she died in a car accident in 2008, as alleged.\n[21] The claimant testified that she has no documentary evidence of her grandmother's accident or death. The claimant testified that her family did obtain a death certificate but that the PSB kept it when her father went to have the grandmother's hukou adjusted. It makes little sense that this would be the only situation, which would require her family to document the grandmother's death. In the previous hearing, the claimant had testified that her parents would be too scared to approach the PSB to have the death certificate returned. The claimant did not give any reason as to why the claimant's family' request to have a death certificate returned would implicate them in any action associated with the claimant's FG practice. In the same hearing, the claimant further stated, in questioning by counsel for the claimant, that the PSB always keep death certificates when people die. The claimant gave no evidence as to how she knows that the PSB always keep death certificates. I do not find it credible, that a government agency would take the document and not return it to the family for further use in documentation. I also note that the claimant has not provided any probative evidence that only one death certificate can be issued.\n[22] The claimant testified that the reason her grandmother had introduced her to FG in 2006 is because she had just begun to menstruate and was suffering from significant menstrual pain. The claimant went to doctors about the pain, but the doctors' treatments did not help. The claimant stated that her family was not worried that she had not started menstruating until the age of twenty. However, it would be expected that when she approached doctors about the menstrual pain which just started upon menstruation at age 20, that the doctors themselves would have had concerns about the late start of menarche, even if her parents had not. Counsel for the claimant submitted post-hearing documents which indicate that in Canada it was discovered that the claimant has a medical condition which can lead to late menarche. I accept that the claimant began menstruating late. However, the claimant did not submit any medical documents from China that she suffered from severe menstrual pain. The claimant's explanation is that her parents could not find her medical booklet. First of all, it would have been prudent for the claimant to bring her medical booklet when she came to Canada, as it would have her medical record, but she did not. Secondly, it would be expected that the parents would carefully guard the claimant's records, including her medical booklet, as it contains her medical history and she is their only child. Thirdly, the claimant explained that her parents could not get a copy of her medical booklet because they were too scared of the PSB. I do not find the explanation reasonable as most likely the hospital would not be aware that the claimant is wanted by the PSB. Counsel submits that her parents should not have to put themselves at risk to get evidence, but I find that there would have minimal risk, if any, as the PSB know the claimant is in Canada, and it would not be unreasonable for her parents to send her medical history to her. The claimant herself could also have attempted to get a copy of the medical booklet from Canada, but did not.\n[23] At the first hearing, the claimant explained that she had considered emailing or faxing a request to have her medical records sent to her, but that she did not feel that was safe to do so. I do not find the claimant's explanation reasonable as the claimant testified that the PSB are aware of her location in Canada, and making a request by fax or email would not put her at additional risk as she is doing so from a position of safety in Canada. I further note, that experienced counsel has assisted the claimant from the outset of her claim. I find the claimant's reasoning for not supplying supporting medical documentation is not acceptable and draw a further negative inference to her credibility.\nRepercussions to the claimant's parents in China\n[24] The claimant was asked as to whether the PSB had mistreated her family as a result of the discovery of her FG practice. The PSB returned to seek information concerning the claimant's whereabouts and told them to instruct the claimant to return to China. No evidence was provided of mistreatment. I note that country document evidence9 indicates that Chinese authorities use family members as hostages to force absconding FG practitioners to give up the practice. In addition, family members of absconding practitioners are subject to harassment, arbitrary interrogation, losing a job, a pension or housing.\n[25] I find that the lack of serious PSB maltreatment of members of the claimant's family further undermines the allegations of PSB pursuit.\n[26] There was an alleged repercussion to the claimants' parents in regard to the PSB freezing their bank account. The claimant testified clearly in this de novo hearing that she learned about the freezing of the bank account when her parents were unable to send her money to continue her studies in XXXX of 2012. However, I note that the claimant omitted from her PIF any mention of the freezing of the bank account, which is an important omission as it caused her to discontinue her studies and was a direct consequence of her alleged FG practice in China.\n[27] In the first hearing of this claim, the claimant gave different testimony. When asked about repercussions to her parents, the claimant stated that there were none. Only when asked about her schooling in Canada, did the claimant state that she could not attend school any longer because she was upset and because her parents could not send her money as their bank account had been frozen. However, when she was asked why she did not include the freezing of the accounts in the amendments to her PIF, the claimant had originally testified that she did not know when the accounts were frozen and that she did not include them in her amendments as the information of the freezing of her accounts came too late to be included in the amendments. It is obvious that the claimant's testimony was contradictory and was evolving at the first hearing and that, for the present hearing, she settled on a definite version of events.\n[28] The claimant testified that her parents' bank account has since been unfrozen. The claimant was asked if she has any documentary evidence of the accounts being unfrozen. The claimant testified that she does not, as the freezing and the unfreezing notification was done by phone and, therefore, there is no document. However, the parents could have asked the bank manager for a note indicating when the bank account was frozen. They could have easily had excuse that they needed proof that they could not immediately pay certain creditors. The explanation the claimant gave for her parents for not getting any note from the bank is that they were too scared to approach the bank. I do not find the claimant's explanation credible in this regard as the claimant's mother is an accountant and, presumably, knows how banks operate. The claimant's parents could also have asked for a note from the bank that the account has been unfrozen. At this point the PSB were no longer involved with the parents' account as they unfroze it and, therefore, the parents would not have any reason not to send this information sometime before this hearing.\nPursuit by the PSB\n[29] The claimant has no supporting evidence that she is wanted by the PSB, nor any evidence that her practice had been discovered in China. The claimant testified that the PSB visited her home five times, the last time in XXXX of 2012, but that they did not leave any summons or arrest warrant. Therefore, there is no documentary evidence to support the claimant's allegations that she is being pursued by the PSB.\n[30] The claimant also did not submit any evidence as to what has happened to the other six fellow FG practitioners. She testified that she has no knowledge or documentary evidence regarding the other six group practitioners, although she had been in communication with the organizer while she was in China. The claimant testified that her parents were too scared to ask anybody for information. The claimant testified that she herself was too afraid to ask anybody, as she feared that the Chinese would be eavesdropping and, therefore, could gather more evidence against her and give her a heavier punishment. The claimant showed no concern that her fellow practitioners would be in any more danger if the claimant's calls were monitored. The claimant did not explain why she thought her punishment would be greater if she tried to find out as to what happened to her alleged fellow practitioners.\nConclusion regarding credibility\n[31] The Federal Court of Appeal held in Orelien10 that \"[O]ne cannot be satisfied that the evidence is credible or trustworthy, unless satisfied that it is probably so, not just possibly so.\" Therefore, findings of fact, as well as the determination as to whether the claimant's evidence is credible, are made on a balance of probabilities. A witness' testimony does not have to be accepted simply because it was not contradicted at the hearing. The Refugee Protection Division is entitled to make reasonable findings based on implausibility, common sense and rationality, and may reject evidence if it is not consistent with the probabilities affecting the case as a whole.11 The British Columbia Court of Appeal stated in Faryna,12 \"In short, the real test of the truth of the story of a witness in such a case must be its harmony with the preponderance of the probabilities which a practical and informed person would readily recognize as reasonable in that place and in those conditions.\"\n[32] In any event, the claimant has not provided any persuasive documentary evidence to support her allegations that she is being pursued by the PSB, nor a reasonable explanation why she was unable to obtain any documents from China. The claimant has not satisfied Rule 11 of the RPD Rules. The sole basis for the claimant's allegations is her testimony and the allegations contained in her PIF. In this regard, I draw a negative inference, especially in the light of my finding that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant did not come to Canada to be a genuine student, but as a vehicle for entering Canada. Based on the foregoing cumulative negative findings I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has not met her onus of establishing that she was a FG practitioner in China and is being pursued by the PSB on that account.\nFalun Gong Practice in Canada\n[33] I find that there is sufficient evidence that the claimant has attended FG practices and activities during the six years while waiting for a refugee hearing. The claimant has also shown that she has substantial knowledge of the philosophy of FG. The court sent the case for a rehearing as the court found that the examination of the claimant regarding her knowledge of FG had been microscopic and that the member should have been testing the sincerity of her faith. In the first hearing of this case, the claimant had presented one support letter from a fellow practitioner and a list and signatures of a few co-practitioners. In contrast, in this hearing the claimant presented long letters from three young men who were former refugee claimants based on their FG practice, and are now Canadian citizens, stating that they are co-practitioners. In the letters, the authors state that they visited the claimant after her car accident in 2014, and describe how during her convalescence she showed that she practiced the three basic principles of FG which are truth, compassion and forbearance. I do not give these letters much weight as to the genuineness of the claimant's practice as the authors cannot attest to the claimant's motivation for practicing FG.\n[34] The claimant testified that her practice of FG was an extension of her FG practice in China. As I find that the claimant was not a genuine FG practitioner in China, and in the absence of any evidence of conversion-type experience in Canada, I find, on a balance of possibilities, that the claimant has studied FG and engaged in FG activities in Canada for the purposes of advancing her refugee claim and not because she is a genuine FG practitioner. I therefore find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant would not likely practice FG in China and would therefore no be persecuted on that account. There is also no persuasive evidence that the Chinese authorities are aware of the claimant's FG activities in Canada.\nCONCLUSION\n[35] On the basis of the cumulative findings noted above, I find that the claimant is able to return to China without risk of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, without risk of the harms pursuant to ss. 97(1) of the IRPA.\n[36] I find that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n[37] Therefore, the Refugee Protection Division rejects her claim.\n(signed)\n\"Rose Andrachuk\"\nRose Andrachuk\nJanuary 4, 2019\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n2 Exhibit 2, Personal Information Form (PIF) dated December 17, 2009.\n3 Exhibit 1, Package of information from the referring CBSA\/CIC.\n4 Maldonado, Pedro Enrique Juarez v.

Counsel requested to make written submissions. The request was granted. Counsel was advised that the written submissions was due by 23 Nov 2018, and the panel reserved the right to render its decision after elapse of this date.\n[3] On 13 Nov 2018, counsel submitted a written urgent request for a copy of the CD recording of the hearing, which was picked up on 19 Nov 2018. However, to date, 4 Jan 2019, counsel's written submissions have not been received at the IRB.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] After considering the totality of the evidence, relevant documents, statutory provisions, and case law, the panel finds the claimant failed to provide sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to discharge her onus, establishing that a serious possibility of persecution based on a Convention ground exists or that, on a balance of probabilities, she would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in St. Vincent, if she were to return to St. Vincent.\nNexus\n[5] The claimant alleges, that if she were to return to her country, she fears she would be killed by members of the \"Cell Block\" gang; who allegedly blame her for causing the death of her deceased partner, XXXX XXXX, a Cell Block gang member, in 2007. The claimant also alleged, that she feared her daughter (born in Canada in 2017)1 would be killed by XXXX brother.\n[6] The panel finds there is no nexus to the convention grounds. Thus, the panel will assess the case under 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nANALYSIS\nIssues\n[7] The following issues were identified at the hearing: Who the claimant fears if she were to return Saint Vincent (St Vincent) at the time of the hearing; credibility, delay in claiming asylum in Canada; state protection and possible exclusion based on criminality.\nIdentity\n[8] The panel finds the claimant, on a balance of probabilities, is a citizen of St Vincent and has established her identity, absent any evidence to rebut the genuineness of the passport2 proffered to Canadian authorities in support of her identity.\nALLEGATIONS AND CREDIBILITY ASSESSMENT\n[9] In assessing credibility, the panel is guided by the Federal Court of Appeal decision in Orelien,3 stating that, \"one cannot be satisfied that the evidence is credible or trustworthy, unless satisfied that it is probably so, not just possibly so.\" Serious internal inconsistencies, external inconsistencies, and implausibilities, existed in the claimant's testimony.\n[10] The panel was also guided by the Federal Court of Appeal in Dan-Ash,4 which stands for the proposition that an important indicator of credibility is the consistency with which a witness has told a particular story, including to Canadian immigration officials.\n[11] The panel also took into consideration The Chairperson's Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution5 when approaching the process of the hearing and the facts in this case. All relevant factors, such as social and cultural context in which the claimant found herself, along with the issue of state protection and country conditions, were examined with consideration of the Chairperson's Gender Guidelines.\n[12] The claimant's allegations are detailed in the Personal Information Form (PIF), and two amendments.6 In summary, the claimant alleges that she was in a common-law relationship with XXXX from 2005 to 2007, and was a victim of spousal abuse and beatings. XXXX, a drug dealer, was injured by the claimant's brother, XXXX7 (XXXX), after an altercation on November 25, 2007. XXXX died in the hospital on November 28, 2018.\n[13] The claimant travelled to Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2007, via Trinidad and Tobago. She sought asylum in Canada on January 11, 2010.\nTravels to Barbados\n[14] The claimant's passport, issued in 2006, indicates that the claimant travelled to Barbados on three occasions, by air on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2006, XXXX XXXX, 2007, and XXXX XXXX, 2007. The claimant explained that her close friend XXXX had a boyfriend in Barbados, she invited her to accompany her. She testified that the purpose of each visit was vacation, and she stayed approximately one week on each visit.\n[15] The claimant was asked the reason she did not travel to Canada via Barbados, instead of Trinidad and Tobago, she explained that her mother had made the arrangement and bought the ticket.\nDelay in claim \/ Subjective fear\n[16] The claimant travelled to Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2007, via Trinidad and Tobago. She was granted stay until March 28, 2008. She sought asylum in Canada on January 11, 2010.\n[17] The claimant explained that when she came to Canada she did not know the law and who to talk to, she was afraid of being deported.\n[18] When asked what propelled her to seek asylum in 2010, the claimant explained that the \"Cell Gang\" had become larger, and they had killed people when \"drug deals went wrong\", and they kill their victims in the bushes.\n[19] The panel does not accept her explanations as reasonable, given her evidence that she left St Vincent fearing for her life after a big drug deal went bad, and the \"Cell block\" gang held her responsible for XXXX death. Furthermore, her evidence indicates that her family was not threatened between the periods 2009 to 2011; her mother an eye-witness to the alleged altercation leading to XXXX death and her brother's alleged conviction in 2009, of murder in self-defence, and after his release in to 2011. She further added that her mother never told her of any threats. The claimant testified she came to Canada because she had a friend, XXXX XXXX. It is reasonable to expect the claimant to have inquired from her friend, after her visitor authorization had expired, to find out how to extend her authorization, regularize her stay, or to seek asylum.\n[20] The panel finds it is reasonable to expect a person fleeing persecution to claim international protection at the first opportunity, in this case, the claimant's did so after several years. The panel draws a negative inference in this respect, and finds the claimant's action demonstrates a lack of subjective fear in St Vincent.\nClaimant's family involvement with drugs\n[21] The claimant's evidence indicates, she told her brother that she heard a conversation on the phone that XXXX was going to be involved in a drug deal. Her brother told her when they got home, after the altercation, that he stopped the deal that night. The claimant further stated, that everyone in her county was engaged in drug trafficking. She explained her brother could have also been engaged in drug sales, since he had no job. She further stated, that her step-father was a fisherman; however, she did not know if he too was involved or not. The panel finds, on a balance of probability, her brother was engaged in dealing drugs.\nDay of incident of the alleged incident\n[22] The claimant testified that the alleged incident took place on a Sunday, she was sure that it was a dry cool night. She and XXXX were at a disco, she saw her brother there talking to his girlfriend. After 10-15 minutes, XXXX went out and the claimant saw her brother following him. The claimant got suspicious of his brother; who was a \"talker\", and followed him out. She observed her brother talking to other people, thus, she returned to the disco.\n[23] The claimant, after 5-10 minutes, heard noises outside the disco. When she went to look, she saw one of XXXX men attacking and stabbing her brother; who sustained small cuts. Others intervened and told her brother, XXXX, to go home. It was about midnight when the claimant saw her brother walking toward her mother's house. The claimant returned to the disco.\n[24] While at a disco, a friend informed the claimant that XXXX had hit XXXX. The claimant did not check on XXXX, and stated that part of her was happy because of the abuse she had endured, feeling she was avenged. The claimant left the disco and went to her mother's house. She testified at the time the weather was dry.\n[25] After arriving at her mother's house, the claimant's mother told her that she was called by a person to come and get XXXX from the stabbing incident. On her way, her mother saw XXXX jumping out of the bushes with a cutlass in hand, attempting to hit XXXX. The claimant's mother screamed, alerting XXXX; who picked up and threw a rock forcefully, hitting XXXX. The incident took place on a road close to the disco with a lot of pedestrian traffic. Subsequently, the claimant's mother and XXXX went home. The claimant subsequently left her mother's house, and returned to her own house. She stated that at the time she went home, it had not rained.\n[26] On the next day, mid-day, the gang came to their gate, approximately 50-100 steps away from the house, shouting for an hour for XXXX to come out. After approximately an hour, they went away. The claimant and her brother did not call the authorities because there was no 911 number to call, and one had to walk to the police station located in the next village.\n[27] The claimant testified that, after the gang members left, she and her brother went to her friend's house in Belair; where she stayed from Monday through Thursday when she travelled to Canada.\nNewspaper article\n[28] The claimant, in support of her allegation, submitted a faxed copy of a newspaper, dated Friday, November 30, 20078; which she had received from her mother. The article indicates, that XXXX XXXX died in the hospital around 7:00 am, on Wednesday. XXXX mother was called about 1:00 am on Monday morning, informing her that her son was knocked down and lying on the road. His mother further added that \"You know what really hurt me? Is that he spent over an hour in the rain and nobody went to his assistance.\" The article also states that,\nOn Tuesday, XXXX XXXX, another resident of Fitzhughes, handed over her son, XXXX XXXX XXXX to police in connection with the incident... An autopsy is to be carried out to determine the cause of death.\n[29] The claimant was asked to explain the inconsistency between her evidence that the weather was dry during the time of the incident in question, midnight and 1:00 am, while the article indicated that it had rained around the time of the incident. The claimant stated, that it had not when she went to her house, and could not remember if it had rained. The issue of the weather condition is significant in the circumstances of this incident. The panel does not accept her explanation as credible, given her evidence that she left the bar after being informed that XXXX had been hit by her brother, and XXXX mother, allegedly, received the call about her son around 1:00 am. The panel draws a negative inference in this respect.\n[30] With respect to the newspaper page submitted, the panel noted, that the page consisted of four separate sections; to the naked eye, the margins, and spaces between the margins, columns, and four separate sections were irregular. Additionally, the layout of the newspaper page was inconsistent, the article titled \"News\" appeared on an advertisement page that contained a \"NOTICE OF SALE\" ad, and a job ad. The claimant was asked to explain these anomalies on what would appear to be the classified section. She explained that her mother had faxed the newspaper page to her.\n[31] The panel does not accept her explanation as persuasive. It is reasonable to expect a professional newspaper to be mindful of its layout and format. Given the nature of the page, it is also reasonable, to expect that anyone, on a balance of probabilities, could purchase space on an advertisement page of any newspaper.\n[32] No probative value is assigned to the newspaper article.\nWas the claimant in a common-law relationship?\n[33] The claimant, in response to question 3 of the PIF9, instructing her to provide marital history in chronological order, indicated that she \"Never was married, the date status required 30\/03\/1984\". Similarly, she did not include her common-law spouse in response to question 4,10 instructing to list relatives, living or dead.\n[34] The claimant explained, that she did not look at the form properly or understand it. The panel does not find her explanation as persuasive. It is reasonable to expect the claimant to have mentioned her alleged deceased common-law husband, in at least question 4, as being deceased, noting, that she had benefit of counsel. The panel draws a negative inference in this respect.\n[35] The claimant was asked if she had any documents to support her allegation, i.e. pictures of XXXX and her. She testified \"no, I came to Canada out of fear\". The panel does not accept the claimant's explanation as persuasive. Noting, that she has been in Canada since 2007, she has had ample opportunity to obtain any documents in support of her common-law relationship with XXXX. It is reasonable to expect the claimant to proffer at least her brother's alleged trial, conviction, and or XXXX autopsy report, or death certificate. Given the claimant's testimony that her brother had a lawyer, and such documents exist and are available.\n[36] The panel does not find the claimant's explanation, that she asked about her brother's case, but did not get it, and the lawyer was shot dead a year ago (2017), as persuasive.\n[37] The claimant was asked if she tried to get any documents for her first hearing in 2012, from XXXX lawyer. She explained, that her mother got the documents but \"could not get it stamped by the police\", and was told \"that it was police business\". The panel finds the claimant's evidence in this respect was illogical. Furthermore, the claimant could have submitted the documents without the police stamp, or with the counsel's affidavit accompanying the documents. The panel draws a negative inference from the claimant's failure to proffer any corroborating documents.\n[38] The panel draws a negative inference from the cumulative effect of the claimant's omission of question 3 and 4, and failure to obtain a sufficient credible document, to corroborate her allegation that she was in a common-law relationship with XXXX. The panel find's the claimant's evidence, regarding being in a common-law relationship, is not credible.\n[39] The panel also draws a negative inference from the claimant's failure to proffer any legal documents in support of the alleged incident leading to XXXX death, and her brother's conviction. The panel finds her evidence in this respect is not credible.\n[40] The claimant, in support of her allegation, proffered a letter dated 2012,11 from her mother; which retreated the claimant's allegations of spousal abuse, and XXXX incident. Minimal probative value is assigned to the letter, given the lack of credibility findings noted above.\nBenefiting of Proceed of a drug deal\n[41] The claimant alleged that XXXX was a member of \"Cell Block\" gang and a drug dealer, selling marijuana and cocaine. He kept the drugs in the shed. Members of the gang would come to the house, and after greeting the claimant, would go to the shed to pick up the drugs. The claimant alleged that she observed XXXX sell drugs. She testified that she was never asked to sell the drugs. She testified that XXXX \"took care of me with the money from the sale of marijuana\". The claimant was asked, given the alleged spousal abuse and beatings, did she consider reporting XXXX drug dealing to the police. The claimant testified \"No ... why would I do that. I was benefiting from it.\"\n[42] If the panel were to accept XXXX was a drug dealer and sold marijuana and cocaine, and the claimant, according to her admission, benefited from the drug sales, the panel would be obliged to accept that the claimant was living off of the proceeds of drug trafficking.\n[43] In this respect, the panel was guided by the British Colombia and Yukon Judgements R. v. M.A.M., [2005] B.C.J. No. 2357, which, in paragraph 23 and 24 states the following:\nParagraph 23: Every one commits an offence who has in his possession any property or thing or any proceeds of any property or thing knowing that all or part of the property or thing or the proceeds was obtained by or derived directly or indirectly from: [emphasis added]\na. the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment; or\nb. an act or omission anywhere, that, if it had occurred in Canada, would have constituted an offence punishable by indictment.\nPragraph 24: \"Possession\" is defined in s. 4(3) of the Criminal Code, in the following manner:\nFor the purposes of this Act,\na. a person has anything in \"possession\" when he has it in his personal possession or knowingly\ni. has it in the actual possession or custody of another person, or\nii. has it in any place, whether or not that place belongs to or is occupied by him, for the use or benefit of himself or of another person; and\n[44] Therefore, the panel concludes, that the claimant knowingly, by living off the proceeds of drug sales by XXXX, based on her own admission, has committed an offence. An offence that is considered criminal under the Control drugs and Substance Act (S.C.1996, c.19) Schedule 1, however, is not subject to exclusion under Article 1F(B), serious non-political crime, given that the punishment for such an offence in Canada in part is stated as:\nEvery person who contravenes subsection (2)\n(a) is guilty of an indictable offence and liable\n(i) to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years, where the subject-matter of the offence is a substance included in Schedule I,\n[45] The matter of exclusion was solidified during the hearing, the RPD Rule 26 requires that the division MUST adjourn and notify the Minister in writing. In this case, considering that the crime draws 7 years imprisonment, the minister was not notified. However, at the onset of the hearing, notice of possible issue of exclusion was declared.\n[46] Given all of the above, the panel finds that the claimant has not established, that on a balance of probabilities, she would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in St Vincent, if she and her daughter were to return to St Vincent in 2018.\nCONCLUSION\n[47] The panel therefore concludes, that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is not a Convention refugee, and not a person in need of protection.\nDECISION\n[48] The claim is therefore rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Fahimeh Mortazavi\"\nFahimeh Mortazavi\nJanuary 21, 2019\nDate\n1 Exhibit 7.\n2 Exhibit 1, passport.\n3 Orelien, Joseph v.

Klauss\nConseil du (de la) ministre\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, also known as XXXX XXXX and PXXXX XXXX XXXX (the claimant), and her three sons, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX (the minor claimants)are claiming refugee protection pursuant to ss. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nADMINISTRATIVE ISSUE\nJoinder\n[2] These claims for refugee protection were heard jointly pursuant to 55 (1) of the RPD rules2. Each claim was decided on its own merits.\nDesignated representative\n[3] The claimant was designated as the designated representative for her three minor sons, the minor claimants pursuant to 20(1) and (6) of the RPD rules3.\nMinisters Counsel\n[4] Minister's counsel participated by filling evidence4 only.\nCounsel's Oral Representation\n[5] The hearing into the claim was held on 13 November 2018. Counsel was asked to make her oral representation at the end of the hearing, as it is the practice at the Board pursuant to Rule 10(7) of the RPD rules. However, counsel submitted that given the complexity of the case at hand she preferred to do a written submission, as she is better in making her submissions in writing and further she wanted to look for more country documents. The panel noting that the case was straight forward, and given that counsel was an experience counsel, offered counsel to make her submission by 19 November 2018. However, counsel stated that it was not sufficient time for her to make her written submission, and requested more time. Counsel's request for more time was denied. The panel notes that all the documents counsel intended to search post hearing was to have been done prior to the hearing and submitted at the hearing. Counsel was directed to make her oral submissions at the end of hearing and she would be provided time to gather her thoughts if she required. Counsel stated her objection on the record and proceeded with her oral submissions. Counsel's objection was duly noted.\nISSUES\n[6] At the outset of the hearing the following issues were identified: identity; credibility; countries of citizenships; delay in departure from Israel; failure to claim in Canada in October 2011; female claimant's failure to claim in USA during the periods of 1999-2007 and November 2011- March 2012; and, state protection in the State of Israel and United States of America (USA).\n[7] Furthermore, given Colombia was also a country of reference the following issues were identified: reavailment in 2007 from USA; Internal flight alternative (IFA); change of circumstance; and, compelling reasons.\nNexus\n[8] The nexus in this claim are religion and membership in a particular group, namely, Catholic converts to Judaism, and vice versa, and perceived political opinion, given the minor claimants' objection to State of Israel military service.\nDETERMINATION\n[9] After considering the totality of the evidence, relevant documents, statutory provisions, counsel's submissions and case law, the panel finds the claimants failed to provide sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to discharge their onus of establishing that a serious possibility of persecution based on a Convention ground exists or that, on a balance of probabilities, they would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Israel, if they were to return to Israel.\n[10] The minor claimants failed to provide sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to discharge their onus of establishing that a serious possibility of persecution based on a Convention ground exists or that, on a balance of probabilities, they would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the USA, if they were to return to the USA.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[11] The panel finds, the claimants based on their passports5 on a balance of probabilities, have established their identity, absent any evidence to rebut the genuineness of the passport proffered to Canadian authorities in support of their identity.\nCitizenship\n[12] The claimant's evidence indicates that she was born in Colombia and is a citizen of Colombia. Her evidence indicates that she and her family, including the minor claimants, immigrated to Israel in 2007, after converting to Judaism and undergoing a Jewish marriage on XXXX XXXX 2007.6 Her family, including her husband, and the three minor claimants were conferred upon Israeli citizenship and they were issued passports of the State of Israel.\n[13] Her evidence indicates that her three sons were born in Florida7, USA and are also USA citizens.8\n[14] Counsel submitted that the minor claimants are entitled to citizenship of Colombia based on their father and mother; who are both nationals and citizens of Colombia. The panel finds it is not necessary to consider this other potential country of citizenship, given the determination with respect to Israel and USA.\nCountries of reference on this claim\n[15] The panel ruled that the female claimant's claim will be assessed against the last country she resided and was citizen of, namely, Israel; where she lived according to the claimant's testimony from November 2007 until October 2011. The minor claimants' claims will be assessed against Israel, where they lived from 2007 to 2011, as citizens and their country of birth and citizenship being the USA.\n[16] Colombia was not addressed at the hearing as insufficient credible evidence, with respect to the claimants' well-founded fear based on ss. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) existed at the hearing against Israel and USA to merit assessing the claims against Colombia.\nClaim against Israel\nWho the claimants fear if they were to return to Israel?\n[17] The claimant alleged that if they were to return to Israel she fears that the minor claimant's would be bullied; have to serve in the military service; and, she fears terrorism in Israel. She also implied that she fears losing her citizenship.\nAllegation and credibility assessment\n[18] In assessing credibility, the panel is guided by the Federal Court of Appeal decision in Orelien,9 stating that \"one cannot be satisfied that the evidence is credible or trustworthy, unless satisfied that it is probably so, not just possibly so.\" With respect to the serious omissions, noted below, the panel was guided by the Federal Court of Appeal in Dan-Ash,10 which stands for the proposition that an important indicator of credibility is the consistency with which a witness has told a particular story, including to Canadian immigration officials.\n[19] The claimant provided the viva voce evidence. The panel finds the claimant's evidence is internally inconsistent, inherently implausible, some oral allegations were omitted from the Personal Information Form (PIF), and aspects of her allegations were contradicted by documentary evidence on country conditions in Israel and documents submitted on her behalf. The panel, therefore, finds the claimant was not a reliable witness as addressed below.\nSubjective fear\n[20] With respect to failure to claim asylum in Canada 2011, the claimant's evidence indicates that in 2011, they travelled from Israel to Canada. The claimant testified that in June 2011, to protect her sons against \"discrimination\" she sent the minor claimants to Canada to stay with her mother. She travelled to Canada later, in October 2011, also fleeing \"discrimination\" experienced in Israel. However, the claimant and her family claimed asylum in Canada on 21 March 2012, after returning to Canada from a visit to the USA. They went to the USA in November 2011. The claimant was asked to explain the reason they did not claim Canada's protection on the first entry to Canada in 2011. She explained that she wanted to but her husband decided to travel to USA to see his children from another marriage, thus, everything was delayed.\n[21] The panel does not accept her explanation for failing to claim in Canada in October 2011, as reasonable, given her allegation of fleeing Israel, because they were discriminated against, called derogatory name Goya (none-Jewish\/un pure), and alleging that although they had converted to Judaism, they could not practice Catholicism overtly. Thus, they came to Canada to enjoy protection of Canada. The panel finds that the claimant's action demonstrates lack of subjective fear in Israel. The panel draws a negative inference from the claimants' failure to claim asylum in Canada in October 2011. It is reasonable to expect a person fleeing persecution to claim international protection at the first opportunity, in this case the claimant's did so after several months and on their second entry to Canada from the USA in March 2012.\n[22] With respect to failure to claim asylum in USA in 2011 and 2007, the claimant testified that in October 2011, she travelled to USA using her Israeli passport entering as a visitor. While she entered Canada in November 2011, using her Colombian passport. The claimant was asked why she did not claim asylum in USA in 2011, she explained that by then the problems with Latin American immigrants had started. The panel does not accept her explanation as reasonable. Noting the claimant's history of failing to claim asylum in USA in 1999, when she left Colombia to seek asylum in USA. Allegedly having lost her personal documents and failing to claim during the required period of one year. She continued to remain in USA irregularly until 2007. With respect to the claimant's failure in 2011, it is reasonable to expect the claimant to at least approach the authorities to see what would happen in the circumstances of her case, given that the minor claimants were born in the USA. The claimant explained that she thought everything was stacked against her as she lived in USA irregularly until 2007. She further explained her husband's lawyer, told them they would be denied refugee protection and would be better not to. The panel notes that the claimant's husband had a criminal record in the USA and his residency permit was no longer valid.\n[23] The panel does not find her explanation as persuasive, given that there were no guaranties in Canada or any other countries that they would be granted asylum. The panel draws a negative inference in this respect and finds the claimant's action demonstrates lack of subjective fear in Israel.\n[24] With respect to delay in departure from Israel in 2011, in the context of alleged discrimination, which according to the claimant's testimony started as soon as they arrived in Israel in 2007. The claimant explained that in 2008, her mother had come to Israel and wanted to go to USA to seek protection. Her mother eventually went to Canada.\n[25] The panel does not find her explanation as persuasive and it is not reasonable. The panel finds given her allegation of discrimination, it is reasonable to expect the claimant to leave Israel with or after her mother's departure to Canada. The panel draws a negative inference from the claimant's failure to depart Israel prior to 2011. The panel finds claimant's actions demonstrates lack of subjective fear in Israel.\n[26] Minister's council further submitted that \"the allegations of risk as outlined by the female claimant [claimant] are seriously undermined by Mr. XXXX XXXX [the claimant's husband] withdrawal of his refugee claim in 2015. Given that they allege the same risk in Colombia and Israel and their claims were joined, the Minister submits that his decision to withdraw his claim is clearly indicative of lack of subjective fear that applies to her claim as well, regardless of the reason for his withdrawal.\"11\nMisrepresentations\n[27] Minister's counsel submitted that the claimant misrepresented herself when she made a refugee application. The minister submitted that the claimant \"...clearly lied to the port of entry officer regarding her routing, her countries of citizenship, and her previous visit to Canada...She only admitted to being a citizen of Israel after a break in the interview: presumably, after being confronted with evidence regarding this citizenship\"12\n[28] The port of entry notes indicates that at first the claimant alleged that she had not been to Canada before despite entering Canada in October 2011. The claimant also alleged that she was not a citizen of any other country besides Colombia despite her testimony at the hearing that she had also acquired citizenship of Israel, and was issued an Israeli passport, which she had used to travel to USA from Canada in November 2011. Furthermore, she had concealed the fact that she travelled to Canada from Israel instead alleging that she travelled \"from Colombia to Panama... Costa Rica, San Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Pasos, Texas... I'm not sure Tiajuna...\"13\n[29] At the hearing the claimant was asked to explain the reason she provided false information at the port of entry. The claimant explained she feared that because she was Israeli and that dual nationals do not get refugee status in Canada and are sent back. The panel finds that the claimant's actions illustrates that she knowingly provided false information; she was aware of the fact that dual citizenship could have negative result when claiming asylum.\n[30] The claimant alleged at the hearing that they were not in possession of their Israeli passports. She further explained that her husband had taken all of their Israeli passports with him back to Israel, when he withdrew his refugee claim in Canada. He opted to voluntarily return to Israel when given a choice between returning to Colombia or Israel.\n[31] The panel finds it is not reasonable to accept the claimant's explanation as it is implausible for the passports to be in Israel when the claimant at the port of entry states to the Immigration officer that the passports \"I leave it behind in Florida.\"14 The panel finds the claimant's evidence regarding the whereabouts of the Israeli passports is not credible.\nConversion to Judaism and fear of being stripped of the Israeli Citizenship\n[32] The claimant's evidence in the narrative indicates that her husband met a friend in Colombia; who told them about converting to Judaism as a means to leave Colombia and live in Israel. In October 2007, the claimant and her family went to Bogota and a few days later they were taken to meet a Rabbi in Cucuta [a border city between Colombia and Venezuela] who conducted the conversions for all the applicants from Colombia. The claimant testified that the conversion process took several days to undergo. The conversion ritual first had her husband accept the Jewish customs, then all of the family took part in immersion ceremony and lastly the claimant and her husband were married by the US Rabbi, at the home of \"Sheliach\" (envoy of the Jewish Agency for Israel to South America),15 in Cucuta. She also testified that her husband was circumcised while her sons were already circumcised because they were born in USA.\n[33] The claimant was asked the reason the allegation of the Jewish marriage taking place at the home of the Jewish rabbi was omitted from the PIF and the PIF amendment she explained \"I forgot\". The panel does not accept her explanation as persuasive, it is not reasonable to accept that she forgot it twice. It is reasonable to expect that this information would have been included in the PIF amendment. The panel draws a negative inference from the omission.\n[34] The claimant's evidence in the PIF states that on 2 November 2007, her husband picked up the Israeli passports and plane tickets. However, her oral evidence is inconsistent with her narrative, it indicates that they were issued permits to travel to Israel and they travelled with their Colombian passports to Israel. They were issued their passports approximately one year later in Israel.\n[35] The claimant alleged that the \"Sheliach\" who presided at their conversion was later arrested in Israel for suspicion of having issued immigrant authorizations to Christians to pass as Jews, thus putting into question their conversion to Judaism. In support of her allegation she provided a news article16 dated 13\/2\/2008, which states in part that \"An envoy of the Jewish Agency for the Israel to Latin America was arrested in the morning on suspicion of having entered the country non-Jewish immigrants with false documentation that certified conversion to Judaism never made. It would be at least 200 cases of Venezuelan citizens who entered the country in this way... Most of the \"Olim\" are aborigines who were convinced to immigrate to Israel with promise that they would receive monetary aid from the country, some of them still live in the city of Ramleh and others left the country some years ago...\"17\n[36] The panel notes that the claimant's case is different from the cases mentioned in the article. Firstly, the article speaks of Venezuelan cases, aborigines who never made conversion to Judaism. It does not mention any converts from Colombia. Secondly, the claimant described four days of conversion process including immersion, circumcision, and Jewish marriage. Thirdly, the panel notes the claimants lived in Ramleh without any contacts from the authorities regarding the genesis of their conversion until their departure in 2011. The panel concludes that the article does not support the claimant's allegations given the discrepancies between their situation and the one described in the article. The panel finds the claimants' evidence regarding their conversion not being genuine is not credible.\n[37] The claimant was asked to provide the Jewish marriage certificate in corroboration of her allegations involving the Rabbi and the Sheliach. The claimant explained that she had given it to her counsel. Counsel submitted that the document was not available due to difficulty of translation. The panel draws a negative inference from failing to submit a copy of translated or untranslated marriage certificate. Furthermore, the panel is not satisfied that the document was difficult to translate given the multicultural nature of Toronto and availability of translators at the board and translator agencies in Toronto.\n[38] The claimant testified that in 2009 the authorities told them that they had to convert again, in Israel; which they did not. They were sent to take courses and change the name of the twins to Jewish names. The claimant's evidence in this respect, in the PIF states that \"we were required to complete the conversion process in Israel so that we could be fully Jewish and accepted in their community. This would allow me to work in XXXX XXXX and my children could have a Bar Mitzvah ceremonies and in the future get married to a Jewish girl. I refused to do it because I did not want us to be Jewish and it would not affect our immigration status.\"18 The panel finds the claimant's testimony with respect to taking a course was exaggerated to strengthen the claim.\n[39] The claimant was asked to explain the omission of this fact and the Sheliach's arrest from their PIF. The claimant explained that the other lawyer, referring to her previous lawyer, wanted to do things quickly. His (previous lawyer) secretary said to go to the heart of the issue and do it quickly. The panel does not accept the claimant's explanation as reasonable given that PIF narrative is composed of six pages and 26 paragraphs, noting that paragraph 11 alone was a full page. The panel finds that these allegations are significant as they go to the heart of the issue, determining the fate of the claimants in Israel; however, the claimant failed to state it to the secretary. The panel draws a negative inference in this respect and finds the claimant's allegations as not credible.\n[40] Furthermore, the claimant was asked, given that she had a new counsel and had made amendments to her PIF, the reason she did not amend her PIF prior to the hearing. She replied she \"does not understand these things well\" (words of the claimant). The panel does not accept her explanation as reasonable, given that the above news article was submitted, it is reasonable to have a reference made to it in the narrative. The panel draws a negative inference in this respect.\n[41] Another article19 dated 15 February 2008, states \"here in Argentina there is a lot of controversy about the late conversion of people who desire and devoutly study Judaism and willing to convert and migrate to Israel.\" The article makes no reference to any conversions in Colombia. The panel finds this article by not referring to Colombia undermines the claimant's allegation regarding the Sheliach.\n[42] If the panel were to accept that the authorities would take actions against fraudulent convertors, the panel notes the claimant's evidence does not support their allegation that their conversion was fraudulent in the eyes of the Israel authorities. The panel notes that the claimant's husband was issued a passport on \"23\/08\/2011\" valid till \"22\/08\/2016\".20 It is reasonable to expect that the authorities on a balance of probability would not have issued him a passport approximately four years after the Sheliach was arrested noting that the claimant's place of birth on the passport indicates \"Colombia.\"21\n[43] In view of the cumulative effect of all of the above the panel finds the claimant's evidence regarding their fear of the authorities concluding that their conversion was false is not persuasive or credible, if nothing has happened so far, then there is no serious possibility in the future.\nDiscrimination amounting to persecution in Israel\n[44] The claimant's evidence indicates that they lived in an Arab area in Ramleh, and her eldest son attended a regular school near her house. She alleged that he was \"discriminated\" and beaten. The claimant did not report it to the police. She alleged that the neighbourhood was tough and even the police would not go there. The next academic year claimant transferred her eldest son to a Jewish religious school. The twins also attended the same school. The claimant alleged that at the Jewish school one of her sons mentioned Christmas and he was called a \"Goya\" a derogatory name for none Jews. The school had kosher food restriction and her sons could not take ham or milk to school. On one occasion when her son had mayonnaise on a chicken hot dog he was scolded and taken to the principal's office. Sometimes the Jewish kids would give them the sign of the cross from far away. Sometimes the minor claimants' lunches would be stolen by other students and they had nothing to eat. The claimant reported these to the principal. The principal told her \"that they were just kids\" and no one was punished. The panel finds that these allegations of discrimination when considered individually or collectively does not amount to persecution.\n[45] The claimant alleged that the Arab children outside of the school had knives. The Arab children threatened the children in the Jewish school. In 2011, the twins were beaten and the Rabbi from the school would escort the claimant's children to their home. However, the claimant did not report the incident to the police. The panel finds the single incident in 2011 does not amount to persecution absent seeking police protection.\n[46] The claimant alleged that the kids threw stones at her house; however, she did not report it to the police. The panel finds these action absent seeking police protection does not amount to persecution.\n[47] The claimant alleged that in 2011, she and two other girls worked as XXXX. They were accused of stealing money from the house they were XXXX. The owner of the house threatened the claimant and the other two girls to return the money or he was going to remove their finger nails and break their fingers. The claimant and the two other girls accompanied by the claimant's husband reported the threat to the police. At first the police laughed and did not take it seriously. The next day the owner of the house called and asked for his money to which the claimant told him they had not taken the money. He threatened them that he would report one of the girls who was on tourist visa to the immigration and threatened their lives. The claimant and the two girls went to a lawyer; who helped Jews returning to Israel and she told them to go to the police again and they should take their report. The claimant and her two friend returned to the police and the police took the report.\n[48] The panel finds the verbal threats and the failure of the police not to take them seriously on one occasion does not amount to persecution, noting that once a verbal threat was made to their lives the police took the report.\n[49] The panel has considered cumulatively all of the incidents of discrimination noted above and the verbal threats, and finds that even considered cumulatively it does not amount to persecution.\nReligion\n[50] The claimant's evidence indicates that she was baptised in Colombia, in XXXX XXXX XXXX, a year after her birth.22 The claimant testified that she converted to Judaism in 2007, in Colombia, so that they could travel and live in Israel. She testified that the minor claimants were also considered Jewish in Israel, explaining that when the father converts that conversion extends to his children.\n[51] The claimant alleged that she could not practice her Catholic faith in Israel. Because she did not want to lose their authorization to live in Israel. She testified at the hearing that she considers herself as Catholic and declared her religion and the minor claimants as Catholic in their PIFs.23 However, to date they have not renounced their Jewish religion formally. She testified that her conversion to Judaism was not an authentic one.\n[52] She also submitted Certificate of Baptism24 for the minor claimants indicating that they were baptized in Canada on 24 August 2014. She explained the reason the minor claimants were baptised in 2014 was because she wanted to have the whole family attend. The claimant was asked why the minor claimants were not baptized earlier date in Canada given that her family including her mother were in Canada. The claimant explained because she wanted everyone to be together and have a lovely party.\n[53] The panel does not accept her explanation as reasonable given that the minor claimants on a balance of probabilities could have been baptized in USA prior to 2007, or in Colombia in 2007, if the intention was to have the whole family to attend, prior to the claimant's husband learning that they could immigrate to Israel if they were to convert to Judaism.\n[54] The documentary evidence with respect to religious freedom in Israel25 states the following:\nAs underlined in the Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty, freedom of religion is an important facet of Israeli society, and consists of both the freedom of religion as well as the freedom to practice one's religion. Israeli Law guarantees freedom of worship and ensures access to holy places to members of all faiths. The Protection of Holy Places Law 5727-1967 safeguards all holy places from desecration and subjects violators to significant prison sentences.\n[55] The panel finds based on the evidence before it that the claimant's religious convictions are not deeply entrenched. The claimant chooses the religion that best suits their needs at a given time. The panel notes that the claimant freely chose to convert to Judaism and immigrate to Israel despite having been baptised as a catholic. Therefore, the panel finds it is insincere to say she was unable to practice her Catholic faith in Israel.\nRight of Aliyah\n[56] The claimant testified that when they entered Israel they were treated as Aliyah and like other returnees they were resettled in Ramleh, an Arab resettlement, because the government wanted to displace the Arabs. They were taken by the organization responsible for the returnees along with other returnees to get identity documents, open bank accounts and informed of the health program. The claimant's testimony inferred that they should not have been part of the returnee group because they had converted.\n[57] With respect to the right of return, the documentary evidence26 states the following:\nThe Law of Return 5710-1950 confers the \"right of aliyah\" stating that \"every Jew has the right to come to this country as an oleh\" (Israel 5 July 1950, 1). The law defines oleh as \"a Jew immigrating, into Israel\" and aliyah as the \"immigration of Jews\" into Israel... Amendment No. 2, 5730-1970, added in 1970, defines a Jew as \"a person who was born of a Jewish mother or has become converted to Judaism and who is not a member of another religion\".\nIn view of the Law of Return Law, the panel finds at the time the claimants entered Israel on the balance of probability as persons converted to Judaism were considered as returnees.\nMilitary\n[58] The claimant testified that she did not want her sons to undergo military service. That military service is mandatory as soon as they finish school and that a lot of young men died at the border while they were still kids. She testified that her children are very passive. Military personal are on the street with weapons. She testified that they do not want to serve in the military and therefore, they do not want to return to Israel. With respect to alternative service she stated that most young people who want to go to the university serve in the military.\n[59] The panel notes that military service is a law of general application. The documentary evidence indicates the following:\n\"The length and type of compulsory service is based on age on the date of first arrival in Israel, regardless of status at the time (tourist, temporary resident, new immigrant, etc.) and on family status on the date of induction. Medical profile is also taken into consideration. A stay in Israel as a tourist or temporary resident followed by two or more years away from Israel will usually not be counted in determining the date of first arrival.\"27\nWith respect to Conscientious Objectors the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Israel indicates the following:\n\"According to Article 36 of the Israeli Defense Service Law (Consolidated Version), 1986, the Minister of Defense has the authority to exempt or defer any soldier, women and men alike, from fulfilling his national army service for reasons that are listed in the law. These reasons may stem from educational requirements, security settlement, the national economical situation, extenuating family circumstances, or other reasons.\n...\nThe IDF will respect the views of a conscience objector, provided that it is satisfied that these views are genuine. To this end, a special military committee, headed by the IDF's Chief Recruitment Officer, or his deputy, hears the application of those who wish to be exempted from the army on the basis of conscience objection. Among the members of this committee are an officer with psychological training, a member of the IDF attorney's office and a civilian expert on conscience objection. (Israel 13 July 2005) War Resisters' International (WRI), an international network of \"antimilitarist\" organizations (WRI 8 Feb.2013), reports that Natan Blanc was sentenced for the fifth time on 21 January 2013, to 20 days imprisonment, for refusing military service based on conscientious objection (ibid. 22 Jan. 2013). His previous sentences, the first of which was on 20 November 2012 (ibid. 3 jan. 2013), were 10 days, 20 days, and 14 days twice.\"28\n[60] The panel notes the minor claimants have not reached the conscription age at the time of the hearing. Given the above objective reliable evidence the panel finds on the balance of probabilities the minor claimants have an avenue to seek exemption from military service in Israel once they reach the conscription age and wish to exercise their right not to serve in the military. Furthermore, the panel notes that the penalty meted out for those refusing to serve, is not excessive to rise to persecution.\nTerrorism\n[61] The claimant stated that she fears terrorism in Israel. Having considered the totality of the evidence the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities that the claimants would not be subjected personally to a risk to their life and\/or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment by the terrorists and that adequate state protection would be reasonably forthcoming. There is no credible evidence before the panel that claimants are specifically targeted by the terrorists. The panel is satisfied that this risk is not personalized risk rather a generalized risk. Consequently, on a balance of probabilities, the risk which the claimants may face in Israel is faced generally by the population of Israel. Based on the particular facts of this case, the panel is not satisfied that the claimants faced or will face a particularized risk of harm in accordance with section 97(1) of the IRPA.\nState Protection Israel\n[62] In the alternative the panel has also considered state protection.\n[63] Under Section 96 or 97(1) of IRPA, a claimant must show, on a balance of probabilities, that adequate state protection is not available. In assessing state protection, the Board is guided by a number of cases from the Supreme Court of Canada, the Federal Court, and the Federal Court of Appeal.\n\"There is a presumption that a state is capable of protecting its citizens except in situations where there is a complete breakdown. To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant must provide clear and convincing evidence of the state's inability to protect a national.\"29 \"While the effectiveness of the protection is a relevant consideration, the test is whether protection offered is adequate.\"30\n[64] The general jurisprudence suggests that a claimant must approach the state for protection.31 In the absence of a compelling explanation, a failure to pursue state protection opportunities within the claimant's home state will usually be fatal to a refugee claim.32\n[65] The burden of proof that rests on the claimant increases with the level of democracy in the state in question. The more democratic the state is, the more a claimant must do to exhaust the reasonable courses of action open to her to demonstrate that state protection was or would not be forthcoming.33\n[66] The panel notes that according to United States country report:\n\"Israel is a multiparty parliamentary democracy. Although it has no constitution, the parliament, the unicameral 120-member Knesset, has enacted a series of \"Basic Laws\" that enumerate fundamental rights. Certain fundamental laws, orders, and regulations legally depend on the existence of a \"state of emergency,\" which has been in effect since 1948. Under the Basic Laws, the Knesset has the power to dissolve the government and mandate elections. The nationwide Knesset elections in 2015, which were considered free and fair, resulted in a coalition government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nCivilian authorities maintained effective control over the security services.\"34\n[67] The panel finds in the circumstances the claimants sought state protection on two occasions when there was verbal threats against them. The police did not take the report on their first visit; however, on the second visit the police wrote a report. The panel notes with regards to all the other allegations they did not report the throwing of stone or the beatings to the police.\n[68] The panel finds the one occasion that the police did not take the report does not rebut the existence of the presumption of state protection.\"35\nClaim against the USA\nMinor claimants are also citizens of USA\n[69] The claimant alleged that if they were to return to the USA they would be put in foster home or detention. In support of the claimant's allegation counsel submitted news articles.36 The articles are regarding the children who were separated from their parents at the US\/ Mexico border and who tried to enter USA this year during the Trump administration.\n[70] The panel finds that the minor claimants' situation is different than those children described in the news articles. The minor claimants are holders of US passports.\n[71] The minor claimants have not established any nexus to a convention ground in the USA. In the PIFs no allegation of risk against USA was made.\n[72] The panel notes that the minor claimants have a XXXX year-old paternal cousin living in the USA. They also have half siblings all be it that they do not know them.\n[73] The panel will not address state protection in USA given that no nexus or allegation of risk has been brought against USA, a country of reference.\nCONCLUSION\n[74] The panel concludes that the claimants, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, also known as XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, and the minor claimants, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\n[75] XXXX, and XXXX XXXX, are not Convention refugees or a persons in need of protection.\n[76] Therefore, their claim for refugee protection is rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Fahimeh Mortazavi\"\nFahimeh Mortazavi\nJanuary 3, 2019\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended.\n2 Refugee Protection Division Rules (SOR\/2012-256).\n3 Ibid.\n4 Exhibit 10, Amended Notice of Intent to Intervene.\n5 Exhibit 1, Three (3) USA passports and one (1) Republic of Colombia passport.\n6 Exhibit 2, question 3, page 3.\n7 Exhibit 1, Three (3) Certificate of birth issued by State of Florida.\n8 Exhibit 1, Three (3) USA passports and birth certificates.\n9 Orelien, Joseph v.

At the time she came to Canada, on XXXX XXXX, 2012, she was almost XXXX years old.\n[4] In her lengthy PIF, the claimant indicated that she fears XXXX XXXX (also known as XXXX in the claimant's narrative update) because he wants her to be a prostitute and she does not want to do it. She fears that XXXX and his friends will harm her and her family. These friends include his brother XXXX and his friend XXXX.\n[5] In July of 2011, the claimant met XXXX in Miskolc, dated him for a week and then a month later moved in with him, as she did not have a good relationship with her parents. XXXX and the claimant stayed in various places and then rented a flat in Budapest, where they stayed for a week. The claimant did not work.\n[6] In November of 2011, XXXX told her he had money problems and wanted her to work as a XXXX on the streets. He slapped her when she refused, and for a week he kept her locked in the apartment.\n[7] After a week, XXXX took her to visit his friends, his family, and people in the business. He took her to buy clothes, and to get her hair and nails done. He would hit her when she continued to refuse to be a XXXX. He said that he would take her to Austria to work. He never left her side so she could not leave.\n[8] In early December, 2011 he took her to Austria. She worked in Vienna as a XXXX. They went back and forth between Hungary and Austria. They did not have a permanent address but stayed in motels. XXXX wore her down, threatened her, beat her several times, and put her on the streets to work.\n[9] The claimant tried to escape but she was unsuccessful. When she resisted working, she was beaten.\n[10] On January12, 2012, she tried to escape and he beat and raped her.\n[11] On February 2, 2012, she was allowed to call her mother but she was not free to talk as XXXX was there holding her neck. He threatened to hurt her family if she did not co-operate.\n[12] In May of 2012, she begged XXXX to allow her to go home. She threatened to inform the police if he did not let her go. He threatened to hurt her and her family if she went to the police.\n[13] On August 20, 2012, a XXXX named XXXX XXXX told the claimant that she knew what was going on. XXXX told her that she knew that XXXX beats her and that she feels sorry for her. XXXX said she would help her escape and instructed the claimant to save some money that she got from her customers. XXXX even mentioned escaping to Canada. XXXX said that she would pack the claimant a bag and get her a plane ticket and that she only had to repay her. The claimant kept some money for herself over a period of five days. XXXX was not suspicious because business was bad.\n[14] On September 29, 2012, she gave XXXX the money. XXXX gave her a suitcase and a plane ticket to Canada for XXXX XXXX, 2012.\n[15] The claimant and XXXX were in Dunasziget at the time. On XXXX XXXX, the claimant snuck out the back window and took a bus that XXXX had arranged to drive the claimant to the airport. The claimant then got on a plane and came to Canada.\n[16] The claimant does not think that if she had approached the police that they would have helped her.\nAmendment to PIF\n[17] The claimant recently married a Canadian citizen on XXXX XXXX, 2018; her husband is intending to sponsor her to Canada.\nNarrative update\n[18] On July 16, 2018, the claimant submitted a lengthy narrative update which contains new allegations. The following is a summary of the update:\n[19] The claimant states that she is of Roma ethnicity because her mother is Hungarian but her father is half Roma. They lived in the numbered streets in Miskolc, in the Roma ghetto, and was therefore identified as Roma by the Hungarians.\n[20] The claimant had a difficult childhood as her father was an alcoholic and he beat her mother. He also attempted suicide. Her parents divorced when she was eight or nine years old. Her mother remarried and the new stepfather also began to drink, beat her mother, and abused the claimant as well.\n[21] She attended a mixed school, but the Roma were segregated within the classroom. Racist kids chased and beat them after school. In grade 10 the claimant began skipping school as she was being discriminated against by the Hungarian students and neglected by the teachers. She was eventually expelled. She was unable to get a summer job because she was Roma.\n[22] She went to live with her father for a year to get away from home. When she lived in Budapest with Richard she tried at first to get a job but could not because of discrimination.\n[23] XXXX renewed her passport and helped her to leave Hungary. The claimant fears that if she returns to Hungary, XXXX would find her and hurt her because she managed to flee from him.\n[24] The claimant also fears that she would be harmed and abused and persecuted because of her Roma origins as thinks Prime Minister Orban wants a white Hungary.\nDETERMINATION\n[25] I find that the claimant has not satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, or, on a balance of probabilities, she would personally be subjected to a danger of torture, or a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment upon return to Hungary. Therefore, I find that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nISSUES\n[26] The determinative issues in this case are identity as a Roma and credibility.\nANALYSIS\n[27] In coming to my decision, I have considered the totality of the evidence, including the oral testimony and the documentary evidence submitted by the claimant. I also considered counsel's written submissions.\n[28] In conducting the hearing and in analysing this claim, I have considered the Chairman's Guideline 4 : Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.2 I also considered the Psychologist's Report,3 which will be discussed below.\nIdentity\n[29] The identity of the claimant as a national of Hungry is satisfactorily established by means of the certified true copy of her passport currently held by the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA).4\nThe Claimant's Roma Ethnicity\n[30] I find that the claimant has not established on a balance of probabilities that she is of Roma ethnicity. In response to question 1(g) on her Personal Information Form (PIF),5 where she is to indicate her nationality, ethnicity or tribe, the claimant indicated that she is Hungarian only. She failed to mention that she is Roma. In fact, in her whole narrative, the claimant does not mention that she is Roma nor does she express any fears of returning to Hungary because of her Roma ethnicity. She also does not indicate that being Roma had anything to do with her being forced into prostitution. She does not indicate in her PIF that XXXX, the man she was living with, and who allegedly forced her into prostitution was himself a Roma. Six years later, in her updated narrative she mentions that he was Roma too.6\n[31] The claimant could not verbalize how she would be identified by others as a Roma. She is light-skinned and has blue eyes. Her name is not Roma. The claimant testified that her family has no Roma traditions as they have assimilated. She did state that because her friends are mostly Roma, people would guess that she is also Roma, and that sometimes she wears a lot of jewellery and does her hair like her Roma friends.\n[32] Counsel submits that the claimant lived in a Roma ghetto. There is no evidence that this is so. In fact, the claimant testified that her mother, who is Hungarian, and not a Roma, was allowed to live in housing not meant for Roma. However, the claimant alleges that her XXXX-year old brother who is allegedly one quarter Roma, was told by authorities in a letter to his mother that he would have to move out when he reaches the age of 18. In her PIF, the claimant indicated that she lived in Miskolc, Hungary but attached no significance to her address in the numbered streets.\n[33] The claimant was given the opportunity to submit post-hearing, a letter her mother allegedly received from housing authorities with regard to her brother having to leave his mother's house when he turned 18. She did not submit the alleged letter, and she did not provide any explanation for not doing so.\n[34] The claimant signed the PIF attesting to the fact that the PIF is complete, true and correct. When asked if the PIF was translated back to her before she signed it, the claimant indicated that it was. Therefore, the claimant must have been aware that there was nothing in the PIF about her fears of returning to Hungary due to her alleged Roma ethnicity. The claimant blames her then counsel for not asking her questions about her Roma ethnicity. However, I note that on the PIF it is indicated that at the time the PIF was signed the claimant had very experienced immigration counsel. I find that if the claimant feared returning to Hungary because of her Roma ethnicity, such information would have been in her PIF.\n[35] I do not attach much weight to the narrative update, which stresses the negative experiences she suffered as a Roma child and teen. I find that if it were true, the claimant would have included them in the PIF, which she had declared was complete, true and correct.\n[36] Also, the claimant also did not submit any documentary evidence of her Roma identity, such as a letter from the Roma self-government in Miskolc or elsewhere. Also, she did not submit any documentary evidence from Roma friends or even her school records. She submitted no documentary evidence that she associates with any Roma in Canada.\n[37] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has not met her onus in establishing that she is Roma.\nCREDIBILITY\n[38] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true unless there is valid reason to doubt their veracity.7 I am cognizant of the difficulties faced by individuals in establishing their claims, including the cultural factors, the milieu of the hearing room, and the stress inherent in responding to the questions through an interpreter. I have also considered that it has been six years since the claimant made her claim. I have also considered the psychologist's report, which is discussed below as well as the Chairman's Guideline, noted above.\n[39] I find that the claimant did not give credible testimony in regard to the central elements of her claim.\n[40] In her PIF, the claimant indicated that she fears that XXXX XXXX would force her into prostitution again and would assault her and her family if she returns to Hungary.\n[41] It would be expected that the claimant would know and remember the name of her pimp and persecutor. At the hearing, when the claimant was asked XXXX last name, she testified that his last name was XXXX. When it was pointed out to the claimant that in her PIF she had indicated that XXXX name is XXXX XXXX, the claimant then stated that his full name is XXXX XXXX XXXX. I do not accept this explanation, as it would be unusual to include in a document someone's middle name as an identifier and not the last name. XXXX is also a last name and not normally a middle name.\n[42] When asked the last name of XXXX, the XXXX who allegedly was instrumental in helping the claimant escape the clutches of XXXX and help her come to Canada, the claimant testified that she never asked her what her last name was. When it was pointed out to her that in the PIF she indicated that her name was XXXX XXXX, the claimant at first had no explanation. She then stated that in the Hungarian version of her PIF it did not say that her name was XXXX. When reminded that she now speaks English well and she must have reviewed the PIF in English as she found a mistake in translation of the word \"flat\" when making her amendments, the claimant responded that she simply missed the error in the name, in that it indicated the name XXXX, when it should not have. It seems very peculiar and not credible, that she would have left out the name XXXX, from her persecutor's name and inserted the name XXXX in her rescuer's name, when she maintains that she never knew her last name.\n[43] There is also another discrepancy as to the name of XXXX brother, who was also involved in the prostitution ring and who lived with them at the summer house while the claimant was working as a XXXX in Vienna. When questioned as to who was watching the girls who belonged to the other XXXX and who stayed at the summer house, the claimant testified that the girls were being watched by XXXX and his brother, XXXX. When reminded that in her PIF she had indicated that XXXX brother's name was XXXX, and how nice he was, the claimant simply said that she remembered incorrectly. I do not find it credible that the claimant would have called XXXX XXXX, as they lived together for months and it appears that they interacted together, and the claimant had found him quite sympathetic to her situation.\n[44] I draw a negative inference from the claimant giving incomplete and inconsistent information as to the names of the three main characters in her story of alleged forced prostitution. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has not established that XXXX, his brother, and XXXX even existed nor that XXXX forced her into XXXX.\n[45] The claimant also gave evolving testimony as to her escape and her passport. The claimant was asked how XXXX helped her escape. The claimant stated that XXXX gave her advice to save money, bought her a plane ticket, and arranged for a bus to take her to the airport. When asked if there was anything else that XXXX did for her, the claimant stated that she did not do anything else, and that everything else she had to do herself. However, the claimant had previously testified that XXXX packed a suitcase and renewed the claimant's passport for her. In her PIF, the claimant had omitted that XXXX helped her get her passport renewed. The claimant explained that at the time she was composing the PIF, she was not asked the specifics as to how she got her passport.\n[46] The claimant testified that her old passport expired in 2008, but she always kept it with her as a form of an ID document, even when she was in Vienna. In the Claim for Refugee Protection Form (RPD), however, the claimant indicated that XXXX had taken away her documentation.8 She did not indicate, as would be expected, that he did not take away the primary form of documentation, which is her passport. The claimant was asked why XXXX did not take her passport away. The claimant testified that her backpack was torn and that the passport must have slipped behind the lining and XXXX did not find it. Later, the claimant testified that XXXX did not know that she had the passport with her. She testified that eventually she buried it in a small hole she dug with her foot while she was out smoking in the backyard of the summer house. Later, she retrieved the passport and gave it to XXXX to renew. She was able to get a photograph for the passport in a photo booth. She was apparently able to evade XXXX scrutiny to get away several times to meet XXXX and to go to a photo booth to get photographs.\n[47] The claimant gave inconsistent information as to why she could not get a job in Budapest. The claimant stated, in her narrative update, that while living in Budapest with XXXX she tried to get a job, but she could not because of discrimination. However, in her PIF the claimant indicated that she could not get a job in Budapest because she lacked education. She mentioned nothing about discrimination. I find that if the claimant had been suffering discrimination, she would have indicated so in her PIF. I draw a negative inference.\nPsychological report\n[48] I acknowledge the diagnosis from a professional which indicates post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety.\n[49] This is a very recent report, dated July 15, 2018. It appears it was done for the purposes of the hearing, as the claimant has not apparently received any mental health treatment prior to the hearing. Moreover, I find that the claimant was able to respond to questions in a cogent manner, taking into consideration her limited education, and the sensitivity of the nature of the questions posed to her.\n[50] I am guided by the Federal Court. In Rokni,9 the learned judge stated that a psychiatric report submitted as evidence \"cannot possibly serve as a cure-all for any and all deficiencies in a claimant's testimony.\" The court reiterated its position in Danailov,10 with respect to the assessment of a physician's evidence and the question of the assessment of credibility, it was stated \"that opinion evidence in only as valid as the truth of the facts on which it is based.\" I do not question the diagnosis stated by a professional in the field; however, the information relayed from the claimant to the psychologist may or may not be totally related to the causes described by the claimant in her evidence.\n[51] I conclude that, while the psychological report can be assigned some weight, it cannot attest to the credibility of the risk to the claimant, if she were to return to Hungary.\n[52] I further note that Justice Annis in Czesak11 has cautioned decision makers regarding the reliance upon forensic expert evidence obtained for the purpose of the litigation, unless it is subject to some form of validation, and without the opportunity of the decision-maker to assess the reliability of expert opinions under cross examination. Justice Annis concludes by stating:\nIn my view therefore, unless there is some means to corroborate either the neutrality or the lack of self-interest of the expert in relation to the litigation process, they generally should be accorded little weight.12\n[53] As I did not find the claimant credible, I assign little weight to the report as it is based on the claimant's self-reporting. The diagnosis may be correct, but the reasons behind it may be based on different factors than those in her PIF.\nCONCLUSION\n[54] I find that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n[55] The Refugee Protection Division rejects her claim.\n(signed)\n\"Rose Andrachuk\"\nRose Andrachuk\nJanuary 10, 2019\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, as amended, sections 96, 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b).\n2 Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution: Update, Guideline Issued by the Chairperson Pursuant to Section 65(3) of the Immigration Act, IRB, Ottawa, November 25, 1996, as continued in effect by the Chairperson on June 28, 2002, under the authority found in section 159(1)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n3 Exhibit 10, Claimant's Personal Documents, received July 16, 2018, at pp. 22-28.\n4 Exhibit 1, Package of information from the referring CBSA.\n5 Exhibit 2, Personal Information Form (PIF) TB2-13649, received December 3, 2012.\n6 Exhibit 10, Claimant's Personal Documents, received July 16, 2018, at p. 9, para. 25.\n7 Maldonado, Pedro Enrique Juarez v.

Pursuant to IRPA section 167(2) XXXX XXXX was designated the representative for the minor claimants.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimants rely on the allegations set out in the narrative portion of the principal claimant's Personal Information Form (PIF),2 as well as the subsequent amendment to that narrative.3 The principal claimant states that he was born in Osijek, Croatia. He states, that because they are ethnically Roma, they experienced severe discrimination and harassment in their native country.\n[4] In their narratives, the claimants cite several incidents that they say were pivotal, and which exemplify this discrimination and harassment in Croatia. The first incident occurred during the war between Serbia and Croatia. In 1991 Croatian soldiers entered the home of the principal claimant's family. The soldiers abused his parents, stole the family's money and kicked them out of the home, telling the family they should be living outside like animals. While the principal claimant's family were out of the home the soldiers not only destroyed its contents, they destroyed the home.\n[5] The principal claimant's mother complained to the commanding officer who ordered that the money be returned. It was, but not before the soldiers humiliated his parents in retaliation for reporting them to their commanding officer. A week later the principal claimant's family left Croatia. The family went to Austria, where he remembers they had temporary protected status. The principal claimant was nine years old when these events took place. When the war ended in Croatia, the family was told it had to leave Austria. He, his parents, and one sister went to live in Serbia. The principal claimant returned to Croatia in 2000, staying at the home of a family friend.\n[6] Upon returning to Croatia, the principal claimant obtained his Croatian citizenship, however, he had first to serve six months in the army. On leaving the army he had difficulty finding work. In his original narrative, he describes the problems he encountered in his job search. As employers refused to hire him, the principal claimant turned to collecting bottles and scrap that he then resold. When he was prevented from scavenging in the dumps, he turned to household bins. On several occasions garbage was dumped on him, while he was in a bin.\n[7] On one occasion a group of youths set upon the principal claimant as he left the grocery. They destroyed his groceries, and when he said he would call the police, the youths beat him. The police did not help.\n[8] In addition to his personal experiences, the principal claimant alleged that his son was treated badly in school and would come home crying. Talking to the school principal did not help, as he threatened to call the police and have him removed from the premises. When the female claimant tried to enroll their daughter in pre-school, she was told that the school did not have a place for her.\nISSUES\n[9] The issues that arise from the claimants' narrative are:\n* Identity and profile;\n* Credibility; and\n* State protection.\nIdentity and Profile\n[10] The panel finds that the claimants have satisfactorily established their personal identities and their identity as citizens of Croatia, because it had before it a number of identity documents that had been issued to the claimants by the government of Croatia. These include copies of their passports and national identity cards, for the adults, that were presented at the POE and which had been seized by CBSA.4 As well, Exhibit 9 contains copies of other identity documents, namely, Birth Certificates for all four claimants and the Croatian Citizenship certificates for the Principal Claimant, the mother, and the older child. The panel had no valid reason to doubt and reject the authenticity of these documents, and accepts them as establishing the claimants' identities.\nThe Claimants' Roma identity\n[11] In addition to self-identifying as Roma, the principal claimant testified that he and the other claimants are all Roma. The claimants also exhibited a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX, who stated that he had been a neighbour of the claimants for many years and was aware of the discrimination they faced from other neighbours because of their Roma ethnicity. The panel accepts XXXX XXXX letter as additional confirmation of the claimants' Roma ethnicity.\nCredibility\n[12] In RKL, the Court characterised credibility as the \"heartland\" of the IRB's jurisdiction. Outlining the law with respect to the credibility findings of the then Convention Refugee Determination Division (CRDD).5\n[7] The determination of an applicant's credibility is the heartland of the Board's jurisdiction. This Court has found that the Board has well-established expertise in the determination of questions of fact, particularly in the evaluation of the credibility and the subjective fear of persecution of an applicant: see Rahaman v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2000] F.C.J. No. 1800 at para. 38 (QL) (T.D.); and Cepeda-Gutierrez v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1998), 1998 CanLII 8667 (FC), 157 F.T.R. 35 at para. 14.\n[8] Moreover, it has been recognized and confirmed that, with respect to credibility and assessment of evidence, this Court may not substitute its decision for that of the Board when the applicant has failed to prove that the Board's decision was based on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it: see Akinlolu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1997] F.C.J. No. 296 at para. 14 (QL) (T.D.) (\"Akinlolu\"); Kanyai v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 FCT 850 (CanLII), [2002] F.C.J. No. 1124 at para. 9 (QL) (T.D.) (\"Kanyai\"); and the grounds for review set out in paragraph 18.1(4)(d) of the Federal Court Act.\n[9] Normally, the Board is entitled to conclude that an applicant is not credible because of implausibilities in his or her evidence as long as its inferences are not unreasonable and its reasons are set out in \"clear and unmistakable terms\": see Hilo v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1991), 130 N.R. 236 (F.C.A.); Aguebor v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1993), 160 N.R. 315 (F.C.A.) (\"Aguebor\"); Zhou v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1994] F.C.J. No. 1087 (QL) (C.A.); and Kanyai, supra, at para. 10.\n[10] Furthermore, the Board is entitled to make reasonable findings based on implausibilities, common sense and rationality: see Shahamati v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1994] F.C.J. No. 415 at para. 2 (QL) (C.A.); and Aguebor, supra, at para. 4. The Board may reject uncontradicted evidence if it is not consistent with the probabilities affecting the case as a whole, or where inconsistencies are found in the evidence: see Akinlolu, supra, at para. 13; and Kanyai, supra, at para. 11.\n[11] However, not every kind of inconsistency or implausibility in the applicant's evidence will reasonably support the Board's negative findings on overall credibility. It would not be proper for the Board to base its findings on extensive \"microscopic\" examination of issues irrelevant or peripheral to the applicant's claim: see Attakora v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), (1989), 99 N.R. 168 at para. 9 (F.C.A.) (\"Attakora\"); and Owusu-Ansah v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1989] F.C.J. No. 442 (QL) (C.A.) (\"Owusu-Ansah\"). In particular, where a claimant travels on false documents, destroys travel documents or lies about them upon arrival following an agent's instructions, it has been held to be peripheral and of very limited value to a determination of general credibility: see Attakora, supra; and Takhar v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] F.C.J. No. 240 at para. 14 (QL) (T.D.) (\"Takhar\").\n[13] In assessing the claimants' evidence and testimony, the panel found that crucial aspects of that testimony was not credible, which in turn cast doubt on the rest of their testimony. For example, there were significant differences between the statements the claimants made at the Port of Entry and their later written narratives, for which the claimants have not provided a satisfactory explanation. When the claimants applied for refugee protection, they were clear that they were under no threat of harm in Croatia. Box 42 of the application asks the question, \"who are you afraid of if you were to return to your country?\" The claimants \"Nobody\". Box 43 asks \"why are you asking for Canada's protection?\" to which the claimants responded \"I am not in danger in Croatia. My goal is to work in Canada because in Croatia we are seen differently because we are \"gypsies\". Therefore we cannot work and we cannot get employed, besides the employment problem in Croatia, everything is fine.\"\n[14] However, when the claimants completed their narrative and amended narrative, their story had changed considerably. The story had evolved from the position that they feared no one and were not in danger, to a claim that in Croatia they had been victims of systemic and serious discrimination from skinheads, neighbours, and nationalists, and had been in state protection. They also were claiming that they had to leave Croatia because of the discrimination and harassment white Croatians had subjected them to.\n[15] The panel gave the principal claimant the opportunity to explain the inconsistency between his statements at the Port of Entry (POE) and in the narratives. His counsel also addressed them when he questioned the claimants. The principal claimant's main response was that he could not remember what had happened at the POE. He stated that he had been \"under a big shock\". He then levelled the charge that the officer who interviewed him when he made his claim had acted improperly. He claimed that the officer threatened him with deportation back to Croatia if he did not sign papers. He alleged that but for the intervention of his sister and another officer, the interviewing officer's misconduct would likely have continued. In response to the panel, the principal claimant testified that he was only now complaining about the officer's conduct because he did not know that he could have done so.\n[16] The panel finds that the principal claimant's explanation for the inconsistency between the POE statements and the PIF narrative as amended is not satisfactory. While it is understandable, that a person newly arrived to Canada would feel some apprehension during the immigration interview, the panel finds that in the circumstances in which the claimants completed their applications for refugee protection, it is more likely than not that their initial statements were truthful.\n[17] The interview in which the claimants made the disputed statements, came two days after they arrived in Canada. By that time they had already gone through an initial interview and had been allowed to enter Canada. They had two days to compose themselves and, thus, were in a qualitatively different position from persons who make the application and are interviewed immediately upon their arrival. The panel concluded that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimants had been truthful when they said their lives were not in danger in Croatia.\n[18] The panel also considered and rejected the principal claimant's allegation, that the officer attempted to intimidate him and threatened him with deportation. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant was neither threatened nor intimidated as he claims. The panel comes to this conclusion because the documents that the claimants were being asked to sign were the standard immigration documents that all refugee claimants must sign. In the absence of a valid visa allowing them to enter Canada, which the claimants did not have, they would have had to perfect their applications for protection by signing them, or face the likely consequence of being refused entry into Canada. The panel concludes that the allegation was a last minute addition, designed to deflect from the principal claimant's inability to proffer a rational explanation for why he would state, initially, that he had come to Canada to work and there was no-one he feared in Croatia.\nThe Alleged acts of Persecution\nThe Soldiers\n[19] The principal claimant alleges that his troubles began during the war between Croatia and Serbia. As set out in the Allegations, the principal claimant's family had an encounter with Croatian soldiers in August 1991. The unpleasant incident saw the Croatian soldiers ejecting the family from their home, stealing their money, and destroying the home. The principal claimant states that the home remains unrepaired to this date. He alleged that it was this incident, and its aftermath, that prompted his parents to leave Croatia and take their family to Austria.\n[20] The panel finds no inherent contradiction in the principal claimant's story. However, as the alleged incidents took place in 1991, in the context of war, the panel finds that it is too remote to the principal claimant's later allegations of discrimination and harassment.\nThe Attack at the Bila Store\n[21] In addition to the general discrimination that all Roma appear to face in Croatia, namely, segregation and harassment at school, limited education and employment opportunity, and social exclusion, the claimants allege a number of specific acts of discrimination were directed against them. The principal claimant testified to an attack that occurred in 2008, in which a group of young skin heads attacked him. He testified that he had taken some bottles to the recycling depot of a large store, and was leaving with his groceries when the men set upon him. They questioned what he was doing at the store. They seized his bags and threw his purchases on the ground. When he threatened to call the police, the men beat him. They broke off the attack only after they thought he was dead. After they left, he hid behind a clump of bushes. He called the police and waited for them to arrive. Some thirty minutes later, the police did come but left without doing anything. The principal claimant testified that the police laughed and said \"gypsy business\" before leaving.\n[22] The panel had concerns about the principal claimant's account of the attack, which he described as taking place at 2:00 p.m. in the store's parking lot, and in full view of many passersby. He described a sustained attack that left him with a bloody mouth and bruised ribs. He stated he could hardly move. Yet he would remain on the scene for about half an hour. While the principal claimant described the bushes as large, about a metre and a half tall, and sketching out the size with his hands, the panel is not persuaded that in the circumstances the principal claimant would have remained on the scene.\n[23] The panel accepts that it is possible he did. However, the panel finds that in a situation where he was severely beaten by five young men, it was not probable that the principal claimant would have remained on site after the attack ended. The panel comes to this view because the principal claimant was attacked by five men, who he did not know. The men acted with impunity, careless of the presence of onlookers. Seemingly, they broke off their attack only when they thought he was dead. In the panel's view, it is not likely that the principal claimant would have remained on scene for half an hour or so after the men left, even if he had called the police as he alleged. The panel finds that it is more likely than not that the principal claimant would have salvaged such of his purchases as he could, and left the scene as quickly as possible.\n[24] Moreover, the principal claimant did not present any objective evidence of the attack. While his description of what happened with the police could explain why he did not have a police report, the panel was not persuaded by his explanation for why he did not have a medical report, because he claimed to have been beaten to the point where he could barely move. The panel infers that, if that were the case, the principal claimant would have been in severe pain and likely would have been concerned about the scope and effect of the injuries. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that he would have sought medical attention.\n[25] When asked, the principal claimant told the panel that he did not seek medical attention because he was not entitled to it. He elaborated, that upon returning to Croatia from Serbia in 2000 he was told he had to wait for five years before he would be covered, however, even after the five years had passed, he received no medical coverage. In light of the claimed severity of the injuries, the panel is not persuaded by the principal claimant's explanation. The panel finds it would have been reasonable for him to try to get medical attention, which he did not do. Therefore, taking all of the circumstances of the attack into consideration, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that it did not take place.\nThe Incident with the Neighbour\n[26] The claimants relate an incident where a neighbour confronted the principal claimant, while he and the minor claimants were on their way to the park. The neighbour shouted at them to leave the park. He also told the principal claimant that \"we should have killed all of you.\" XXXX XXXX refers to this incident in his letter.6 However, he gives a somewhat different version of events, stating that the neighbour became annoyed because the minor claimants were playing in front of the building. Unlike the principal claimant, XXXX XXXX alleges that the neighbour's abuse was both physical and psychological.\n[27] Even accepting that this incident did take place, the principal claimant testified that he, his family, his mother-in-law and XXXX XXXX were the only Roma persons who lived in the building. The principal claimant made a point of stating, that while other Roma lived in the vicinity, he and his family did not live with them. They lived apart from the local Roma community with his mother-in-law, and had done so for more than a decade. The claimants related no other significant incidents with their neighbours. While it was an ugly incident, the claimants continued to live in the building, or at least maintain it as their permanent address until they left Croatia. The panel finds that it is reasonable to expect that if the claimants were subjected to anti-Roma fuelled harassment from their neighbours, there would have been more than one such incident. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities that, the neighbour did react quite strongly and unpleasantly to the children's playing as XXXX XXXX states in his letter. Therefore, the panel is not persuaded that this one incident rose to the level of persecution. Accordingly, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the neighbours did not harass the claimants as they claimed.\nEmployment\n[28] The claimants alleged that the adults could not find suitable work, which forced the principal claimant into scavenging at dumps and in dumpsters. In her application for refugee protection, the female claimant stated that she had come to Canada to work. She said,\nI am not in danger in Croatia. My goal is to work in Canada, because in Croatia we are seen differently because we are \"gypsy\". Therefore, we cannot work and we cannot get employed. Besides the employment problem in Croatia everything else is fine.7\n[29] The principal claimant's work history sees him working at various jobs, both in and out of Croatia. He testified that the female claimant did not work, while she testified that she had been prevented from obtaining her high school certificate by the racist actions of a teacher who did not pass her in her Croatian language exam.\n[30] Even if the panel were to accept that the principal claimant had difficulty finding steady work in Croatia, the panel is not persuaded that the same is true of the adult female claimant. Her profession is given as \"XXXX XXXX\", in the police certificate she presented. These certificates were presented to the panel as genuine documents, upon which the panel could rely. Therefore, it is open to the panel to find that the document stands in clear contradiction of the claims of the female claimant, and undermines her overall credibility.\n[31] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that as indicated in her PIF,8 the female claimant did finish high school and that she did find work as a XXXX XXXX as stated in The Police certificate (criminal record check) that she presented. If this is not so, then the claimants have presented a false document to support their refugee claims. Either way, the panel finds that the credibility of their claims, regarding their inability to find employment in Croatia, is undermined.\nThe Minor Claimants\n[32] The claimants allege that their children did not escape anti-Roma discrimination. Their son XXXX attended school for one term, during which he was treated very poorly. He was beaten up, other students took his belongings and pushed him into the mud. The female claimant complained to his teacher, who said she could do little about the treatment of their son. Complaining to the school's principal was equally fruitless. He took the view that the school was doing them a favour by allowing XXXX to be enrolled. If true, these allegations would be clear instances where the claimant's son had fallen victim to anti-Roma discrimination.\n[33] Their daughter was denied a place in day care, even as a former classmate of the female claimant was accepted. Given that the claimants have been less than straightforward with regard to other aspects of their claim, the panel finds, that without objective evidence about Croatia's daycare policy and the alleged refusal to admit Lorena, it is unable to find that she was denied entry into daycare.\nDo the Claimants have a well-founded fear of Persecution?\n[34] The claimants allege that they have experienced anti-Roma discrimination and harassment in Croatia. They claim that because they are Roma they experience discrimination in schooling, and in finding employment. They experience virtually daily attacks from neighbours, skin heads, and \"Croatians\" generally, and that officials, whether at school or the police, take no action when these incidents are brought to their attention.\n[35] In light of the panel's credibility findings relating to the inconsistency between the claimant's POE statements and their PIF narratives; the principal's allegations regarding the attack at the Bila store and the incident with the neighbour; the female claimant's police clearance certificate and her education, the panel finds that the majority of the allegations and testimony are not reliable. The remaining allegations that the panel found credible, are the allegations that the house of the principal claimant's mother was damaged during the war; that the adult claimants and their son likely suffered discrimination and harassment at school, and that he has had difficulty finding permanent employment. However, the panel is not satisfied that the damage to his parents' house, and the discrimination the claimants experienced, have risen to the level of persecution.\n[36] First, the damage to the house occurred during the war, and according to the principal claimant, may have been linked to the fact that the family had come to Croatia from Serbia, and less to their Roma ethnicity.9 He claimed that during their invasion of the home, the soldiers mocked his father, asking him where his Serbian army uniform was hidden. Second, the discriminatory incidents at school are now too remote to weigh heavily in the assessment of the claimant's well-founded fear. Nor is it clear to the panel that the claimant's son was mistreated as alleged.\n[37] The panel does not dispute that the claimants have experienced some discrimination in Croatia, however, it finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants were truthful when they state in their application for refugee protection that their only concern was work. Therefore, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities, that there is insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence before it on which it could find that the claimants have a well-founded fear of persecution in Croatia.\nState Protection\n[38] The claimants allege that as Roma persons, state protection is not available to them. In Gonzalez Torres,10 Justice Zinn made the point that a state protection analysis is \"contextual\". According to Justice Zinn,\n[S]tate protection cannot be determined in a vacuum. When undertaking a contextual approach in determining whether the refugee claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection, many factors ought to be considered, including the following:\n* The nature of the human rights violation;\n* The profile of the alleged human rights abuser;\n* The efforts that the victim took to seek protection from authorities;\n* The response of the authorities to requests for their assistance, and\n* The available documentary evidence.\"\n[39] The other aspect of the state protection analysis, is the notion of well-founded fear. It is a prerequisite that claimants establish, by means of credible and trustworthy evidence, that their fear of persecution in the country claimed against is well-founded. Further, as the issue of state protection goes to the objective portion of the test for fear of persecution, it is not enough for a claimant to simply assert his or her subjective belief that protection is not available.11\n[40] The principal claimant cites the reaction of the police, in the Bila incident, as an instance where protection was denied. In regard to this incident, the panel found, on a balance of probabilities, that it did not take place. Therefore, the panel also finds that the allegation that the police laughed and said \"gypsy business\" before leaving, is also not credible and trustworthy.\n[41] In Sandy,12 the Federal Court (Trial Division) made it clear that.\nThe presumption that persecution will be likely and fear well founded only arises from the establishment of a claimant's subjective fear, 'if there is an absence of state protection' (Ward...). That is, proof of the state's inability to protect, or a presumption relating thereto, does not arise from a finding that the [claimant] has a subjective fear. The need to prove 'state inability to protect' is an additional requirement, and it relates to establishing the objective well-foundedness of the [claimant's] subjective fear.\n[42] In light of the fact that the panel has found that there is insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence before it to allow it to conclude that the claimants fear of persecution is well-founded, the panel finds that the objective portion of the test is also not made out.\n[43] On February 4, 2019 after the panel had completed, but before it had signed the decision and reasons, the panel was handed post hearing submissions in the form of a letter from the Canadian Centre for Victims of Torture, (CCVT). The submissions were unsolicited, however, counsel for the claimant took the position that the panel should consider them in its deliberations, as the letter from the CCVT touched on an issue on which the panel had questioned the principal claimant, namely, whether he had undergone counselling in Canada. The panel has had the opportunity of reading the letter from the CCVT. The panel finds that it adds nothing to its deliberation, but may well be detrimental to the claimants' cause. The relevant paragraph of the letter is paragraph three. This states,\nDuring the on-going counselling sessions, Mr, XXXX XXXX shared his concern of fear of the result of his hearing with IRB and returning back to his home country Croatia and \"again being physically and psychologically tortured\". He also worrying [sic] about his two children XXXX and XXXX because they are crying and afraid of returning back to their home country Croatia.13\n[44] It is important to note, that the principal claimant did not claim that he had been tortured either physically or psychologically. At the hearing, he did make reference to being \"psychologically ill-treated\", prompting the panel's question as to whether he had sought counselling. It emerged during the hearing that the \"psychological ill-treatment\" consisted of having garbage dumped on him as he rummaged through private dumpsters. Deliberate? Likely so. Unpleasant? Certainly. However, in all the circumstances of the case, the panel is not persuaded that the claimants have established that the principal claimant had been tortured physically and psychologically.\n[45] The panel accepts that the principal claimant would likely be apprehensive about the outcome of his hearing, but finds that this is to be expected. As for the claims that the minor claimants are crying and afraid of returning to Croatia, XXXX was XXXX years old and XXXX XXXX when they were brought to Canada. Given their relatively tender years at the time they came to Canada, the panel is not persuaded of the truth of this statement.\n[46] In the result, the panel finds that the letter from the CCTV undermines, rather than assists, the claimants' credibility.\nCONCLUSION\n[47] The claimants having failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the panel finds that they are not Convention refugees. For the same reason, the panel also finds that they are not persons in need of protection as defined by s. 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n(signed)\n\"H. Ross\"\nH.

An application was made to disjoin her and her daughter's claims from that of the foster family, which was denied on August 10, 2018. However, a second application was made to disjoin, which was allowed on August 16, 2018.3 An amended narrative was submitted.4\n[6] In my questioning and in rendering this decision, I have considered the Chairperson's Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.5\nALLEGATIONS\n[7] The allegations of the claimant are in her Personal Information Form (PIF): one with the foster family6 and her amended one.7\n[8] The claimant alleges she is an orphan who was adopted by Hungarian parents. She attended school but was transferred to specials-need school. She was pushed down the stairs in school. After elementary school, she went to vocational school to graduate as a XXXX, but did not get work. She alleges an incident in XXXX of 2007 when while she was travelling in a XXXX, she was kicked and suffered a broken tooth and her lip was bleeding; she got off the XXXX at the next XXXX. The claimant was able to buy a house with the help of the government, for she is an orphan. She alleges she was gang raped in XXXX 2011, while she was celebrating her XXXX in a XXXX but did not file a report. Two months later, she found out she was pregnant and she gave birth to her daughter XXXX. Her claim with her foster family was filed in 2012.8\n[9] In Canada, she met her common-law partner, XXXX XXXX who is a Canadian citizen, Roma and 29 years older than her in 2015. They are now living as common-law partners and as of XXXX 2017, she has a daughter with him.\nDETERMINATION\n[10] I find that the claimant is not a Convention refugee nor is she in need of protection. I find that the claimant has not established that there is a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground or that, on a balance of probabilities, she would be subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, upon return to her country and my reasons are as follows.\nANALYSIS\n[11] The determinative issue in this claim is credibility.\nIdentity\n[12] The claimant and her minor child's identities are established by way of the certified true copies of their Hungarian passports.9\n[13] Her Roma identity was established by a document from the Roma Community Center dated XXXX XXXX, 2018, and signed by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.10\nCredibility\n[14] In counsel's questioning, the claimant stated that she needed extra help at school, for she was slow in her studies; she was provided that help by the state. She also stated that she took XXXX course in Hungary, which was only added to her amended PIF.11 However, the psychologist's report12 mentions that she experienced XXXXdisabilities, but makes no mention of any XXXX issues. The panel is aware of the stress and the anxiety in testifying in the hearing room and gave the claimant the opportunity to explain the inconsistencies, with the assistance of a Hungarian interrupter.\n[15] There were many inconsistencies for which there were no reasonable explanation between her oral testimony and the evidence and documents that she presented. There was no persuasive evidence to explain the omissions between her Personal Information Form (PIF) and the supporting documents.\n[16] I am aware of the case law as it relates to credibility. However, even if one is to give the claimant the benefit of the doubt, there were serious credibility concerns as it relates to the claimant's testimony and the two incidents referred to in her PIF that happened in Hungary.\nIncident of 2007\/2008\n[17] The claimant was asked who she fears in Hungary. She testified that she fears her attackers - specifically, they are skinheads and a group. When asked which group they belonged to, she testified that they do not have a name, but they wear black clothing. When asked when they attacked her, she stated it was in XXXX 2007. In her original PIF,13 this particular incident was alleged to have taken place in XXXX 2008. In her amended PIF, she stated that this incident of being attacked on the XXXX and suffering a broken tooth and bloody lip, actually happened in 2007.14 When the panel pointed out to her that in the psychological report,15 she told the psychologist that the attack happened in 2008, the claimant stated there must be some mistake. When asked why the psychologist would state that, she stated it must be a mix up.\n[18] When asked if she filed a police report of that incident, the claimant stated: \"No, I did not.\" However, the panel noted that the psychologist states the following in the report: \"Ms. XXXX reported she eventually did inform her foster-mother what happened on the XXXX, and she was taken to the police station to give a report. She explained the case was closed because the perpetrators' identities were unknown.\"16\n[19] The claimant stated that she did not file a report. When asked to explain the inconsistency, she did not have an answer to that. I draw an adverse inference from the inconsistency and the lack of explanation.\nOmissions in her written\/oral\/psychological reports17\n[20] In her amended PIF, the claimant added that she was gang raped while she was celebrating her XXXX in XXXX 2011.18 When asked why this incident was not mentioned in her original PIF with her family, she testified that the family did not know about it.\n[21] When asked if she needed any medical assistance after the rape or if she reported the incident to the police, she testified that she did not. However, the panel pointed out to the claimant that the psychologist report on page 21 states: \"She explained she took herself to the hospital and then made a report to police.\"19 In response, the claimant stated that she did not go to the hospital or report it to the police. When asked why the psychologist would write that in the report presented to the Board, at this point, the counsel requested to take a break to speak to her client. A ten minute break was taken. When the hearing resumed, the claimant stated it is hard for her to talk about it.\n[22] It was pointed out to the claimant that the panel did not ask her to give details but only pointed out the inconsistencies in her written and oral testimony and the documents she presented. The claimant had no explanation.\n[23] These were the two main incidents in her PIF which had inconsistencies that were not explained. There was also no medical report presented of her alleged gang rape.\n[24] The counsel asked the claimant if she has spoken to anyone about the incidents and she replied she only spoke about it to the psychologist. She was also asked if she followed up the treatment recommended by the psychologist and if it helped her; she stated that she did not follow it and that it did not benefit her. When counsel asked her why not, she stated that she does not want to talk about it. The panel finds that the claimant has been here since April 2012 and the psychologist was only sought in 2018 for the letter is dated XXXX XXXX, 2018.20 Even after the psychological assessment, the claimant has not taken the advice of the psychologist. I find that the claimant's inconsistencies without any explanations, detracts from her credibility.\nChild born in Hungary\n[25] The panel asked the claimant why she kept a child that she alleges was conceived of rape, her explanation was that it was her first child and that she is against abortion. The panel is sensitive to the subject of rape, but the claimant's explanation does not make sense as to why she would keep a child who would remind her of being raped, unless that is not the case. She also stated that her family had no idea of her being raped. One would expect some medical documents and that her family would know about such a crime if, indeed, it took place.\nCommon-law Partner\n[26] When asked what the status of her common-law partner is, she stated that he is a Canadian citizen. When asked if there was a sponsorship on file for her, she stated that there is no sponsorship on file because she does not accept other peoples' help. When asked if she is living with him because they have a child together, she stated that she is not with him because he is a Canadian citizen. When asked why she is with him, she testified it is because she loves him. When asked why he would not sponsor her, or if they had talked about that, she answered that they have not talked about it. She further stated that \"he could sponsor me, but I will not like that.\" I find that the claimant is living with her common-law partner, as a family, and I do not find her statement to be reasonable.\nHer home in Hungary\n[27] The claimant stated that the state helped her to buy a home in Hungary. When asked what happened to that house, she stated that the government took it. When asked why they would take it, she stated it is because she owes money. When asked if she had any documents to show that her house was taken by the government, she said that the documents are in her home in Hungary. When asked what kind of documents, she stated they were just bills. When asked if she has any documents that she had a house which was taken by the government, she stated she did not have any documents. The panel draws an adverse inference from lack of any documents to show that, indeed, her house, which the state helped her buy, was taken away.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[28] While the documentary evidence of general country conditions of Roma in Hungary raises human rights concerns, the mere fact of being of Roma ethnicity in Hungary is not, in and of itself, sufficient to establish that an applicant faces more than a mere possibility of persecution upon return.21 Both subjective fear and objective fear are components in respect of a valid claim for refugee status.22 The applicant has a burden of establishing a link between the general documentary evidence and the applicant's specific circumstances.23\n[29] I find that not every Roma in Hungary has experienced what amounts to persecution. Each case must be decided on its own merits. In this regard, I find persuasive words of Justice Harrington in Varga: \"Each case turns on the particular history of the claimant, the record, the adequacy of the analysis by the Tribunal and, indeed, the appreciation of that evidence by various judges of this Court.\"24\n[30] Is there adequate state protection in Hungary in a forward looking manner? In Ruszo, Chief Justice Crampton of the Federal Court set out the law regarding state protection:25\nIt is settled law that absent a complete breakdown of state apparatus, it should be presumed that a state is capable of protecting its citizens.26 Moreover, \"the more democratic the state's institutions, the more the claimant must have done to exhaust all the courses of action open to him or her.\"27\n[31] In the case at hand, there were inconsistencies in the claimant's oral testimony and the documents she presented and she did not have a reasonable explanation for such discrepancies. On one hand, the claimant stated that she did not go to the police; however, on the other hand, the evidence she presented28 to the Board states that she sought medical help and went to the police. In her oral testimony, she maintained that she did not go to the police and instead chose to leave the country without seeking help. On one hand, in the psychological report, she states that the police could not do anything and \"the case was closed because the perpetrators' identities were unknown.\"29 Whereas in her oral testimony and written narratives, she stated that she did not seek protection.\n[32] Ward30 has established that the onus is on the claimant to produce clear and convincing evidence that the state cannot provide protection. The recent Federal Court of Appeal decision of Mudrak upheld the principle that the onus rests on the claimant to rebut the presumption of state protection.31 In this case, the claimant has not rebutted this presumption of state protection and the credibility concerns raised, further negates her claim.\nCONCLUSION\n[33] Having considered all of the evidence, I find that claimant has not established that she faces a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, or that, on a balance of probabilities, she would be subjected to a risk of life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture upon return to Hungary.\n[34] Therefore, this claim and that of the minor child are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Sarwanjit Randhawa\"\nSarwanjit Randhawa\nApril 5, 2019\nDate\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n2 Refugee Protection Division Rules (SOR\/2012-256), Rule 55.\n3 Exhibit 9, Disjoinder Application Result, dated XXXXX, 2018.\n4 Exhibit 7, Personal Information Form (PIF) Amendments and Documents, pp.1-17, received March 4, 2019.\n5 Chairperson's Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution: Update, Guideline Issued by the Chairperson Pursuant to section 65(3) of the Immigration Act, IRB, Ottawa, November 25, 1996, as continued in effect by the Chairperson on June 28, 2002, under the authority found in section 159(1)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n6 Exhibit 2, PIF - TB2-04527, received May 1, 2012; Exhibit 8, Amended PIF of Family, received May 3, 2013.\n7 Exhibit 7, PIF Amendments and Documents, pp.1-17, received March 4, 2019.\n8 Exhibit 1, Package of information from the referring CBSA\/CIC, received April 11, 2012.\n9 Ibid.\n10 Exhibit 7, PIF Amendments and Documents, p.18, received March 4, 2019.\n11 Ibid., p.8.\n12 Ibid., pp.19-23.\n13 Exhibit 2, PIF - TB2-04527, Narrative, para 38, received May 1, 2012.\n14 Exhibit 7, PIF Amendments and Documents, p.8, para 10, received March 4, 2019.\n15 Ibid., p.20.\n16 Ibid.\n17 Ibid., pp.19-23.\n18 Ibid., p.9, paras 16-18.\n19 Ibid., p.21.\n20 Ibid., pp.19-23.\n21 Csonka, Zoltan v.

Three months later, he made an inland refugee claim on December 17, 2003, at the Citizenship and Immigration (CIC) office in Montreal. On February 8, 2004, the respondent signed his Personal Information Form (PIF)1 affirming that the information he provided was complete, true and correct.\n[3] The principal claimant, in his PIF, listed himself as living with his 'common-law or same-sex partner.' He identified that partner as XXXX XXXX and listed the date they began living together as XXXX XXXX, 2003.2 In his narrative, the principal claimant provided that he and his same-sex partner, XXXX XXXX, had been in a romantic relationship since their teenage years. After multiple attempts by their families to keep the men apart, they both travelled to Canada separately to study. Once reunited in Canada, they resumed their relationship and when the principal claimant's father discovered that the couple was living together, he threatened the men and stopped providing financial assistance to the principal claimant.\n[4] After he was cut-off from his family financially, the principal claimant became concerned about what would happen to him if he was to return to India. The couple left Toronto and travelled to Montreal. They proceeded to make a decision to seek refugee protection in Canada. The couple's claims were heard jointly in Montreal on June 16, 2004, and they were given a positive decision on August 26, 2004, and were accepted as Convention refugees based on their sexual orientation.3\nTHE MINISTER'S APPLICATION\n[5] On May 9, 2014, the Minister made an application to vacate the refugee protection granted to the claimant, pursuant to section 109(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act4 and pursuant to Rule 57 of the previous Refugee Protection Division Rules. At the same time, the Minister disclosed the evidence to be relied upon to support the Application.\n[6] The Application is under section 109 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (\"the Act\"), which provides as follows:\n(1) The Refugee Protection Division may, on application by the Minister, vacate a decision to allow a claim for refugee protection, if it finds that the decision was obtained as a result of directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts relating to a relevant matter.\n(2) The Refugee Protection Division may reject the application if it is satisfied that other sufficient evidence was considered at the time of the first determination to justify refugee protection.\n(3) If the application is allowed, the claim of the person is deemed to be rejected and the decision that led to the conferral of refugee protection is nullified.\n[7] According to the Minister's evidence,5 the claimant misrepresented material facts relating to his sexuality, his relationship with XXXX XXXX and his fear of his father, if he were to return to India.\n[8] The Minister specifically alleges that the respondent and Mr. XXXX ended their relationship in 2005, shortly after applying for permanent residence in Canada on September 14, 2004, becoming a permanent resident a year later. The respondent then proceeded to rekindle his relationship with his parents, travelling back to India for his sister's wedding in 2006. He sponsored his parents to Canada on November 25, 2009, where he listed himself as having never been married and having never been in a common-law or conjugal relationship.\n[9] In 2011, the respondent returned to India and married his wife, XXXX XXXX XXXX. Six months later on June 2, 2011, he filed a family class sponsorship to bring his wife to Canada. On his spousal sponsorship application, the respondent lists XXXX XXXX as his former common-law partner, noting the couple began living together in XXXX of 2003, but did not provide a date for which the relationship ended.\n[10] The respondent and his wife were interviewed at the visa post in New Delhi on February 1, 2012. At that interview, the respondent denied having been in romantic relationship with XXXX XXXX, noting that he had never touched him and that the men were just friends. The respondent was asked by the visa officer to explain any difficulties he had in India while he was in a relationship with Mr. XXXX, he did not provide any answers.6\n[11] The Minister submitted that given the material misrepresentations about the romantic relationship between the claimants, the Refugee Protection Division should have rejected the respondent's claim for refugee protection.\nCredibility\n[12] Prior to the hearing held on November 5, 2018, the respondent was designated as a vulnerable person for the vacation proceedings. Counsel for the respondent asked for some accommodations, including the panel being alert to the psychological report from Dr. XXXX XXXX dated XXXX XXXX, 2018.7 The respondent testified through the assistance of a Punjabi interpreter at the hearing.\n[13] A claimant's sworn testimony is presumed truthful unless there are reasons to doubt the veracity of their allegations.8 The presumption of truthfulness is rebuttable and a claimant bears the burden of establishing their claim.9 In assessing credibility, the panel is mindful of the many difficulties faced by the claimant in establishing a claim, including nervousness, cultural factors, the setting of the hearing room, and the stress inherent in responding to questions through an interpreter.\n[14] In assessing credibility, the panel also took into consideration the respondent's mental health issues and level of education.10 In light of these symptoms detailed in the psychologist report, the panel rephrased questions as required during the proceeding. The panel is also mindful of the challenges faced by refugee claimants with diverse SOGIE in establishing their claims before the Board, including reluctance or difficulty in discussing their non-conformity with socially accepted SOGIE norms.11\n[15] After considering the respondent's evidence in its entirety, the panel finds that material aspects of it are not credible. In accordance with Guideline 9, the panel has considered whether cultural, psychological, or other barriers may reasonably explain these credibility concerns. However, after considering all of the evidence, the panel finds that there are material discrepancies between the respondent's testimony and the other documents in evidence that were not reasonably explained.\n[16] The respondent testified that he was indeed in a same-sex relationship with XXXX XXXX at the time he made his claim for refugee protection. He testified that it was after the couple applied for permanent residence, and while Mr. XXXX was working in the field of XXXX XXXX XXXX, that the respondent stated that he felt alone and his feelings changed for his partner. He stated that he spent a lot of time at the gurdwara and that he started seeing women and finding them attractive. He told his partner that his feelings had changed and the couple decided to split. XXXX XXXX, in a letter in support of the respondent, confirmed that the couple split in XXXX of 2015.12 After the couple split, the respondent testified that he contacted his parents and reconnected with his family. He stated that despite his family's previous persecution of him, that as long as he was no longer in a relationship with XXXX, they were willing to accept him back into the family. The respondent testified that at the time he made his claim for protection, he was with a man and therefore considered himself homosexual man, and now that he is married to a woman he considers himself a heterosexual man. He stated that he did not understand what bisexuality was at the time of his claim, and that he does not consider himself a bisexual man.\nANALYSIS\n[17] In the analysis of the minister's application the following factor or question had to be considered: Was there a misrepresentation or withholding of material facts and whether this misrepresentation related to a relevant matter?\n[18] While the panel accepts counsel for the respondent's argument, that sexuality is a fluid concept and that some 15 years later, the respondent cannot be expected to fit a specific or preconceived mould of what one thinks a homosexual or heterosexual man should look like, the difficulty the panel has with the respondent's evidence is its metamorphosis over time. The respondent has provided contradictory information, statements and testimony to immigration officials throughout the last 15 years. The panel finds that if an individual was to be telling the truth, that information would on a balance of probabilities, remain consistent. The panel finds that the respondent did misrepresent and withhold material facts.\n[19] The second consideration was whether those facts related to relevant matters. The panel finds that these misrepresentations do relate to relevant matters, specifically, sexuality-related persecution and well-founded fear under s. 96 of the IRPA and credibility under both sections 96 and 97(1) of the IRPA.\nThe Applications\n[20] The respondent made an application for permanent residence on September 14, 2004.13 The application was made for a single person, the respondent, failing to list the respondent's common-law partner, XXXX XXXX. The respondent was asked at the hearing why he and Mr.XXXX did not make a joint application for permanent residence. The respondent stated that he was advised by his legal representative that the couple was a week short of living together for a year, so the couple made separate applications for permanent residency. The panel asked the respondent why the couple would not wait a week, until they were considered common-law to submit the application, and his response was that he had never thought of that as an option and wanted to get his application in quickly.\n[21] The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that if the couple was in a genuine relationship at the time of their permanent residence application, they would have waited the additional week to make a joint application for permanent residence.\n[22] The respondent made an application to sponsor his parents for permanent residence on November 25, 2009.14 On the application, the respondent was asked to provide any common-law, conjugal partnerships or marriages. The respondent failed to declare his relationship with Mr. XXXX.\n[23] When questioned at the hearing as to why he failed to provide that information, the respondent failed to provide a reasonable answer. The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the respondent failed to declare his common-law relationship with XXXX XXXX on his parents' sponsorship application because the couple was never in a genuine relationship.\n[24] In 2011, the respondent married and proceeded to make an overseas spousal sponsorship for his wife on June 2, 2011.15 On the application, the respondent noted that he was in a previous common-law relationship with XXXX XXXX. Nothing the relationship began in XXXX of 2003, and listing no end date.\n[25] The couple was interviewed at New Delhi on February 1, 2012. During the interview, the respondent was asked about his relationship with XXXX XXXX. The respondent told the visa officer that he had a friendship with a Mr. XXXX, there was no physical relationship. He stated that he never \"touched him with a finger.\" He noted that when he and XXXX slept in the same bed, he made sure not to touch him.\n[26] The panel asked the respondent why, if the relationship between the men was genuine, he would not speak openly to the visa officer about it. The respondent testified that he was not expecting to respond to questions about his previous relationship with XXXX XXXX at the sponsorship interview in New Delhi, and was not emotionally prepared to do so. He stated that he only wanted to speak about his relationship with his wife and felt the relationship with Mr. XXXX was not relevant. The respondent stated that he also did not want to be honest with the visa officer, because he was a Punjabi-speaking male and he was embarrassed and ashamed, and did not want to be judged or have his previous relationship affect his wife's sponsorship. Counsel asked the respondent if he actually stated to the visa officer that he did not \"touch him with a finger.\" The respondent testified that he was unsure, but that he recalls answering a set of questions that required 'yes' or 'no' answers.\n[27] The panel asked the respondent if he was represented in any of his other immigration matters, he stated that he was. The panel asked if his legal representation were Punjabi-speaking males, and he confirmed that they were.\n[28] The panel notes that the visa officer provided an affidavit that he conducted the respondent's interview on February 1, 2012 in New Delhi.16 And that the notes found in GCMS are of the respondent's interview, and that those notes cannot be modified or deleted after the fact. He states that the notes are an accurate reflection of the interview. The panel finds that the visa officer has no motivation to misspeak the facts of the interview, or what was stated during, in the GCMS notes. The panel accepts the GCMS notes as an accurate reflection of what occurred during the interview in New Delhi.\n[29] The panel does not accept the respondent or counsel's explanation as to why he failed to describe the relationship between he and Mr. XXXX at his interview in New Delhi. The panel notes that the respondent had been represented by two Punjabi male lawyers during the course of his immigration matters. The panel also notes that later in the interview, the respondent contradicted his statements at the beginning of the interview, stating the men had feelings toward each other while in India. The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the respondent did make the statement that he and Mr. XXXX were not in a physical relationship, and that he failed to provide details of what troubles he had in India because of his relationship with XXXX, because the two men were never in a genuine relationship.\n[30] The panel notes that the respondent had to declare previous marriages or common-law partnerships in his sponsorship application, which would indicate that the information would be reviewed by the visa post. Furthermore, the panel notes that the respondent had XXXX XXXX provide a letter for his spouse's sponsorship application in 2011,17 stating that the men were a couple and at some point they split up, but remained roommates until 2005. If the respondent did not expect to answer questions about his relationship with Mr. XXXX, why would he have his ex-partner provide a letter providing detailed information about the relationship? The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the respondent was not surprised by the questions posed by the visa officer, but instead answering truthfully about his alleged relationship with XXXX XXXX and his troubles in India.\nMr. XXXX testimony\n[31] During the vacation hearing, the respondent testified that he and Mr. XXXX first had sexual relations while in India, when he was thirteen. Mr. XXXX XXXX testified on behalf of the respondent. He spoke of when the couple's relationship began and when it ended. The panel asked Mr. XXXX when the couple first had sex, and he testified that the couple were first intimate after they arrived in Canada in 2003, contradicting what the respondent had testified to.\n[32] The panel draws a negative credibility inference from the contradiction in the testimony of the two men. While the panel agrees with counsel for the respondent's counsel's submissions that there was no definition of what 'sex' was provided, the panel notes that neither of the men asked for clarification as to what the Minister or the panel meant by 'sex,' nor did they hesitate in providing a response. The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that both men knew what the Minister and panel were referring to, and did not require clarification. The panel finds that if in a genuine relationship, the men would have been able to consistently describe when they were first sexually intimate.\n[33] The panel notes that the respondent has not been consistent with the information he has provided immigration authorities since he filed his application for permanent residence in 2004. Information about his relationship with Mr. XXXX has been omitted, misstated or contradicted with each application, his interview and at the vacation hearing. The panel asked the respondent why she should find that he is telling the panel the truth, considering he has not been truthful to immigration officials before, and he stated that he was telling the truth to the panel and that it was easier because he was prepared for the questions that would be posed about his past relationship with XXXX at the hearing.\n[34] The panel finds that the respondent's credibility has been impugned by his previous statements to immigration officials, whether it be in documents or during an interview. The panel finds that the respondent has not dispelled the credibility concerns or the contradictions over the course of his immigration history, from the time of his refugee claim to his sponsorship application, during his vacation hearing. In fact, the panel finds that the respondent's testimony, and that of Mr. XXXX, lead to less clarity when it came to the couple's relationship, as neither men could give consistent testimony on when they first engaged in sex.\nSynopsis\n[35] The panel agrees with Minister's counsel and finds that the claimant did misrepresent material facts relating to relevant matters. Specifically, that the respondent benefitted by having his refugee claim accepted based on his sexual orientation as a gay man, and being in a relationship with XXXX XXXX. The panel has found on a balance of probabilities that the men were not in a genuine relationship, and that by alleging such a relationship, the respondent made a material misrepresentation with relation to a relevant matter.\n[36] The panel finds these misrepresentations material and significant. They seriously impugned the credibility of the respondent's allegations that he was persecuted in India.\n[37] The panel went on to consider if there was any remaining untainted evidence before it, from which it could conclude that the respondent could have received a positive determination. The Federal Court has held that the RPD cannot rely on country conditions alone to justify the granting of refugee protection as the claim must be personalized.18 The panel has canvassed the remaining evidence as it relates to the respondent's specific profile, its finds that there is no untainted evidence or specific profile that remains. Counsel for the respondent has not put forward any alternative profile for her client. The panel has reviewed the evidence and finds that, absent any particular circumstances or profile for the respondent, there is not more than a mere possibility for him as it relates to any potential risk.\n[38] Finally, the panel assessed the potential risk of return for the respondent as a failed asylum seeker being deported to India. Again, the documentary evidence reports that the Canada Border Services Agency does not disclose to the Indian government that a person had filed a refugee claim against India.19 According to the same report, a legal officer from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) stated that Indian nationals who return to India after having their asylum applications rejected did not have any problems if they returned with valid travel documents. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that there is insufficient evidence to support that the respondent would face any type of hardship at the time of his initial claim as a failed asylum seeker had he been returned to India\n[39] The Federal Court has also held that where there is no remaining credible evidence upon which a panel can make a positive determination that the person is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, it can be inferred that the person is not one.20 Given the misrepresentations that the respondent made, the panel finds that there is insufficient evidence which is untainted that could have supported a positive determination under s. 96 or s. 97 of IRPA.\n[40] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the Minister has satisfied the burden of establishing that the Application to Vacate the Convention refugee status for the respondent be allowed.\nCONCLUSION\n[41] In conclusion, it is the decision of this panel to vacate the decision to allow the claim for refugee protection, on the grounds that the decision was obtained as a result of the respondent directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts relating to relevant matters, and that there was not sufficient evidence remaining before the original decision maker to justify the granting of refugee protection to the respondent.\n[42] The decision to allow XXXX XXXX XXXX refugee protection is vacated, his claim is deemed to be rejected, and the decision that led to the conferral of refugee protection is nullified.\n(signed)\n\"K.

He received death threats in XXXX 2011, XXXX 2015 and XXXX 2015.\n[2] In XXXX 2016, the claimant received a death threat from a group of criminals known as [translation] \"the cannibal army\". He suspects that the threats came from a well-known criminal by the name of Jerry Bien-Aim\u00e9.\n[3] The claimant stated that he will not receive state protection and that he is not safe anywhere in Haiti.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[4] The claimant's identity was established by means of his Haitian passport,1 birth certificate,2 national identity card,3 driver's licence,4 XXXX XXXX5 and marriage certificate.6 The panel is satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, as to the claimant's identity and Haitian citizenship.\nCredibility\n[5] The claimant was a XXXX in Haiti. In XXXX 2016, a woman came to his office with a XXXX XXXX. The claimant immediately recognized that the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and needed to be XXXX to receive XXXX XXXX. However, the claimant did not have XXXX XXXX and could not XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX. The claimant told the woman to go to the XXXX XXXX of the closest XXXX.\n[6] Later that evening, an anonymous caller telephoned the claimant and chastised him for not XXXX the XXXX himself. Approximately eight weeks later, the claimant received anonymous death threats by telephone. These threats referred to the XXXX incident involving the XXXX XXXX. The claimant suspects that the threats were made by Jerry Bien-Aim\u00e9, the leader of a criminal gang in Haiti, as suggested by the claimant's friend, XXXX. The panel asked the claimant if there was a connection between the refusal and his fear of the criminal, Jerry Bien-Aim\u00e9. The panel had to ask the question three times before the claimant answered. The claimant was unable to show a connection between Bien-Aim\u00e9 and the failure to XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX 2016.\n[7] The claimant alleges a fear of a well-known criminal in Haiti by the name of Jerry Bien-Aim\u00e9. According to the claimant, Mr. Bien-Aim\u00e9 wanted the claimant to XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX 2016. The claimant stated that Mr. Bien-Aim\u00e9 had threatened him because he had refused to XXXX XXXX XXXX and that Mr. Bien-Aim\u00e9 had threatened him in XXXX 2016. The panel then asked him why Mr. Bien-Aim\u00e9 would have waited from XXXX until XXXX to threaten the claimant. If Mr. Bien-Aim\u00e9 is as powerful as the claimant says he is, it would be expected that he would act as quickly as possible rather than waiting two months to threaten the claimant. The claimant was unable to provide an explanation for the delay. This failure to provide a satisfactory explanation undermines the claimant's credibility.\n[8] The claimant could not say how XXXX knew who had made the threats. He did not provide a letter from XXXX to explain the reason for the threats. The claimant was unable to explain why Jerry Bien-Aim\u00e9 would have waited approximately eight weeks to object to the claimant's failure to XXXX XXXX XXXX for the XXXX. The claimant only had suspicions and speculated about the connection between the incident with the XXXX and Jerry Bien-Aim\u00e9. The lack of a connection between Bien-Aim\u00e9 and the anonymous threats undermines the claimant's credibility.\n[9] The claimant testified that he did not feel that he was in danger in Haiti prior to the XXXX 2016 incident. He did not come to Canada to claim permanent protection until July 2017.\n[10] The claimant fears what he calls the \"cannibal army\". He stated that it is a [translation] \"notorious group\" that existed when President Aristide was in power and that supported him. The claimant also stated that President Aristide was ousted in 2004. He stated that this group is active throughout Haiti. The claimant indicated that this group is particularly active in Gona\u00efves. He was unable to provide evidence that this group is active throughout Haiti. The panel draws a negative inference as to the claimant's credibility.\n[11] The claimant maintains that one of the reasons why he fears the cannibal army is that this criminal organization killed a XXXX in Haiti. He did not provide any evidence concerning this incident. The panel would expect that a claimant would provide any evidence available to him when making a claim for refugee protection. This lack of evidence undermines the claimant's credibility.\n[12] The claimant's testimony concerning Jerry Bien-Aim\u00e9 is speculative. The panel asked him why this was the case. This does not support the allegation of a fear of returning. The panel makes an adverse finding regarding the claimant's credibility.\nNEXUS TO THE CONVENTION\n[13] The claimant acknowledged that he is not being pursued or targeted in his country by reason of his race, religion, nationality or political opinion. He alleges that he is being pursued because he belongs to a particular social group, in this case, Haitian XXXX. The claimant accepts that not all XXXX are being pursued by the cannibal army. The claimant was unable to provide evidence that Haitian XXXX are a particular social group within the meaning of the Convention.\n[14] The only fact established by the claimant's testimony in this case is that he believed that he was threatened by Jerry Bien-Aim\u00e9. His statement about the source of this threat is purely speculative and has no probative value with respect to establishing that he was actually threatened by Bien-Aim\u00e9 or by the cannibal army. There is no evidence before the member that establishes that the claimant was threatened by the individuals he claims to fear.\n[15] Haitian XXXX do not constitute a group that is defined by an innate or unchangeable characteristic; nor are they a group whose members voluntarily associate for reasons so fundamental to their human dignity that they should not be forced to forsake the association; and, they are not a group associated by a former voluntary status, unalterable due to its historical permanence. The panel concludes that the particular social group referred to by counsel does not meet any of these three criteria. The claimant is not a member of a particular social group under the Convention.\n[16] The claimant is simply a victim of crime. Victims of crime, corruption or vendettas are generally unable to establish a nexus between their fear of persecution and a Convention ground.7\n[17] The claimant's testimony lacks credibility. The claimant's testimony is not credible or trustworthy.\nRisk analysis pursuant to subsection 97(1) of the Act\n[18] The claimant maintains that he is a person in need of protection because he faces a unique, personalized risk. The claimant stated that he is personally being persecuted because he refused to XXXX XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX and the leader of a criminal gang took issue with this.\n[19] In view of the claimant's credibility issues and the shortcomings in the evidence, the panel cannot conclude, on a balance of probabilities, that this claimant would be subjected to a risk to his life, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger of torture if he returned to his country.\nCONCLUSION\n[20] Having analyzed the evidence as a whole, the panel concludes that the claimant has not discharged his burden of establishing that he would face a \"serious possibility\" of persecution on one of the Convention grounds. He has also failed to demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that he would be personally subjected to a risk to his life, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture if he returned to Haiti.\n[21] For all these reasons, the panel determines that the claimant, XXXX XXXX, is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection and therefore rejects this claim for refugee protection.\n(signed)\n\"R.

He made one trip back to KSA in XXXX 2013, returned to the U.S. and made an asylum claim in the U.S. in XXXX 2013. He had had a credible basis interview in XXXX 2015 and his claim was forwarded for processing. His initial hearing, scheduled for XXXX 2016, was re-scheduled to XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017. When this hearing was postponed to XXXX 2017, the claimant, days after the postponed XXXX date of his hearing, left the U.S. and entered Canada, making a refugee claim at the Port of Entry. He alleges that he fears return to Syria due to his religion; Sunni Muslim. This was the reason given in his initial U.S. claim and in his initial interview and narrative in Canada. He later amended his narrative to include an allegation of a fear of persecution due to his sexual orientation. By way of explanation for this initial omission, the claimant alleged that he feared that his uncle would find out. He alleged that both the interpreter at the initial interview and the interpreter who assisted when he spoke with his first lawyer in Canada, were friends of his uncle. His uncle was the anchor relative whose presence in Canada allowed the claimant to make his claim here as an exception to the Safe Third Country Agreement between Canada and the United States. He also testified that he thought his lawyer had included the allegation regarding sexual orientation in his initial Canadian narrative. When asked by the panel if he had checked to see if it was included, the claimant gave, in the panel's view, seeing him testify in the hearing, a long and evasive answer before stating that he did not remember.\n[3]\nIn the claimant's BOC narrative and at the hearing, the claimant alleged that the 2016 election, and the anti-Muslim rhetoric of the incoming President, along with some incidents of harassment (i.e. being told to go back to where he came from and vandalism to his bicycle which he attributes to animus against him due to his religion) caused him to fear for his safety and his future in the U.S. He referred to a statement, made on Twitter at the time, by the Canadian Prime Minister about welcoming diversity, as part of his reasoning.\nIdentity\n[4] A certified copy of the claimant's current Syrian passport was included with the referral.3 This is sufficient to establish the claimant's identity and nationality.\nCredibility and Subjective Fear\n[5] With regard to subjective fear, in Kamana,4 Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer held that the panel's finding that the claimant had not credibly established the subjective element was reasonable and:\nThe lack of evidence going to the subjective element of the claim is a fatal flaw which in and of itself warrants dismissal of the claim, since both elements of the refugee definition - subjective and objective - must be met.\n[6] The claimant had been in the U.S. for almost four years before he came to Canada. By his own testimony, he was established there. He had an authorization which allowed him to work, he had friends there. He was represented by an attorney in his asylum claim. He reports that his attorney had initially advised him that his claim would be accepted but, with the change in administration, his attorney was uncertain. The claimant testified that he had not received a notice that he was being deported from the U.S. but feared he might in future. At the hearing, the panel clarified whether the claimant's U.S. attorney had told him of any actual change in the immigration and asylum laws in the U.S. The claimant said he had not but then went on to say that his attorney had told him that the Immigration Judge who would be hearing his claim always supports the current president. The panel asked how his attorney could know this but the claimant was unable to provide further information. The panel finds that this statement by the claimant was likely an embellishment and not true\n[7] The panel finds that the claimant has been less than forthcoming regarding his reasons for leaving the U.S., particularly in the context of his allegation regarding his sexual orientation. He reports that he lived openly as a gay man in the U.S. before coming to Canada but in Canada, he has to hide his orientation. The panel finds his allegations regarding his fear of being removed from the U.S. to Syria to be very speculative. While statements, including late night Tweets, made by the incoming President were concerning, there was no evidence before the panel that there had been any change in U.S. laws which would put the claimant at a reasonably foreseeable risk of removal. The claimant did not allege that there had been. His claim was proceeding. The claimant does not directly allege that his counsel advised him to abandon his claim and, in the absence of evidence, the panel will not speculate that he had. While his attorney may have told him the outcome was less certain, this is not adequate reason to abandon his claim before it was even heard. There is nothing in Canadian refugee law which would guarantee the outcome of any individual claim in this country; the Prime Minister's generic Tweet about offering protection to those fleeing persecution notwithstanding.\n[8] The panel finds that the claimant's actions amount to what is sometimes referred to as \"asylum shopping\". Canada's refugee system is not intended to facilitate entry into Canada of persons who would prefer to live in this country rather than in another one where they are already safe. In this case, the country the claimant left to make a refuge claim in Canada is one which Canada has, through bilateral agreement, recognized a safe county for refugee claimants.5 This fact cannot be ignored. The claimant had been in the U.S. long enough and had proceeded far enough along in his asylum claim that reasons more substantial than those he had given in this claim would have to exist before the panel could find that his actions, along with the credibility concerns referred to above, do not overcome the validity of the allegations on which the claimant has based his claim.\nCONCLUSION\n[9] The panel finds that the claimant has not met his onus of presenting credible evidence to establish his claim under s. 96 of the IRPA. While subjective fear is not explicitly included in s. 97(1) of the IRPA, the effect of the claimant's actions on his credibility leads the panel to find that he has not met the onus of establishing a claim under that section as well.\n(signed)\n\"D.

The claimant comes from a devout Ahmadi family and because of his beliefs he had problems at school where even the principal took no action against the abuse he sustained at the hands of some extremist minded students and teachers.\n[3] He also experienced problems at the hands of the orthodox extremists particularly when one leader called XXXX XXXX XXXX, from the extremist group called Khatm-e Nabuvat, registered a false FIR against him accusing him of preaching the Ahmadi faith. He was charged under section 298-C of the anti-Ahmadi law.\n[4] He fled to Indonesia where he lived for a year and a half. While in Indonesia, he obtained USA visitor's visa. He returned to Pakistan for 9 to 10 days before fleeing to the USA. In the USA he was given asylum. His asylum status was vacated because the US authorities found that he provided a false date of birth and a fraudulent police report. He decided to come to Canada after a deportation order was issued to him in the USA.\n[5] Details of the claimant's story can be found in his Basis of Claim (BOC) narrative.2\nANALYSIS\n[6] The determinative issue in this claim is the claimant's exclusion under Article 1F(b) of the United Nations Convention and subsection 170(e) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).3\n[7] The issue of exclusion under Article 1F(b) of the United Nations Convention and subsection 170(e) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act was raised by the panel at the hearing.\n[8] Article 1(F) reads in part as follows:\nThe provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any persons with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:\n(b) The claimant has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee\n[9] The United Nations Handbook4 defines \"serious crime\" as a capital crime or a grave punishable act. For the purpose of exclusion under I F(b), this serious crime to have been committed by an applicant \"outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee.\" The aim of this exclusion clause is to protect the community of the receiving country from the danger of admitting a refugee who has committed serious common crime. Exclusion in 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention is limited to \"serious crimes\" committed before entry into the state of refuge.5 In this case the state of refuge is Canada.\n[10] The Federal Court of Appeal has indicated, without explicitly deciding, that a serious non-political crime should be equated with one in which a maximum sentence of 10 years or more could have been imposed had the crime been committed in Canada. This approach has been characterized as \"sensible\" and has been followed in the Federal Court Trial Division.6\n[11] The claimant's actions in the USA fall within the ambit of Section 403 of the Criminal Code of Canada; that being Identity Fraud, as well as, Section 368: that being Use or Possession of Forged Document7.\n[12] The Federal Court of Canada has held that the proof of a claimant's identity is of central importance to his or her claim. In cases where the identity of the claimant is not proven, the claim must fail, and the Board need not pursue on analysis of the evidence in relation to other aspects of the claim.8\n[13] The claimant testified that his previous passport9 stated his date of birth to be XXXX XXXX XXXX 1972. He testified that was a false date of birth. That passport10 was given to him by his family at the airport before he left for Indonesia. He had a work permit in Indonesia where he lived for a year and a half before he returned to Pakistan to meet his family for about 9 to 10 days. While in Indonesia, he obtained his US visitor's visa.\n[14] As per his testimony, it is not plausible that the claimant noticed that the birth date in his previous passport was false before he finally fled to the USA from Pakistan since his father obtained that passport for him to enable him to escape from Pakistan where he was wanted for arrest by the Pakistani authorities. He used that passport to travel to Indonesia where he applied for his visitor's visa to USA. With the same passport he returned to Pakistan. His testimony that he was that passport to enable him to escape from Pakistan without being arrested by the Pakistani authorities on blasphemy charges against him confirms his knowledge of the false date of birth in the passport.\n[15] Therefore, based on the evidence adduced the panel finds that the claimant knew that his previous passport had false date of birth fraudulently obtained to enable him to escape from Pakistan without being arrested for the charges against him. It is not plausible that Pakistani authorities would have issued a genuine passport with a false date of birth particularly when the authorities had warrant of arrest against him. Therefore, the panel finds that the claimant had full knowledge that he was carrying a fraudulent passport with a false date of birth when he travelled to Indonesia.\n[16] The claimant testified that he arrived in the USA in XXXX of 2001 and he applied for asylum in the USA in December of 2001 after his USA visitor's visa had expired. He lived illegally in the USA for a short period of time before he applied for asylum in the USA.\n[17] The authorities in USA approved his asylum claim based on the information in his previous passport (No. XXXX) containing his false date of birth (XXXX XXXX, 1972).11 Additionally, in his arrival\/Departure Form I-94 under which he was admitted in the USA he stated his date of birth to be XXXX XXXX XXXX 1972, which was his false date of birth. Also, at his interview on March 16, 2016, when he applied for the non-immigrant visa in Jakarta, the claimant stated that he had never used any other names or identities for any reason12 when he had used his false date of birth.\n[18] Since the panel finds13 that the claimant had knowledge of the fraudulent passport containing false date of birth he was carrying at the time he left Pakistan to travel to Indonesia, he knowingly mislead the authorities in the USA, where he was seeking protection, into believing that his date of birth was XXXX XXXX, 1972 which was false. It is expected of the claimant to inform the authorities of the country, USA in this case, at the time of his entry as to why he had to carry a fraudulent passport that contained a false date of birth and was escaping arrest in Pakistan. He did not. He continued misleading the authorities in the USA into believing he was born on XXXX XXXX XXXX 1972, as stated in his previous passport.\n[19] The claimant was granted asylum on September 25, 2002, based on the information he had given to the authorities in the USA.14 Subsequently, on August 24, 2004, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) determined that the evidence the claimant had provided for his asylum claim was fraudulent. An overseas investigation revealed that the police reports purportedly issued by the Police Station Civil Line in Lahore, Pakistan [FIR No. XXXX, dated XXXX 2004 and FIR No. XXXX, dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2004] were fabricated. Accordingly, the overseas investigation reported that the claimant was wanted by the police in Lahore for the offences listed on the FIRs. When the claimant could not be found, he was declared to be a \"proclaimed offender by the Court of competent jurisdiction ....\"15\n[20] Based on the evidence adduced, the panel finds that the claimant was given the USA visitor's visa in Indonesia and was granted asylum in the USA based on the information, including false date of birth he had provided. Therefore, knowingly, the claimant misrepresented his identity when he applied for his USA visitor's visa (non-immigrant visa) in Indonesia, when he entered the USA from Pakistan and when he filed his asylum claim. It is expected of the claimant fleeing persecution from his country of birth to provide truthful information when he entered the USA and when he applied for asylum. The claimant did not in this case.\n[21] After the USA authorities found that the claimant has used a false identity and provided them false FIRs, on April 10, 2006, the Immigration Judge in the USA vacated the grant of political asylum and he was granted withholding of removal status. From September 25, 2002, when he was granted asylum until April 10, 2006, the claimant lived and worked in the USA having access to all social benefits and protection from the USA authorities.\n[22] At the hearing in Canada the claimant provided his new passport and his birth certificate both of which indicate his name to be XXXX XXXX XXXX and his date of birth to be XXXX XXXX, 1980.\n[23] There is no persuasive documentary evidence before the panel to indicate that the claimant provided explanation to the USA authorities as to why he used a false date of birth when he obtained his visitor's visa in Indonesia, upon his entry into USA when he submitted I-94 Arrival\/Departure Form at the port of entry in the USA. As a result, the USCIS found him to have misrepresented himself at the port of entry in the US under assumed identity.16\n[24] Based on the documentary evidence17 from an independent and a reliable source, the panel finds that the claimant used the false date of birth (XXXX XXXX, 1972) to obtain his US visitor's visa in Indonesia and upon entry in the USA in the Form I-94 without providing any explanation as to why he had to do that.\n[25] The USCIS Decision18 indicates that the claimant had provided fraudulent FIR.19 An overseas investigation revealed that the police report purportedly issued by the Police Station Civil Line in Lahore Pakistan was fabricated and as a result the panel disbelieves that the claimant was ever charged under s. 298(c) as alleged.\n[26] Using that fraudulent FIR,20 the Decision21 indicates, the claimant had obtained asylum status in the USA which was later vacated when the USCIS found that the claimant had provided a fraudulent FIR.22 Providing false documents is a crime in Canada punishable under s. 366(1) of the Criminal Act. The offence the claimant committed in the USA is indictable and the claimant is liable for an imprisonment of not more than 10 years.\n[27] The claimant also gave a different date of birth, that being XXXX XXXX XXXX 1980, when he applied for asylum and change of status in the USA.23 He used XXXX XXXX XXXX 1972, as his date of birth when he applied for the USA visitor's visa in Indonesia and I-94 Arrival\/Departure form when he entered the USA. At his interview in the USA on March 16, 2016, he stated that he applied for the non-immigrant visa in Jakarta and had never used other names or identities for any reason.\n[28] At the March 16, 2016 interview the claimant indicated that he had previously applied for political asylum and the court proceedings were terminated. He indicated that the I-485 application he filed on July 5, 2013, was his first and only application for permanent residence. He failed to disclose that he had previously applied for permanent residence and failed to disclose the circumstances surrounding the Immigration Judge's decision to vacate the grant of political asylum. Misrepresentation of identity is a criminal offence under s. 403(1) of the Criminal Act in Canada and punishment for that crime is imprisonment for a term not more than 10 years.24\n[29] The claimant's counsel pointed out that the FIR25 the claimant had provided was found to be fabricated. She indicated that the USCIS found that the claimant was wanted by the police in Lahore for offences listed on the subsequent FIRs26 he had provided. When the police failed to find and arrest the claimant, he was declared as a \"proclaimed offender\" by the Court of competent jurisdiction.\n[30] The subsequent FIRs27 the claimant provided indicate that he was charged under s.506 P.P.C. which his counsel mentioned was the threats he had issued to kill a resident of Lahore. The police had been seeking the claimant's whereabouts to arrest him for those charges, but have not been successful and there is no documentary evidence to indicate the outcome of these charges after the claimant left Pakistan.\n[31] Therefore, without any documentary evidence to indicate withdrawal of the aforementioned charges or the claimant's acquittal of those charges, the claimant has not persuasively established that he had not issued any death threats to the individual in question in Lahore. The court document28 indicates that there is a pending charge against the claimant which has not been resolved to date. As a result, without the claimant's acquittal or withdrawal of the aforementioned charges, the panel does not find that the claimant had not issued threats to kill to the person mentioned on the court document29 he provided.\n[32] Based on the evidence adduced, the panel finds that the claimant's actions in Pakistan and the USA each constitute \"serious non-political crimes\" and the equivalent offence in Canada for each of the aforementioned crimes is punishable by a maximum of 10 years imprisonment term.30\n[33] Chief Justice McLachlin stated:\n...While consideration of whether a maximum sentence of ten years or more could have been imposed had the crime been committed in Canada is a useful guideline, and crimes attracting a maximum sentence of ten years or more in Canada will generally be sufficiently serious to warrant exclusion, the ten-year rule should not be applied in a mechanistic, decontextualized, or unjust manner.31\n[34] The Supreme Court of Canada observed, in Ezokola,32 that the test for exclusion \"must reflect the role of the Board and must work within the practical realities of refugee proceedings\" (para 37). An RPD hearing is \"not a criminal trial .... the Board makes exclusion determinations; it does not determine guilt or innocence\" (para 38 and para 101), \" .... it is intended to be less formal than a criminal trial and more expeditious\" (para 39).\n[35] There is no persuasive evidence to suggest that the claimant was motivated by a political goal to have used the aforementioned false identities and fraudulent police report. Since the claimant used false identity and provided fraudulent FIR in the USA for more than a year, he has committed \"serious non-political crimes\" and the equivalent offence in Canada for each of those crimes is punishable by a maximum of 10 years imprisonment term.33 The offences the claimant committed \"were serious within the meaning of Article 1F(b)\"34 of the Convention.\n[36] In Jayasekara,35 in order to rebut the presumption of \"seriousness\" of the crime the claimant is required to demonstrate with respect to the element of the crime, the mode of prosecution, the penalty prescribed and the facts and the mitigating and aggravated circumstances underlying the conviction, as to why exclusion should not apply to him\/her.\n[37] There are no mitigating circumstances underlying the claimant's criminal activities. He was not a minor, he was not motivated by political gain and there is no persuasive evidence to suggest that he was under duress or had any psychological problems.\n[38] Section 133 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act36 does not apply as a defence for the claimant's serious criminality. The Federal Court has stated that, \"section 133 of the IRPA only prevents charging an individual with an offence it does not legalize the use of false identification.\"37 There is no documentary evidence from the USCIS explaining why the claimant used false date of birth while obtaining his US visitor's visa in Indonesia and upon his entry into USA. Since there are pending charges against him in Pakistan, not related to blasphemy, and those charges have not been withdrawn nor has he been acquitted, the panel finds that the claimant is fleeing Pakistan for prosecution and not religious persecution.\n[39] Therefore, based on the evidence adduced, guided by the Federal Court case of Durango38 the panel finds that Section 133 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act not to be a mitigating factor in this case.\n[40] The claimant confirmed that he was represented by a legal counsel in the USA and there is no persuasive documentary evidence to suggest that that counsel did not represent the claimant professionally as well as there is no persuasive documentary evidence to suggest that he did not receive enough time and or fair opportunities to inform the authorities in the USA about his true identity and to inform the authorities his reasons for having provided a fraudulent FIR39 which he used to obtain asylum fraudulently.\n[41] In regards to the elements of the crime, at the hearing, the claimant admitted that he used false date of birth in his previous passport with which he successfully entered the USA in XXXX 2001. He had ample time in the USA to inform the authorities why he had to use false date of birth in his previous passport. He obtained his visitor's visa in Indonesia and his entry into the USA by misrepresenting himself, by providing a false date of birth. He also provided fraudulent police report when he was never charged for blasphemy.40 Also, there is no persuasive evidence to suggest he was not in a proper frame of mind while he was in Pakistan and in the USA. His father obtained a passport with a different date of birth to avoid the claimant from being arrested for the crimes he was accused of committing.\n[42] In regards to the mode of prosecution, there is no persuasive evidence to suggest that the claimant did not have the benefit of a counsel or that he received an unfair interviews or hearings in the USA. His refugee status was vacated41 by the USA authorities on April 10, 2006, for using false identity and for providing fraudulent FIR.42 There is also no persuasive evidence to suggest that the claimant was innocent and that his asylum status was revoked in error. Therefore, the panel finds that the punishment he received for using false identity and fraudulent FIR was fair and judicious since he used false identity while he was an adult [he was over 18 years old].\n[43] The sentences received by the claimant cannot be construed to be lenient or as undermining the presumption of seriousness attached to his crimes. His asylum status was terminated and he had no chance to appeal that decision. He was given deportation order since the USA considered his offences serious.\n[44] In Jayasekara,43 Honourable Justice Letourneau states:\n[.....] I agree with counsel for the respondent that, if under Article 1F(b) of the Convention the length or completion of a sentence imposed is to be considered, it should not be considered in isolation. There are many reasons why a lenient sentence may actually be imposed even for a serious crime.\n[45] Guided by the above case law, the panel does not find that the punishment the claimant received in this case was not serious, given he lost his status in the USA and received deportation order.\nCONCLUSION\n[46] Therefore, based on the totality of the evidence adduced, the panel finds that the claimant has committed serious non-political crimes in the USA at the time he was an adult and in the right frame of mind. The panel finds that the claimant is a criminal and individuals like the claimant who have committed serious non-political crimes outside Canada do not deserve refugee protection in Canada.\n[47] Therefore, based on punishment given to individuals like the claimant for identity fraud and providing fraudulent documentary evidence, and guided by the case law,44 the panel finds that the claimant in this case is excludable, since he falls within the parameters of Article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention.\n[48] Accordingly, the Refugee Protection Division excludes XXXX XXXX XXXX for refugee protection in Canada.\n(signed)\n\"S.

They seek refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1 The PC was appointed the designated representative for his son, the minor claimant. The claimants all adopted the PC's narrative for their claim.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The PC alleges the following.\n[3] In 1989, the Indian army (the IPKF) took control of XXXX and the area around it where he was living. Together with other Tamil youths, the PC was arrested, questioned and beaten, and accused of being a member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). To escape the IPKF, the PC and his family fled to XXXX, which was controlled by the LTTE. In Vanni, he was forced to dig bunkers and collect food parcels for the LTTE. He also had to farm and to contribute 25% of his yield to the LTTE.\n[4] During the period 1990-1992, the CC was living in XXXX where she was constantly pressured to join the LTTE. Her parents subsequently paid a large sum to the LTTE to prevent her conscription. Later, after the family fled to XXXX, she was forced by the LTTE to fill sandbags for sentries. The CC and the PC married in 2004 and their son, the minor claimant, was born in XXXX in 2007.\n[5] In XXXX 2009, the PC surrendered to the Sri Lankan army and was taken to a refugee camp where he was questioned and beaten after being suspected of connections to the LTTE. When the CC arrived at the refugee camp where the PC was being held, in XXXX 2009, members of the army attempted to rape her, but an officer rescued her.\n[6] After obtaining assistance from a priest, the PC was released, but not before he was questioned and threatened with severe punishment, if he supported the LTTE. Following the PC's release, the claimants moved to XXXX. While there, they were approached in XXXX 2009 by members of the Eelam People's Democratic Party (EPDP) who urged them to vote for them in the municipal election or face serious consequences. When the EPDP realized that the PC was related to one of the opposing candidates, he was abducted in a white van. The PC was then taken to a house where he was questioned and threatened not to vote for his relative. He was told that if he ignored their warning, he would be abducted again and not be released.\n[7] In August 2010 during the Parliamentary elections, most people voted for the Tamil National Party, angering the EPDP. During the first week of XXXX 2010, the PC was abducted in a white van. Three days later, he was instructed to call his wife, the CC, and tell her to bring 15 Lakhs rupees (approximately 11,000 CAD). The men threatened to kill the PC, if she did not produce the money. She asked for an extension of at least one day, and the following day one of the men came to the claimants' home and collected 5 Lakhs rupees. The CC was told to obtain the outstanding amount or face death. She asked for a month's extension, and after consulting with their family, the claimants left the Sri Lanka on XXXX XXXX, 2010 without paying the outstanding amount. The claimants arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2011, after travelling through several countries, including the United States (US).\nDETERMINATION\n[8] The panel finds that the claimants are neither Convention refugees in accordance with section 96 nor persons in need of protection in accordance with section 97(1) (a) and (b) of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\n[9] The key issues in this case are credibility, whether the claimants have a well-founded fear of persecution, and whether Colombo is a viable internal flight alternative.\nIdentity\n[10] The claimants provided copies of their birth certificates2 and National Identity Cards3 in support of their identity. The panel is persuaded, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants are who they claim to be and they are citizens of Sri Lanka.\nCredibility\n[11] The PC has stated in his Personal Information Form (PIF)4 narrative that after moving to XXXX with his family, he was abducted on two occasions by the EPDP: in XXXX 2009 and in XXXX 2010. His testimony in regard to these two alleged incidents was confusing and inconsistent. Initially, when testifying about the 2009 incident, he indicated that he had been abducted, that he had beaten and threatened, and that a ransom had been demanded. It was pointed out to the PC that his PIF narrative regarding the 2009 abduction made no mention of being beaten or of a ransom being demanded. In fact, according to his PIF narrative, the ransom demand of 15 lakh rupees was not made until the second abduction in XXXX 2010. The PC was also informed that his PIF narrative stated that during the 2009 abduction he was warned not to vote for a relative who was an opposing candidate. He was asked why he had made no mention, in his testimony, of the 2009 abduction and of having a relative who was an opposing candidate. After being made aware of his omissions and inconsistencies, the PC changed his testimony to reflect what had been written in his PIF narrative. The PC, however, provided no explanation as to the inconsistencies and omissions in his initial testimony. The panel draws a negative inference with respect to the PC's credibility.\n[12] The PC's testimony regarding his alleged 2010 abduction was also confusing and inconsistent, both with his PIF narrative and the CC's testimony. The PC's narrative states:\nAfter 3 days they gave me a phone and instructed me to tell my wife to come with 15 Lakhs rupees. She first asked about my health. One man snatched my phone and warned my wife that I would be killed if the money was not paid. She asked for at least a day to borrow some money. Next day one of them went to my house and brought 5 Lakhs rupees.5\nIn contrast to his narrative, the PC testified that the CC had come with the 5 Lakhs rupees to where he was being held during his abduction, and not that one of the abductors had gone to his house and received the 5 Lakhs rupees from the CC. When asked about the incident, the CC testified that, in fact, one of the abductors had come for the money at their home, as had been stated in the PC's PIF narrative. She attempted to explain why the PC's testimony differed from his written narrative by saying that she had only told him about the incident later. The panel, however, finds that the CC's explanation does not make sense. According to the PC's testimony, he witnessed her coming with the money to the location where he was being held. His PIF narrative, however, states that one of the abductors went to his home to get the money. Again, the panel finds the inconsistency indicative of a lack of credibility with respect to the PC's story. The panel notes that all three claimants have relied on the PC's narrative, which now appears to be unreliable.\n[13] In written submissions, the claimant's counsel acknowledged the difficulty with the PC's testimony, in contrast with the CC's more consistent testimony. Counsel submits that the CC was directly involved in the transaction with the EPDP while the PC was detained, which explains why her testimony was more consistent with the PIF narrative than the PC's testimony. Counsel also notes that the claimants have been in Canada for nearly eight years, suggesting that the problems with the PC's testimony can be attributed to the length of time that has transpired since the events took place.\n[14] The panel recognizes that Legacy cases typically deal with events that have occurred quite a few years before the hearing. Nonetheless, claimants have access to their PIF narratives from the date on which they initially file their claims, they have the opportunity to review the events in their narratives before their hearing, and if necessary, they can amend their narratives, if they find the initial narratives do not accurately reflect the events on which they are basing their claims.\n[15] The panel notes that the inconsistencies identified in the PC's testimony concerned events central to the claimants' claim. It would be reasonable to expect that the PC would have remembered, for example, that the abductors had gone to his home to obtain the ransom from his wife, not that she came with the money to where he was being held, as he testified. This event was central to their claim, and ultimately led to their departure from Sri Lanka. It is therefore not unreasonable to expect that the PC would have accurately recalled this key event which took place shortly before their departure from Sri Lanka and was the main reason for their departure. His inconsistent testimony must therefore be due to a lack of credibility. His wife, the CC, recognized that the PC struggled with his testimony and was able to rectify his testimony when she later had the opportunity to testify. Nonetheless, the panel finds that the PC's inconsistent testimony with respect to the two key events involving the EPDP, which the claimants maintain was the main motivation for their flight from the country, undermines the overall credibility of this claim.\nWell-founded Fear\nFear of the Army\n[16] The claimants testified that they cannot return to Sri Lanka because they continue to fear the Sri Lankan army and the EPDP. They have provided a letter6 from the CC's mother, dated XXXX XXXX, 2019, which notes that the army and police have visited the home and asked about the PC. \"Few times the army and police visited home and asked about XXXX and her husband XXXX.\" The letter,7 however, provides no dates as to when the visits took place.\n[17] The claimants' interactions with the army occurred near the end of the war in 2009. The PC surrendered to the army in XXXX 2009 and was taken to a refugee camp. At the camp, he was beaten and questioned about his involvement with the LTTE. Having come from an LTTE area, the army suspected that the PC may have been an LTTE fighter. The CC joined her husband in XXXX 2009. Although she was not questioned or beaten, two of the soldiers sexually harassed her and tried to rape her. The claimants were subsequently both allowed to leave after a priest intervened on their behalf.\n[18] The panel notes that the claimants' alleged mistreatment would have taken place near the end of the war at a time when many human rights violations occurred. According to their information, however, there was no further interaction with the army following their release from the refugee camp. The panel finds, therefore, that there is insufficient evidence to indicate that the army has a continued interest in the claimants. The panel also notes that the claimants left Sri Lanka on their own genuine passports and experienced no difficulty from the authorities on departure from Sri Lanka.\nThe EPDP\n[19] The claimants' main difficulties appear to be as a result of their alleged interaction with members of the EPDP. According to the PC, their first encounter with the EPDP took place in XXXX 2009 when they came to his home and demanded that the claimants vote for them in the municipal election or else they would face serious consequences. When they realized that the PC was related to one of the opposing candidates, they abducted him, and after questioning him, warned him that if he supported his relative, they would abduct him again. According to the PC's PIF narrative, the PC was abducted in 2009 because the EDPD discovered that he was related to an opposing candidate in the election. As highlighted earlier, the PC initially made no mention of the relative during his testimony regarding the 2009 abduction. The panel therefore finds the omission of this central fact from the PC's initial testimony to be indicative of a lack of credibility.\n[20] The PC indicated that his next encounter with the EPDP took place in XXXX 2010 after the 2010 parliamentary elections in Sri Lanka. According to the PC, the EPDP were angry that Tamils had voted primarily for the Tamil National Party rather than the EPDP. The EPDP then came to his home and abducted him once again, this time demanding a ransom of 15 Lakhs rupees. The PC indicated that they paid the EPDP only 5 Lakhs rupees and that the claimants left Sri Lanka, before paying the outstanding amount. The claimants have indicated that this was the determining factor in their departure from Sri Lanka. The panel notes, however, that the letter8 from the CC's mother, which indicates an unspecified and ongoing interest from Sri Lankan authorities in the claimants, makes no mention of the EPDP. As discussed earlier, the PC's account of his interactions with the EPDP is inconsistent. In light of the absence of any reference to the EPDP in the letter9 from the CC's mother, the panel finds that there is insufficient reliable evidence to conclude that the EPDP has an interest in the claimants.\n[21] The panel has reviewed information regarding the EPDP in a Response to Information Request (RIR) dated March 17, 2017.10 The party was originally formed in the late the 1980's to fight alongside the LTTE, but later allied itself with the government and operated as a paramilitary outfit supporting Sri Lankan military forces against the LTTE. It was described in a 2016 report by the International Crisis Group as a \"former Tamil militant group\" that is part of the United People's Freedom Alliance, a \"diverse coalition of parties.\"11\n[22] The US Country Reports 2014 is also quoted in the RIR as stating that:\n[t]here were persistent reports of close ties between progovernment paramilitary groups such as the [EPDP] and government security forces. Whereas during the war these groups served more of a military function, often working in coordination with security forces, in the postwar environment they increasingly took on the characteristics of criminal gangs as they sought to solidify their territory and revenue sources.12 [citations omitted]\n[23] Country Reports 2014 further stated that:\n[t]here were persistent reports that the EPDP ... engaged in intimidation, extortion, corruption, and violence against civilians in the Tamil-dominated district of Jaffna. Reports throughout the year especially focused on the role of EPDP members in issuing threats to opposition Tamil politicians or community members engaged in human rights cases that could bring disrepute on the government.13 [citations omitted]\n[24] A 2016 report by the International Truth and Justice Project in Sri Lanka stated that:\n[t]he [EPDP], which plays a key role in brokering releases of the victims, is still operating with impunity. The modus operandi for abduction, detention, interrogation, torture, sexual violence and release in exchange for large payments to the security forces and human smugglers remains unchanged.14\n[25] The panel further notes that the recent country documents found in the latest National Documentation Package,15 such as the US Department of State Report, dated April 20, 2018; the Amnesty International Report, dated February 22, 2018; the Freedom House Report on Sri Lanka for 2017; and the Human Rights Watch World Report, January 2018, make no mention of the EPDP. The 2015 election in Sri Lanka saw the EPDP win only one seat.16 It would appear that the EPDP's power, at least politically, has been diminished and as highlighted in Country Reports 2014,17 its activities are focused in the Tamil-dominated north of the country.\n[26] The panel has considered the letter18 from the CC's mother and given concerns with its reliability, in light of its source, assigns little weight to the letter. As Justice Annis has cautioned in El Bouni, regarding documentary evidence that emanates from family members and friends:\n... I find that confirmatory evidence of family members and friends, which is not subject to cross-examination, is not highly probative or credible evidence. Highly probative evidence is intrinsically well-presented evidence from independent sources confirming a material fact in the matter.19\n[27] The claimant's counsel has suggested that the claimant's risk is not generalized and that he has been targeted by the EPDP because of a perceived political opinion that he is an LTTE supporter or sympathizer. Counsel submits that the EPDP is connected with the government and therefore, by extension, the agent of persecution is the state.\n[28] The panel finds that while the EPDP worked with Sri Lankan security forces, especially during the conflict with the LTTE, which ended in 2009, and that they have been connected to the former Rajapaksa regime, there is insufficient recent evidence that they continue to be a significant force or have their previous level of connection to the security forces and government. As one of the sources quoted in 2016 in the Sri Lanka COI Compilation, December 2016, stated:\n... '[w]ith the exit of Mahinda Rajapaksa from power, paramilitary wings have lost much of their influence and relevance to pressurize people,' and that 'Military Intelligence, which had enjoyed a lot of patronage during the previous regime to use paramilitary as coercive instrument of power outside the pale of law, is at present under a lot of pressure from the government.'20 [citations omitted]\n[29] The panel also notes that the EPDP's interaction with the claimant has essentially been one of a criminal nature, based on extortion and intimidation. As stated in Country Reports 2014: \"...they [the EPDP] increasingly took on the characteristics of criminal gangs as they sought to solidify their territory and revenue sources.\"21 The panel finds that his interactions with individuals whom the claimant believes were members of the EPDP were of a criminal nature. Given the huge number of Tamils who have worked abroad or have a member of their family currently living in the Tamil diaspora, the panel finds that the risk faced by the claimant is one generally faced by most Tamils, especially in the north of Sri Lanka, where the Tamil population is most concentrated.\nInternal Flight Alternative in Colombo\n[30] In the alternative, the panel has put forward Colombo as a viable internal flight alternative destination for the claimant. The CC was asked whether they could go and live in Colombo. The CC replied that they have no resources in Colombo and that the EPDP and the army are still in Colombo. The PC stated that when he enters Sri Lanka, the army and the EPDP would know, they would inform the police in Colombo, and he would be in trouble because they still suspect that he is an LTTE sympathizer. The claimant's counsel has submitted that because the EPDP is associated with the army and the government, and given the small size of the country, there is no internal flight alternative for the claimant.\n[31] The panel notes that the Australian Government's DFAT Report, January 2017, on Sri Lanka states that unemployment in Sri Lanka is relatively low (4.7 % in 2015) and that education is generally of a high level.22 The claimants are still relatively young, in their early forties, and given the low levels of unemployment, it is reasonable to expect that as Sri Lankan nationals they would not face insurmountable barriers to employment in Colombo, where it would be reasonable to expect more opportunities than in a small town in the North. The panel also notes that a move to Colombo would provide the PC's son with greater access to education and employment upon graduation. It is to be expected that rent in the largest urban centre in the country will be higher than in the primarily rural areas of the north. Nonetheless, the panel does not find higher rents to be a sufficient reason to rule out Colombo as a viable internal flight alternative. Reasonably, as well, one would also expect wages to be higher in Colombo than in XXXX XXXX XXXX area, where the claimants' home is currently located.\n[32] The claimant has also stated that he would be \"in trouble\" in Colombo because the police in Colombo would be informed of his presence there by the EPDP, and they would target him because he is a suspected LTTE sympathizer. The panel finds that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the EPDP is currently associated with the army or any other government agency. While the EPDP may have had a direct relationship with state agents, the panel finds that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the EPDP is currently working with the army or police. Further, the panel will demonstrate in the next section that the claimants' profiles are not ones that will attract negative attention from the authorities. While the panel acknowledges that the authorities will initially note that they have been abroad for some eight years living in the Tamil diaspora, they will find that they are not wanted for any crimes, that they left the country legally, and that any interaction with the authorities in the past did not indicate any support for or significant involvement with the LTTE. The panel therefore finds that the claimants will not experience any significant difficulties or face persecution should they to return to Sri Lanka and settle in Colombo.\nThe Claimants' Risk Profiles\n[33] The panel finds that since the claimants has not adduced any evidence that they have been involved in any Sri Lankan-related political activities during their time in Canada, there is therefore no evidence for the authorities to conclude that the claimants are opposed to the government or are in any way supportive of pro-LTTE activities. In light of their lack of political involvement and of the political changes in Sri Lanka since the claimants have left, the panel finds that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the authorities would have adverse interest in them, even given their past experiences in the country.\n[34] The panel has also reviewed country documentation with respect to returnees, especially those with perceived or suspected links to the LTTE. In an August 2015 report, the International Crisis Group noted that \"Tamils returning from abroad continue to be arrested under the PTA [Prevention of Terrorism Act] on suspicion of old LTTE involvement.\"23\n[35] The Amnesty International Annual Report 2017\/2018 on Sri Lanka found that Tamils suspected of links to the LTTE continued to be detained under the PTA [Prevention of Terrorism Act], which permits extended administrative detention and shifts the burden of proof onto the detainee alleging torture or other ill-treatment.24\n[36] While it is clear from various country documents that certain individuals suspected of links to the LTTE face a possibility of arrest and even torture at the hands of government security forces, there are also indications that the situation is improving. Not all Tamils are routinely screened. According to research, \"...only those individuals for whom the government claims there are 'reasonable concerns' of having links with the LTTE are screened.\"25 In addition, another expert on Sri Lanka has noted that \"...while those accused of links with LTTE are still 'not treated well,' the situation has 'improved a lot' since the end of the civil war [in 2009], noting that allegations of torture and detentions have diminished.\"26\n[37] The Executive Director of the National Peace Council of Sri Lanka (NPC), has indicated that \"[a]rrests and detentions are not common unless for some reasonable suspicion of criminal activities,\"27 and the President of the Council of (non-government organizations) NGOs in Sri Lanka has stated that \"...arrest and detention of those with alleged links to the LTTE continue, but that they have been 'reduced.'\"28 While these statements stand in contrast to some of the conclusions in other reports, the panel notes that these statements are made by individuals within Sri Lanka and tend to be more recent assessments of the situation. Nonetheless, the situation in Sri Lanka for Tamils, although it has improved under the current regime elected in 2015, is far from perfect and the risk profile of an individual with suspected links to the LTTE must be carefully considered. The panel must therefore determine whether the claimants face more than a mere possibility that they will be harassed and harmed by Sri Lankan authorities upon return there.\n[38] The claimants believe that they will experience problems as soon as they arrive in Sri Lanka because the authorities there have demonstrated an ongoing interest in them. As stated above, the panel finds the claimants assertions of ongoing interest in them by the authorities to be unsupported by reliable evidence and their fears not to be well-founded. The panel also finds the letter29 from the CC's mother wife, as evidence of ongoing interest in the claimant by the EPDP, the army, and the police, to be unreliable. The letter provides no dates of the alleged visits and makes no mention of the EPDP, which the claimants allege are the source of their most recent and greatest fear. The panel finds therefore that the claimants have provided insufficient reliable evidence that the EPDP or indeed the current regime would be interested in them.\n[39] The United Kingdom's (UK) Home Office Report: Country Information and Guidance. Sri Lanka: Tamil Separatism, June 2017 includes a number of significant conclusions established by the UK Tribunal in assessing recent, independent reports regarding returnees to Sri Lanka. One of the Tribunal's key findings is that:\nThe government's present objective is to identify Tamil activists in the Diaspora who are working for Tamil separatism and to destabilise the unitary Sri Lankan state enshrined in Amendment 6(1) to the Sri Lankan Constitution in 1983, which prohibits the 'violation of territorial integrity' of Sri Lanka. Its focus is on preventing both (a) the resurgence of the LTTE or any similar Tamil separatist organisation and (b) the revival of the civil war within Sri Lanka.30 [references omitted]\n[40] The panel notes that the claimants do not have any direct ties to the LTTE, nor do they have a history of having opposed the government, either in Sri Lanka or during their time in Canada. The UK Tribunal, in assessing recent, independent reports regarding returnees to Sri Lanka identified a key risk profile as:\nIndividuals who are, or are perceived to be, a threat to the integrity of Sri Lanka as a single state because they are, or are perceived to have a significant role in relation to post-conflict Tamil separatism within the Diaspora and\/or a renewal of hostilities within Sri Lanka.31\n[41] The claimants have not participated or been involved in any anti-regime or pro-LTTE activities, either in Sri Lanka or since their arrival in Canada. Their activities subsequent to their departure from Sri Lanka do not indicate any reason for any particular interest in them by authorities.\n[42] The panel has also considered the evidence regarding failed asylum-seekers, given the particular circumstances of these claimants. In light of this information, the panel finds that the claimants are not, on a balance of probabilities, persons who would be perceived to be linked to any pro-LTTE factions by the current Sri Lankan government, and it determines that they do not have good grounds to fear persecution as failed asylum-seekers should they return to Sri Lanka. The panel further finds that there is no evidence to suggest that since they left Sri Lanka, the Sri Lankan government has any reason to believe that they are members or supporters of the LTTE. As already referenced, the Report from the United Kingdom Border Agency states that:\nThe focus of the Sri Lankan government's concern has changed since the civil war ended in May 2009. The LTTE in Sri Lanka itself is a spent force and there have been no terrorist incidents since the end of the civil war.\nThe government's present objective is to identify Tamil activists in the Diaspora who are working for Tamil separatism and to destabilise the unitary Sri Lankan state enshrined in Amendment 6(1) to the Sri Lankan Constitution in 1983, which prohibits the violation of territorial integrity' of Sri Lanka. 32\n[43] The panel finds that the claimants have provided insufficient evidence to support their stated fear of the EPDP, the army, and the police. Given that the claimants have not had any apparent political involvement while in Canada with any pro-separatist or anti-government organizations, Sri Lankan authorities would have no reason to detain them or to subject them to any more than a cursory questioning upon their return.\nCONCLUSION\n[44] After careful consideration of all of the evidence, including the claimants' testimony, as well as written submissions33 by the claimants' counsel, the panel determines that the claimants have not satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on Convention grounds, or that, on a balance of probabilities, they would be subject personally to a danger of torture, or face a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, if they were returned to Sri Lanka.\n[45] The panel therefore concludes that the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection and rejects their claim.\n(signed)\n\"Anthony da Silva\"\nAnthony da Silva\nMarch 14, 2019\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96, 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b).\n2 Exhibit 1, Package of information from the referring CBSA\/CIC.\n3 Ibid.\n4 Exhibit 2, Personal Information Form (PIF).\n5 Exhibit 2, PC's PIF narrative at p.12.\n6 Exhibit 10, Letter from the Co-claimant's mother.\n7 Ibid.\n8 Ibid.\n9 Ibid.\n10 Exhibit 5, National Documentation Package (NDP) for Sri Lanka, item 13.11.\n11 Ibid., item 13.11, at s. 3.\n12 Ibid., item 13.11, at s. 3.1.\n13 Ibid., item 13.11, at s. 3.2.\n14 Ibid., item 13.11, at s. 3.2.\n15 Exhibit 5, NDP for Sri Lanka (April 30, 2018).\n16 Ibid., item 4.2,\n17 Ibid., item 13.11.\n18 Exhibit 10, Letter from the Co-claimant's mother.\n19 El Bouni, Haidar v.

The claim was declared abandoned on October 1, 2018 as he did not appear for either the Conference scheduled for September 17, or for the Special Hearing of September 24, 2018.\n[2] The claimant has requested a reopening of his claim. He submits that it was always his intention to proceed with his claim. He submits that it was always his practice to file changes of address through the office of his former counsel. He states that he does not know why the Board would continue to have an old address for him.\n[3] The claimant also submitted, that he went to the office of his former counsel on December 31, 2017, where he was given the business card of someone (XXXX) to contact. Between January and May 2018, he made several attempts to contact his counsel. However, he became worried when he went to his office in March 2018, and found it abandoned with a note that his former counsel had retired. He received some information about the transfer of counsel's office from a security guard, and subsequently he asked a friend to call counsel's office for his file. The claimant attests that he went to the Board's Victoria Street office to change his address. He attended at the Board's fourth floor offices and filled out a change of address. A Board employee directed him to the tenth floor where he filled out another change of address form.\n[4] The claimant only learned of his former counsel's retirement when he hired his present counsel. He states that he received none of the Notices to Appear, and only learned that his claim had been declared abandoned when his new lawyer told him that it had been.\n[5] The claimant alleges a continuing fear of persecution in Colombia.\n[6] Counsel for the claimant argues that he always had a coninuing intention to pursue his claim and was not aware that no lawyer had carriage of his file. She states that he has made this Application at the earliest available opportunity, that is, as soon after he retained counsel as possible, and that should the Board refuse to reopen the Claim, it would result in a breach of natural justice operating negatively upon the claimant.\n[7] Counsel for the claimant argues, that the matter involved more than the failure of a claimant to keep the Board apprised of his current contact information. She submitted that it was about a \"refugee claimant who believed he was represented by counsel and who has been deprived of a proper risk assessmnet.\" Cousnel for the claimant cited several Federal Court decisions where the Court has taken the position that \"refugee applications may be allowed to proceed, despite procedural defects, to ensure that the requirements of natural justice are fullfilled.\"1\n[8] Counsel argues that the RPD fell into error when it declared the Applicant's refugee claim abandoned.\n[9] The RPD is not persuaded by counsel's argument. The RPD Rules allow for the re-opening of claims in certain circumstances under Rule 62 of the RPD Rules. Rule 62(6) provides that the RPD must not allow the application unless it is established that there was a failure to observe a principle of natural justice. [emphasis added] Rule 62(7) requires that the RPD consider any relevant factors, including those set out in the Rule. As such, while the RPD can only re-open an appeal if there has been a failure to observe a principle of natural justice, it may reject an application on broader grounds.\n[10] I find that the applicant has not estabished that there was a failure to observe a principle of Natural Justice. The claim was referred to the IRB on February 5, 2012. At the time of referral, the Applicant resided at XXXX XXXX Street, apt. XXXX in Toronto. He filed or caused to have filed with the Division, two changes of addresses. The first address change was made on October 5, 2012 through the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. A second change of address was filed on July 7, 2014 (the XXXX Road address). The third change of address was made on January 22, 2018, and was filed by his present counsel.\n[11] The claimant stated in his Affidavit that he filed a change of address with the Board and when he did so, a Board employee instructed him to go up to the 10th Floor to file a change of address. He attached a copy of this change of address to his Application. This Change of Address is on the letterhead of the Canda Border Services Agency (CBSA), an entirely separate entity, notwithstanding that the two offices are housed on the same premises. Even if I were to accept that the Applicant genuinely believed that he was filing a change of address with the Board, he was doing so only on October 12, 2018, which is nearly three weeks after the Division had declared his claim abanaodned. Therefore, his implicit claim that he changed his address with the Board, and they ought to have had it and not abandoned his claim, is not borne out.\n[12] Furthermore, while the claimant stated that whenever he moved to a new aparment he always went to his lawyer's office where he would fill out a form, sign it, and it would then be faxed to the Board, an examination of his moves belies the claim.\n[13] The claimant moved from the XXXX Road address in mid-2014; he did not file a change of address. He moved again on August 31, 2018. Again, he did not file a change of address with the Division. By this last move, he had already been alerted to a possible problem with his former counsel, as he had been trying to conatct his office to no avail. As well, he already knew that Messr. XXXX XXXX had taken over files of his previous counsel..\n[14] The panel's concern is that in these circumstances, the Applicant still did not come directly to the Board's offices on Victoria Street to make the change of address. He clearly knew where it was, as he would come to it on October 12, 2018.\n[15] The Applicant was well aware that he had the obligation to notify the Board of changes in his contact information. He moved twice without notifying the Board. When he did notify the Board, it was weeks after a decision had been taken to declare his claim abandoned. He seeks to misrepresent the timing of this notification.\n[16] The Applicant makes much of the fact that he filed his claim in 2012, and has been waiting for a hearing. Given that he maintains that his fear continues to be well-founded, the panel would have expected that he would have been more diligent in ensuring that the Board has uptodate contact information for him, particularly when he had difficulty contacting his counsel for several months before the claim was decalred abandoned.\n[17] The panel finds that Applicant's actions and failure to notify the Board of his contact information do not support a continuing interest in pursuing his refugee claim. The applicant's failure to follow the rules, and the Division's subsequent abandonment of his claim do not, in this instance, constitute a Breach of Natural Justice or breach of procedural fairness.\n[18] Having considered all of the evidence and arguments in this Application, the panel finds that was no breach of natural justice.\n[19] The application to reopen is denied.\n(signed)\n\"Hazelyn Ross\"\nHazelyn Ross\nFebruary 15, 2019\nDate\n1 Application, Counsel's Written Representations, para. 34.\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRPD.29.1 (August 31, 2012)\nRPD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SPR : TB2-01546\n",

On July 16, 2012, the claimant made a claim for refugee protection.\nAllegations\n[4] The claimant alleges that he fears persecution as a result of his political opinion and membership in a social group, due to his opposition to his land being expropriated by the Chinese government without fair compensation.\nDetermination\n[5] I find that the claimant is not a Convention refugee, as he does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention refugee ground in China. I also find that the claimant is not a person in need of protection pursuant to s.97\nAnalysis\n[6] The determinative issue in this claim is credibility and whether there is a nexus to a Convention ground.\nIdentity\n[7] The claimant's identity as a Chinese national is established by his testimony and by the personal identity documents filed.3\nCredibility\/Subjective Fear\n[8] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that those facts are true unless there is valid reason to doubt their veracity.4 The determination as to whether a claimant's evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities.5 The panel can accept some, all or none of a witness's testimony.6 In assessing credibility, I am mindful of the claimant's education, and background. In addition, I am cognizant of the many difficulties faced by a claimant in establishing a claim, including cultural factors, the milieu of the hearing room, and the stress inherent in responding to oral questions through an interpreter and nervousness. I am also mindful that nearly seven years have passed since the allegations are said to have occurred and that the passage of time can impact a person's recollection of events.\nThe Land Expropriation\n[9] The claimant testified that he did not disagree with the Chinese government expropriating his land, only with the amount that the government intended to pay him in compensation. He together with other property owners in the village organized and obtained land evaluations to demonstrate to the government that their property was worth more than the offered compensation. Initially, the villagers had approached the local land tribunal regarding their concerns. However, they were advised to make their concerns known to a higher level of government. As a result, the claimant and approximately thirty others attended at the town government office. They filed their petition, together with their independent land evaluations, and were told to await a response. Subsequently, and before they had received a response to their petition, the Removal and Demolition Office (RDO) workers came to their village and told them to move by XXXX XXXX, 2012. The villagers responded that they would not move and that they were waiting for reasonable compensation. During this discussion the claimant was accused by the RDO workers of spreading anti-government rumors. He and others were told that they would be dealt with if they did not move.\n[10] The next day three people from the RDO approached the claimant and his neighbours, offered them money if they would take the lead in moving out. They refused the offer. On XXXX XXXX, 2012, before the deadline, RDO workers came to demolish the properties.\n[11] The claimant testified that he was at work when he received a phone call telling him that the demolition had started, that people were being arrested, and that he should hide. The claimant testified that initially he went to a friend's home about 20 minutes away by car from the demolition site. He stayed there for a couple of days and then went to his cousin who lived about 35 minutes away by car. He remained at this cousin's house until he left China on XXXX XXXX, 2019.\n[12] He learned from his wife, that the Public Security Bureau (PSB) officers had come to their home and that he was ordered to report to them. When he failed to report they returned the next day. They also went to his close relatives' homes. Prior to his leaving China the PSB returned five or six times to his home. The claimant testified that a day or two after the incident PSB officers left a summons for him. The claimant testified that twelve people were arrested as a result of their opposition to the demolition. Seven people were released the following day and XXXX remain detained.\n[13] The claimant's testimony was substantially consistent with his narrative. Whilst there were some inconsistencies, I do not find them to be material, and I accept that the claimant's land was expropriated by the Chinese government. I further accept that the claimant, together with other villagers approached the town government and made their displeasure over the amount of compensation known.\n[14] However, I have concerns regarding the way in which the events unfolded thereafter. The claimant testified that the RDO workers told him on XXXX XXXX, 2012, that he would be in trouble for his opposition to the land expropriation. Nothing happened to the claimant as a result of that conversation or his subsequent refusal to accept additional monies the day following the conversation. In addition, the claimant and the other villagers received their joint petition back without any negative consequences on XXXX XXXX, 2012.\n[15] Six days later the demolition occurred and people were arrested at the scene. It is notable that the claimant was not present for the demolition and therefore did not engage in any obstructive behaviour. Nor was there any evidence of exactly what happened to precipitate the arrests. I accept as reasonable that the claimant was concerned when he heard that villagers were being arrested and that he chose not to attend for that reason. I also accept that given his earlier conversation with the DSO workers and their threat, he may have been nervous that he would be implicated.\n[16] However, the evidence does not support a finding that the PSB came looking for the claimant or that a summons issued for him. The claimant did not mention a summons in his narrative and testified that he had forgotten to include it, and also that he did not think it important to include it. I find that the claimant's omission and explanation in this regard undermines his credibility.\n[17] The claimant testified that he stayed with his cousin until he left China and that it was his cousin's idea for him to leave China and go to Canada. He had not considered relocating in China because the PSB would be able to find him as they have a very advanced \"network.\" However, the claimant attended at the United States Consulate to obtain a visitor's visa and then left China using his own passport. The claimant testified that he used the services of a smuggler, the implication being that the smuggler smoothed the way for him both at the United States Consulate and airport. However, given the claimant's concerns regarding the PSB's advanced network as a reason for him not to relocate within China, I do not find it credible that the claimant would go to the United States Consulate or attempt to leave China on his own passport, for fear of detection. I acknowledge that the claimant's education and sophistication level may mean that he could not know the exact nature of the PSB network in 2012, although I note that the country documentation suggest that it was robust.7 The issue is not how accurate was the claimant's knowledge but rather that his perception prevented him from taking action, such as moving within China for fear of being caught. It is reasonable to conclude that this same concern would have been present regarding his attendance at the United States consulate and at the airport. However, he testified that he did not question the smuggler's instructions. I note that the claimant had no prior knowledge of the smuggler and that it was his cousin who made the arrangements. People who are fearful will often go to extraordinary lengths to get away from their persecutor and will often put themselves in danger to do so. However, I do not find it credible that the claimant would not question the smuggler regarding his travel arrangements and what to do if things went awry, particularly given the amount of money that the smuggler was being paid. I find his testimony in this regard inconsistent with his testimony that he was frightened to be arrested on the day of the demolition, despite not being at the demolition site and that he chose to hide from the PSB.\n[18] The claimant testified that the PSB continue to come to his home and have instructed his wife that he must turn himself in. He testified that sometimes they come numerous times in a year and sometimes once a year. The last visit to his home was on XXXX XXXX XXXX, in XXXX, 2019. Country documentation makes clear that if a person fails to appear as directed a coercive summons may be issued.8 Although, country documentation also states that the process may not always be followed, given the number of times that the PSB have come to his home to find him, and the claimant's evidence that XXXX other village representatives remain in custody, it is reasonable to assume that the claimant is an important suspect and it is reasonable to expect that the PSB would use the tools available to them and issue a coercive summons. Whilst the fact of no coercive summon is not determinative, it is a factor to be considered\n[19] Furthermore, there was no corroborating evidence to substantiate the arrest and sentences of the XXXX other villagers. The claimant testified that his wife informed him recently that they remained in custody. When asked about corroborating documentation regarding the XXXX other villagers the claimant testified that he and his wife do not write to each other and that they only talk. I am mindful that a claimant does not have to produce corroborating evidence. However, the absence of corroborating evidence is also a factor to consider.\n[20] Given the extent of the claimant's involvement in the protest, his non-attendance when the demolition was happening, his failure to mention a summons for his arrest in his narrative, and his failure to mention the use of a smuggler in his narrative, the weight of the evidence does not support a finding that the PSB were looking for the claimant. In coming to this finding, I have considered both the level of corruption and the availability of fraudulent documents in China.9\n[21] The claimant provided documents including the notice of land expropriation, an evaluation assessment of the land, and I accept that the claimant's property in China was expropriated. However, when the totality of the evidence is considered, I am unable to find on a balance of probabilities that the PSB are looking for the claimant. For these reasons, I find there is no persuasive evidence of a nexus to a Convention ground. I find that the claimant does not have a subjective fear of persecution due to his political opinion or membership in a social group, and the claimant has not met his onus of establishing, on a balance of probabilities, that he would be persecuted were he to return to China.\n[22] Even were I to have found the claimant credible in regard to being wanted by the PSB, the claimant's testimony makes clear that he did not disagree with the government's reasons for wanting to take his property. His dispute was purely economic. The claimant made no anti-government statements, he has not participated in any anti-government rally, meeting or organization. Nor was he present at the time of the demolition. Based on the claimant's testimony, he is wanted in regard to a potential unlawful act (by attempting to disrupt the government's actions in expropriating his land) rather than for holding a particular political opinion. There was no evidence that the claimant would have objected to the expropriation of his property had adequate compensation been provided, in fact the evidence is to the contrary. In my view, the claimant's activities were directed at a social problem and not directed to political change, nor does the evidence support a finding that this actions could be imputed to be so. For this reason, there is not a nexus to a Convention ground.\n[23] Furthermore, were I to have found the claimant credible, the claimant has broken a law of generalized application, one that applies to the whole population without differentiation.10\n[24] On a balance of probabilities, it is more likely that the claimant would be prosecuted for preventing government officials from carrying out their duties, and not for holding a particular political opinion. I also note, that the claimant's property has now been demolished and no compensation paid and the government has achieved its objective at no cost. In addition, nearly seven years have passed, and it is not reasonable to expect that the PSB are still in pursuit of the claimant. For these reasons, given the claimant's likely jeopardy, I further find that section 97(1) does not apply to the claimant.\nCONCLUSION\n[25] I find that the claimant is not a Convention refugee, as he does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention refugee ground in China. For the same reasons, I find that the claimant is not a person in need of protection pursuant to s.97.\n(signed)\n\"Jan Mills\"\nJan Mills\nApril 23, 2019\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n2 Exhibit 2, Personal Information Form (PIF) TB2-09051, received August 14, 2012.\n3 Exhibit 1, Package of information from the referring CBSA\/CIC; Exhibit 6, at pp. 2-16.\n4 Maldonado, Pedro Enrique Juarez v.

He seeks refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant alleged in his Personal Information Form (PIF) narrative, the following:\n[3] After suffering from upper body pain, and finding that conventional medicine did not alleviate his symptoms, the claimant started to practice Falun Gong (FG) in XXXX 2011 on the advice of his friend, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who had benefited from FG practice. After some time, he felt his condition improve and convinced another friend to join his FG practice group.\n[4] On XXXX XXXX, 2012, the claimant's FG group was raided by the Public Security Bureau (PSB). The claimant managed to escape and went into hiding at his cousin's house. While in hiding, he learned that the PSB had gone to his home on XXXX XXXX, 2012, and left a summons accusing him of being engaged in illegal FG activities and recruiting people for an illegal organization. They also told his parents that that his friend XXXX, and another practitioner, had been arrested on the day of the PSB raid.\n[5] After hearing that the PSB had returned to her relatives' homes to look for him, arrangements were made for a smuggler to assist the claimant to leave China.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] The panel finds that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee, in accordance with section 96, nor is he a person in need of protection, in accordance with section 97(1)(a) and (b) of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\nIssues\n[7] The key issues in this case are credibility, his identity as a bona fide FG practitioner, and whether he has established a sur place claim.\nCredibility\nClaimant's travel to Canada\n[8] The claimant has indicated that he exited China at XXXX and travelled to Taiwan on a boat. From Taiwan, he came to Canada on a false Taiwanese passport, which was taken from him by the smuggler who had accompanied him to Canada. The claimant testified that he had no evidence of his departure from China and arrival in Canada. The panel finds that his inability to corroborate his actual exit from China undermines his assertion that the PSB came to his home on XXXX XXXX, 2012, and left a summons for him.\nRaid and Pursuit by the Public Security Bureau (PSB)\n[9] The claimant stated that on XXXX XXXX, 2012, the PSB raided his FG group practice. He also testified that the PSB visited his home on XXXX XXXX, 2012, and left a summons, that they have continually gone to his home since his departure in 2012, and that they inquired about him as recently as XXXX 2019. While the panel finds his description of the raid and his subsequent escape plausible, it finds his testimony that the PSB has continually gone to his home since his departure in 2012 to be improbable, given his minor profile.\nThe Claimant's Motivation\n[10] The claimant testified that he was motivated to begin practising FG after experiencing arm and shoulder pain, and finding that the treatment and medication prescribed were either ineffective or had side effects such as causing him dizziness. After being advised by his friend to try FG, as it has helped the friend's backache, he joined his friend's FG practice group. The claimant was asked if knew that FG was illegal and that there could be serious consequences such as detention and even torture if caught. He affirmed that he was aware of the consequences. He was then asked why he would risk such potential dire consequences, he replied that the doctor told him that there was no treatment for his condition and that that the drugs prescribed had made him dizzy.\n[11] The panel noted that after several months of practice he had indicated that his pain was \"almost gone.\" He was asked why he simply did not quit at that time and continue the exercises in private. He replied that he obtained greater benefit from the group practice. The panel finds that the claimant's motivation for practising FG was simply to relieve his physical pain, and that his explanation for wanting to continue to practice in a group after his pain was \"almost gone\" is not reasonable, given the concomitant risks associated with being discovered.\nThe Claimant's Profile\n[12] The United Kingdom (UK) Home Office Operational Guidance Note on China (November 2016) provides the following comments from the Courts in the UK:\n...our first conclusion as to risk, from the objective evidence as a whole, is that, absent special factors, there will not normally be any risk sufficient to amount to \"real risk\" from the Chinese authorities for a person who practices Falun Gong in private and with discretion. On any assessment the number of Falun Gong practitioners in China is very large indeed. The figures quoted range from 2 million to some 100 million. So far as can be gathered from the evidence before us, the number of people who have faced detention or re-education by the Chinese authorities as a consequence of Falun Gong activity, whilst large in absolute terms, is a relatively small proportion of the overall number of practitioners. This indicates that the large majority of those who practice Falun Gong in China in privacy and with discretion do not experience material problems with the authorities.2\n[13] The claimant was not involved in promoting FG publicly, or criticizing the Chinese authorities in any public forum. The claimant, according to his PIF and testimony, was involved simply in practising FG in private with other practitioners. The claimant provided no explanation as to how the PSB became aware of the practice of his FG group and why they subsequently targeted them. The panel therefore concludes, that even if the claimant's account of events was found to be credible, it is unlikely that the PSB would be interested in or continue to search for the claimant, given his minor profile as a member of a group consisting of XXXX individuals who got together for an hour on weekends to practice FG in the privacy of their homes.\nThe Chuanpiao (subpoena) and Detention Dismissal Notice\n[14] As part of his evidence, the claimant provided two documents in support of his allegations that he is wanted by the authorities in China due to his FG practice there, and that his friend and co-practitioner was arrested and served XXXX years in detention for having been involved in FG practice. The claimant was asked as to when he had received these documents. He replied that his father had sent the documents in March of 2019. When asked why he had just received the documents, given that his claim was filed in 2012, he replied that no one had mentioned that he would need them. The panel notes that the claimant has been represented by counsel since 2012, and finds it improbable that his experienced and competent counsel would not have advised him to provide supporting evidence for allegations when he initially filed his claim. While the panel recognizes that the Detention Dismissal Notice would have been available only in 2016, it questions why the Chuanpiao was sent to the claimant only in March 2019, when his being wanted by the PSB was the central issue in his claim when initiated in 2012.\n[15] The claimant provided an original copy of a Chuanpiao,3 which can be translated as a subpoena or summons. The document summoned the claimant to report to the People's Court of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, 2012. The claimant testified, that even though he did not report as summoned, the PSB have never issued any subsequent documents, despite the multiple visits to his family home in China. It would be reasonable to expect that the PSB would have issued a subsequent document, such as an arrest warrant, given their alleged continual interest in the claimant and given that the Chuanpiao indicates that he was accused of \"being involved in Falun Gong activities recruiting members for illegal organization.\"4 The absence of any follow-up documents, in light of the PSB's continual interest in the claimant, undermines his assertion that the PSB has targeted him and is still interested in pursuing him.\n[16] The claimant also provided a copy of a Detention Dismissal Notice,5 which states that his friend XXXX was released on XXXX XXXX, 2016, after serving XXXX years in detention. Additionally, according to the Notice, XXXX was also deprived of his political rights for a period of one year. The panel has some concerns with the authenticity of this document. The document states that XXXX was \"deprived of political right 1 year from XXXX XXXX, 2012 to XXXX XXXX, 2016.\"6 The panel notes, however, that according to Article 58 of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China: \"A term of deprivation of political rights as a supplementary punishment shall be counted from the date on which imprisonment or criminal detention ends...\"7 The date, however, that is given in the document as the start of the deprivation of political rights is XXXX XXXX, 2012, which is the date of the PSB raid and the date on which XXXX was arrested. The date on the document that is given as the end of the deprivation of political rights is XXXX XXXX, 2016, which is the date of the PSB raid and the date on which XXXX was released from detention. According to Article 58, however, the start of the deprivation of political rights should be on the date that an individual is released from detention, which in this case, would have been XXXX XXXX, 2016. The panel finds that the information in the document is inconsistent with Article 58 of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China, and therefore suspect, further undermining the claimant's credibility regarding events in China prior to his arrival in Canada.\n[17] Given the credibility concerns with respect to the two documents, the panel assigns them no weight and finds the claimant's allegations regarding his FG practice, and subsequent problems in China, to be not credible.\nRefugee sur place\n[18] The claimant's counsel submits that the claimant has been involved in FG practice since his arrival in Canada. Counsel further submits that, not only can the claimant not return because he is wanted by the PSB, but that even if he was not wanted and was to return, he could not practice openly and freely in public. Counsel submits that the claimant has established that he is a bone fide FG practitioner through his activities in Canada over the past six and half years ago, and that therefore he is a refugee sur place.\n[19] In considering whether there are grounds for a sur place claim, the panel reviewed the United Nations Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status,8 which outlines the criteria to be considered in the determination of a sur place claim. Specifically, Article 96 is particularly relevant to this claim. It states:\nA person may become a refugee \"sur place\" as a result of his own actions, such as associating with refugees already recognized, or expressing his political views in his country of residence. Whether such actions are sufficient to justify a well-founded fear of persecution must be determined by a careful examination of the circumstances. Regard should be had in particular to whether such actions may have come to the notice of the authorities of the person's country of original and how they are likely to be viewed by those authorities.\n[20] The claimant alleges that he became a regular FG practitioner in Canada, shortly after his arrival in Canada in 2012. He has provided a number of photographs9 of him and other practitioners participating in a range of FG activities in Canada, including public protests, handing out FG flyers on the street, studying FG philosophy, and practising FG exercises in public. He has also provided letters of support10 from two practitioners in Canada.\n[21] With respect to the photographs, the panel finds that they are insufficient evidence of ongoing and continual practice of FG since 2012, but more importantly, that these isolated images support his assertion that he is a bone fide practitioner. With respect to the two letters of support from practitioners in Canada, the panel finds that the information provided is also insufficient to support the claimant's assertion of being a committed and practising FG adherent since arriving in Canada. The panel notes that neither practitioner was present as a witness at the hearing, and has considered Justice Annis' caution in El Bouni regarding the reliability of documentary evidence emanating from family members and friends:\n... I find that confirmatory evidence of family members and friends, which is not subject to cross-examination, is not highly probative or credible evidence. Highly probative evidence is intrinsically well-presented evidence from independent sources confirming a material fact in the matter.11\n[22] The panel asked the claimant a number of questions about FG, and found him to be knowledgeable concerning certain aspects of FG philosophy. He was also asked to perform one of the FG exercises, and it was apparent that he had practised the movements on previous occasions. When asked if he would return to China if he was not wanted by the PSB, and simply practice FG on his own in private, he replied that he needed to practice with others freely in order to obtain the full benefit of FG.\n[23] The panel finds that the information on FG is readily available and relatively simple to understand. The panel finds that the ability to learn and answer questions about FG is insufficient evidence to conclude that the claimant is a true adherent to FG, given the concerns it has with the credibility of this claim. The claimant has been in Canada for six and half years, and would have had sufficient time to pick up some of the FG language and basic concepts, as well as practice the five exercises that constitute the FG physical regimen.\nCONCLUSION\n[24] After careful consideration of all of the evidence, including the claimant's testimony and his counsel's submissions, the panel determines that the claimant has not satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on Convention grounds, or that, on a balance of probabilities, he would be subject personally to a danger of torture, or face a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, if he were returned to China.\n[25] The claim is therefore rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Anthony da Silva\"\nAnthony da Silva\nApril 8, 2019\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96, 97(1).\n2 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) for China (December 21, 2018), item 1.7, at s. 2.3.5.\n3 Exhibit 6, at p. 13 & 14.\n4 Ibid.\n5 Ibid. at pp.15, 16.\n6 Ibid.\n7 Exhibit 3, Item 9.15.\n8 Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status, Geneva, January 1992.\n9 Exhibit 6, at p. 25-27.\n10 Ibid, at p. 17-22.\n11 El Bouni, Haidar v.

XXXX XXXX (first son) and XXXX XXXX XXXX (second son and minor claimant) claim to be citizens of Trinidad and Tobago. The claimants seek refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (\"IRPA\").1\n[2] The principal claimant was appointed as the Designated Representative for the minor claimant.\n[3] The Minister did not intervene on the issue of Exclusion under Article 1E of the Convention, in reference to the three oldest claimants.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The claimants' allegations are set out in the narrative attached to the principal claimant's wife's Personal Information Form (PIF).2 All the claimants rely on this narrative.\n[5] The principal claimant and his wife are 44 and 41 years old respectively. They are from the province of Guandong.\n[6] The claimants allege that the principal claimant and his wife had a child before marriage and had to pay a fine. The wife was required to wear an IUD. When she experienced problems because of the IUD, she was not allowed to have it removed. Due to the medical problems, and because she wanted to have more children, she had a private doctor in China remove it, and she and the principal claimant left for Trinidad and Tobago in XXXX of 1998. They left their daughter in China with the principal claimant's parents.\n[7] The principal claimant and his wife obtained work permits and later received their permanent resident status in Trinidad in 2005 and 2006 respectively. They had their first two sons in Trinidad in 2000 and 2004.\n[8] In 2004 the principal claimant returned to China to get their daughter and bring her to Trinidad. In 2006, they returned to China to attend the principal claimant's father's funeral. In 2007, the claimant's wife returned to China for four months for treatment of a medical problem, as she had communication problems in Trinidad and was not being treated properly. In 2011 and 2012, they went to China to try to get the children put on their hukous, but could not do so without paying exorbitant fines and facing sterilization.\n[9] In Trinidad the claimants faced increased discrimination because of their race and ethnic origin. There were a lot of murders and robberies being perpetrated against Chinese people. The principal claimant and his wife received physical threats and unequal treatment. For example, their meat deliverer threatened to break down their doors and windows. They were charged extra rent at the market because of their race. The police would not come to protect them if the perpetrators were dangerous.\n[10] The daughter also faced discrimination from students who beat her frequently. The principal claimant said that they could do nothing as they were Chinese. Their oldest son was not accepted into a top high school because of his race. Their second son also experienced discrimination at school. When he would ask for lunch at school, he was refused on the basis that he was Chinese.\n[11] Fearing persecution in China and Trinidad, the principal claimant came to Canada with the children on XXXX XXXX, 2012. His wife arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2012.\nIDENTITY\n[12] The claimants' personal identities and national identities as citizens of China and Trinidad (for the first and second son) are established by their respective passports, which were seized by the CIC and are found in the file as a Certified True Copy form.3\nDETERMINATION\n[13] I find that the claimants are not Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, nor are they persons in need of protection, pursuant to section 97(1) of the IRPA.\nEXCLUSION UNDER ARTICLE 1E (Trinidad and Tobago)\n[14] Article 1E4 reads as follows:\n1E. This Convention shall not apply to a person who is recognized by the competent authorities of the country in which he has taken residence as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of the nationality of that country.\n[15] The Federal Court of Appeal in Zeng5 has set out the test that must be taken into account when deciding whether Article 1E applies. The Court of Appeal held that the reformulated test to be applied to Article 1E determination is:\n[16] Considering all relevant factors to the date of the hearing, does the claimant have status, substantially similar to that of its nationals, in the third country? If the answer is yes, the claimant is excluded.\n[17] If the answer is no, the next question is whether the claimant previously had such status and lost it, or had access to such status and failed to acquire it. If the answer is no, the claimant is not excluded under Article 1E.\n[18] If the answer is yes, the RPD must consider and balance various factors. These include, but are not limited to, the reason for the loss of status (voluntary or involuntary), whether the claimant could return to the third country, the risk the claimant would face in the home country, Canada's international obligations, and any other relevant facts.\n[19] The test to be applied in considering whether the status in question is akin to that of nationals is outlined in the decision of the Federal Court in Shamlou; the Court cited four criteria outlined by Lorne Waldman and adopted them:\n[20] Lorne Waldman in his text... outlines four criteria that, in his opinion, the Board should follow in undertaking an analysis regarding the \"basic rights\" enjoyed by an applicant. These four criteria are:\n(a) the right to return to the country of residence;\n(b) the right to work freely without restrictions;\n(c) the right to study, and\n(d) full access to social services in the country of residence.\n[21] If the applicant has some sort of temporary status which must be renewed, and which could be cancelled, or if the applicant does not have the right to return to the country of residence, clearly the applicant should not be excluded under Art. 1E [emphasis added].6\n[22] For ease of reference in assessing exclusion under 1E, I will refer to the three oldest claimants as \"claimants\", as the first two sons are citizens of Trinidad and therefore not considered under 1E.\n[23] The claimants indicated that they came to Trinidad in 1998 and their daughter in 2004. They indicated in their PIFs that they obtained their permanent resident status in Trinidad in 2005 and 2006. The claimants did not submit any documents regarding their permanent residence status to the Board.\n[24] I find there is no real dispute that the claimants were permanent residents of Trinidad when they departed Trinidad. There is also no dispute, that as permanent residents, they had the right of return to Trinidad, the right to work freely without restriction and the right to study, and the right to social services.\n[25] From their testimony it appears that the claimants had the right to work as they did work, that they had the right to education, as the children attended school, that they had the right to social services, such as medical care, as the wife claimant received medical treatment. They also had the right to return, as they travelled to China several times and were able to return to Trinidad. In other words, they had the rights similar to that of nationals of Trinidad.\n[26] Since there is prima facie evidence that the claimants had permanent residence in Trinidad, the onus shifts to the claimants to establish whether their permanent resident status is still valid, and whether they can return to Trinidad as permanent residents. There is no documentary evidence from Trinidadian authorities as to whether the claimants still retain permanent resident status, or whether they have lost it. The wife of the principal claimant testified that she approached the Trinidad consulate and was told that they had lost their permanent resident status. However, the claimants did not submit any proof in writing from the consulate. Counsel submitted an affidavit from her articling student, stating that she had spoken to an immigration officer at the consulate who told her that the claimants would have lost their status as they have been out of the country since 2012.\n[27] Therefore, on a balance of probabilities, I find that the claimants no longer have status substantially similar to that of nationals of Trinidad. No evidence was provided if permanent residency can be restored if the parents and the daughter return to Trinidad.\n[28] According to directions in Zeng, I will now consider and balance the various factors when assessing whether to exclude the claimants.\nReason for the loss of status\n[29] Counsel submits that the claimants have not voluntarily lost status, because the claimants testified that they fear returning to Trinidad because of the discrimination and violence perpetrated against the Chinese community. Counsel submits, that their failure to maintain their status must be considered in the context of their problems in Trinidad and their fear of returning there. But if they are considered to have voluntarily lost their status, they did so for a valid reason, as it is not reasonable to expect them to keep open the option of returning to Trinidad where they fear persecution and risk to their life.\n[30] I find that the claimants were not credible in regard to fearing persecution in Trinidad. I do accept that there is a generalized risk of violence in Trinidad due to gangs and the drug trade. However, I find that the claimants did not give sufficient credible evidence that they themselves faced persecution. The wife of the principal claimant testified that at the time her husband came to Canada with the children in XXXX of 2012, they did not intend to stay in Canada. They just came on a trip to relax and be happy and that they did not make any further plans. She stayed in Trinidad for another couple of weeks as she was running their XXXX. It was when her children told her that Canada is a wonderful place, that they are happy and that they wanted to stay in Canada, that she decided that she would join her family in Canada. From this testimony, it appears to me, that the principal claimant and his children were not fleeing persecution, or they would have come to Canada to make a refugee claim and not merely for holidays. The wife, as well, delayed in leaving Trinidad, although she had a valid Canadian visa, thus negating the urgency of fleeing persecution. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants came to Canada to seek a better life in Canada, and not because they faced persecution. I find that they were asylum shopping.\n[31] The wife testified that they had decided to move to China because her children were bullied in Trinidad. I note that bullying in school does not normally rise to the level of persecution. The claimants never asserted that the children suffered any physical or emotional harm. The parents complained because their son was not admitted to \"exceptional classes\" because of his ethnicity, but gave no documentary evidence that this was so. Even if true, the parents can only speculate why their son was not chosen to attend a competitive program.\n[32] The wife testified that her daughter was bullied and pushed as she walked to school, and that in the classroom they pushed her stuff, and that one time her computer fell. I find that the description of the children's experiences does not rise to the level of persecution. They were able to attend school and to perform well.\n[33] I also note, that when asked what the racial mix was of the students at the schools the children attended, she testified that the children had different skin colours. I therefore find, it is very unlikely that the claimants, who were children in Trinidad, were bullied because of their ethnicity.\n[34] The claimants submitted a letter7 from a family friend who is a primary school teacher. In reference to the daughter, the author writes that she was discriminated against by other kids in her class, mostly because of her race, and that kids pushed her down when she passed their group. The daughter never got to speak to the principal about the matter. I give this letter limited weight, as the author only knows this information second hand as she never witnessed the treatment of the daughter. The author also opines that she has encountered similar situations with other Chinese children because they tend to keep to themselves. Therefore, it may be that other children bullied the daughter because she was aloof and did not mingle with the other children, and not because of her ethnicity, especially since the school she attended is ethnically mixed.\n[35] I also find that the adult claimants did not give sufficient credible evidence that they were persecuted in Trinidad because of their Chinese ethnicity. When asked what persecution they suffered in Trinidad, the wife described an incident where a meat delivery person asked her for cigarettes, and when she had none to give him, he threatened to come at night to damage their store, but did not do so. I find that this incident does not describe persecution because of ethnicity.\n[36] When asked to describe what other persecution they faced in Trinidad, the wife said that whenever they went to the hospital that other people would be seen first, even though they had come after them. I find that this may be just a case of perception and not reality. Even if true, there is no assertion that they were not treated in the hospital, nor that they were not treated well. I find that this also is not persecution.\n[37] When asked to give another example of persecution, the wife testified that their XXXX was robbed once, that it happened in 2008, but that the incident was omitted from her PIF. I find that if the robbery had occurred, the claimants would have included it in the narrative, as they are instructed to include all relevant events. There is also no reason to believe that the robbery, if it occurred, was not an isolated event of criminality as there is no evidence that it was related to their ethnicity.\n[38] The national documentation package for Trinidad does not appear to have evidence about ethnic violence in the country against Chinese nationals. The claimant provided a number of news articles8 that ethnic violence against Chinese nationals is on the rise in Trinidad. However, I find that this is sparse evidence, at best, to sustain an allegation of persecution or need for protection. While I do place some weight in these articles, they certainly do not overcome the credibility concerns with this claim as a whole. They also do not establish that Chinese residents are targeted. I am not satisfied that the violence against Chinese nationals in Trinidad is at a level beyond generalized risk, or such that the claimants would be de facto at risk by virtue of their ethnicity.\n[39] These findings about the allegations of ethnic violence extend to both the children as citizens of Trinidad, as well as the adult claimants as permanent residents.\n[40] In sum, I find, on a balance of probabilities, the claimants did not give sufficient credible evidence of persecution in Trinidad.\n[41] I find therefore, that the only reason the claimants came to Canada was because they were asylum shopping.\nReturn to China\n[42] The wife testified that the claimants returned to China four times, and each time they came back to Trinidad. In 2006 they returned for her father-in-law's funeral. In 2007 they went because she needed to have medical treatment for a kidney problem, as she found that she could not understand the Trinidadian doctors, and they were not treating her properly. She stayed in China for four months for the treatment. I note that the claimant gave no document, such as a medical booklet, as evidence of her medical treatment in China.\n[43] She testified that they had decided to live in China, and therefore went to China in 2010 and 2011 to try to get the hukous, but were unsuccessful. However, in her PIF, it is indicated that they returned to China in 2010 because her husband's mother was ill. It also appears that the claimant's wife went back to China, as her passport indicates that it was issued in Guandong in 2003, and not in Trinidad as she testified. Her only explanation is that she does not remember.\n[44] The principal claimant's PIF indicates that he traveled to China in 2004 when he went to get their daughter, in 2006 when he went to his father's funeral, in 2007 when his wife was sick, and in 2010 when his mother was ill. In 2011, he went to fix his hukou and stayed there for 8 months until XXXX 2011, and then returned the same month and stayed until XXXX of 2012, a period of 6 months.\n[45] It therefore appears, that the claimants resided in Trinidad but were not afraid to travel to China on several occasions and stay for extended periods of time.\n[46] Though not determinative, I find that the claimants' significant reavailment to China negatively affects their credibility.\n[47] I also note that the principal claimant and his wife travelled to the United States in 2010 without making an asylum claim.\nRisk of persecution in China\n[48] This risk assessment is applicable to the parents and daughter.\n[49] The claimants submitted an update to the PIF narrative on November 26, 2018. In it, the principal claimant' wife alleges that they had a fourth child born in Canada. She also alleges that in Trinidad their whole family attended church for a short time, but they stopped attending because of violence. In June of 2015, while in Canada, her husband was very stressed and anxious because they did not know when they would have their refugee hearing. Therefore her husband began to pray every night and started attending church. He was baptized in XXXX of 2015. He is afraid that he would not be able to practice his faith in China.\n[50] In regards to the daughter, there is no credible evidence that she was ever persecuted or ever would be in the future. The claimants did not provide sufficient credible evidence that she would not be able to return to China and obtain the required documents, such as the RIC and hukou, as she is a citizen of China and travelled to Canada on a Chinese passport. She is 20 years old and can return to China on her own. She lived in China for 6 years with her grandparents until she went to Trinidad in 2004. There is no evidence that she lost her Chinese citizenship.\n[51] In reference to the parents, they have claims based on two issues: persecution because they broke the Family Planning laws in that they now have four children, one born in China, two in Trinidad and one in Canada; and one based on religion, as the principal claimant claims to now be a Christian.\nRisk due to Family Planning\n[52] The claimants have no documentary evidence that they were ever being sought by family planning officers, as they only had one child born in China.\n[53] The principal claimant and his wife now have four children and fear that they would be sterilized if they returned to China. They also fear that they would not be able to obtain the requisite documents such as the hukou to let them access social services in China.\n[54] However, the claimants have been in China several times with their three children, sometimes staying for long periods of time, and they appeared to have had no problems.\n[55] The wife testified that they tried to get hukous in two different years, in 2011 and 2012, but were refused. I find that her testimony in this regard is confusing and not credible. It is understandable that they would not be able to get hukous as they did not reside in China and had not moved back to China. She also testified that the authorities would not issue the hukous until one of them was sterilized. As well, she could not explain how they were attempting to get their hukous without having RICs, which she testified they did not have. The claimant did not give a coherent explanation as to why she and her husband did not have their RICs, or why they did not retain old ones. She also did not explain adequately why they had to go to China two different years to try to do the same thing, that is to try to get hukous, nor did she give details what attempts they made and how, and why it required their presence in China over an extended period of time.\n[56] In regard to sterilization, I find that it is unlikely that the Chinese authorities would be interested in sterilizing the principal claimant, or his wife, as they are 44 and 41 years old respectively, and have not had a child for four years. The claimants lived in the city of XXXX in Guangdong Province. Article 53 of Guangdong family planning regulations indicates that the penalty for an out of plan birth is a fine, and that the fine increases for any additional out of plan births.9\n[57] I acknowledge that there have been forced abortions and sterilizations in Guangdong Province, but note that there is no evidence available to the panel that such practices have occurred since 2012. I further note in this regard, a 2012 directive issued by the National Population and Planning Commission of China banning the \"enforcement of family planning policy carried out in a brutal way.\"10\n[58] I also acknowledge that family planning policies are unevenly enforced in China, and in some instances local officials forced women to have abortions and sterilizations. I note, however, the wide variation in provincial practices, and further note, there is no evidence that such actions occurred in Guangdong Province and in particular in XXXX XXXX since 2012.\n[59] Country documentary evidence indicates that historically, Guangdong authorities have taken a more relaxed approach to family planning. In 2011, the director of Guangdong's Population and Family Planning Commission stated he had applied for \"approval to be the leader in the country in the relaxation of the family-planning policy.\"11\n[60] I note that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Guangdong Province XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I find, in the context of Guangdong's historical flexibility in regard to the implementation of family planning regulations, and the indication in these regulations that a fine is charged for having an out-of-plan child, that it is likely that officials in XXXX XXXX would follow the 2012 directive as to the use of force in implementing family planning policy. As noted above, there is no evidence of any forced abortions or sterilizations since 2012.\n[61] I cite the 2015 decision of the Federal Court in Yu,12 in which the Court noted the panel recognized that although forced sterilization and forced abortion are illegal in China, such practices still occur. The Court further noted, the panel relied on evidence of conditions in the applicant's province of Guangdong and found sufficient safeguards against these forced measures. The Court noted as well that evidence shows that Chinese citizens may be required to pay a monetary fine. The Court also noted the jurisprudence of this Court, which has held that such fines do not amount to persecution.\n[62] I further cite the decision of the Federal Court in Liang,13 in which the Court reviewed Guangdong family planning documentation, and noted the regulations indicate that a fine is charged for an out-of-plan birth and the fine is multiplied by the total of out-of-plan children. The Court further noted the variation in family planning policy in China and found there was insufficient evidence to establish that the applicants would face forced sterilization in Guangdong and dismissed the appeal.\nTwo-Child policy\n[63] There is new country documentary evidence concerning the implementation of the two-child policy.14 This document cites a professor with the Institute of Population and Labour Economics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. According to the professor, \"all children born should be registered, no matter if they are second or third or higher births, prior to or after the new regulations.\"15 This document further states that Guangdong Province has officially de-linked fines and hukou registration for those born outside the rules, although a fine must be paid eventually. Therefore, the claimants' children born in Trinidad and Canada could be registered in a hukou and attend school if they decided to reside in China.\n[64] I further cite the decision of the Federal Court in Huang, which concerns a couple who had a fourth child and who feared being forced to wear an IUD and be subject to forced sterilization if they were to return to China. The Court noted the applicants bear the burden of proof and submitted no evidence suggesting that a family with a fourth child was at any greater risk than families who had a second or a third. The Court further noted, that the Board cited evidence that people with a second or third child in Guangdong province had paid fines but had not been required to wear an IUD or subject to sterilization. The Court found that it was reasonable to conclude, that past practice was likely to continue now that the applicants had four children. The Court dismissed the application.16\n[65] I find that, in the context of its analysis of Guangdong Province's family planning regulations, its practices in this regard since 2012, and its apparent practices since the implementation of the two-child policy, that the claimants will not be at risk of persecution if they were to return to China with three children and that the penalty would be a fine which Federal Court jurisprudence has found not to be persecutory.\n[66] In sum, I find, on the basis of the analysis above, that if the claimants were to return to China there is less than a mere possibility that they would be subject to persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, that they would be subject to the harms pursuant to subsection 97(1) of the IRPA, based on the Family planning policies of China..\nSur Place Christian Claim\n[67] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant is not a genuine Christian.\n[68] The claimant testified that he fears returning to China because of his new-found faith as a Pentecostal Christian.\n[69] The claimant was asked if this was the first Christian church he ever attended. He testified that he had heard of Christian churches in Trinidad but he did not go to any churches. The claimant was then asked if his wife and children go to church with him, and he responded that they sometimes do when he really wants them to come. He was asked if his wife and children ever attended another church before the one he now attends, he responded that he thinks they did when they first came to Canada. However, in the update to the PIF the claimants submitted, it is clearly indicated as a lead-in to the allegations that the principal claimant is now attending a church in Canada that his whole family attended church in Trinidad for a short while, but stopped attending due to violence. The claimant had no coherent explanation for the inconsistency. I draw a negative inference as to the credibility of his story of being a Christian.\n[70] The claimant submitted a letter from Reverend XXXX XXXX which was received by the Board only two days before the hearing. In the letter, Rev. XXXX attested to the claimant's regular attendance since XXXX XXXX, 2015. The claimant also submitted a baptismal certificate17 dated XXXX XXXX, 2018. In his letter, Reverend XXXX does not indicate how he monitors attendance, as he supervises several of his churches. Furthermore, the letter does not indicate what the pre-conditions were, if any, for baptism.\n[71] In Li, Madam Justice Gleason stated as follows:\nMore particularly, the burden of establishing the sincerity of his beliefs rested with the applicant. The Board's determination that he had not discharged this burden was based on its assessment of the applicant's credibility: the fact that he had obviously fabricated a story about what occurred in China, had lied during his testimony before the Board and had offered no convincing proof of a conversion experience in Canada. Apart from the pastor's letter, the baptismal certificate and the photographs, there was no other evidence offered by the applicant to support his claim to be a true Christian. The Board was in no way obliged to accept these documents as proof of the sincerity of the applicant's religious beliefs, especially in light of the applicant's lack of credibility and earlier fraudulent attempt to enter Canada. In this regard, I endorse the comment of Justice Pinard in Jin ... at para 20, that:\n....it would be absurd to grant a sur place claim every time a pastor provides a letter attesting to an applicant's membership in his church.18\n[72] The question to be answered deals with the sincerity of the claimant's faith, which is difficult to gauge. I find the motivation of the claimant questionable, since his conversion is recent and he was not credible in regard to his introduction to a Christian church in Trinidad.\n[73] The claimant testified that he does not read the Bible because he does not know the Chinese characters very well, but he learns about the Bible by listening to the pastor and other testimonials, and by watching television. He also stated that he goes to Bible classes.\n[74] Although the claimant testified that he joined the Pentecostal religion, he does not know what Pentecostal means. When asked what a Pentecostal religion is, he testified that it means that you have to learn the Bible and believe. Although the claimant does not have much education, it would be expected, that after more than three years of attending the church, he would know why his Christian church is called Pentecostal.\n[75] The claimant was asked about the main things he believes in. He testified that he believes in the Trinity, the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. However, the claimant could not say anything more about the Trinity. When asked to tell more about the Trinity, the claimant gave evasive answers and did not answer the question.\n[76] The claimant, despite being baptized, also did know the purpose and effect of Baptism, in that the sacrament washes away sins. The claimants sees Baptism only as having proof that he is a Christian.\n[77] I do acknowledge that a person's knowledge of Christianity is not necessarily a benchmark of true adherence to the faith. The claimant had some minimal knowledge, considering he has allegedly been practicing Christianity for more than three and a half years. However, he lacks the understanding of some of the basic Christian concepts which he himself indicated were his beliefs.\n[78] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that owing to the earlier credibility findings about the claimant not being forthright about his first attendance at church, and his motivation about coming to Canada, that he joined a Christian Church for the purposes of enhancing his chances of remaining in Canada by having another basis for his refugee claim. There is no evidence that the claimant's Christian practice has come to the attention of Chinese authorities.\n[79] In consideration of all the evidence, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant failed to establish his sur place claim with credible, convincing, and cogent evidence\n[80] In the alternative, even if the claimant is a genuine practicing Christian, the documentary evidence indicates that it is likely that he could practice his faith in China. He did not adduce evidence that he had come to the attention of the Chinese authorities or that the Pentecostals have any particular profile that the Chinese authorities would find objectionable. Reverend XXXX himself indicates that he has travelled to China several times.\n[81] I note that certain religious or spiritual groups are banned by law in China. The criminal law defines banned groups as cults. The following is noted:\nCertain religious or spiritual groups are banned by law. The criminal law defines banned groups as \"cult organizations,\" and those belonging to them can be sentenced to prison. A judicial explanation states this term refers to \"those illegal groups that have been found using religions, qigong [a traditional Chinese exercise discipline], or other things as a camouflage, deifying their leading members, recruiting and controlling their members, and deceiving people by molding and spreading superstitious ideas, and endangering society.\" There are no published criteria for determining, or procedures for challenging, such a designation. The government maintains a ban on the Guanyin Method Sect (Guanyin Famen or the Way of the Goddess of Mercy), Zhong Gong (a qigong exercise discipline), and Falun Gong. The government also considers several Christian groups to be \"evil cults,\" including the Shouters, Eastern Lightning, Society of Disciples (Mentu Hui), Full Scope Church (Quan Fanwei Jiaohui), Spirit Sect, New Testament Church, Three Grades of Servants (San Ban Puren), Association of Disciples, Lord God Sect, Established King Church, Unification Church, Family of Love, and South China Church.19\n[82] The documentary evidence does indicate that there are five state-sanctioned religions in China: Buddhism, Taoism, Muslim, Catholicism, and Protestantism. Churches of these religions are permitted to register with the government and their adherents are allowed to hold worship services.20 The claimant has not indicated that he would not attend a registered Protestant church in China.\n[83] The documentary evidence is mixed and there are examples of authorities harassing congregants of unregistered churches. I acknowledge that China Aid reported, that in January 2016, a Christian church in Fuqing, Fujian province was forcibly demolished for failing to register with the local government. It was located in a remote area and attended by approximately 50 followers.\n[84] However, I note that there are millions of practicing Christians living in China and that the Chinese authorities generally tolerate small house churches. I also note, the various pieces of documentary evidence which indicate that authorities generally do not bother Christian followers who meet in small groups. The number of practicing Christians in China varies depending on the documentary evidence; however, the estimated number of Christians in China are estimated to be between 70 and 80 million. It is reported that many of these congregate in illegal house churches. The exact number is difficult to estimate because many worship in underground house churches.21\n[85] The United Kingdom Home Office reports, that generally, the risk of persecution for Christians expressing and living their faith in China is very low and statistically negligible. The Chinese constitution protects religious freedom and the Religious Affairs Regulations 2005 (RRA) provides for the conditions under which Christian churches and their leaders may operate. The same document reports that there has been a rapid growth of Christianity; this is true for both the state registered churches and the house churches. The report indicates that individuals move freely between the registered churches and the unregistered churches according to their worship preferences. The evidence indicates, that generally, many millions of Christians worshipping in unregistered churches are able to express their faith as they wish.22\n[86] It is also reported that the evidence does not support a finding that there is a consistent pattern of persecution, serious harm, or other breach of fundamental human rights for individuals attending unregistered house churches. The adverse treatment is confined to closing down church buildings where permission has not been obtained for use as a church and\/or preventing or interrupting unauthorized public worship or demonstrations. There have been reports of a risk of persecution, serious harm, or ill-treatment for those individuals who choose to worship in unregistered churches and who conduct themselves in such a way as to attract the local authorities' attention to them or their political, social, or cultural views.23\n[87] The constitution allows for freedom of religion but it limits protections for religious practice to normal religious activities where \"normal\" is not defined in the constitution. It is also reported, that the constitution provides for the right to hold or to not hold a religious belief, and it states that state organs, public organizations, and individuals may not discriminate against citizens \"... who believe in, or do not believe in, any religion.\"24\n[88] I note that the documentary evidence reports that:\n[89] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that should the claimant wish to continue his religious activities upon return to China, he could do so in the registered church or in one of the family churches. There are many Christian congregations he could attend without attracting the interest of authorities. The documentary evidence indicates that the vast majority of Christians in China are able to freely practice their faith.\nSUMMARY\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\n[90] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants have not established that any of them would be persecuted in Trinidad. Therefore the two children, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, who are citizens of Trinidad can return to that country. There is also no evidence that the claimants cannot become Chinese citizens if they give up their Trinidadian citizenship, as China does not allow dual citizenship.\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\n[91] In balancing the different factors as outlined in Zeng, my finding that the claimants lost their permanent residents status in Trinidad deliberately as they were asylum shopping, added to my finding that, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants would not be persecuted in China, I find weighs heavily toward the finding that the claimants are excluded from refugee protection.\nCONCLUSION\n[92] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants born in Trinidad, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, are citizens of Trinidad and Tobago and are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. Their claims for refugee protection are rejected.\n[93] I find that the other three claimants, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX are excluded pursuant to 1E as per s. 98 of IRPA. They are therefore neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. Their claims for refugee protection are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Rose Andrachuk\"\nRose Andrachuk\nMarch 7, 2019\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n2 Exhibit 2.\n3 Exhibit 1, Package of information from the referring CBSA\/CIC.\n4 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (S.C. 2001, c. 27), Schedule (Subsection 2(1)), Sections E and F of Article 1 of the United Nations Convention Relating To The Status Of Refugees, Article 1 E.\n5 Zeng, Guanqiu v.

She married in 2004. The marriage produced one child.\n[4] After the birth of the claimant's child in 2005, she was forced to wear an IUD (intrauterine device). In XXXX 2011, the claimant was forced to have an abortion after it was learned that she was pregnant. She began to suffer lower back pain. Medication did not relieve the pain. The claimant asked to have her IUD removed; this request was refused.\n[5] In XXXX 2011, the claimant's friend, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX suggested that the claimant try Falun Gong to relieve her pain. The claimant expressed her fears because Falun Gong is an illegal practice. A month later, when the claimant's health problems persisted, XXXX convinced the claimant to begin the practice of Falun Gong. After two months of practice, the claimant's health improved. She then joined a group practice when XXXX explained that there is a strong energy field in a group resulting in faster effects of the practice.\n[6] On XXXX XXXX, 2012, members of the Public Security Bureau (PBS) raided the claimant's Falun Gong group practice. The claimant was able to escape. She went to the home of her cousin where she hid. The claimant kept contact with her husband through the telephone. She learned that the PSB had searched her family home and the PBS advised her husband that she should surrender herself to the PSB. The claimant also learned that three members of her group had been arrested. The PBS returned to the claimant's home and the home of her relatives in search of her. The claimant was dismissed from work and her husband was laid off from his work because of the claimant's Falun Gong practice.\n[7] The claimant arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2012 and made a claim for refugee protection on September 25, 2012.\nThe Issue of Self-Representation\n[8] The claimant appeared at her hearing with no legal representation.\n[9] The claimant indicated at the commencement of the hearing that she was aware of her right to legal counsel but indicated that she was prepared to proceed in the absence of counsel.\n[10] Given that the claimant was not represented by counsel at the hearing, I ensured that the following procedural safeguards were in place for the hearing.\n[11] I explained to the claimant the procedures of the hearing. The issues were outlined to the claimant. I reviewed the claimant's PIF with her and she acknowledged that the interpreter she engaged to assist with the PIF had informed her of the entire contents of the PIF. I reviewed all of the documents on file for the claimant's hearing. At the end of the hearing, the claimant was provided time to compose a short submission and then to read it to me.\nDETERMINATION\n[12] I find that the claimant, XXXX XXXX, is not a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the IRPA, nor is she a person in need of protection pursuant to s. 97(1) of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\n[13] The issue in this hearing was:\n* Credibility\nIdentity\n[14] The claimant's personal identity and country of citizenship have been established, on a balance of probabilities, as per a certified true copy of her passport3 as well as her Resident Identity Card and Hukou (household register).4\nCredibility\n[15] In assessing the credibility of the evidence presented by the claimant, I kept in mind the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Maldonado5 wherein the Court stated, in part, that \"when a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there be reason to doubt their truthfulness.\" However, I find that the claimant failed to advance her claim with evidence that is credible. I found the claimant's testimony to be untrustworthy. I am aware that none of the credibility concerns raised here may be sufficient, each on its own, to negate this claim. However, the cumulative effect of all of them is that I do not have sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence upon which to base a determination that the claimant is a Convention refugee. As the court of appeal in Sheikh,6 MacGuigan, J.A. held:\n... even without disbelieving every word [a claimant] has uttered, a ... panel may reasonably find him so lacking in credibility that it concludes that there is no credible evidence relevant to his claim ... In other words, a general finding of a lack of credibility on the part of the applicant may conceivably extend to all relevant information emanating from his testimony.\nThe PSB\n[16] For the following reasons, I am not persuaded that the claimant was or is wanted by the PSB.\n[17] During the hearing, the claimant testified that she was in contact with her husband while she was in hiding. I asked the claimant what information her husband had provided to her with regards to activities of the PSB. The claimant testified that she was informed that the PSB wanted her to turn herself in. When asked if her husband provided any further information, the claimant testified that she had been told many things but she could not remember. I referred the claimant to her written narrative in which she alleges that while she was in hiding her husband informed her that the PSB had searched their family home. The claimant then testified that it was only after she arrived in Canada was she given this information by her husband. She testified further that while she was in hiding, her husband had told her she was wanted by the PSB but he had told her nothing about the search. I reminded the claimant that in her narrative she indicates that she obtained information about the PSB's search while she was in hiding. The claimant testified that when she wrote her PIF narrative she had the assistance of a consultant and she did not know how her story was written. I do not find this explanation satisfactory. The claimant signed her PIF as \"complete, true, and correct.\"7 As indicated above, at the beginning of the hearing, the claimant affirmed that the interpreter of her PIF had informed her of the contents of the PIF. In addition, I could accept that the claimant might have forgotten all that her husband told her while she was allegedly in hiding. However, that is not the case here. The claimant provided testimony that contradicts her PIF narrative, that is, she testified that she received the information about the PSB search after she arrived in Canada. As a result of this testimony, I find the claimant's credibility undermined.\n[18] The claimant testified that she obtained a passport in 2010 in order to travel with her son. Stamps in the passport indicate that the claimant travelled to Malaysia in XXXX 2011 and to Japan in XXXX 2011.8 Upon being asked, the claimant testified that when she was not travelling she kept her passport at home in her bedroom. As indicated above, the claimant alleges that the PSB searched her home shortly after she escaped the PSB raid. During the hearing, the claimant testified that while she was in hiding she attended the US embassy in order to obtain a visa. Upon being asked, she testified that her passport was required at that time. I reminded the claimant that she had earlier testified that the PSB had raided her home. I then asked her why the PSB would not have taken her passport at that time to circumvent her leaving the country. The claimant testified that she guessed that they did not find the passport which she had placed among the baby clothes. I find this explanation unsatisfactory. According to the independent documentary evidence, ordinary passports are issued by the department of the Ministry of Public Security9 and Chinese citizens who exit or enter China submit their exit\/entry documents such as passports or to the exit\/entry border inspection authorities for examination, go through the prescribed formalities.10 I, therefore, find it reasonable to conclude that the PSB would have been aware that the claimant owned a passport at the time of their alleged raid. A Response to Information Request (RIR)11 indicates that if circumstances are considered serious, it is conceivable that a passport would be seized by the PSB. Given that the claimant alleges that when the PSB searched her home, other members of her Falun Gong group had been arrested, I believe the situation to have been serious. I, therefore, find it highly unlikely that the PSB did not confiscate the claimant's passport to prevent her escaping China. The claimant's credibility is, thus, undermined.\n[19] During the hearing, I asked the claimant how she was able to escape from the PSB raid. She testified that she was the first to run out the back door while other members of her group collected items before attempting to escape. She testified that she was able to escape to the home of a friend. When I asked how the PSB, a highly professional organization determined to eradicate the practice of Falun Gong, would not have organized their raid such as to prevent any escapes. The claimant testified that their lookouts were very experienced Falun Gong practitioners who could identify any suspicious looking people. The independent documentary evidence does not support this explanation. According to one RIR, the PSB is the largest component of the police force in China.12 According to a 2016 report from the United Kingdom Home Office the authorities continued a campaign, initiated in 1999, of extensive, systematic, and in some cases violent efforts to pressure Falun Gong practitioners to renounce their belief in and practice of Falun Gong.13 Another RIR14 indicates that the Chinese government established the 6-10 Office (Office 610) in 1999 to implement its ban on the Falun Gong. The methods of Office 610 include surveillance and severe punishments. Thus, I find it is neither plausible nor credible that agents of such an organization as the PSB, intent on eradicating Falun Gong, would not have surrounded the house rather than simply arrive at the front door allowing practitioners to escape out the back door and to flee from a nearby bus stop. The claimant's credibility is, thus, further compromised.\n[20] In her PIF narrative, the claimant alleges that following the raid by the PSB she escaped to the home of her cousin where she remained in hiding. However, I found that the claimant's oral testimony did not conform to this allegation. Initially the claimant testified that she escaped to the home of a friend who is a cousin of her husband. Shortly thereafter she altered this testimony and stated that she first ran to the home of a friend who then drove her to the home of her cousin. I referred the information in the PIF asked her to explain the discrepancies. The claimant testified that she did not wish to cause problems for her friend so she avoided providing this information in her PIF. I indicated to the claimant that she had mentioned other people in her PIF and then asked why she had omitted receiving help from one particular friend. The claimant testified that this friend had just had a baby. I find the claimant's explanations unsatisfactory. I note that the name of the cousin is not provided in the PIF and the claimant could have chosen to indicate that a friend, similarly unnamed, assisted her in arriving at the cousin's home. I find this to be an instance where the claimant could not keep her story straight. The claimant's credibility is, thus, diminished.\nIn hiding\n[21] The claimant alleges in her written narrative that she was in hiding from the time of the PSB raid on XXXX XXXX, 2012 until she left China in XXXX 2012. I am not persuaded of this allegation. Aside from the findings above that discuss the claimant's activities with regards to where she hid and what information she received while in hiding, I provide the following reasons.\n[22] During the hearing, the claimant was asked how long she remained in hiding at the home of her cousin. She testified that she remained there about three weeks. I referred the claimant to her PIF in which she indicates that she remained at the home of her cousin until she left China. The claimant testified that she left the home of her cousin and had to remain for a few weeks in XXXX XXXX city awaiting her passport. I referred the claimant to her PIF in which she states that she lived at one address from XXXX 2012 until XXXX 2012.15 The claimant then changed her testimony and stated that when she went to XXXX XXXX city she stayed at various places a few days at a time. I find the claimant's explanations unsatisfactory. I find the claimant's credibility is thus further diminished; her altered testimony factors in this finding.\nSnakehead\n[23] I am not persuaded that because she was wanted by the PSB, the claimant employed a snakehead to assist her in leaving China.\n[24] When the claimant was asked, she testified that she travelled from China to United States (US) on her genuine passport. The claimant testified that she had no problems leaving China. When asked to explain how she left safely given that she was wanted by the PSB, the claimant explained that the snakehead had made all of the arrangements for exiting from China to Hong Kong. I note that, according to one RIR, individuals who wish to travel to Hong Kong from Mainland China must obtain an Exit-entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong.16\n[25] The claimant testified that the snakehead did all of the work in assisting her to obtain a US visa. When asked, she testified that she did not know if the snakehead provided false documents with the visa application. The claimant testified that once she arrived in Canada her passport was returned to her. Canadian immigration officials later seized the passport.17 I acknowledge that snakeheads may have connections with specific customs officials to circumvent security at Chinese exit points as well as means of assisting in obtaining a US visa. It must also be acknowledged that smuggling is a high risk and high reward endeavour. It is reasonable to expect that smugglers do everything possible to protect their illicit enterprises, which would include protecting their collaborators at Chinese facilities. Given the snakehead may have fraudulently obtained the US visa contained in the passport and the indication18 that the passport was stamped by the customs officer when the claimant departed China, it is reasonable to expect that the snakehead would not allow the claimant to retain her passport in the event it was traced back to the snakehead or his customs or possible visa collaborators. In this regard, I find the claimant's testimony neither plausible nor credible and this leads me to draw a negative inference regarding her credibility.\n[26] During the hearing, the claimant testified that she entered Canada from the US by walking through a park north of Seattle. She testified that she was instructed by an associate of the snakehead to pose as a tourist in the park. When asked, the claimant testified that she had no problems with security while crossing the border through the park from the US to Canada. I indicated my general knowledge of heightened security at US borders since 9\/11. I then asked the claimant how it was possible that she crossed the border undetected. She testified that they were lots of tourists about at that time. While possible, I do not find crossing the border through a park undetected by security to be probable. I am guided by the words of Mr. Justice Mahoney in Orelien19 wherein he stated:\nIt seems to me one cannot be satisfied the evidence is credible or trustworthy unless satisfied that it is probably so, not just possibly so.\nFalun Gong practice in China\n[27] I am not persuaded that the claimant was or is a genuine practitioner of Falun Gong. I found that the claimant could not provide, in a forthright manner, information about her Falun Gong practice in China.\n[28] When asked, the claimant testified that she began her Falun Gong practice in XXXX XXXX XXXX 2011 while in China. This testimony is consistent with information found in her PIF narrative.20 I asked the claimant if at that time she had been aware of the authority's stance regarding the practice of Falun Gong. The claimant testified that she did not know. I asked the claimant if at that time she had been aware that the practice of Falun Gong was illegal. She responded in the negative. I referred the claimant to her written narrative in which she states that when her friend suggested she try Falun Gong to alleviate her health problems, the claimant was afraid to do so because she knew it was illegal. I asked the claimant to explain the discrepancies. The claimant testified that at that time she had not seen anyone practice Falun Gong before and had not heard anyone talk about the practice. Since this response did not provide an adequate explanation, I rephrased my question. The claimant testified that at the beginning she didn't know about Falun Gong and when she asked, she was told that it was illegal. I find this explanation unsatisfactory. Information provided by the claimant in her PIF clearly states that she was aware of the illegality of Falun Gong and this is why she was reluctant to begin the practice. As a result of this testimony, I find the claimant's credibility compromised.\n[29] When asked about her initial practice, the claimant testified that she practised privately with her friend for about a month and a half before joining a group. I then asked the claimant to describe a typical week of her Falun Gong practice in China once she had joined the group. The claimant testified she alternated her practice, one week with her friend and one week with the group. The claimant testified that the group practices she attended were held at the home of XXXX XXXX. When asked if she attended group practice elsewhere, the claimant testified that she heard of another location but attended only at XXXX XXXX home and only a few times. I referred the claimant to her written narrative in which she indicates that she attended group practice on a weekly basis and at two different locations. I asked her to explain the discrepancies. The claimant testified that she had earlier testified that she attended another home besides that of XXXX XXXX and that she did not know the name of the home owner. I find this explanation unsatisfactory because it contradicts the claimant's earlier testimony. I find the claimant could not keep her story straight. An important indicator of credibility is whether a witness can consistently tell her particular story.21 I, thus, find the claimant's credibility further compromised.\nFalun Gong practice in Canada\n[30] The claimant testified that she began to practice Falun Gong when she arrived in Canada in XXXX 2012 but after her father died in 2015 she completely stopped the practice. She testified that she also stopped the practice because of her son's negative response to her practice.\n[31] I asked the claimant to describe her weekly practice in Canada from 2012 to 2015. I found the claimant's testimony to be vague. I found it necessary to continually prompt the claimant which resulted in very short responses. I found that the claimant was unable to provide in a forthright manner any detailed description of her three year practice in Canada. I, thus, draw a negative inference.\nFalun Gong knowledge\n[32] In assessing the claimant's Falun Gong knowledge, I kept in mind the claimant's limited formal education and the Federal Court decision in which the Honourable Justice Mandamin stated that:22\nThe RPD conducted a rigorous and microscopic investigation of the Applicant's knowledge of Falun Gong.\nIn result, I conclude the RPD held the Applicant to an unrealistically high standard of knowledge of Falun Gong and imposed its own understanding of Falun Gong upon the Applicant.\n[33] Nevertheless, I am not persuaded that the claimant was or is a genuine practitioner of Falun Gong.\n[34] During the hearing, the claimant testified that for the short time she practised Falun Gong in China she began to study the text of Master Li. She testified that in Canada while she practiced Falun Gong she read Master Li's text almost every day.\n[35] Since earlier in the hearing, the claimant had testified about truthfulness, one of the principles of Falun Gong, I asked her to explain what Master Li means by the principle of truth. The claimant testified that one is to be a truthful person and do deeds with a conscience of abiding to good things. She added that one should not do bad deeds. I indicated to the claimant that according to Master Li the principle of truthfulness involved more than being a truthful or honest person. I then asked the claimant if she could provide further details of the principle of truth. The claimant testified that Master Li talks about truth and each person may have a different understanding. She testified further that she knows she had to be truthful and not do bad things. Since this was not the correct answer, I asked the claimant if she was aware that Master Li says that being truthful involved informing others of the benefits of Falun Gong. She responded in the affirmative. I asked the claimant if she was aware that Master Li says that being truthful involves informing others of the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners. She responded in the affirmative. When I asked the claimant why she did not provide these definitions when asked to explain the principle of truth, she testified that she forgot. I find that the claimant did not provide a satisfactory explanation. The principal of truthfulness for Falun Gong practitioners is relatively straightforward. The claimant had 11 years of formal education in China. She allegedly studied the philosophy of Falun Gong both in China and in Canada. I believe this to be sufficient time to allow the claimant to explain the principle of truthfulness in a simple manner. As a result of this testimony, I find that claimant's credibility compromised.\n[36] The claimant had earlier testified about black matter and when asked, she was able to correctly explain that it developed in the body as a result of bad things one or one's ancestors had done. However, when asked to explain the basic concept of attachments, she testified that attachments were things one could not let go of. This answer was rather vague, so I asked the claimant to state the attachment that Master Li identified as most harmful. The claimant was silent and then testified that Master Li talked about attachments but she could not explain. I indicated to the claimant that Master Li provides many examples of attachments in his text and then asked for an example. The claimant testified that she did not remembers. I advised the claimant that Master Li identifies jealousy as the most harmful attachment. I then asked her what Master Li says will happen if one cannot rid oneself of jealousy. The claimant testified that a person would become kind if they rid themselves of jealousy. I find this is not the correct response. Master Li states that if one does not rid oneself of jealousy one's cultivated thoughts become fragile. I reminded the claimant that Master Li considered alcohol an attachment. When asked, the claimant was unable to state what Master Li says will happen if one cannot rid oneself of the use of alcohol.\n[37] I note that being a Falun Gong practitioner is more than performing exercises and learning a series of facts, it involves the adoption of a philosophy and applying that philosophy to your daily life. While the claimant may know a few terms, she has failed to demonstrate that she adopted the philosophy of Falun Gong to her daily life.\n[38] In addition, given that I am not persuaded that the claimant was an adherent of the practice of Falun Gong in China, her vague testimony regarding her practice in Canada and her lack of basic knowledge of Falun Gong, I find that I am not persuaded of his practice of Falun Gong in Canada. As the Court explains in Jiang, the RPD can \"import its credibility findings into its assessment of an application's sur place claim.\"23 The RPD can, \"assess an applicant's genuineness and therefore its sur place claim in light of credibility concerns relating to the original authenticity of a claim.\"24 Since I have made negative credibility findings with regards to alleged events in China, I, therefore, import these findings onto the assessment of the claimant's claim of her practice of Falun Gong in Canada.\nForced use of an IUD\n[39] In her written narrative, the claimant alleges that after the birth of her child she was forced to wear an IUD. She alleges that she fears she will be forced to wear an IUD if she returns to China. During the hearing, I pointed out to the claimant that the One Child Policy law changed in China since she left in 2012. I indicated that the Two Child Family Planning Policy came into effect in January 2016. I asked the claimant if she feared that she would be forced to wear an IUD if she returned to China now. The claimant testified that she no longer has a family in China. She had earlier testified that her husband has divorced her and she seldom speaks with her son. She testified further that she did not know what the situation would be if she returned to China.\n[40] Given the independent documentary evidence on file, I find it highly unlikely that the claimant would be forced to wear an IUD. My reasons are as follows.\n[41] According to one RIR, as of February 2017, 29 out of the 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government have revised their regulations in implementing the two-child law including Guangdong.25 I note that according to the claimant's PIF she resided in the province of Guangdong before relocating to Canada.26 According to two recent articles, there are indications that China is about to remove altogether the limits on the number of children allowed.27\nSummary\n[42] I am aware, as stated at the outset, that none of the credibility concerns raised above may be sufficient on their own to negate this claim. However, the cumulative effect of these is that I do not have sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence upon which to base a determination that the claimant is a Convention refugee.\n[43] I find, therefore, that the claimant is not a Convention refugee.\nSection 97(1)\n[44] The claimant advanced no persuasive evidence to suggest she would face any danger, that is, more likely than not, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture.\n[45] Given the finding above, that the claimant in not credible with regards to her Falun Gong practice, and that it is highly unlikely that she would be forced to wear an IUD, I find that she is not a person who faces a risk to her life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if she were to return to China.\n[46] For these reasons, the claimant is not a person in need of protection.\nCONCLUSION\n[47] The claimant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection pursuant to section 96 or subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Therefore, this claim is rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Lesley Mason\"\nLesley Mason\nFebruary 18, 2019\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, sections 96, 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b).\n2 Exhibit 2.\n3 Exhibit 1.\n4 Exhibit 6.\n5 Maldonado, Pedro Enrique Juarez v.

Fellow students ridiculed her, while her teachers were not interested in her. So much so, she was unable to complete her primary education. Her adult life has been marked by further discrimination. Notably, the claimant was attacked by Hungarian nationalists, who kicked her in the stomach, causing her to miscarry the 17 weeks old foetus she was carrying.\n[3] The adult male claimant alleges, that he endured years of persecution in Hungary because of his ethnicity. \"Guardists\" abused him, and he received several anonymous death threats. He was held back at school and had difficulty obtaining work. He also alleged, that the police did not provide them with state protection, when they tried to make a complaint.\nISSUES\n[4] The central issue in the claim is credibility. With regard to the adult male claimant, delay in claiming is also a relevant consideration.\nIdentity\n[5] Copies of the claimants Hungarian passports, and the principal claimant's national identity card, were among the documents provided to the Board by CBSA. Also on file, are letters from the Roma Community Centre on Dundas Street West, Toronto, that attest to the Roma identity of the claimants. Based on these documents, as well as the oral testimony of the principal claimant and her spouse, the panel is satisfied as to the claimants' personal identity and citizenship.\nCredibility and Well Founded Fear\nThe Principal Claimant\n[6] At the start of the hearing, the principal claimant swore to the truth of the content of the PIFs, as amended.3 When asked, she denied wanting to make any further amendment to the PIFs, neither were there any documents that the claimants wanted to rely on, that had not been put before the panel. The entire family were relying on the narratives of the principal, and adult male claimants, i.e. the parents. The Minister participated in the hearing, by filing documents, and making written submissions in relation to the issue of credibility.\n[7] In RKL v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 2003 FTC 116, the Federal Court opined, that credibility forms the crux of the Board's determination of refugee protection claims. The Court put the issue this way:\nThe determination of an applicant's credibility is the heartland of the Board's jurisdiction. This Court has found that the Board has well-established expertise in the determination of questions of fact, particularly in the evaluation of the credibility and the subjective fear of persecution of an applicant: see Rahaman v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2000] F.C.J. No. 1800 at para. 38 (QL) (T.D.); and Cepeda-Gutierrez v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1998), 1998 CanLII 8667 (FC), 157 F.T.R. 35 at para. 14.4\n[8] In Maldonado,5 Federal Court of Appeal, (FCA), set out the principle, that when a claimant swears to the truth of certain facts, this creates a presumption that the facts are true, unless there is valid reason to doubt their truthfulness. In other words, a claimant's sworn testimony gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of truthfulness.\n[9] The panel also considered and applied Guideline 4, which addressed the difficulties that women claimants, fearing gender-related persecution, may have in presenting their cases.6 As well, the panel considered the UNHCR handbook with respect to the difficulties that claimants, generally, may have in substantiating claims. Nonetheless, the panel found that the principal claimant's evidence, and oral testimony, was fraught with serious credibility concerns that it was unable to resolve in her favour, even after it took these guiding principles into consideration.\n[10] The first concerns, arose from the contradiction between statements that the principal claimant is reported as having made at the Port of Entry (POE).7 As stated above, in her PIF narrative, the principal claimant claimed to have a well-founded fear of persecution in Hungary, by reason of her Roma ethnicity. She also described an incident when she was kicked in the stomach, causing her to miscarry. She also claimed to have been raped by members of the Hungarian Guard, all of which led to her becoming depressed.\nConcerns arising from Statements made at the Port of Entry\n[11] The principal claimant was interviewed twice. She was interviewed immediately upon arrival in Canada, and interviewed again after she was detained. The principal claimant's responses to the questions at Boxes 42 of her claim for refugee protection are recorded as, \"I am not afraid of anyone, I just want to let you know that there are no resources to live there.\" The claimant reiterates this statement at Box 43 of the claim, where she is recorded as stating,\nBecause in my country nothing exists, there is no food, there are no jobs, there are no jobs, I cannot work. How can I feed my family? I don't have shelter, I don't have a house and I don't have food. That is why I am here. I cannot support my family at all.\n[12] These statements stand in stark contradiction to her later statements, in her PIF, and in her oral testimony, that claim that a well-founded fear of persecution, based on racist incidents, in which Hungarian nationalists attacked, assaulted, and battered her with dire consequences to her physical well-being and mental health.8\n[13] In her submissions, the Minister's representative phrased the issue in the following terms, \"why would the principal claimant tell the officer who interviewed her that despite being Roma she had no have any fear of returning to her country?\"9 The Minister's representative pointed out, that the principal claimant had also told the officer that she was ready to return to Hungary. The Minister's representative took the position that the latter allegations in her PIF, were significantly contradictory of the statements the principal claimant made at the POE; and argued that these contradictory statements, called into question the overall credibility of the principal claimant.\n[14] The panel put the contradictions squarely to the principal claimant. She denied making the statements. She said she did not remember saying that she had no fear of returning to, or that she was willing to return to Hungary. She testified that while she remembered being interviewed, she had only a hazy memory about the interview. She remembered that she was asked what she feared in Hungary, and she remembered responding that she had been attacked, lost her child, and was very scared. She stated that she told the interviewing officer that her partner was in Toronto. She described her emotional state during the interview as \"very fearful and very stressed\". The principal claimant alleged that her emotional state had been negatively influenced by the officer, who had treated her very badly. Asked to explain in what way the officer treated her badly, the principal claimant testified that the officer told her that she would be sent back to Hungary on the next plane. The principal claimant also told the panel, that at the POE she was following the instructions of the agent who brought her to Canada. The agent had advised her to not state the true basis of her claim, until after she had gained entry into Canada, and spoken to a lawyer.\n[15] On considering the principal claimant's testimony, the panel concluded, that she had been less than straightforward when recounting her recollection of what had occurred at the POE. Both times that the principal claimant was interviewed, her responses were recorded, and the officer interviewing her made contemporaneous notes and observations regarding her and the interview. These responses, as translated by the interpreter, do not reflect the statements the principal claimant said she made. That is, the officer's notes do not mention that the claimant said she had been attacked, or had lost a child as a result; nor do they say that her partner was in Toronto. As indicated earlier, her responses at Boxes 42 and 43 indicate a purely economic motivation for the principal claimant's decision to come to Canada.\n[16] With respect to her spouse, the POE notes do not mention him. They mention a XXXX XXXX. The principal claimant told the officer that Mr. XXXX had invited her to visit him in Toronto, and would host her during the visit.10 In fact, the principal claimant sought permission to enter Canada to visit with Mr. XXXX. The officer noted, that when Mr. XXXX was telephoned, he denied ever extending such an invitation to the principal claimant.11 Mr. XXXX told the officer, that he was willing to put the principal claimant up for one night only.\n[17] The panel accepts, that during the initial interview, the principal claimant would have experienced some degree of fear and apprehension, after all, she was in a strange country being interviewed by a person in authority, and she could have no reference point for the likely outcome of the interview. Nonetheless, for the following reasons, the panel finds that there are valid reasons to doubt, and to reject, this aspect of the principal claimant's testimony.\n[18] Firstly, the first time that an attack on the principal claimant is mentioned is when she actually makes her claim for refugee protection.12 The principal claimant made a claim for Convention refugee protection two days after she arrived in Canada, and, according to her, after a female guard told her \"she did not have to cry as she was in a safe place.\" This guard encouraged her to call a lawyer. The panel does not accept that an agent would have counselled the claimant to put forward an entirely economic reason for coming to Canada, while at the same time advising her to talk to a lawyer. However, this is not the only, or primary, reason why the panel doubts, and rejects, the principal claimant's testimony.\n[19] The panel also doubts, and rejects, her claim that she does not remember telling the officer about Mr. XXXX, who she testified was the brother of her pastor because this testimony does not explain how the officer came to have his name and telephone number. In the panel's view, the only way the officer could come by this information, is if the principal claimant had provided it. Thus, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that on arriving in Canada, and on being interviewed, the principal claimant did name Mr. XXXX as the person she had come to visit, and did request entry into Canada for the purpose of visiting with him. The panel also finds, that she did provide the officer with Mr. XXXX telephone number. Therefore, it finds her response, that she did not remember this particular sequence of events, to be disingenuous and misleading.\n[20] As well, the panel does not accept that the principal claimant has as poor recall, of the events at the POE, as she claims to have, because her responses demonstrated significant recall of many of the core components. The principal claimant was able to recall how many officers were present at the initial interview, and what their respective roles were - one officer interviewed her, the other photographed her. She remembered well, talking about her spouse and the fact that he was already in Canada, as well as recounting the alleged assaults, and her fear of the Hungarian Guards. She also testified, that the officer had stressed the need for her to answer the questions truthfully, and she recalled being told that she appeared fearful.\n[21] The panel finds, that the level of detail about what the principal claimant claims she recalled is incompatible with a hazy memory of the interview. The panel finds that the principal claimant's memory appeared to fail only with respect to those areas that were potentially detrimental.\n[22] In particular, the panel found, that given that the principal claimant's spouse had preceded her some three months earlier, and given that the plan was to have the family reunite in Canada, it is reasonable to expect that the claimant would have told the officer that she, and the minors, were coming to reunite with her spouse. That the officer telephoned Mr. XXXX to verify her story of an invitation to visit with him, is, in the panel's view, indicative of the fact that the principal claimant did not mention her spouse at the POE as she claimed.\n[23] The principal claimant also volunteered, that the officer had given her an express opportunity to be truthful. She spontaneously testified, that the immigration officer had not only underscored to her that she should make truthful statements; he had also put it to her, that she appeared to be under duress, and encouraged her to \"come clean\" and to tell the truth. Her testimony in this regard was: \"At that moment the officer did notice that I was lying and he told me that I know you are under a threat, and now I have all of the documents supporting that I was under a threat.\"\n[24] While it is not clear to the panel, that the threat the officer perceived the principal claimant to be under, and the threat the claimant is referring to, is the same, (the officer seemed to have been concerned with the possibility of human trafficking); and, also, while the principal claimant may have been reluctant to deviate from the agent's \"script\", the panel finds that she had been given ample opportunity to be truthful about why she was coming to Canada, but had opted not to do so, even where she could have no fear of reprisal from the agent. Furthermore, while the panel does not expect that the claimant would have set out her claim in great detail, the panel is not persuaded that having been given an opening by the immigration officer, she would not have indicated that she was fleeing physical violence by nationalists, as she later claimed.\n[25] With regard to the principal claimant's allegation, that the initial interviewing officer had treated her badly, and had told her she would be sent back to Hungary on the next plane. The panel finds that, if made, this statement ought to be examined in the context of the principal claimant's statement that she feared nothing in Hungary, and was willing to return. Furthermore, the hearing was the first time, in the five-year history of the file, that the principal claimant had levelled such an accusation, despite being represented by counsel throughout. The panel finds that, in these circumstances, and given the seriousness of the accusation, it was reasonable to expect that she would have brought the accusation forward much earlier, given her later reliance on her mental health status. As a result, the panel concluded, that the accusation against the visa officer was, on a balance of probabilities, no more than a last minute addition designed to cover her inability to offer a satisfactory explanation, for the inconsistent statements that she made at the POE.\n[26] Accordingly, the panel accepts the officer's statements regarding the initial interview, and finds as fact, that during the initial interview, the principal claimant did say that while she was Roma, she did not have any fear of returning to Hungary, and was willing to do so. In doing so, the panel is mindful of the Federal Court's caution, citing Hathaway, that,\n...in evaluating the applicant's first encounters with Canadian immigration authorities or referring to the applicant's Port of Entry Statements, the Board should also be mindful of the fact that most refugees have lived experiences in their country of origin which give them good reason to distrust persons in authority.13\n[27] The panel understands the caution to mean, that the Board ought not to place undue emphasis on a claimant's behaviour during their first contact with Canadians. However, the panel is of the view, that where, as here, a claimant's behaviour at the POE, namely her utterances, stand in clear contradistinction to their later statements and where, the claimant is unable to provide a satisfactory explanation for the contradictions and\/or omissions, then the Board is entitled to make a negative credibility finding, as the panel is doing in this case.\n[28] The Federal Court, Appeal Division, has stated that,\nA person's first story is usually the most genuine and, therefore, the one to be most believed. That being said, although the failure to report a fact can be a cause for concern, it should not always be so. That, again depends on all the circumstances: see Fajardo v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1993] F.C.J. No. 915 at para. 5 (QL) (C.A.); Owusu-Ansah, supra; and Sheikh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2000 CanLII 15200 (FC), [2000] F.C.J. No. 568 (QL) (T.D.).\n[29] The panel finds that the principal claimant's initial statement at the POE, to the effect that, she did not have a well-founded fear of persecution in Hungary, that she had come to Canada for entirely economic reasons were, on a balance of probabilities, genuine. The panel also finds, that her statements at the POE call into question her later allegations in her PIF, and her oral testimony.\nThe Medical Evidence\n[30] The claimant submitted a number of medical documents to support her allegations, that she suffered several traumatic experiences in Hungary, and that these experiences have led to the development of mental health issues. In 2013, Dr. XXXX, from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), diagnosed the principal claimant as suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Major Depressive disorder. It is not clear on what basis the diagnosis was made. The physician states his impression that the principal claimant \"presents with classic symptoms of PTSD, as well as Major Depressive disorder\".\n[31] The panel asked the principal claimant how she came to consult with Dr. XXXX. She responded, that she was referred to him by her family doctor, Dr. XXXX, who states that \"it will be safer and better for the wellbeing of my patient (the principal claimant) if he (sic) remains in the country.\" The principal claimant met with Dr. XXXX only once, when she returned to CAMH on June 28, 2017, she did not see him. However, in 2013, both he and her counsel referred her to the Canadian Centre for Victims of Torture (CCVT). While the principal claimant did not disclose to Dr. XXXX that she had been raped in Hungary, he did give her information for the Women's Health Centre. She has visited the Centre three or four times since Dr. XXXX gave her the information in 2013. It appears, that the principal claimant did not seek the assistance of the CCVT until 2017, three years after she was first referred to Dr. XXXX. When asked, she testified that she had been receiving care from her family doctor. The 2017 letter from CAMH states, that the principal claimant reported that she 'is very depressed, cries every day and feels discouraged and hopeless\".14 It is clear from this self-report, that the principal claimant did not make a concerted effort to utilise the tools that were made available to her. She states that she was seeing her family doctor, and receiving treatment prescribed by him.\n[32] With the possible exception of Dr. XXXX, the medical personnel saw the principal claimant on two occasions only. Much of what is contained in the reports, was information that the principal claimant provided, all of which, in the panel's view, calls into question the sufficiency of the medical reports to establish the credibility of her assertions regarding the attacks, and their effect on her mental health. With respect to Dr. XXXX letter, the panel found, that he had crossed that intangible line between providing medical care and advocacy, when in respect to the principal claimant he wrote, \"it will be safer and better for the wellbeing of my patient if he [sic] remains in the country\".15 For these reasons, the panel gave less weight to the medical documents than it might otherwise have done.\nThe Hungarian Medical Documents\n[33] The principal claimant testified, that she had been receiving counselling since 2009. She was treated by a Dr. XXXX XXXX. She testified that she went to Dr. XXXX, because she had been unable to reconcile her problems by herself, and was suffering from insomnia and flashbacks.16 The medical report lists a number of conditions for which the principal claimant had been receiving treatment, but does not state how the claimant came to be receiving the treatment, that is, was she referred to Dr. XXXX, and, if so, by whom. Nor is it clear from his letter, what branch of medicine Dr. XXXX practices. Interestingly, Dr. XXXX recommended that the principal claimant move, as a way of dealing with her issues. He confirmed that she had taken his suggestion and moved to Canada.\n[34] The panel asked the principal claimant what Dr. XXXX meant, when he suggested that she move. She responded, that he told her to come to Canada, because he had heard that Canada was a safe country where nobody is attacked. If true, the panel confesses itself perplexed by Dr. XXXX recommendation, that the principal claimant come to Canada as a treatment for her psychological issues, instead of treating them himself. However, the panel does not interpret his statement in this manner. The panel infers that by advising the principal claimant to \"move and change location\", Dr. XXXX intended that she move within Hungary. In the absence of a clear indication of Dr. XXXX area of practice, as well as in the absence of information regarding the number of times he saw the principal claimant, or what tests or treatments were done or recommended, the panel is not persuaded that it could place significant reliance on Dr. XXXX letter.\n[35] The panel notes, that in his letter Dr. XXXX stated, that the principal claimant received treatment for PTSD in Hungary.17 This information came from the principal claimant herself. Accordingly, the panel finds Dr. XXXX medical note, to be of limited probative value in its assessment of the credibility of her claim, that she developed mental health issues because of the racist attacks she experienced in Hungary.\n[36] Regarding the principal claimant's psychological assessment, Counsel conceded that there had been no objective testing done on the principal claimant, however, she submitted that the principal claimant had been undergoing psychiatric treatment prior to coming to Canada. Counsel cited Exhibit 10, p. 52, as proof that the principal claimant had received psychiatric treatment in Hungary. Dr. XXXX letter, certified that the claimant had been receiving treatment for;\n...anxiety, restlessness, adjustment disorder, disorder in finding her identity, in addition to being decompensated psychically as a result of being raped by Hungarian skinhead boys in August 2009 and received psychiatric treatment until she was in Hungary, March 2012.\n[37] However, for the reasons set out earlier, the panel gave little weight to his report.\n[38] Counsel also submitted, that the presence of Canadian psychological and medical reports lends credence to the principal claimant's claims regarding her experiences.18 In the absence of objective testing, and limited opportunity to observe the principal claimant in a clinical setting, the panel is not persuaded of counsel's submissions. The panel accepts that the principal claimant has been receiving ongoing care from her General Practitioner for the past five years, however, the panel is of the view that this care alone is not necessarily proof that she had the experiences in Hungary she claimed.\nThe Miscarriage\n[39] The principal claimant alleged, that she suffered a miscarriage after an unprovoked attack by Hungarian Nationalists, during which, she was kicked in the stomach. She was four and a half months pregnant when the attack occurred. The principal claimant submitted two medical reports respecting the miscarriage. One report is dated September 29, 1998.19 This report shows that the principal claimant was admitted to the gynecology department of the XXXX XXXX XXXX on that date. However, it does not show the date she was actually released; nor does the report show the date on which it was written. It does state, that a copy had been forwarded to the relevant authorities.\n[40] In response to her counsel, the principal claimant testified that she went to the police station to file a complaint about the incident, but was rebuffed. No report was taken. The panel relies on its specialised knowledge, obtained as a result of adjudicating similar claims, that medical personnel usually inform the police of violent incidents, and the police usually attend at the hospital, to speak to the victims. The claimant testified, that she spent about three or four days in hospital. The panel expects that the police would have visited the principal claimant during these three or four days. Thus, she would not have had to go to the police station to make a complaint. The absence of a date of release, or a date when the report was written, makes it difficult for the panel to assess the credibility, of this aspect, of the principal claimant's testimony. Nonetheless, based on the panel's specialised knowledge, the panel finds that it is more likely, than not, that the police would have gone to the hospital to speak with the principal claimant, and not the other way around.\n[41] The second medical report, shows that the principal claimant returned to the neurology department on October 22, 1998.20 This report indicates, that she had an early spontaneous abortion. It also indicates, that the principal claimant told the staff that she had been attacked, and had suffered a miscarriage as a result. This report does state a date of release, and appears to be in proper form.\n[42] The panel asked the principal claimant to clarify why the first medical report did not mention that she had a miscarriage She agreed, that it had not been a miscarriage, but claimed that the baby had been injured during the attack, necessitating that she be induced, and that the baby was big which required dilation (of her cervix) and taking the baby. She added, that the Hungarian doctors did not write down exactly what had happened.\n[43] On considering the principal claimant's explanation, the panel concluded, that it was possible that the medical procedure did occur as she described. However, the panel was not satisfied that it was probably so, because the first report does not mention that she had been transported to hospital by ambulance in an unconscious condition as she claimed, which the panel finds that it was reasonable to expect it would have. Given this omission from the report, and her testimony that the police did not attend the hospital to speak with the principal claimant during the three or four days she was hospitalised, the panel also finds that there is insufficient, credible evidence before it, to allow it to conclude that she had suffered a beating at the hands of Hungarian nationalists that led to a miscarriage. Nonetheless, despite the panel's reservations, it does not find that the whole of the principal claimant's credibility is undermined by its concerns regarding the alleged miscarriage.\nThe Rape\n[44] The principal claimant alleged, that on the evening of August 25, 2009, a number of Hungarian Guards attacked and beat her. One of the attackers raped her. Her ordeal ended, when several people heard her cries, and came to her aid. The attack occurred very close to an apartment building that she was going to.\n[45] The principal claimant submitted a number of letters, in support of her allegations. The letters were written by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX; and an XXXX XXXX XXXX The principal claimant testified that she knew all of the letter writers. It later turned out, that XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX are the same person, namely the mother of the adult male claimant. While XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX, also appear to be the same person. Thus, there were not as many people writing in support of the incident as it appears.\n[46] XXXX XXXX XXXX lived near to the principal claimant's sister. She knew the claimant before the alleged rape. In her letter, Ms. XXXX refers to \"a gypsy girl being attacked\" and not to the principal claimant by name. In response to the panel, the principal claimant testified that she did not know why Ms. XXXX did not name her in the note. The panel found her response not to be plausible, given that she testified that they were well acquainted, and the panel finds that it is reasonable to expect that Ms. XXXX would likely have recognised the claimant's voice.\n[47] In her letter, XXXX XXXX XXXX the principal claimant's sister-in-law, said she heard screams coming from outside of her building. When she looked out, she saw that five men were attacking \"a gypsy girl\". She went to the aid of the screaming woman, at which time, she saw that the victim was the principal claimant, and that the principal claimant told her that the attack was unprovoked. The panel asked the principal claimant if she told her sister-in-law that she had been raped. She replied that she had not. The panel also asked the principal claimant how long it took for someone to come to her aid, to which she replied 15-20 minutes. She also told the hearing that the alleged rape took place in some bushes that were \"not too far\" from the apartment building where her sister-in-law lived.\n[48] The panel had concerns about a number of aspects of the principal claimant's testimony. Specifically, the panel did not find it plausible that her sister-in-law would not have recognised the principal claimant voice, which would have lent more impetus to her desire to come to the principal claimant's assistance. Further, as the principal claimant testified that the alleged attack occurred so close to the building, the panel finds that it is not plausible that it would take 15-20 minutes for someone to come to her aid.\n[49] When she was asked, the principal claimant testified that the incident occurred in August, at about four or five in the afternoon. She described the weather conditions as dusky, because the day had been rainy and cloudy. This testimony, inadvertently, undermines XXXX XXXX's statement; that she looked out of her window, and saw five men attacking the principal claimant. As the principal claimant described her attackers as being clad in black, and the time of day as being dusky and therefore somewhat dark, the panel finds that it calls into question what XXXX XXXX saw, and therefore, the reliability of her eye witness evidence.\n[50] In response to her counsel, the principal claimant stated, that she was going to visit her brother who lived in the building outside of which the attack occurred. August 25 is Hungary's National Day and her brother was holding a small party. Her partner was already at her brother's home, while her son and his grandmother were elsewhere. Alerted by her screams, the principal claimant's partner and her brother ran downstairs; it was they who took her up to the apartment. They found her on the ground in a fetal position, and unable to stand. She testified, that she did not tell her partner that she had been raped. This was evidence that was not in the principal claimant's PIF, and for the reasons set out below, the panel found the evidence was not credible.\n[51] The principal claimant's counsel asked her about XXXX XXXX letter. Counsel pointed out, that XXXX XXXX appeared to intimate that she and some others witnessed persons assaulting the principal claimant. When her counsel asked the principal claimant to explain how it would take 15-20 minutes for someone to go to her aid, when the incident occurred so close to the building, and XXXX XXXX witnessed the assault; the principal claimant was non-responsive. She said she \"did not know, she could not remember the time, she was just screaming\". When her counsel tried to elicit a further or better response from the principal claimant, she replied that her attackers had prevented her from screaming ... \"I was not able to scream at that time they were in there. They had my mouth shut\".\n[52] The panel found that this aspect of the principal claimant's testimony was not plausible, because not only was it internally inconsistent, it conflicted with her written statement that she had been screaming. The testimony also conflicted with the statements of the letter writers; that they heard her screams and saw her attackers. Moreover, given the principal claimant's statement that the attackers left as help was arriving, the panel finds that her testimony that they kept her mouth shut undermines the statements made in her narrative, and in the letters of XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX; that they were alerted to the incident by screams.\n[53] In her letter, XXXX XXXX, said she saw four men, as opposed to the five that XXXX XXXX claims she saw attacking the principal claimant. The panel places no significance on this discrepancy, as it is not material to the claim whether there were four or there were five attackers. However, the panel does find it significant, that neither woman mentioned the presence of the principal claimant's partner, which, in the view of the panel, it was reasonable to expect that they would do, had he been present, and had he played the role the principal claimant testified he did.\n[54] Furthermore, in light of the proximity of the scene of the alleged rape to the apartment building that the principal claimant described, it is not plausible that some fifteen to twenty minutes would elapse before help would arrive. The panel finds that this is a further instance where the claimant has demonstrated a lack of straightforwardness.\n[55] At the second sitting, the principal claimant sought to excuse the discrepancies in her oral testimony as being due to stress and headache, and not taking her medications. However, she did reaffirm the distance of the alleged crime scene from the apartment building, as well as the time frame within which help arrived.\n[56] The panel finds that her explanation was not satisfactory, because it does not accept that the entirely new version of the alleged event the principal claimant presented at the first sitting of the hearing, could be explained by stress and headache. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the inconsistent and contradictory evidence regarding the alleged rape, was the result of the principal claimant's want of straightforwardness.\n[57] The panel finds, that the testimony of the adult male claimant regarding the incident was also not plausible. He corroborated the principal claimant's testimony, that he was one of the people who assisted her. The panel relies on its previous credibility finding regarding his presence at the scene, to doubt, and to reject this aspect of the adult male claimant's testimony. Furthermore, with specific reference to his alleged attendance at the scene, the panel finds that it is not plausible that the principal claimant's spouse would have gone to her attendance, found her in the fetal position, and not come to know, if not immediately, that she had been raped. The panel finds that this testimony; that he did not notice that she had been sexually assaulted, not to be consistent with what one might reasonably expect in the circumstances.\n[58] Counsel for the claimants, submitted that the credibility assessment, regarding the principal claimant, should be situated within the parameters of Guideline 4. The panel concurs. The panel finds, that the principal claimant was not disadvantaged in any way in presenting her claim. At the start of the hearing, she acknowledged that she had put all of the evidence, including documentary evidence, upon which she wanted to rely before the panel. She did not need to make any further amendments to her PIF. While at times she broke down during the hearing, the principal claimant was afforded every opportunity to compose herself. Further, when testifying about the sexual assault, her son was excluded from the hearing room at her request.\n[59] Counsel submitted, that there was no reason to doubt the veracity of either adult claimant's evidence. She stated, that both claimants were forthright in their testimony, admitting when they could not understand or did not know something. Counsel described the principal claimant as being appropriately emotional, when discussing her sexual assault. Clearly, in light of the panel's credibility findings, the panel does not come to the same conclusion as Counsel.\n[60] Counsel for the claimants also submitted, that the principal claimant was specific about when people came to her aid. She submitted, that there was corroborative evidence before the panel that supported the principal claimant's experiences, namely, the letters from witnesses. Reliance was placed on the fact that the writers of these letters had included copies of their identity cards. With all due respect to counsel, the panel is not persuaded by these submissions, given the numerous implausibilities and contradictions in the principal claimant's evidence.\n[61] Thus, on the basis of its credibility finding, that the testimony was inconsistent, contradictory and implausible, the panel finds that the credibility of the principal claimant's allegation, that she was raped by Hungarian Guards on August 25, 2009, is seriously undermined. Accordingly, the panel finds that there is valid reason, to doubt, and to reject the principal claimant's allegation, that on August 25, 2009, members of the Hungarian Guard attacked her outside of the building where her brother and sister-in-law lived. The panel also doubts, and rejects, the principal claimant's allegation that a member, or members, of the Hungarian Guard raped her during the attack.\nIssues arising from the Principal Claimant's Roma Ethnicity\n[62] In response to her counsel, the principal claimant stated, that because she is ethnically Roma, she suffered racial discrimination in Hungary. She recounts difficulties at school; being followed in stores, and living in fear. She also described discrimination in employment. Specifically, for a period of about three months, the principal claimant was employed as XXXX help. She testified that during these three months, she was not allowed to enter the area where food was prepared. She claimed that this was because she was Roma. On further examination, the claimant admitted that she had been hired as a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX The panel finds that the principal claimant's description of her duties, places a different light on her employment situation. She was hired to clean, not to cook. Therefore, her complaint is not well founded.\n[63] Asked by her counsel to describe what her life was like between 1998 (after the \"alleged miscarriage\") and 2009, the principal claimant replied that she lived in fear. She was hesitant to go out by herself. When she went out, she faced racism. For example, Hungarians avoided sitting next to her on the bus.\n[64] The panel has no doubt, that the principal claimant has experienced the type of discrimination, and likely, harassment that the documentary evidence indicates many Roma are subjected to. She, herself, described the discrimination she received as being of the type that Roma generally face. The panel is not persuaded, that the principal claimant has presented sufficient credible evidence to establish that the discriminatory incidents she experienced, had risen to the level of persecution.\nThe Adult Male Claimant\n[65] The Adult Male Claimant accepted and adopted the testimony of the principal claimant. He added his own experiences, namely, that while he was living in Hungary, he received a number of threatening letters. In August 2010, five men dressed in black beat him up; and in September or October 2011, several men in a car harassed and beat him. The adult male claimant testified that the letters were particularly disturbing, because the writer threatened him with physical harm. The letters did not stop after he left Hungary, instead, they were sent to his mother's home. In reply to his counsel, the adult male claimant testified that he received the first letter some time in 2011. He left Hungary on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2011. By the time he left, he had received between six to ten letters at the home he shared with his family. While a sister and her two children remained in the home, the letters were no longer sent there, instead they were sent to his mother's home, which was about an hour's travel from the place where he used to live. The panel found the adult male claimant's testimony, about the letters, to be convoluted and implausible, and not in accord with what might reasonably be expected in the circumstances.\n[66] First, the adult male claimant testified that he began to receive the threatening letters not long before he left Hungary. He testified that all of the Roma living in his neighbourhood received similar letters. Noting, that many of the letters were addressed to the adult male claimant personally. The panel asked him, whether he knew any of the persons who were writing the letters, which he denied.21 When the panel observed that he was directly addressed in the letter at page 97 of Exhibit 10,22 the adult male claimant responded that this letter \"came from Guardists who were sending the letters to his mother\". He went on to explain that the letter contains the salutation, \"Hi XXXX\" because where he lived was called \"Gypsy Row\" but \"Hungarians\" lived there too.\" He stated that the Hungarians likely knew him, his wife, and their son, and also likely knew his name.\n[67] The panel assessed the plausibility of the adult male claimant's testimony and explanation about the letters. For the following reasons, the panel finds, that the testimony is not plausible. The adult male claimant testified, that he last lived with his mother sometime before 2011. He lived an hour away with his family, his sister, and her family. He testified that his mother began to receive letters addressed to him, after he had come to Canada, and has continued to receive them for five years. As the claimant was already in Canada, when his mother began to receive letters, the panel finds that it is not plausible that the letter-writer(s) would address him by name. The panel infers, that if letter-writer(s) knew him well enough to know his name, then they also likely knew that he had left Hungary, therefore, it is unlikely, that they would have begun to send letters addressed to him at his mother's home. The panel concludes that, on a balance of probabilities, the adult male claimant and his mother did not receive harassing letters, and that the letters were produced for the sole purpose of bolstering his claim for refugee protection.\n[68] The adult male claimant described two violent incidents that he alleged took place in August 2010, and in the fall of 2011. In the first incident, he was walking home when he saw four or five people in black. Hoping to avoid them, he crossed the street, but they too crossed the street. One attacker stomped on his hand, damaging a finger. The assailants uttered racial slurs as they beat him. The adult male claimant testified that he did not report the incident to the police, because the doctor who attended to him advised him not to. He testified that when he told the doctor what had happened to him, the doctor told him that the police would not believe him. So the adult male claimant went home without filing a police report.\n[69] The panel considered his testimony, in light of its specialised knowledge gleaned from hearing claims against Hungary. The panel is aware that in instances of physical assaults on patients, medical personnel are required to notify the police. The reporting is not usually left to the patient. Whether the police respond (it appears that it is usual for them to do so) or take further action, is a different matter. In light of its understanding of the practice attendant upon circumstances that the claimant described, the panel concluded, that while it is possible that the doctor might have attempted to deter the adult male claimant from filing a police report, it is not probable that he did. The panel finds that the credibility of the adult male claimant is, therefore, undermined by his claim that the doctor told him not to file a police report.\n[70] The second time he was attacked, the adult male claimant testified, that he did go to the police, however, they laughed at him and refused to take a report. This time, his attackers had urinated on him. Counsel for the claimants described the adult male claimant as being appropriately emotional, when recounting the experience. He testified, that the cavalier reaction of the police to his experience caused him such distress, that he cried for two days. It was the turning point for him, and the impetus for the decision to come to Canada. The panel accepts that, if true, this would be a clear incident of discrimination, as the police would have treated the adult male claimant differently because of his ethnicity. This, in the panel's view, is likely the single credible incident of the incidents alleged by the adult male claimant.\n[71] The panel is aware, that a single incident may well give rise to persecution. However, the panel is not persuaded that the police refusing to take the adult male claimant's statement, while discriminatory, raises the act of discrimination to one of persecution. The adult male claimant lived in Budapest, and there were other avenues of redress available to him, such as the Independent Police Complaints Board, the Parliamentary Commissioners' Office, the Equal Treatment Authority, the Roma Police Association, the Complaints Office at the National Police Headquarters; all of which bodies are mandated to investigate complaints against the police that he seemed not to have considered.\nThe Son\n[72] Both the principal and adult male claimant testified that their son, XXXX, had difficulty in school. The claimants presented a psychological assessment of the son's intellectual ability. The report indicates, that XXXX had serious learning deficits, and when compared to his peers, demonstrated an \"intelligence level of the mild mental retardation zone.\"23 The claimants intimated that XXXX was misdiagnosed due to his ethnicity. The principal claimant asserted, that he was \"a very smart boy, he learnt all his lesson and he was never allowed to answer the questions.\" She testified he was held back.\n[73] The claimants may well be correct in their assertions. However, it does appear from the report, that there was a comprehensive testing of XXXX abilities across a spectrum of tasks. The assessment reveals that XXXX functioned adequately at some tasks, and less so in many cognitive areas. There also appears to be the complicating factor of age, as he appeared to have been older, and bigger, than the students who were in his class.\n[74] Notwithstanding the views of the claimants, without a comparator assessment, the panel is not prepared to find that the Hungarian assessment demonstrates the inherent racism of Hungarians towards Roma children, and XXXX in particular.\nOther Incidents\n[75] The claimants allege, that racists went to the home of their sister in Hungary. The racists kicked out the sister, and her family, and vandalised the building. They painted a swastika on the wall. The claimants tendered a police report,24 that states the home was empty and locked at the time of the supposed event. This report contradicts the claim that the sister and her family were living at the home when they were forced out. Given that a report was actually taken, the panel finds that it was reasonable to expect that it would reflect the eviction of the sister, and her family, as opposed to stating that the house was empty and locked at the time of the offence. In the circumstances, the panel is not persuaded that the claimants have presented sufficient credible evidence that Hungarian Nationalists invaded the sister's home, evicted her and her family, and vandalised it.\nSTATE PROTECTION\nCounsel's Submissions\n[76] Counsel for the claimants submitted that state protection was not, and would not, be available to them, should they be returned to Hungary. He submitted, that from their evidence and testimony, the claimants did make effort to engage the state, however, on those occasions, when the adult male claimant did seek the assistance of the police, namely, with respect to the letters, and with respect to the incident when he was urinated on, that protection was denied him.\n[77] Counsel for the claimants submitted, that the documentary evidence clearly supports a finding of an absence of state protection. She submitted, that the current Amnesty International Report clearly shows that there is a move in Hungary towards what counsel termed an \"illiberal democracy\". Counsel also submitted, that the United States of America Department of State (DOS) Report,25 refers to impunity for Human Rights abuses, as well as discusses concerns about the Roma communities. Section 6 of the DOS report notes that \"Roma suffer discrimination in all forms of life.\" Counsel for the claimant also submitted, that it,\n...was important to note that in Item 2.5 the UN General Assembly26 report documents ongoing problems based on Roma ethnicity. Paragraph 2 as well as paragraph 78 of the report talks about Roma facing discrimination and falling victims to human rights violations, while Item 10.227 talks about police response to complaints lodged by Roma citizens.\n[78] Counsel submitted, that hate crimes and hate speech are prevalent in Hungary, and the response by the police to violence against Roma is feeble. Counsel concluded, that the statements in the documentary evidence corroborate the claimant's claim; that should they return to Hungary at this time, they are likely to be met with similar types of violence as when they left. Counsel for the claimant submits that per Katinszki,28 the claimants ought not to be expected to have recourse to any other body but the police for state protection.\n[79] In Katinszki, the Federal Court took issue with the Board's finding, that state protection was available to the claimants in Budapest. It found, that the organisations that the Board referred to as being able to provide that state protection were not, in fact, mandated to provide protection, but rather functioned as oversight bodies:\nThe Board also points to various organizations that can provide protection to the Applicants and again seems to assume that these organizations would be in a better position to provide protection in Budapest since their head offices are located there. The problem with this assertion is that there is no evidence on the record that these organizations would be better able to \"protect\" the Applicants in Budapest than in the rest of the country. More importantly, the mandate of each of the organizations referred to by the Board (the Independent Police Complaints Board, the Parliamentary Commissioners' Office, the Equal Treatment Authority, the Roma Police Association, the Complaints Office at the National Police Headquarters) is not to provide protection but to make recommendations and, at best, to investigate police inaction after the fact.\n[80] Counsel for the claimants also submitted, that as a Roma woman, the principal claimant has an additional barrier when seeking redress against gender-related violence, because according to the documentary evidence, the police tend not to take domestic violence complaints as seriously as they should. Counsel for the claimants submitted that the police would treat any attempt, by the principal claimant to obtain police protection, in a similar manner.\n[81] Although pertinent, the panel finds that the submissions of Counsel for the claimant pre-supposes a finding of general credibility in their favour, which finding, the panel has not made. In fact, overall, the panel has found the principal claimant not to be credible in respect of the alleged rape, and thus, her need for psychiatric or psychological counselling, based on that rape, while she was in Hungary. The panel, also, did not find that she had credibly explained the significant divergence, between her statements at the Port of Entry, and her later allegations in her PIF. While the panel found that her credibility regarding the miscarriage itself had not been significantly undermined, the panel was not certain as to how the principal claimant came to miscarry.\n[82] Similarly, the panel did not find that the adult male claimant provided credible and trustworthy evidence, in respect of the letters and the incident of August 2010. While the panel did find his testimony regarding the incident of fall 2011 to be credible, the panel was not satisfied that the incident rose to the level of persecution. However humiliating it was to the adult male claimant, it appeared to have been a random attack. Therefore, the panel is not persuaded of Counsel's view, that the claimants have successfully displaced the presumption that state protection would be available to them in Hungary,\n[83] Further, the panel finds, that not every Roma in Hungary has experienced what amounts to persecution. In this regard, the panel finds persuasive the words of Harrington J. in Varga:29\nEach case turns on the particular history of the claimant, the record, the adequacy of the analysis by the Tribunal and, indeed, the appreciation of that evidence by various judges of this Court (Banya v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2011 FC 313, [2011] FCJ No 393 (QL), at para 4.)\n[84] In this context, the panel undertook an analysis of the operational adequacy of state protection that would be available to these claimants, should they return to Hungary. It is notable, to raise another aspect of the relevance of Balogh30 in this case. For the purposes of s. 96 of the IRPA, personal targeting or past persecution is not required in order to establish a risk. Rather, persecution can be established by examining the situation of similarly situated individuals.31 The panel finds that the Balogh decision is consistent with these principles. As explained by Justice LeBlanc at paragraph 19 of this decision:32\nMoreover, while the documentary evidence of general country conditions of Roma in Hungary raises human rights concerns, the mere fact of being of Roma ethnicity in Hungary is not, in and of itself, sufficient to establish that an applicant faces more than a mere possibility of persecution upon return (Csonka v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 1056, at paras 67-70 [Csonka]; Ahmad v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2004 FC 808, at para 22 [Ahmad]. Both subjective fear and objective fear are components in respect of a valid claim for refugee status (Csonka, art para 3). The applicant has a burden of establishing a link between the general documentary evidence and the applicant's specific circumstances (Proph\u00e8te 4 v Canada (Citizenship & Immigration), 2008 FC 331, at para 17; Jarada v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 409, at para 28; Ahmad, at para 22).\n[85] Thus, in the panel's reading of jurisprudence relating to refugee claims based on Hungarian Roma ethnicity, the panel finds that it does not support a blanket conclusion, that the general country conditions are such that all Roma in Hungary face discrimination amounting to persecution. Rather, and as conducted in this case, the panel has considered the particular claimants' circumstances, in combination with the general documentary evidence, to determine whether these claimants face a risk of persecution should they return to Hungary in 2018, or in the near future.\n[86] Refugee protection is meant to be a form of surrogate protection, to be invoked only in those situations where the refugee claimant has unsuccessfully sought the protection of their home state. The onus is on the refugee claimant to approach the state for protection, in situations where state protection might be reasonably forthcoming.33 In the absence of a compelling explanation, a failure to pursue state protection opportunities within the home state will usually be fatal to a refugee claim, at least, where the state is a functioning democracy with a willingness and the apparatus necessary, to provide a measure of protection to its citizens.34\n[87] The refugee claimant's burden of proof, is directly proportional to the level of democracy in the state in question; the more democratic the state's institutions, the more the refugee claimant must have done to exhaust all courses of action open to them.35 In a functioning democracy, a refugee claimant will have a heavy burden, when attempting to show that they should not have been required to exhaust all of the recourses available to them domestically, before claiming refugee status.36\n[88] A refugee claimant must show, that they have taken all reasonable steps in the circumstances to seek protection, taking into account the context of the country of origin, the steps taken, and the refugee claimant's interactions with the authorities.37 Local failures by authorities to provide protection do not mean that the state as a whole fails to protect its citizens, unless the failures form part of a broader pattern of the state's inability, or refusal, to provide protection.38 No government is expected to guarantee perfect protection to all of its citizens at all times, and the fact that a state is not always successful in protecting its citizens is not enough to justify a claim, especially, where a state is in effective control of its territory, has military, police, and civil authorities in place, and is making serious efforts to protect its citizens.39 Less than perfect protection is not a basis to determine that a state is either unwilling, or unable, to offer reasonable protection.40\n[89] The panel is required to determine the state protection provided, at the present time that is relevant.41 The panel's analysis of the protection available to Roma in Hungary today, is that, such protection is operationally adequate based on its analysis that follows. The panel notes, that regard must be given to what is actually happening, and not what the state is endeavouring to put in place.42 In this case, the panel finds, the government's efforts to have \"actually translated into adequate state protection\" at the operational level.43\n[90] The panel acknowledges, that the Roma minority population in Hungary experience discrimination in many aspects of their daily lives, and at times, violence and abuse at the hands of some racist elements in Hungary, including, the lack of action on the part of some police officers, who also demonstrate anti-Roma sentiments. However, with the formal dissolution of the Hungarian Guard in 2013, and with the right-wing Jobbik Party re-casting itself as a more inclusive but still nationalist party, it has attempted to distance itself from the right-wing platform in the pre-2014 elections:\nGabor Vona, Jobbik's 37-year-old leader...declared [in late 2013] a new direction for his party - towards the political centre, and away from the extreme right which won it its ugly reputation. \"We are a people's party now,\" Mr. Vona told me. \"Naturally we have kept our basic values, but now we are trying to represent the whole of society, with all the different views which people hold....I will not accept any crude or extreme views in the future. I want this to be party [sic] which everyone can calmly and honourably vote for.\"44\n[91] The BBC report45 referenced Jobbik's role in the 2000s in contributing \"to a serious worsening of relations with the Hungarian Roma minority\" but now, \"...Jobbik's programme calls for an end to positive discrimination for minorities.\" The Jobbik Party does not target Roma, the Guardists have been disbanded, and the latter no longer poses a harassing threat to Roma. A member of Political Capital, a prominent \"think tank\" in Budapest, interviewed for the BBC article, opined:\nMr. Vona wants to move the party toward the centre and push out the extremist elements. ...if he manages to tone down the anti-Gypsy and anti-Semitic rhetoric, that has to be welcomed.\"46\n[92] The panel also notes from its reading of the documentary materials, including human rights monitoring groups, the customary annual reports that the Board references and the diverse media sources, that there are no current reports of right-wing and nationalist marches or gatherings in Hungary that are targeting, harassing, and threatening Roma. While discriminatory attitudes persist, among some groups and people in Hungary today, there is no documented evidence before the panel to suggest, or to establish, that other nationalist or right-wing groups have been targeting Roma today as they were in the years leading up to the claimants' departure, or that these groups are supported by the State.\n[93] The preponderance of the objective evidence, regarding current country conditions, suggests that, although not perfect, there is adequate state protection in Hungary for victims of crime, including crimes committed against Romas, that Hungary is making serious efforts to address the problems of criminality, and that the police are both willing and able to protect victims. Police corruption and deficiencies, although existing and noted, are not systemic. I am of the view, in canvassing the documentary evidence, that, as a whole, the issue of corruption and deficiencies are being addressed by the state of Hungary.\n[94] The panel has also considered the documentary evidence submitted by Counsel for the claimants. The general tenor of Counsel's documentary evidence is that Hungary, under Viktor Orban, has branched out on a path of its own, particularly, as it relates to migrants. That the Hungarian government is resisting calls from the European Union, and the United Nations, to accommodate migrants and asylum seekers is not in question. The Human Rights Watch report makes that crystal clear.47 Counsel for the claimant urges that the Hungarian stance against migrants, bodes ill for Roma. This is a facile conclusion to make, and not necessarily correct, as Hungary's position appears to be that integrating any new populations is the issue, as it may prove difficult.48 Perhaps morally wrong, but the question is whether this position leads, ipso facto, to a denial of state protection for these claimants.\n[95] In Jarada49, Justice Yves de Montigny held that,\n[T]he assessment of the applicant's potential risk of being persecuted if he were sent back to his country must be individualized. The fact that the documentary evidence shows that the human rights situation in a country is problematic does not necessarily mean there is a risk to a given individual.\n[96] In Jean, Justice Shore also addressed the need for personalized risk,50 stating at paragraphs 33:\nAn applicant must establish that there is a personalized risk based on his or her personal circumstances, which was not done in this case: the applicants did not show that their particular situation would cause a personalized risk, and the documentary evidence does not support their allegations.\n[97] While Justice Shore was addressing risk from criminality, the panel is of the view that the principle he stated is equally applicable to the claimants' case.\nDifficulty of assessing State Protection\n[98] The panel, in assessing the issue of state protection, is guided by the jurisprudence from the Supreme Court of Canada, the Federal Court of Appeal, and the Federal Court. The courts have established a number of principles relating to state protection, and the panel will apply those principles to the claim at hand.\n[99] The presumption of state protection was articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Ward. The thrust of that decision being that,\na) Nations should be presumed capable of protecting their citizens.\nb) Absent a situation of complete breakdown of state apparatus, such as that recognized in Lebanon in Zalzali, it should be assumed that the state is capable of protecting a claimant.51\nc) Unless the authorities concede that they are incapable of protecting a claimant, he or she must show by means of clear and convincing evidence that the state is incapable of providing protection.\nd) Without some evidence of a state's inability to protect its citizens, the claim fails.\n[100] The panel has considered the country conditions documents52 dealing with Hungary's ability to offer state protection. The panel finds, that Hungary is a democracy in effective control of its territory, and has in place a functioning security force to uphold the laws and constitution of the country. Therefore, the onus was on the claimants to provide \"clear and convincing\" evidence of Hungary's inability to protect them.53 Less than perfect protection, is not a basis to determine that a state is either unwilling, or unable, to offer reasonable protection.54\n[101] As Russell, J., noted in Molnar55 the acknowledged widespread discrimination, against persons who are ethnically Roma, makes a state protection analysis difficult. Perhaps, as a result, the Courts have been divided as to how to deal with the question of state protection in Hungary. Thus, in Mudrak, the Federal Court stated:\nIt is well recognized that there is a division in the ranks of judges of the Federal Court on the issue of state protection, particularly as it applies to claimants from the Hungarian Roma community.\"56\n[102] The court went on to highlight this division, by quoting decisions from the Federal Court, which provided divergent opinions on state protection for members of the Roma community. In the panel's view, the following decisions best illustrate the divided legal mind-set of the Federal Court on this issue.\n[103] The first is that of Moczo,57 where the claimants,\n...an extended family from Hungary... sought refugee protection in Canada based on their experiences of discrimination and persecution as members of the Roma community. In particular, they allege that their home was attacked by a group that pushed a concrete wall onto its roof. Later, someone threw bricks at the house.58\n[104] In allowing the appeal, the Court disagreed with the Board's conclusion, that the applicants had not made reasonable efforts to seek state protection. The Court stated:\nThe Board failed to take account of evidence showing that two of the applicants had approached the police on separate occasions to complain about bricks being thrown at their house. The police did not make a report; they simply said there was nothing they could do.59\n[105] The Court also concluded, that state protection was unavailable to the applicants:\n...the Board concentrated on evidence relating to improvements not yet realized to the exclusion of the documentary evidence showing that Hungarian police often discriminate against and fail to investigate crimes of violence against the Roma.60\n[106] In Csaba Racz the Federal Court came to a different and opposing position,61 observing that in the claim, the claimants:\n...were at home when stones were thrown through their windows. Denes Csaba Racz, the father in the applicant family, ran out of the house to see what had happened but he was immediately kicked in his stomach and assaulted. By the time Timea Raczne Marodi, the mother in the applicant family, went outside, her husband was on the ground and his attackers were fleeing in a car. They were shouting that \"this is not over\" and that the applicants would die. Mr. Racz called the police. When they arrived, he showed them the broken windows and where he was kicked and punched. The police asked if he saw the perpetrators, and Mr. Racz replied that he did not because he was kicked very suddenly. Ms. Marodi did not get the license plate. The police said that there was not much they could do, but that they would patrol the area more often. They left without taking a report. They patrolled one more time that night but no additional patrols were made. The applicants also asked the Mayor of their village to help them but he said the police would take care of things.62\n[107] In dismissing the appeal, the Federal Court stated:\nI agree with the submission of the respondent that the Board's examination must focus on whether these persons, on clear and convincing evidence, have established that there is not adequate state protection at the operational level. I am unable to find, based on their submissions in this application, that the Board's decision that they did not establish the inadequacy of state protection is unreasonable. In fact, although not perfect, the response of the police to the applicants' complaints, given the specific circumstances of the assaults taken to the police, appears to have been adequate and in keeping with what Canadian police forces would be likely to do.63\n[108] Although the Court in Mudrak64 certified two questions, pursuant to paragraph 74(d) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (IRPA).\n[109] The Federal Court of Appeal determined that the questions should not have been certified in the first place. The questions were:\na) Whether the Refugee Protection Board commits a reviewable error if it fails to determine whether protection measures introduced in a democratic state to protect minorities have been demonstrated to provide operational adequacy of state protection in order to conclude that adequate state protection exists?\nb) Whether refugee protection claimants are required to complain to policing oversight agencies in a democratic state as a requirement of assessing state protection, when no risk of harm arises from doing so?\n[110] More recently, in Poczkodi,65 the Federal Court reiterated some of the principles set out above, reiterating that while \"democracy alone does not ensure effective state protection, it is a relevant factor\". Relying on Sow v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2011 FC 646 at para 1166 and Kadenko v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1996] FCJ No 1376 (QL) at para 5, 143 DLR (4th) 532 (FCA)),67 the Federal Court noted, that the onus on a claimant to seek state protection varies, and is commensurate with the state's ability and willingness to provide protection. However, in Ruszo v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 1004, 440 FTR 106, the Chief Justice explained at para 33, that a claimant cannot simply rely on their own belief that state protection will not be forthcoming without testing it:\nIn this regard, doubting the effectiveness of state protection without reasonably testing it, or simply asserting a subjective reluctance to engage the state, does not rebut the presumption of state protection . . . In the absence of a compelling or persuasive explanation, a failure to take reasonable steps to exhaust all courses of action reasonably available in the home state, prior to seeking refugee protection abroad, typically will provide a reasonable basis for a conclusion by the RPD that an applicant for protection did not displace the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence.\n[Internal citations omitted]68\n[111] It is in the context of these divergent views on state protection that the panel must attempt to decide the question of whether the claimants have displaced the presumption of state protection. In the instant case, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities that the claimants have not credibly established that they have met their evidentiary burden, with regard to their attempts to obtain state protection. The principal claimant claimed that she went to the police to report the beating, after which she miscarried, but was rebuffed. She claimed that her mother tried to report the August 25, 2009 incident, but she too was rebuffed. Given the panel's finding, concerning that first police report and its credibility findings regarding the rape, the panel finds that there is little credible and trustworthy evidence before it to support a conclusion that the principal claimant made attempts to obtain state protection, but was unsuccessful.\n[112] While the panel accepts that the adult male claimant did likely seek to obtain state protection after the second attack, it is also clear, that he did nothing further about enforcing his rights. He did not complain to any of the bodies set up for that purpose. He simply decided to come to Canada, which he did.\n[113] Thus, in the case of the principal claimant, it is not clear to the panel that she made any attempt to obtain state protection. Accordingly, she does not meet the stipulation set out in Ruszo,69 namely, that a claimant must take reasonable steps to exhaust all courses of action reasonably available in the home state, prior to seeking refugee protection abroad.\n[114] With respect to the adult male claimant, the question is whether the refusal of the police to investigate the incident, when he was urinated on, constitutes a failure of state protection, such that it can be said, that he could have no prospect of obtaining state protection in the future.\n[115] In Mudrak,70 Mr. Justice Annis states that:\nMore substantively, suggesting that police oversight agencies have no role in demonstrating adequate state protection is like saying senior policing management has no role in policing due to their oversight function, or saying that policing is a short-term operational exercise. Similarly, denying oversight agencies an important role in police protection would suggest that the police complaints process, and thereafter the courts in Canada, have no responsibility in ensuring adequate policing. This is surely an unsustainable proposition. It is no counter-argument that Canadian police are more responsive to complaints about their conduct, which in some recent instances at least, might be challenged. The point is that the evidence in the Hungarian Roma persecution claims indicates that the oversight agencies are diligent in their investigations and in reporting their findings to the police. The transparency and accompanying public criticism of the state protection apparatus is an important ingredient to reforms and improvement in protection services accorded to Roma citizens.\nThe requirement to access police oversight agencies is particularly important where the persecution is in the form of random incidents, such as is normally the case for members of the Roma community. Adequate state protection against random crime must operate at a community level over a longer time frame, because responding to any particular victim cannot assure that future random attacks from other assailants will not occur. To the extent that random criminal conduct can be prevented by means other than increased patrols, effective policing can have a deterrent effect by arresting and successfully prosecuting wrongdoers accompanied by the declaratory publicity attached to successful convictions.\nThus, looking ahead, no crime prevention process can be effective if victims of crime do not report incidents to the police and proactively cooperate in their investigations, including complaining if not satisfied with the efforts of the police. If the rhetorical question is whether all members of the Roma community will be better protected from a rule requiring they follow up instances of inadequate policing with oversight agencies, I would argue, yes it would.\n[116] Taking the statements of Annis, J into consideration, the RPD concludes that, as stated above, the burden is on the claimants to provide clear and convincing evidence that the state is either unwilling, or unable, to provide them with adequate protection. It is not for the RPD to provide that proof, rather, it is the claimant who bears the legal burden of rebutting the presumption that state protection exists by adducing clear and convincing evidence which satisfies the panel, on a balance of probabilities.71\n[117] The panel concludes, after careful consideration of all of the evidence, that the claimants have not rebutted the presumption of state protection. Indeed, the principal claimant has not reliably established that she made any effort to obtain it, and the adult male claimant has not taken advantage of the existing police oversight agencies to further his complaint. It was open to him, to take his complaint to one of the existing bodies, he did not.\n[118] The panel is further guided by the recent decision X (Re) 2017 CANLII 144421 (CA CISR), in which, it was determined that state protection was available to the claimants. Further guidance is taken from the recent Federal Court decision of Venter, in which Justice Boswell found, that the RPD reasonably considered the legislative measures taken by the Hungarian government and their operational effectiveness:\nThe RPD reasonably concluded that the Applicants had not provided sufficient evidence either to rebut the presumption of adequate state protection in Budapest or to show that relocating to Budapest would be unreasonable in view of the Applicants' particular situation and circumstances.72\nCONCLUSION\n[119] The claimants claimed Convention refugee status in Canada, based on a well-founded fear of persecution in Hungary because of their Roma ethnicity. The principal and adult male claimants testified to incidents of discrimination, starting with school, and extending through their employment and public life in Hungary. They also detailed several violent incidents that, they claim, led to their making the decision to leave Hungary and to come to Canada. Their son, XXXX, relies on the claims of his parents, although they claim that he suffered severe discrimination while he was attending school in Hungary. They claim that their attempts to obtain state protection were refused, and they allege that, if returned to Hungary, they would be unable to access state protection should they require it. They also alleged, that under the present Hungarian government, the situation for Roma has worsened.\n[120] The panel finds, that it is not in dispute that Roma face discrimination in Hungary. However, what was at issue in these claims, was whether the claimants could credibly establish their allegations of persecution, and a lack of state protection. For the reasons set out above, the panel finds that the claimants have not met their onus to establish the basis of their claims by means of clear and convincing evidence. The panel also finds, that the claimants have not established that state protection is, or will not be, available to them in Hungary.\n[121] Accordingly, the panel finds that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX are not Convention refugees as defined in section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The panel also finds, that they are not persons in need of protection as defined in section 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n(signed)\n\" H. Ross\"\nH.

Their claims are joined pursuant to Rule 55 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] The panel finds that the claimants have not satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, or that, on a balance of probabilities, they would personally be subjected to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture upon return to China.\nDe Novo\n[4] The claimants' first RPD decision (dated August 16, 2016) was overturned by the Federal Court on June 19, 2017 and sent back for redetermination.\nALLEGATIONS\n[5] In the Basis of Claim Forms (BOC) signed February 8, 2016 and amended March 14, 2016 and May 22, 2018, the claimants state the following risks.\n[6] The female claimant, a 29 year old woman, states that she was accused of slandering the government and fears the PSB (Public Security Bureau) will arrest her. She states that she had an affair with a county magistrate in 2014 and when she became pregnant, he forced her to have an abortion. He then fired her. During her employment, she had noticed evidence of his corruption so when she lost her job, she posted information about the corruption on the internet. She was thereafter questioned by some men who threatened further harm after kicking her. She continued to post updates on the internet but her posts were quickly deleted. The magistrate called and threatened her. She went to Europe in XXXX 2015 to have a break. Upon her return, she went to the municipal government to ask for help and while she was there, the PSB went to her home seeking her arrest. She went into hiding before leaving China with a smuggler.\n[7] The male claimant, a 34 year old man, states that he was arrested by Chinese authorities who accused him of slandering the government. He worked dispensing medications at a hospital and when he reported that the hospital was dispensing undocumented and therefore suspicious medicine, he was told to be quiet. He was then fired. He went to the food and drug administration to report the matter. Thereafter, five men went to his home, beat him, and threatened him with death if he continued to pursue the matter. He then went to the hospital and told passersby about the matter. He was then arrested and detained seven days by the PSB. Upon his release, he tried to petition at a local office. He accompanied the female claimant to Europe and then upon returning to China, planned to go to Beijing to petition. On his way to the station, family called to say that the PSB were there seeking his arrest. He went into hiding and escaped China with the female claimant and a smuggler.\n[8] Both claimants fear Chinese authorities should they return.\nANALYSIS\n[9] The determinative issues in this case are well-foundedness and credibility.\nIdentity\n[10] The claimants' identities as nationals of China are established through their testimony and the supporting documentation filed, namely, copies of their passports.1\nMinister's Intervention\n[11] The Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (the Minister) provided a Notice of Intervention on March 22, 2016. The Minister's Representative (MR) raised concerns regarding the claimants' credibility owing to conflicting statements made by each claimant at the Port of Entry. The MR intervened with documents and did not participate in the hearing.\nCredibility\n[12] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true unless there is valid reason to doubt their veracity. The determination as to whether a claimant's evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities. Having considered the claimants' testimony, the panel has credibility concerns as outlined below.\nAbility to exit China when wanted by PSB\n[13] The panel notes the Jurisprudential Guide issued by the Chairperson concerning exit controls in China. The panel has considered this Guide and has also undertaken an independent assessment of the claimants' particular circumstances and evidence concerning their exit from China.\n[14] The claimants testified that they flew from Beijing to Hawaii. They did not have difficulties exiting China. The panel notes that their passports contain exit stamps from China dated XXXX XXXX, 2016.\n[15] The claimants both assert that they were wanted for arrest by Chinese authorities before they departed China for Hawaii on XXXX XXXX, 2016. The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimants did not have difficulty passing through the airport's many security checks because they were not wanted by Chinese authorities.\n[16] The panel notes the documentary evidence concerning the efficiency of Chinese authorities and the presence of the Golden Shield Project. The panel finds that if the claimants were indeed wanted by authorities, they would then have been discovered by authorities when they left China on XXXX XXXX, 2016 using their own passports to travel as they testified that they did.\n[17] The documentary evidence indicates that PSB monitors citizens' exits from China and that an individual wanted by the PSB would be noted in the computer database. The current documentary evidence states that airport authorities are connected to Policenet, a PSB database of persons wanted by authorities:\nIn 10 February 2014 correspondence with the Research Directorate, the Executive Director of the Dui Hua Foundation affirmed that airport security officials have access to the Public Security Bureau of China's online database of citizens who have been convicted of crimes or are wanted by the authorities [also known as Policenet or the Golden Shield]. Similarly, the representative of the Laogai Research Foundation stated that reports on \"experiences of activists who have been detained while trying to board an international flight provide clear evidence that airport officials are connected to Policenet\" (26 Feb. 2014). A colleague of Cao Shunli, who was also prevented from travelling to Geneva for the human rights training in September 2013, later publicized her own experience at the airport in Guangdong (HRIC 11 Oct. 2013). According to the Laogai Research Foundation, the colleague indicates that when her passport was swiped by airport authorities, scanning equipment immediately made noises alerting airport officials that she was wanted by police. She was subsequently detained in the Guangdong Baiyun Airport and told that Shanghai police would not let her leave. She was then transported from Guangdong to Shanghai for detention and questioning. This woman's experience provides concrete evidence of airport officials coordinating with police departments in tracking and detaining a political dissident.\n[...]\nThe representative of the Laogai Research Foundation wrote that the Chinese government checks the passports of citizens attempting to leave the country in order to ensure that they are suitable for foreign travel. Customs officials stamp the passports of citizens approved for foreign travel. Public security officials often confiscate passports held by individuals deemed unsuitable for foreign travel. 2\n[18] The panel notes the female claimant's testimony that she believes the snakehead facilitated their travel. The panel, however, prefers the documentary evidence which indicates that citizens' exits from China are closely monitored.\nThe representative of the Laogai Research Foundation provided the following information:\n[T]he Golden Shield incorporates extensive tracking and control mechanisms such as real-name online registration requirements, GPS monitoring, and facial recognition surveillance technology in a multipronged approach to identify potentially disruptive individuals. Policenet, a component of the Golden Shield, stores a wealth of information on Chinese citizens and connects the various agencies and levels of command within the public security apparatus. This integrated system enables Chinese public security forces to effectively target and neutralize political dissidents.\nIn partial corroboration, the Chinese economist writing in Open Magazine affirms that \"Cisco's Policenet has been helping the [Chinese Communist Party]'s public security organs to ferret out political dissidents and Falun Gong practitioners for years.\"\nAn undated article on the website of the Ministry of Public Security, entitled \"Deepening the Implementation of the 'Golden Shield' Project,\" indicates that all police units nationwide have access to eight public security databases, including the \"National Basic Population Information Database\" (China n.d.). Also accessible through the databases is information on household registration [hukou], border exit and entry, road traffic, and criminal investigations.3\n[19] The documentary evidence indicates that passports and travellers are thoroughly examined at airports in China and that facial recognition technology is used at Beijing and Guangzhou airports:\nSources report the use of facial recognition technology for staff at Beijing Capital International Airport. A 2009 article by China Daily indicates that as of September 2009, Beijing Capital International Airport has used facial recognition systems to \"stop people from pretending to be airport staff and sneaking into restricted areas.\" Similarly, the Canadian embassy official indicated that Beijing international airport has a facial recognition system \"used by airport staff passing between the secure transit and public sections of the terminal,\" as well as by \"flight crew departing Beijing, using the same queue as airport staff.\"\nAccording to the Canadian embassy official, facial recognition technology is also used at Guangzhou International Airport:\n[w]hen passengers [pass] through [the] immigration counter, they [are] photographed by a mini-camera to record each passenger's face. Facial recognition technology is applied to the images; however, it is unclear as to the total scope of the database against which the images are assessed.\nMore generally, concerning practices at main Chinese international airports, the same source explained that Chinese border officials do not take photographs of passengers upon international departure at every airport in China. In Beijing, photographs were taken in the past, but are not being taken now. If photographs are being taken (e.g., Guangzhou), they would be taken at China Immigration Inspection departure counters at airports. The only facial recognition procedure applied is a comparison between the photo on the travel document and the passenger's face. 4\n[20] The panel also notes that there is systematic corruption in China and that airport officials can be bribed. The panel acknowledges that the documentary evidence does indicate that authorities in China do not always apply regulations evenly.\n[21] The panel finds however that the preponderance of the documentary evidence does state that authorities at airports and at borders conduct thorough screening of passengers. The panel notes that the claimants assert that they are wanted for arrest. The panel notes the documentary evidence indicating that authorities in airports have access to computer systems allowing them to see if the person applying for exit is wanted by authorities. The panel prefers the unbiased country condition evidence to the claimants' testimony and finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimants are not wanted by Chinese authorities.\nWell-foundedness: profile as individuals wanted by police\n[22] The female claimant testified that she was accused of political dissent because she posted on a blog that the county magistrate who fired her, Mr. XXXX, had treated her badly. The posts were removed from the internet soon after she made them. She testified that she wanted to go to city officials to report him but that she did not do so. The panel asked whether she made any complaints about him other than on a blog and she said no. She stated that she wanted to expose his misbehaviour to city hall but that before she made a complaint, she heard from her family that the PSB were at her home and that they told her to report to them on XXXX XXXX, 2015.\n[23] The panel finds that the documentary evidence indicates that the PSB brook no dissent and are known to arrest protesters and hold them without charge.5 PSB forces, according to the documentary evidence, also \"used administrative detention to intimidate political and religious activists and to prevent public demonstrations.\"6\n[24] The panel finds that the female claimant complained about the personal actions of a public official on a blog in 2015. She did not mention that he was corrupt in his job, but only in personal matters. She testified that she has not had contact with him since XXXX, 2015. The panel finds that a reasonable person would not find the female claimant to be a political dissident or a person seeking to overthrow the government.\n[25] The male claimant testified that he feared Chinese officials because he exposed a medicine expiry date scandal at the hospital where he was employed. When asked why he would be fearful of authorities because of this, he said that the PSB accused him of slandering the government.\n[26] He want to complain at his hospital, then he complained to the township and then to the ministry of quality control. He testified that the highest level of government he went to was the city government. He testified that he was arrested and detained seven days in XXXX 2015 on the charge of slandering the government. After his release from detention, he was able to travel to Europe with the female claimant for a vacation (XXXX, 2015). After he returned from vacation, the PSB issued a summons for his arrest.\n[27] When asked why a summons was issued, he said it was because he went to the city in XXXX, 2015. The panel asked the male claimant whether he had any trouble leaving China for Europe and he said no, but that a smuggler helped him.\n[28] The panel notes the section above concerning ability to leave China and finds on balance that the male claimant is not of interest to authorities given his ability to exit China for Europe on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015. The panel finds that if Chinese authorities wished to arrest him for actions he took in XXXX, 2015, they would not have permitted him to leave China for Europe in XXXX, 2015.\n[29] The documentary evidence indicates that government officials have little tolerance for petitioners who travel to Beijing to bring their complaints about possible government corruption. The claimants did not petition and did not take their complaints to even a level higher than the city. Their involvement was local.\n[30] The documentary evidence states that although authorities \"quickly suppress demonstrations involving expression of dissenting political views,\" that citizens hold thousands of protests every year, concerning different government actions.\n[31] The evidence states that local authorities are more concerned with petitioners who take grievances to the state level and that local officials do attempt to stop petitioners from doing so:\nCivil protests and petitioners\n3.15.1 Some applicants will apply for asylum or make a human rights claim based on ill- treatment amounting to persecution at the hands of private security firms working in co-operation with corrupt police officers, and\/or the Chinese authorities due to their involvement in civil unrest or petitions.\n3.15.2 Treatment: .The law provides for freedom of peaceful assembly, however, the government severely restricted this right in practice. The law stipulates that such activities may not challenge \"party leadership\" or infringe upon the \"interests of the state.\" Protests against the political system or national leaders are prohibited. Authorities deny permits and quickly suppress demonstrations involving expression of dissenting political views. Citizens continue to gather publicly to protest evictions, relocations and compensation in locations throughout the country, often resulting in conflict with authorities or other charges.\n3.15.3 Freedom of assembly and association are severely restricted. Citizens risk punishment for organising demonstrations without prior government approval, which is rarely granted. Nevertheless, workers, farmers and urban residents held tens of thousands of protests during 2012, reflecting growing public anger over unlawful activity by officials, especially land confiscation, corruption, pollution and fatal police beatings. In July 2012, thousands of people peacefully protested against the construction of a copper plant in Shifang, Sichuan Province. Police took action with tear gas, stun grenades and beatings. After photographs were circulated by social media sites, the authorities announced that they would cancel the project and release detained protesters, though residents expressed fears that the project would resume once attention died down.\n3.15.4 The law protects an individual's ability to petition the government, however, persons petitioning the government faced restrictions on their rights to assemble and raise grievances. Most petitions addressed grievances about land, housing, entitlements, the environment or corruption. Most petitioners sought to present their complaints at national and provincial \"letters and visits\" offices. Although banned by regulations, retaliation against petitioners reportedly continues. This was partly due to incentives the central government offered to local officials to prevent petitioners from raising complaints to higher levels. Local officials face penalties if they fail to limit the flow of petitioners travelling to Beijing to report injustices to the central government. As a result, petitioners are routinely intercepted, harassed and detained in illegal \"black jails\" or sent to labour camps without trial. Detained petitioners are reportedly subjected to beatings, psychological abuse and sexual violence but in some cases, officials tolerated demonstrations or agreed to protesters' demands.\n[...]\nIn recent years there has been a significant increase in petitioning and civil unrest in China mainly related to the issues of unpaid wages, land confiscation, forced evictions and corruption. Many of these protests have involved thousands of people and some have turned violent, resulting in deaths and serious injury.\nAlthough the Chinese government is wary of any form of popular protest and is likely to respond harshly to protests that challenge the state's authority, the majority of these land and industrial protests are based on local issues and directed against local officials. Even when the protests are directed against the state they rarely challenge the state's authority or right to govern but instead protest against its specific policy as regards wages or land. In general, applicants from this category of claim are unlikely to be seen by the Chinese authorities as having engaged in a political act and are therefore unlikely to engage the United Kingdom's obligations under the Refugee Convention. However, each case should be considered on its individual merits as protestors or petitioners may be subject to criminal or administrative detention in RTL camps or 'black jails' where they are at risk of torture, abuse and mistreatment. 7 [emphasis added]\n[32] The panel finds that a reasonable person would not find these claimants to be political dissidents or persons seeking to overthrow the government. The claimants did not indicate that they did anything illegal or that they took their concerns to any level higher than the city.\n[33] The panel acknowledges that Chinese officials do not tolerate political opposition or dissent but finds on balance that the claimants would not be considered anti-regime or political opponents.\n[34] The panel finds, given the implausibility of the claimants being viewed as anti-regime, that, on a balance of probabilities, they are not wanted by or of interest to the PSB for reasons of their views on hospital medications (male claimant) or the personal actions of a municipal official (female claimant) in China.\nSupporting documents\n[35] The panel notes the two summons8 indicating the claimants are each wanted for \"slandering of government.\" The panel notes that the documents do not have security features and could have been produced by using a printer and a stamp with red ink.\n[36] The panel notes that the claimants enlisted the assistance of a smuggler and provided documents and information of unknown provenance in order to obtain a US Visa. As such, it would be reasonable to believe that the claimants would have access to similar documents to establish and support a claim as someone wanted by authorities. The panel awards no weight to the documents indicating that the claimants are wanted by authorities.\n[37] The panel notes moreover that that this type of document, a single page with black ink and red stamps and without security features, is easily made by anyone, anywhere. The panel notes the documentary evidence indicating that fraudulent documents are readily available in China.\nIn correspondence with the Research Directorate, an official at the Canadian embassy in Beijing wrote that there are \"consistent reports\" of document fraud in China and that fraudulent identity documents (IDs) are easily obtained in the country. Similarly, a professor of criminal justice at Xavier University who specializes in Chinese policing stated in correspondence with the Research Directorate that \"[t]here is little question that fraud of all kind[s], including ID fraud, is a major problem in China.\" The Professor added that fraudulent IDs are \"easily accessible\" and that the industry is a \"big business\" and an \"open secret\" in China. In July 2012, the state media source China.org.cn described the fraudulent ID industry as \"an incredibly lucrative trade,\" in an article about the market for fake student ID cards, university diplomas, and other types of ID on the grounds of Renmin University in Beijing.\nAccording to the Beijing embassy official, the provinces of Guangdong and Fujian are \"considered particularly high-risk for fraudulent documents\"9.\n[38] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the summonses and detention certificate are not genuine. The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimants are not wanted by Chinese authorities.\n[39] The female claimant provides a typed document entitled \"revealing the people's government magistrate evil doing\" which she claims she posted on the internet. The panel, however, has no indication that this document was posted anywhere. The panel notes that the female claimant testified that her posts were removed soon after posting. The panel finds that this document could have been produced by anyone, and that the document holds no evidence that it was ever posted anywhere. The panel awards it no weight.\nExpert witness\n[40] The panel heard and considered evidence provided by the expert witness called by counsel, Professor XXXX XXXX. The panel notes the witness's self-described area of expertise is \"the domestic politics of China and China-Canada relations.\"\n[41] The panel notes the expert witness testimony that corruption is rampant in China and that there is little recourse for citizens to complain about corrupt officials and that there are times that those who expose corruption could be charged criminally. Professor XXXX also testified about the evolving surveillance technology employed by authorities to watch the activities and movements of citizens.\n[42] While the panel notes and appreciates the participation and evidence of the expert witness, the panel notes also his testimony that he does not have specific knowledge of the officials mentioned in the claimants' BOCs. The panel finds that his evidence is similar to that provided in the NDP at exhibit 3. The panel notes that the witness does not have specific knowledge of the officials whom the claimants fear and find his testimony is not of sufficient probative value as to overcome the panel's findings on credibility (their ability to exit China when allegedly wanted by authorities) or well-foundedness (their profile as persons of interest to authorities).\nCONCLUSION\n[43] Accordingly the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that there is not more than a mere possibility that the claimants would be persecuted for a Convention ground or that it is likely they would be subjected personally to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture. The claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\n\"Sarah Morgan\"\nSarah Morgan\nFebruary 19 2019\nDate\n1 Exhibit 1\n2 Exhibit 3 , NDP 30 April, 2018 version, item 14.3 RIR CHN104761.E\n3 Exhibit 3 , NDP 30 April, 2018 version, item 10.4, RIR CHN104762.E\n4 Exhibit 3, NDP, 30 April, 2018 version, item 3.24, RIR # CHN105049.E\n5 Exhibit 3, NDP, 30 April, 2018 version, item 10.5, RIR CHN104967.E\n6 Exhibit 3, NDP, 30 April, 2018 version, item 2.1, DOS Report\n7 Exhibit 3 , NDP 30 April, 2018 version, item 1.7, UK Operational Guidance Note, Dec 2014\n8 Exhibit 1 (subsection 7)\n9 Exhibit 3, NDP, 30 April, 2018 version, item 3.22, RIR # CHN104579.E\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRPD.29.1 (August 31, 2012)\nRPD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SPR : TB6-01781\nTB6-01801\n",

Liu\nConseil du (de la) ministre\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX (hereinafter referred to as \"the claimant\") is a citizen of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), who is claiming refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)1, on the basis of his political opinion.\n[2] The associated claimants are his wife, XXXX XXXX XXXX (hereinafter \"the associated claimant\") and their child XXXX XXXX XXXX (\"the minor claimant\").\n[3] The associated claimant was named designated representative for the minor claimant. The associated claimants base their claims on that of the claimant. These claims were heard jointly pursuant to Rule 55 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules2.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The claimant's allegations were contained in his Basis of Claim form (BOC),3 it's amendments which are found throughout the claimant's exhibits, and his oral testimony.\n[5] In summary, the claimant fears persecution at the hands of the DRC authorities, who he fears will target him due to his political activism. The claimant alleges he has been detained because of his political activities as a member of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) party. The first time he was detained was in XXXX 2016 during the course of an opposition march where several others were detained. A few days later they were released. The claimant's life returned to normal, and he and his family traveled to the United States of America (US) on vacation in XXXX 2017. The claimant was questioned by security services at the airport prior to departure about his reasons for traveling overseas and any political motivations for the trip. He was allowed to leave with his family at the last minute before the flight. The claimant returned to the DRC for work reasons on XXXX XXXX, 2017, and claims he was questioned at the airport for several hours before being allowed to return home.\n[6] The claimant further alleges that he was kidnapped a few days later when he went to check on a UDPS office that had been encircled by police. He alleges he was tortured by security services and that he was released after arranging for ransom to be paid.\n[7] The claimant returned to the US, where the associated claimants remained in his absence, and the claimants chose to come to Canada to file their asylum claims.\n[8] The Minister intervened by way of documents and the Minister's submissions and evidence were considered by the panel.\nDETERMINATION\n[9] The panel finds that the claimants are not Convention refugees as they do not have a well-founded fear of persecution on a Convention ground in the DRC. The panel also finds that the claimants are not persons in need of protection in that their removal to the DRC would not subject them personally to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. The panel also finds that there are no substantial grounds to believe that the claimants' removal to their country of citizenship would subject the claimants personally to a danger of torture.\nANALYSIS\n[10] The determinative issue in this claim relates to the claimants' credibility.\nIdentity\n[11] The panel is satisfied with the claimants' personal identities and status as citizens of the DRC, on a balance of probabilities. Their identities were established based on their oral testimony, and certified copies of their passports found in Exhibits 1.\n[12] The panel also notes that the US temporary resident visas for all three claimants are on file in Exhibit 1, where copies of the claimants' passports can be found. The panel has reason to believe that the claimants did have genuine passports issued to them by the government of the DRC, because they were not only able to obtain US visas based on these passports, but they were also able to use them to travel to the US on multiple occasions. The panel notes that the majority of these visits took place prior to the period of alleged persecution and the claimant provided testimony about each of these trips, which he said were for work and vacations.\nCredibility\n[13] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true unless there is valid reason to doubt their veracity.4 However, that presumption of truthfulness may be rebutted by contradictions in the evidence presented by the claimant, which could establish a lack of credibility.5 Omissions and vagueness with regards to the claimant's allegations can also be determinative.6 The panel finds that the Maldonado presumption is rebutted, for the reasons below.\n[14] The panel asked the claimant about the circumstances surrounding his being questioned at the airport, and the claimant said they asked about his trip, and on his return to the DRC they confiscated a kitchen appliance. He also mentioned extortion. The panel is willing to accept that the claimant was questioned by DRC officials on two occasions at the airport in Kinshasa. However, as will be seen below, the panel does not believe that this questioning was a result of the claimant having been targeted as a perceived political opponent.\n[15] According to the objective documentation,7 returnees to the DRC may be interviewed during immigration checks upon return to the country. A Response to Information Request (RIR)8 notes that in 2014, a DRC official was reported to have instructed security services to track down UDPS members and to keep a lookout for UDPS members returning from European countries. According to the RIR, The Observer reported that emphasis is placed on targeting political activists living in the UK and other parts of Europe who are deported to Kinshasa, and it considered that the document providing the above-noted instructions was \"apparent confirmation that returnees from the UK could be tortured.\"\n[16] The UK Home Office report cited in the RIR is also in the National Documentation Package.9 The UK Home Office report indicates the following:\na. Canada was not returning failed asylum seekers to the DRC;\nb. Belgium, Finland, Germany, Netherlands and the USA undertook returns of failed asylum seekers to the DRC, and none of those countries were aware of detention and ill-treatment of returnees; although the Netherlands observed that some failed asylum seeker returnees might be questioned by the ANR;\nc. Belgian and French officials were not aware of any interest of the DRC authorities in returnees, and Swiss officials noted that the DRC authorities have an interest in those who pose a political risk, or who are a high level activist, not in those who had simply applied for asylum; and neither the Belgian, French or Swiss officials were aware of substantiated evidence of ill-treatment of DRC nationals on return;\nd. The Executive Director of a Kinshasa-based human rights organisation indicated that he did not think the DRC authorities had a specific interest in failed asylum seekers, even though they may ask an individual why they are being returned. He further indicated that the authorities in DRC are interested in those who were on a \"blacklist\" held by DGM, which would include those wanted by the police in Congo and opposition political activists, and that these were the people who would be taken for further questioning by the ANR.\ne. The International Organization of Migration office in Kinshasa indicated that there was no substantiated evidence of ill-treatment and\/or detention on return for returnees.10\n[17] Item 1.14 of the National Documentation Package (NDP) states that low level members\/sympathizers of the UDPS, for that reason alone, will not be at real risk on return to the DRC in the current climate.\n[18] The panel finds that the preponderance of sources cited in these documents indicate that returnees are not at risk upon return to the DRC. The panel further finds that based on these documents, where a risk may arise, the risk is for those wanted by authorities and\/or those who are considered to be opposition political activists or combatants. For the reasons below, the claimant has not established, with sufficient credible evidence, that these factors apply to him.\nNon-genuine Medical Document Submitted by Claimant\n[19] The panel found that the claimant's testimony contradicted some of the evidence he presented in support of his claim. In particular, the claimant presented a doctor's report which he alleged relates to the injuries incurred when he was abducted on XXXX XXXX, 2017 and released the following day. However, the doctor's note is dated and signed on XXXX XXXX, 2016 and refers to an examination on XXXX XXXX, 2016. It is accompanied by a mostly illegible copy of an identity card that is dated in 2016. The claimant could not present an explanation for the discrepancies in the letter, and speculated it is a transcription error. The panel does not accept this speculative explanation. The report does not simply refer to the year 2016 as the date of the examination; the report itself is dated on XXXX XXXX, 2016. On a balance of probabilities, the doctor would not make these errors in the year when writing a report in the month of May, five months after the start of the year. As such, the panel finds this is a non-genuine report and that it does not support the claimant's allegations that he was abducted on XXXX XXXX, 2017 and released on the following day. The panel takes a negative inference as to the claimant's credibility for having presented a non-genuine doctor's report in support of his allegations, and for presenting testimony in support of this non-genuine document. The provision of this non-genuine doctor's report calls into question the veracity of the claimant's allegation that he was abducted and harmed by security services.\n[20] The panel also considered the letter from the claimant's relative11 who paid the ransom for the claimant relating to the same incident. Considering the non-genuine document presented above and the claimant's testimony regarding that document which was not credible, the panel attributes minimal weight to this letter which purports to corroborate the same incident.\n[21] Having weighed the evidence before it the panel does not find credible the claimant's allegations that he went to the UDPS office to check on it after it had been surrounded, and as a result he was abducted and tortured by security services on XXXX XXXX, 2017.\nUDPS activism not established\n[22] The claimant presented an unclear copy of his UDPS membership card.12 The documentary evidence states that the UDPS is the most prominent opposition party in the DRC, and it funds its activities through the sale of membership cards.13 The UDPS has 41 seats in the National Assembly, while the PPRD (Kabila's party) holds 62.14 This is not a small party issuing only a few membership cards; the UDPS party has many members across the DRC. The panel finds that the claimant has not established that holding a UDPS membership card is sufficient in itself to cause him to be persecuted by DRC authorities.\n[23] The claimant was asked questions about his UDPS membership and activism. He said he was elected within the UDPS to be a financial officer. However, he was unable to name any local candidates in the UDPS. He could name only a very few high-profile individuals in the party. By way of explanation for this, he said he only had confidence in XXXX XXXX, the party leader, as others were less reliable. When asked to provide an example of a less reliable person, he mentioned Bruno Tshibala, who is a well-known former spokesperson for the UDPS. The claimant said Tshibala had switched to the party in power. The panel finds that this vague information about high-profile people is easily obtainable by anyone on the Internet,15 and is not sufficient to establish the claimant's membership in the party. It does not explain why the claimant, who alleges to have held a position of responsibility in his UDPS chapter, would have no idea of the names of any former or current local UDPS candidates, even if he did not have confidence in them. This is information that he should reasonably know given the level of involvement he allegedly had in the party, having joined in 2011 and been involved until XXXX 2017. A negative inference is taken as to the claimant's credibility.\n[24] The claimant was asked what party Bruno Tshibala had changed to, and the claimant said Kabila's party. The panel asked what the name of that party is, and the claimant said PPRD. When asked what PPRD means, the claimant said he did not remember. The panel finds that reasonably, if the claimant had the political involvement he alleges and was active in the UDPS as he alleges, he would reasonably know the full name of the party in power in his country.16\n[25] The claimant alleges that he participated in a UDPS protest where he was arrested, and that he was a financial officer for the UDPS. The claimant was asked whether he had made any efforts to obtain any documentation to support his activities in the party or his problems due to his affiliation with the UDPS, for the purposes of his protection claim. He testified that he had not made any efforts to contact the party. As an explanation he stated that it wasn't filed, and he was scared to approach the party. The panel finds that this answer is vague and does not reasonably explain why the claimant never approached the UDPS, particularly from within Canada.\n[26] Rule 11 of the RPD rules17 emphasizes the importance of establishing the claimant's identity and other elements of their claim. It does not impose any absolute requirement upon a claimant to provide such documents but it does require a claimant who does not furnish documents establishing identity and other elements of the claim to explain why they were not able to obtain them. In this case, the panel finds that the claimant provided an unsatisfactory explanation for why he made no effort. His actions show a lack of diligence and considering his existing credibility problems the panel does not believe that he was a genuine member of the UDPS.\nInsufficient remaining evidence to establish allegations\n[27] The panel notes the Canadian medical report18 provided by the claimant. It states that the claimant has hypertension and chronic kidney disease. It does not indicate how these conditions may affect the claimant's testimony, or how he acquired these conditions. The panel affords it appropriate weight, but finds that it is insufficient to overcome the negative inferences taken or to establish the claimant's allegations regarding his UDPS activities or the treatment he allegedly received from the authorities.\n[28] The claimant also submitted a letter from the Carolinas HealthCare System.19 This document pertains to the minor claimant's illness during her sojourn in the US and does not provide information regarding the claimants' experiences in the DRC.\n[29] Country documents20 were also presented by the claimant which discuss issues such as corruption and political violence in the DRC. The panel finds that these do not account for the problems noted above in the claimant's evidence. They are insufficient to overcome the negative inferences taken.\nSummary of Credibility\n[30] The claimant's testimony was lacking in credibility and he was not able to account for contradictions in the evidence presented. A non-genuine document was presented in support of the claim, purporting to establish that the claimant had been tortured and abducted by authorities, and this further undermined the claim. Given the panel's negative credibility findings in this decision, and the panel's findings that the claimant's allegations that he was an active member of the UDPS and was abducted by the DRC authorities due to his political activities and affiliation were not true on a balance of probabilities, the panel finds that the claimant has not established that he would be considered a political opponent or \"combatant\" by the DRC authorities, or that he is currently wanted by the authorities. In addition, the panel notes that the claimant is not part of the diaspora movement active in Belgium, France, or the UK, and he testified that he is not politically active in Canada.\n[31] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is not credible. The numerous credibility concerns examined above, which are central to the core of the claim, cause the panel to doubt the veracity of all the claimant's evidence. The panel therefore finds that the central allegation in this case, that is that the claimant was an active member of the UDPS and targeted as a result, is not true, on a balance of probabilities. The panel is guided in its assessment by the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in Sheikh.21 As such, the panel does not believe the claimant's allegations of being arrested or abducted at any time by DRC authorities.\n[32] Considering all of the above, the panel finds that the claimant has not established that he would face a risk upon return to the DRC, that is more than a mere possibility of persecution, or on a balance of probabilities, a risk of torture, or a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment of punishment.\n[33] The panel finds that the claimant has not been a credible witness and does not accept his allegations of risk in the DRC. The associated claimants have based their claims on that of the claimant; as such, the panel therefore finds that the claimants have not established that they have been targeted for any reason in the DRC. The panel does not find the claimants' allegations of being pursued or targeted by anyone in the DRC to be credible.\nCONCLUSION\n[34] The cumulative effect of all of the above noted credibility concerns are that the panel does not have sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence upon which to base a determination that the claimants are Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.\n[35] Therefore the claims are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"R.

The claimant further fears persecution as a Christian woman living in a predominantly Islamic society.\n[4] More specifically, the claimant alleges that was born in XXXX, Iraq and had been living in northern Iraqi city of XXXX for several years at the time she departed the country in XXXX 2018. XXXX is situated in what is known as the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. In 2014, the claimant started working for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. This work brought her into contact with various non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and local authorities, including the main security force in the Kurdistan Region, known as XXXX. She came to know an XXXX XXXX named XXXX, who took a romantic interest in her and tried to convince her to marry him and to convert to Islam. The claimant continually rejected these proposals. XXXX constant demands disrupted the claimant's life. She was forced to quit her job on four occasions in order to try to keep him away from her. In XXXX 2016, she moved to XXXX to get away from XXXX, hoping that he might forget about her. However, he went to the claimant's home in XXXX and learned from the claimant's sister that she was in XXXX. Thereafter, he called the claimant in XXXX and threatened that he could find her anywhere in the Kurdistan Region. The claimant was afraid to remain in Erbil by herself after this so she moved back to her family home in XXXX. XXXX became more forceful in his communications. One day in XXXX 2018, he showed up at the claimant's house and threatened to kidnap and hurt her and her family if she did not comply with his demands. It was after this incident that the claimant felt that she had no other choice but to leave the country, which she did. Her family moved temporarily to XXXX. The claimant fears that her life will be in danger if she were to return to Iraq.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] The panel finds that the claimant has not established that she would face a serious possibility of persecution were she to return to Iraq. She has also not established, on a balance of probabilities, that she would be personally subject to a danger of torture, a risk to her life, or to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, were she to return to Iraq.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[6] The panel is satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, as to the claimant's personal identity and identity as a national of Iraq, based on the certified true copy of her Iraqi passport in evidence.4\nInternal flight alternative\n[7] The determinative issue in this claim relates to the existence of an internal flight alternative (IFA), the idea being that claimants are expected to find safe haven within their own country unless they can show that it is objectively unreasonable for them to do so. It is not a matter of convenience, or the attractiveness of an IFA, but whether a claimant should be expected to make do in that location before traveling to another country to seek a safe haven.5 The test to be applied in determining whether there is an IFA is two-pronged.6 First, the panel must be satisfied that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country identified as an IFA. Second, conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for her to seek refuge there. Once the issue of an IFA is raised, the onus shifts to the claimant to demonstrate that either of the two prongs is not met.\n[8] During the course of the hearing, the panel raised Baghdad as a potential IFA for the claimant and, having considered all of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant does have a viable IFA there.\nThe claimant would not be at risk in Baghdad\n[9] There is no persuasive evidence before the panel that the claimant's persecutor is looking for her outside of the Kurdistan Region. At the hearing, the panel asked the claimant if XXXX has contacted any of her family members in Iraq in the period after her departure from the country. She answered \"no,\" adding that the XXXX does not hold any power in the central region of Iraq and, therefore, he would not be able to find her family in Baghdad. In light of this, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that that the claimant's persecutor would not have the ability to find the claimant either were she to relocate to Baghdad.\n[10] The panel asked the claimant why she could not relocate to Baghdad, given her testimony that XXXX would be unable to find her family there. She testified that as a Christian and a woman it would not be safe for her living in that city, which she likened to living in a prison. The panel has therefore considered whether being a Christian and a woman would pose a serious possibility of persecution for the claimant in Baghdad.\n[11] With respect to her profile as a Christian, the claimant testified that she is not a very religious person but that she would attend church at Christmas and Easter. She described her family as being the same way. The panel is cognizant that the objective documentary evidence indicates that religious minorities in Iraq, including Christians, are reported to be vulnerable to human rights violations and other abuses, such as abductions, extra-judicial killings, extortion and forced eviction.7 However, considering the claimant's testimony that she is not a very religious person and the fact that she attends church infrequently, the panel finds that it is unlikely that she would be identified or targeted as a Christian were she to relocate to Baghdad. The panel also notes that it has been reported by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) that while the risks against religious minorities persist, the reported number of such incidents has recently reduced.8 In making this finding, the panel further notes the claimant's testimony that her father, who she indicates is a Christian also, has been travelling back and forth between northern Iraq and Baghdad for work for approximately 15 years, holds a high profile, well-paying job in Baghdad and is currently living there with the claimant's mother and brother in a predominantly non-Christian neighborhood. The panel further notes that while the claimant declared in her BOC that her family's move to Baghdad was temporary, they were still residing there as of the date of the hearing, an approximate period, according to the claimant's testimony, of 10-11 months.\n[12] With respect to gender, the claimant testified at the hearing that she could not live in Baghdad because the people and culture are \"behind.\" She stated that she was sure that she would be bothered or sexually harassed were she to live there. The panel finds that this amounts to speculation.\n[13] The panel notes from the objective documentary evidence that women in Iraq face various forms of legal and social discrimination.9 Conservative social norms are said to constrain women's participation in public life throughout the country.10 The same norms are reported to impede women's ability to enjoy the same legal status and rights as men in all aspects of the judicial system.11 In general, law and custom do not respect freedom of movement for women.12 Women routinely require permission from husbands or male relatives to engage in economic activities outside the home.13 Domestic violence is noted to remain a pervasive problem in Iraq, with no law prohibiting it in areas of the country outside the Kurdistan Region.14 Violence against women is said to be significantly underreported and rarely prosecuted.15 It is reported that trafficking in women and girls continues to pose a major problem in Iraq.16 Sexual harassment is reported to be prevalent, with local customs and traditions preventing many women from seeking justice.17\n[14] The panel further notes that the UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines states that \"[w]omen without support and protection provided by their family or tribal network are particularly vulnerable to being harassed, kidnapped or sexually assaulted. In order to ensure livelihoods for themselves and their children, women without a breadwinner may be compelled to engage in prostitution, begging or marriage to elderly men, including in so-called temporary or \"pleasure marriages\" (muta'a).18\n[15] The panel finds that the claimant's circumstances are such that she would not be without support or protection from her family, who continue to live in Baghdad. The claimant's testimony was that they are living comfortably by Iraqi standards, given her father's well-paying job. The panel considers that the claimant's father has considerable knowledge of the city and is stable there, based on the fact has been living and working in Baghdad for approximately 15 years. The panel also draws from evidence of the claimant's education and work history that her father is supportive of her. There is no evidence before the panel to suggest that he would be unwilling or unable to support the claimant were she to join the family in Baghdad.\n[16] While the objective documentary evidence indicates that serious problems continue to exist in Iraq, including in Baghdad, and including problems faced specifically by women, the preponderance of the evidence indicates that such problems are in many cases significantly decreased by the fact that the claimant has a supportive male breadwinner. The panel therefore finds that the claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution in Baghdad on the basis of her gender were she to relocate there.\n[17] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution were she to relocate to Baghdad.\nIt would not be unreasonable for the claimant to relocate to Baghdad\n[18] The Federal Court of Appeal (FCA) has set a very high threshold for the \"unreasonable test,\" requiring nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant in travelling or temporarily relocating to a safe area. There must also be \"actual and concrete\" evidence of such conditions.19 The FCA has also found that it is not enough for refugee claimants:\nto say that they do not like the weather in a safe area, or that they have no friends or relatives there, or that they may not be able to find suitable work there. If it is objectively reasonable in these latter cases to live in these places, without fear of persecution, then IFA exists and the claimant is not a refugee.\n...[I]t is not a matter of a claimant`s convenience or the attractiveness of the IFA, but whether one should be expected to make do in that location, before travelling half-way around the world to seek a safe haven, in another country.20\n[19] The objective documentary evidence21 indicates that the following should be taken into consideration when deciding upon internal relocation to Baghdad:\n* possession of a Civil Status ID (CSID) or the ability to obtain one;\n* ability to speak Arabic (those who cannot are less likely to find employment);\n* the existence of family members or friends able to provide accommodation and assistance;\n* whether the individual is a lone female (women face greater difficulties than men in finding employment);\n* whether the individual can find a sponsor to access a hotel room or rent accommodation;\n* and whether the person is from a minority community.\n[20] The panel finds, based on the evidence, that the claimant meets all of the above criteria: she declared in her BOC that she is of Iraqi nationality and that she speaks Arabic; she has family currently living in Baghdad, including both of her parents, who would be able to provide assistance and accommodation to her - again, her father has been working in Baghdad for a very long period of time; and certified true copies of her Iraq passport and Certificate of Identification are included in Exhibit 1. Additionally, the panel notes that the claimant is well-educated, which the panel finds would assist her in finding employment.\n[21] In light of the evidence, and considering the high threshold set by the FCA, the panel finds that it would not be unreasonable for the claimant to relocate to Baghdad.\nCONCLUSION\n[22] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel determines that the claimant would not face serious possibility of persecution in Iraq, nor, on a balance of probabilities, would she be personally subject to a danger of torture, a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, were she to return to Iraq, owing to the availability of an IFA in Baghdad.\n[23] Accordingly, the panel rejects her claim.\n(signed)\n\"K.

XXXX XXXX (the second claimant) is the 20-year-old male who is the same-sex partner of the princicpal claimant.\n[2] The claimants are both citizens of Iran and hold no other citizenship. They fear returning to Iran because they fear persecution at the hands of the Iranian authorities due to their membership in a particular social group (gay men) and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimants allege that:\n* They are gay men from Shiraz, Iran. They are both from strict Islamic religious families.\n* They have been in a secret relationship in Iran for a while. They separately convinced their parents to allow them to apply to study in Canada.\n* The second claimant arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX 2018 and enrolled in a high school and completed his final year of high school in Canada. The principal claimant arrived in Canada ten months later on XXXX XXXX 2018 and applied to study at a university in Canada.\n* They made their claims for refugee protection on or about 4 March 2019.\n* They fear returning to Iran as they cannot live openly as gay men in Iran.\nDecision\n[3] The panel finds that the claimants are Convention refugees.\nANALYSIS\nPersonal Identity\n[4] The panel is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the claimants have established their personal identities as Iranian citizens based on their testimony, as well as a certified true copy of their Iranian passports at Exhibit 1.\nCredibility\n[5] I find the claimants credible on the material aspects of their claim; namely that they are gay men from Iran. The claimants answered all questions put to them fully, spontaneously and without evasion. I accept the explanation for the inconsistent information in their BOCs that they are Christians (the claimants say this was an error).\n[6] In addition to their testimony, the panel carefully reviewed and considered the following copies of documents the claimants submitted in support of their allegations (Exhibit 4):\n* A letter of acceptance at a private school in Toronto (re: the second claimant)\n* A letter of acceptance for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (re: the principal claimant)\n* A birth certificate (re: the principal claimant)\n* Photos\n* Two affidavits by friends of both claimants\n* Intake confirmation letters from the 519\n* Texting conversation\n* Social media posts\nNature of Harm feared\n[7] The harmed feared by the claimants is serious harm (i.e. physical harm or detention).\nAgent of persecution\n[8] I find that the agents of persecution are the Iranian state and society.\nReason for harm - nexus to the definition\n[9] I find that the claimants have established a nexus to the definition - the harm feared is on account of their membership in a particular social group (sexual orientation).\nLikelihood of harm\n[10] I find that the claimants have established that they have a serious possibility of facing serious harm should they return to Iran. The neutral objective country documentation tendered into evidence by both the board in Exhibit 3 and counsel in Exhibit 4 supports this finding.\n[11] At item 2.1 of Exhibit 3 is the US DOS Iran. Country Reports on Human Rights for 2018. The Executive Summary sets out a brief description of the current political conditions and human rights climate in Iran. It states:\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is an authoritarian theocratic republic with a Shia Islamic political system based on velayat-e faqih (guardianship of the jurist or governance by the jurist). Shia clergy, most notably the rahbar (supreme jurist or supreme leader), and political leaders vetted by the clergy dominate key power structures.\nThe supreme leader is the head of state. The members of the Assembly of Experts are in theory directly elected in popular elections, and the assembly selects and may dismiss the supreme leader. The candidates for the Assembly of Experts, however, are vetted by the Guardian Council (see below) and are therefore selected indirectly by the supreme leader himself. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has held the position since 1989. He has direct or indirect control over the legislative and executive branches of government through unelected councils under his authority. The supreme leader holds constitutional authority over the judiciary, government-run media, and armed forces, and indirectly controls internal security forces and other key institutions. While mechanisms for popular election exist for the president, who is head of government, and for the Islamic Consultative Assembly (parliament or majles), the unelected Guardian Council vets candidates and controls the election process. The supreme leader appoints half of the 12-member Guardian Council, while the head of the judiciary (who is appointed by the supreme leader) appoints the other half. Candidate vetting excluded all but six candidates of 1,636 individuals who registered for the 2017 presidential race. In May 2017 voters re-elected Hassan Rouhani as president. Restrictions on media, including censoring campaign materials and preventing prominent opposition figures from speaking publicly, limited the freedom and fairness of the elections.\nCivilian authorities maintained effective control over the security forces.\nIn response to nationwide protests that began in late December 2017 and continued throughout the year, the government used harsh tactics against protesters. Human rights organizations reported at least 30 deaths of protesters during the year, thousands of arrests, and suspicious deaths in custody.\nThe government's human rights record remained extremely poor and worsened in several key areas. Human rights issues included executions for crimes not meeting the international legal standard of \"most serious crimes\" and without fair trials of individuals, including juvenile offenders; numerous reports of unlawful or arbitrary killings, forced disappearance, and torture by government agents; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; systematic use of arbitrary detention and imprisonment, including hundreds of political prisoners; unlawful interference with privacy; severe restrictions on free expression, the press, and the internet, including censorship, site blocking, and criminalization of libel; substantial interference with the rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of association, such as overly restrictive nongovernmental organization (NGO) laws; egregious restrictions of religious freedom; restrictions on political participation; widespread corruption at all levels of government; unlawful recruitment of child soldiers by government actors to support the Assad regime in Syria; trafficking in persons; harsh governmental restrictions on the rights of women and minorities; criminalization of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) status or conduct; crimes involving violence or threats of violence targeting LGBTI persons; and outlawing of independent trade unions.\nThe government took few steps to investigate, prosecute, punish, or otherwise hold accountable officials who committed these abuses, many of which were perpetrated as a matter of government policy. Impunity remained pervasive throughout all levels of the government and security forces.\nThe country materially contributed to human rights abuses in Syria, through its military support for Syrian President Bashar Assad and Hizballah forces there; in Iraq, through its aid to certain Iraqi Shia militia groups; and in Yemen, through its support for Houthi rebels and directing authorities in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen to harass and detain Bahais because of their religious affiliation.\n.\n[12] This summary plainly states that legal and societal discrimination as well as violence against gays currently exists in Iran.\n[13] Later in the same document more detailed information concerning the situation for sexual minorities in Iran is set out:\nThe law criminalizes consensual same-sex sexual activity, which is punishable by death, flogging, or a lesser punishment. The law does not distinguish between consensual and nonconsensual same-sex intercourse, and NGOs reported this lack of clarity led to both the victim and the perpetrator being held criminally liable under the law in cases of assault. The law does not prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.\nSecurity forces harassed, arrested, and detained individuals they suspected of being LGBTI. In some cases security forces raided houses and monitored internet sites for information on LGBTI persons. Those accused of \"sodomy\" often faced summary trials, and evidentiary standards were not always met. The Iranian LGBTI activist group 6Rang noted that individuals arrested under such conditions were traditionally subjected to forced anal or sodomy examinations, which the United Nations and World Health Organization said can constitute torture, and other degrading treatment and sexual insults. Punishment for same-sex sexual activity between men was more severe than between women. UNSR Jahangir reported in March receiving reports of the continued discrimination, harassment, arbitrary arrest and detention, punishment, and denial of rights of LGBTI persons.\nThe government censored all materials related to LGBTI status or conduct. Authorities particularly blocked websites or content within sites that discussed LGBTI issues, including the censorship of Wikipedia pages defining LGBTI and other related topics. There were active, unregistered LGBTI NGOs in the country. Hate crime laws or other criminal justice mechanisms did not exist to aid in the prosecution of bias-motivated crimes.\nThe law requires all male citizens older than age 18 to serve in the military but exempts gay men and transgender women, who are classified as having mental disorders. New military identity cards listed the subsection of the law dictating the exemption. According to 6Rang, this practice identified gay or transgender individuals and put them at risk of physical abuse and discrimination.\nNGOs reported that authorities pressured LGBTI persons to undergo gender reassignment surgery.\nAccording to a May report by 6Rang, the number of private and semigovernmental psychological and psychiatric clinics allegedly engaging in \"corrective treatment\" of LGBTI persons continued to grow during the year. 6Rang reported the increased use at such clinics of electric shock therapy to the hands and genitals of LGBTI persons, prescription of psychoactive medication, hypnosis, and coercive masturbation to pictures of the opposite sex. Many of these practices may constitute torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment under international law. According to the report, one such institution is called \"The Anonymous Sex Addicts Association of Iran,\" with branches in 18 provinces.\nDespite government programs to treat and provide financial and other assistance to persons with HIV\/AIDS, international news sources and organizations reported that individuals known to be infected with HIV\/AIDS faced widespread societal discrimination. Individuals with HIV\/AIDS, for example, continued to be denied employment as teachers.\n[14] Further, at item 6.1 of Exhibit 3 is a report entitled Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Rights in Iran published in July 2015 by Outright Action International. It states:\nIn present-day Iran, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) individuals suffer from human rights violations and are denied the basic freedom of being who they are. Abuses are perpetrated by the Iranian government, the judiciary system and by non-state actors such as schools, communities and families. No one is held accountable for these serious violations of basic rights.\nIn a country of over 75 million people, the population of LGBT Iranians is estimated in the millions, much like their numbers found in societies of similar size. But in Iran, due to multiple pressures and restrictions, this community is invisible and experiences much suffering and pressure from all parts of society to conform to gender norms. LGBT Iranians live within a rigid system of social, religious and legal values and norms, dictated by the government.\n[15] Counsel also tendered into evidence numerous documents including recent reports from authoritative sources at Exhibit 4 that speak to an existence of state-sponsored homophobia in Iran.\n[15] The neutral country of origin information tendered into evidence in this case unambiguously supports the claimants' allegation that as a gay men they have a seriously possibility of, at very best, facing systemic discrimination amounting to persecution should they live openly as a gay men in Iran.\nState protection\n[16] I find that the claimants cannot avail themselves of state protection in this case as the state is the agent of persecution.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[17] I find there is no viable IFA anywhere in Iran as the state is the agent of persecution in this case.\nCONCLUSION\n[18] Therefore, for the foregoing reasons, I conclude that the claimants are Convention refugees under Section 96 of IRPA and therefore allow these claims.\n(signed)\n\"L.

The PC claimant provided all the evidence on her behalf and acted as her Designated Representative for the purposes of the hearing.\nAllegations and Background\n[3] The details of the claimants' fear of persecution are set out in the narrative portions of their Personal Information Forms3 and subsequent amendments;4 however, the following is a summary of the allegations.\n[4] The PC alleges to fear FARC guerrillas who targeted her prior to coming to Canada in 2010. The PC owned a XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX from 2004 onwards. On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010 she was approached by a member of FARC who wished to lease one of her XXXX properties. This property was owned by her XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and located behind the neighboring police station. The XXXX was out of town. An application to lease was filed without the proper supporting documentation.\n[5] The FARC member returned on XXXX XXXX, 2010 and introduced himself as a FARC Front 19 member and wanted to contact the owner. The FARC member began pressuring her to provide the keys, stating that commander \"XXXX\" wanted the property and she must comply.\n[6] The PC reported this to the police station; however, she did not make a denunciation as it was just \"a conversation\" and the officer indicated that she should return if anything further occurred and then file a formal denunciation. On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010, the PC received a threatening call confirming that she must turn over the keys to the home on XXXX XXXX, 2010 to the FARC member, and reminded her that \"squealers died.\" No denunciation was made as she was warned not to.\n[7] The PC took a leave of absence from her work XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010, while leaving church, she was approached by FARC militants. The militants delivered a new warning and imposed a new war tax as well, to be paid in 20 days.\n[8] The PC was instructed that if she complied, her family's rights to her mother's farm, which had been confiscated in 2006 and occupied by FARC, would be preserved. The PC closed her business on XXXX XXXX and moved to a friend's home with her mother. Nothing was reported again to the police.\n[9] On XXXX XXXX, 2010, the PC and her mother moved to Bogota to join her daughter, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The business was sold on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010. On XXXX XXXX, 2010 there was an attempted kidnapping of the PC's daughter in Bogota. This was reported to the police on XXXX XXXX, 2010. On XXXX XXXX, the PC received a threatening call from commander XXXX, and she and her family moved to a new location with a friend. On XXXX XXXX XXXX the claimant decided to leave the country, and purchased plane tickets on XXXX XXXX. They left Colombia on XXXX XXXX, 2010 and came to Canada via the United States.\n[10] This claim was heard by the Refugee Protection Division and on March 11, 2013; a negative decision was rendered. The decision was appealed to the Federal Court, and on XXXX XXXX, XXXX the claim was returned by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to the RPD for redetermination before a newly constituted panel. This is the decision of the redetermination.\nDETERMINATION\n[11] The panel finds that the claimants are not Convention refugees, nor persons in need of protection as they do not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention refugee ground in Colombia and, on a balance of probabilities, they do not face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or risk of torture if returned to Colombia today.\nTHE ISSUES\n[12] The determinative issue in this claim is well-foundness of the claim given the change in circumstances in Colombia.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[13] The claimants provided Colombian passports and copies of their Colombian Personal ID cards5 on entry to Canada, and the panel is satisfied that the claimants have established their identities as nationals of Colombia.\nCredibility\n[14] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are indeed true unless there is valid reason to doubt their veracity.6 The determination as to whether a claimant's evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities.7\n[15] By definition, a Convention refugee is someone who has a well-founded fear of persecution, and both the subjective and objective components are required to meet the definition.8 While some credibility issues did arise with the evidence before the panel, for the purposes of this decision, change in circumstances and state protection in conjunction with the claimants' profiles are determinative.\nChange of Circumstances and well-foundedness of the fear today\n[16] The determinative issue in this claim is the change of circumstances in Colombia and whether the claimants have a well-founded fear of persecution in Colombia today, nine years after their departure from Colombia.\n[17] The test of well-foundedness in Adjei9 applies to claims involving an assessment of changed or changing country conditions.10 As set out in the Federal Court, a change of circumstances is relevant for determining whether, after an absence from the country of nationality, there has been a \"meaningful,\" \"effective\" and \"durable\" change in country conditions, and if there has been, does the change in circumstances support a continuation of a risk on return today.11 12\n[18] Justice Robertson states in Rahman:13\nThis Court has previously held in Yusuf ... that the issue of \"changed circumstances\" is essentially one of fact. Indeed, what is important is not so much the change as the actual circumstances existing in the claimant's country of origin. The question is whether those circumstances support the claimant's alleged well-founded fear of persecution.\n[19] The panel has considered the information contained in the most recent National Documentation Package on Colombia,14 and the situation in Colombia regarding the most significant developments surrounding the conclusion of a peace deal between the government and the FARC and other entities.15\n[20] On June 15, 2014, President Juan Manuel Santos was elected for a second term of office, based on his platform of negotiating peace with the FARC. The Peace talks with FARC began in October 2012 in Havana, Cuba and continued until a final agreement and disarmament was reached in August 201616 - almost six years after the claimants arrived in Canada.\n[21] The October 2016 referendum to ratify the deal was unsuccessful, but the Government and FARC signed a revised peace deal in November and sent it to Congress for ratification instead of conducting a second referendum. Both houses of Congress ratified the revised peace accord on November 29-30, 2016, marking an end to the conflict.\n[22] The Department of State (DOS) Report for Colombia for 2018 addresses the recent and up-to-date situation in Colombia and notes in part:\nColombia is a constitutional, multiparty republic. In June voters elected Ivan Duque Marquez president in elections that observers considered free and fair and the most peaceful in decades.\n...\nThe government took steps to investigate, prosecute, and punish officials who committed human rights abuses, although some cases experienced long delays that raised concerns about accountability. The Special Jurisdiction for Peace (SJP, or JEP in Spanish)--the justice component of the Comprehensive System for Truth, Justice, Reparation, and Non-Repetition--started operations during the year.\nAs part of the 2016 peace accord, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), formerly the country's largest guerrilla insurgency group, disarmed and reincorporated as a political party that participated in the March congressional elections and initially nominated a presidential candidate, who withdrew from the race in May. On July 20, FARC representatives took up eight of their guaranteed 10 seats in congress.17\n[23] While the Report also states that \"Civilian authorities generally maintained effective control over security forces,\"18 there is evidence that some illegal armed groups, including the National Liberation Army (ELN), continued to commit human rights abuses.\"19\n[24] There is documentary evidence20 that illegal armed groups continue to operate in Colombia, for political or drug trafficking purposes, or both, however this is by no means a threat to the entire territory, but affects those areas strategic for coca cultivation, cocaine production, and for trafficking abroad.\n[25] The claimants specifically had issues with FARC prior to XXXX 2010 and maintain that it is FARC whom they fear on return. The PC's mother's farm had been occupied by FARC in 2006, and FARC allegedly retaliated against the PC's sister when she tried through government procedures to repossess it in 2014. The PC's sister fled to Canada and obtained refugee protection.\n[26] The PC ran into problems with FARC in 2010 when they wanted to obtain a lease over XXXX. XXXX property which she was leasing. She was threatened on several occasions and eventually she took her mother and they relocated to Bogota to live with her daughter. When there was an attempted kidnapping of her daughter and a threatening call from FARC, they all decided to leave.\n[27] Since these events, the country conditions have greatly changed in Colombia. The PC offered no updated information on XXXX XXXX XXXX and his property that FARC wanted to gain control of; nor updated information on the individual to whom she sold her XXXX XXXX business to in XXXX XXXX, or any subsequent problems she encountered.\n[28] The PC confirmed that she has siblings living in and around Bogota, as well as a brother in Barranquilla, and none have any issues with FARC. The PC and her mother have no high risk profile. The PC fears that if she tries through the government programs to get possession of her mother's farm in XXXX XXXX, FARC will harm her. There is no convincing evidence before the panel from an objective basis that FARC has continued to pressure for war tax or to retaliate on old vendettas. Quite the contrary. FARC holds political seats and participates in the Colombian democracy,21 and the majority of the FARC members from 2010 have embraced peace with the government.\n[29] If the PC and her mother are fearful about retaliation for efforts to gain repossession of their farm, they are certainly not obligated to do so on return. While safely in Canada, there is no evidence that the claimants pursued repossession of their farm in XXXX XXXX over the past nine years, and there is no obligation to undertake this on their return either.\n[30] The country documentation confirms that those that suffer from the continued criminal activity are not individuals like the claimants. The Amnesty International submission to the United Nations in 2018 notes that while guerilla related violence has decreased in Colombia, the Indigenous Peoples, Afro-Colombians and peasant communities continue to be victims of the smouldering dispute that continues in certain areas of the Pacific coast despite the Peace Agreement.22\n[31] Insight crime reports that, while the majority of FARC participants have entered into a peace deal with the Colombian government and now form a new political party known as the Revolutionary Alternative Common Force, with 10 guaranteed seats in the Colombian congress23 splinter FARC dissidents still plague certain areas of Colombia in the departments of Guaviare and Meta, closer to the jungle and rivers systems which serve the continuation of drug trafficking. The insurgent actions in these areas are more about extortion and intimidation to protect the criminal activities,24 and the claimants can return to family who live far from these areas and without any problems.\n[32] It is noteworthy that the Government and FARC reached agreement and the 2018 DOS Report states:\nAs part of the peace accord, the FARC registered a political party composed of former FARC members in 2017 under the name People's Alternative Revolutionary Force (Fuerza Alternativa Revolucionaria del Comun), maintaining the same acronym. The FARC political party participated in the March congressional elections and initially nominated a presidential candidate, who withdrew from the race in May. On July 20, FARC political party representatives took up eight of their guaranteed 10 seats in congress.25 [emphasis added]\n[33] It further states,\nThe Colombian National Police (CNP) is responsible for internal law enforcement and is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defense ... The government continued to expand education and training of the armed forces in human rights and international humanitarian law.26\n[34] Overall, the DOS Reports confirms that while there is violence in Colombia, it is largely emanating from groups other than the FARC, who have mostly embraced the peace treaty. The activities of the ELN and other criminal groups are actively combatted by government forces, with successes, and it is noted that certain individuals are more targeted than others, none of which the claimants fall under.27\n[35] The panel finds that the change of circumstances in Colombia is durable and has led to substantive and measurable changes in the nature of Colombian politics, and increased levels of security experienced by the population as a whole. This change has paved the way for adequate state protection for citizens with problems, and especially those with problems historically with FARC.\nThe Claimant's Profile and FARC\n[36] The panel has also considered the September 2015 UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Asylum-Seekers from Colombia28 and notes that it has been more than nine years since the claimants resided in Colombia and the PC worked as a XXXX.\n[37] While the Guidelines are now three years out of date, it is noted that the claimants do not currently have any profile that is identified in the 2015 report. The panel concludes that the claimants do not have a high risk profile, which could present any danger with FARC in Colombia today.\n[38] While the PC testified that she believed that she would be located by FARC on return as she failed to cooperate with FARC in 2010; or that they would target her or her mother as they do not want the farm repossessed, the panel notes that the PC's siblings in Colombia who have not tried to gain access to the farm and have experienced no problems, and as identified above, the activities of FARC have been significantly diminished by the peace accord that took place after the claimants fled.\n[39] While the panel is sympathetic to the PC's desire to remain in Canada with her daughter,29 now a permanent resident through marriage, and to keep her mother in Canada who has medical challenges being addressed in Canada, these are humanitarian factors relevant for consideration in a different immigration application and are not determinative considerations in a Convention refugee claim.\n[40] In this case, the panel must consider the change in circumstances and the current well-foundedness of the fear. In Sukhraj Singh,30 the Federal Court recognized that the documentary evidence in a particular case may not be unequivocal as to the political situation in a country, and even contradictory in certain areas (it is up to the Refugee Protection Division to assess whether the evidence is sufficient to support its conclusion. In so doing, it can reasonably rely on evidence it considers most consistent with reality).\n[41] As a result, improved country conditions may be found to be sufficient given the claimants' circumstances, notwithstanding the fact that there is room for even more improvements, like the continued rogue criminal activities in the remote areas of Colombia.\n[42] A fair analysis of the change in circumstances in Colombia does not support the PC's allegation that they will be targeted today for their interactions with FARC in 2010. At the time that the claimants left Colombia, FARC had the power and influence to terrorize segments of the Colombian population, with impunity. The subsequent peace agreement reached with the main stream FARC members, has brought a meaningful change to country conditions in Colombia and has enabled the elected government officials to better govern the country effectively.\n[43] The demobilization process is not a temporary measure either. It is an integral component of the peace deal and FARC is adhering to the terms.\nIn June 2017, the UN political mission in Colombia verified that FARC guerrillas who accepted the peace agreement with the government had handed their weapons to the mission. The demobilized guerrilla group later announced it was forming a political party, the Revolutionary Alternative Force of the Common People.31\n[44] While it is reported that \"a minority of dissident guerrilla fighters rejected the terms of the peace agreement, have not disarmed, and continue to commit abuses.\"32 The peace deal is in place; it is supported by both sides; and the panel is not persuaded that the presence of a minority of dissidents detracts from the durability of the change of circumstances that has occurred since the claimant left Colombia almost nine years ago.\n[45] Furthermore, the continued stability of Colombia is of interest to the international community. The United Nations continues to play an active role in the process and it works closely with both sides in the deal to ensure it remains supported and implemented, as identified by Human Rights Watch:\nThe peace agreement between the Colombian government and the FARC\nprovided for the creation of a \"Special Jurisdiction for Peace\" to try those\nresponsible for gross human rights violations committed during the conflict.\nFARC guerrillas and members of the armed forces responsible for crimes\nagainst humanity and serious war crimes who fully cooperate with the new\njurisdiction and confess their crimes are subject to as much as eight years of\n\"effective restrictions on freedoms and rights,\" but no prison time.33\n[46] Finally, the report states that the government has created \"an Interior Ministry program that assigns protection to human rights defenders, trade unionists, and journalists....\"34\n[47] The transformation of a 52-year-old conflict into lasting peace has been, and continues to be a process. In this process, the panel accepts that documented human rights abuses occur and it will take time for the full effect of the peace deal to be realized. That being said, the panel finds that the objective documentary evidence establishes persuasively that a verifiable change of circumstances has occurred in Colombia based on that evidence. The panel finds that the implementation of the deal, which continues to be reported widely and monitored by the UN and other international monitoring and human rights organizations, is representative of FARC's transformation and its new status and commitment to peace.\n[48] The PC provided evidence that two sisters received Canada's protection. One who had a XXXX XXXX as an XXXX, and therefore a completely different profile from the PC, and another who encountered a problem when trying to repossess the family farm from FARC in 2016.\n[49] As already addressed, neither the PC or her mother have a high risk profile, and there is no obligation on their return to investigate the accessibility of their family farm in XXXX XXXX, if they are fearful. Documents provided by the claimants35 confirm that XXXX XXXX is located in a conflict area. Certainly, the claimants can return to Cali, or other areas far from XXXX XXXX where they are anonymous. The PC's sibling located close to XXXX XXXX in Barranquilla has no problems with FARC according to the PC. In fact, all the other family members have lived peacefully in Colombia since the claimants' departure in 2010, outside of XXXX XXXX.\n[50] For the reasons stated, the panel finds a durable and lasting peace has been attained in Colombia, and the claimants do not have a profile that gives rise to a risk on return.\nCONCLUSION\n[51] In conclusion, the panel finds that the claimants are not Convention refugees under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act or persons in need of protection within the meaning of section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act by virtue of a change of circumstances in Colombia and by virtue of the claimants' personal circumstances in respect of that change.\n[52] The panel rejects the claims.\n(signed)\n\"Elana Rose\"\nElana Rose\nJune 3, 2019\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n2 Exhibit 2, Personal Information Forms (PIF) Narrative.\n3 Exhibit 2-3, PIF, TB0-12882 and TB0-13101.\n4 Exhibit 5, Federal Court Record.\n5 Exhibit 1, Package of Information from the referring CBSA\/CIC.\n6 Maldonado, Pedro Enrique Juarez v.

Joined to this claim is also XXXX XXXX, who is the PC's father and a Hungarian citizen, but is represented by separate counsel. They all are seeking refugee protection, pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\n[2] This claim was initially heard on December 4, 2012. In a decision of February 1, 2013, the RPD found that the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. The RPD found that the claimants had not provided clear and convincing evidence of the state's inability to protect them. The RPD found, therefore, that there was not a serious possibility of persecution should they return to Hungary.\n[3] Following a judicial review of the RPD's decision, the Federal Court referred the claim back to the RPD for a de novo hearing, which took place on March 12, 2019. Prior to the de novo hearing, the PC's husband's claim was suspended by the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA). The PC's husband, XXXX XXXX, was the PC in the initial hearing. The claimants, with the exception of XXXX XXXX, rely on XXXX XXXX PIF narrative and subsequent amendment for their claims.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The PC and her children allege the following:\n[5] They have experienced countless occurrences of discrimination, denigration, belittlement, abuse, and harassment as a result of their ethnicity. They have identified the Guards or Guardists and the Jobbik party specifically as those whom they most fear. They also state that they have experienced discrimination in employment, health care, and housing, as well as societal discrimination.\n[6] In an amendment to their narrative, the claimants have provided specific examples of the discrimination they have faced. They have all faced discrimination in education and as a result of insults, threats and ostracism, the PC's children were moved to another school, but the mistreatment continued.\n[7] In 2003, the PC's son XXXX XXXX who died in XXXX, was physically abused by a nurse while he was in the hospital for treatment of a XXXX XXXX. The hospital refused to investigate the incident and the police refused to give them a report. The narrative also indicates that the PC was ignored and mistreated at the hospital, because of her Roma background, each time she went in to give birth.\n[8] In 2006 the PC and her husband were followed by four Guardists. When they caught up with the claimants, they beat them and broke the PC's arm and her husband's leg. They were taken to the hospital, but the report filed with the police disappeared and the police refused to investigate or provide a report.\n[9] In XXXX, after the claimants had arrived in Canada, their son XXXX XXXX XXXX was killed in a traffic accident. The story was published in the XXXX XXXX and the names of the claimants were given in the newspaper story, identifying them as refugee claimants. Following the story in the XXXX XXXX XXXX their situation was publicized in Hungary, eliciting racist online comments and threats. The claimants fear that because their situation as refugee claimants, that and their identities have become known in Hungary, they will be targeted by racist elements in the country should they return to Hungary.\n[10] XXXX XXXX (XXXX) alleges the following:\n[11] As a child at school, he was ostracized, mocked, and physically abused. Later, as an adult in the workplace, he faced discrimination, always being relegated to the lowest jobs. He described an incident while working at a XXXX XXXX in his home city of Miskolc. He, like other Roma, initially was hired as a XXXX, but was later elevated to the position of XXXX XXXX where he wore a suit and tie, working alongside non-Roma Hungarians. Although he was excluded from social functions by the other XXXX, he worked hard and was praised for his efforts by his supervisor. Nonetheless, several months later, he was replaced by a non-Roma individual and told he could return to his previous work as a XXXX. After leaving the XXXX XXXX where he had worked, he was unable to find another job as a XXXX XXXX with other XXXX XXXX because of his Roma background.\n[12] He also indicated in his PIF narrative, that his interactions with police were typically negative, ranging from being frisked and asked for ID, to being fined for minor infractions like jaywalking. He also stated that he was evicted from his home in Miskolc and had to move in with his mother\nDETERMINATION\n[13] The RPD finds that the claimants would not face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, and that, on a balance of probabilities, they would not personally be subjected to a risk to life or danger of torture.\nKEY ISSUES\n[14] The key issues in this case are persecution versus discrimination\/harassment and state protection.\nIdentity\n[15] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants have established their identities through their genuine passports.\nPersecution versus discrimination\/harassment\n[16] Persecution is not defined by the Convention. However, persecution can mean sustained or systematic violation of basic human rights demonstrating a failure of state protection.2 Case law has stated that to be considered persecution, the mistreatment suffered or anticipated must be serious,3 and occur with repetition or exercise of that right might be affected. In other words, the legal question to be determined is: \"Does the persecution alleged by the claimant threaten his or her basic human rights in a fundamental way.\"4\n[17] The Federal Court of Appeal in the case of Sagharichi5 stated:\nIt is true that the dividing line between persecution and discrimination or harassment is difficult to establish, the more so since, in refugee law context, it has been found that discrimination may very well be seen as amounting to persecution. It is for the Board to draw the conclusion in a practical, factual context by proceeding with a careful analysis of the evidence adduced and a proper balancing of the various elements contained therein and the intervention of this Court is not warranted unless the conclusion reached appears to be capricious and unreasonable.\n[18] The panel is aware that discriminatory practices against Roma exist in Hungary at many levels; however, the documentary evidence shows that the conditions in the country are not such that the entire Roma population is subject to persecution. The panel finds that the documentary evidence shows that Roma are discriminated in many spheres of life, but in a reading of all the documentary evidence about the situation of Roma in Hungary, the panel determines that it is not possible for it to conclude, or by extension find, that 1) all Roma in Hungary are persecuted; and 2) that the particular circumstances of the claimants demonstrate they will face persecution if they return to Hungary. Moreover, while the panel finds that as a group, the Roma in Hungary face discrimination, it does not find that the evidence referenced in this case establishes that Roma, as a group, face persecution.\n[19] In the Balogh decision,6 the Court noted that the mere fact of being Roma in Hungary is not, in and of itself, sufficient to establish that an applicant faces more than a mere possibility of persecution upon return. Based on these claimants' evidence at the hearing, their personal experiences do not support a finding that they have faced discrimination amounting to persecution, or that they face a forward-looking risk of persecution simply because they are Roma.\n[20] As explained by Justice LeBlanc at paragraph 19 of this decision:\nMoreover, while the documentary evidence of general country conditions of Roma in Hungary raises human rights concerns, the mere fact of being of Roma ethnicity in Hungary is not, in and of itself, sufficient to establish that an applicant faces more than a mere possibility of persecution upon return (Csonka v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 1056, at paras 67-70 [Csonka]; Ahmad v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2004 FC 808, at para 22 [Ahmad]. Both subjective fear and objective fear are components in respect of a valid claim for refugee status (Csonka, art para 3). The applicant has a burden of establishing a link between the general documentary evidence and the applicant's specific circumstances (Proph\u00e8te v Canada (Citizenship & Immigration), 2008 FC 331, at para 17; Jarada v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 409, at para 28; Ahmad, at para 22).7\n[21] Having examined the evidence in this case, the panel finds that the discrimination experienced by the claimants did not threaten their fundamental rights, but rather the quality of life in their home country. Aside from their children, who were in school, the PC's husband was employed off and on doing \"occasional work\" from 2000 until they came to Canada in 2011. The PC stayed at home to look after their children. The claimants lived in a rented home described by the PC as having two rooms and a kitchen, but no running water. There was no evidence to suggest that they were denied health care or social services. The PC testified that she delivered all of her children in a hospital.\nEmployment and Housing\n[22] The panel acknowledges that the claimants lived in sub-par housing and that the PC's husband managed only occasional work. The PC's father, XXXX, has referenced his eviction from his home as well as his problems in finding work after he left his job at the XXXX XXXX when he was demoted to the position of XXXX. Their narratives suggest that they experienced discrimination in employment because of their Roma ethnicity.\n[23] The panel notes that both the PC's husband and her father had little education, which no doubt contributed to their under-employment. The panel also recognizes that Roma, especially those of earlier generations, received inferior education. While Roma face more difficulty in obtaining steady employment than ethnic Hungarians, and they experience levels of unemployment far greater than ethnic Hungarians do, many Roma nevertheless do find jobs and do enjoy full employment in spite of their ethnicity. The panel notes that, while the PC's father believed he was demoted back to XXXX from the position of XXXX XXXX because of his ethnicity, it also notes that he chose to quit work when he was told to return to his XXXX XXXX position, and that he collected unemployment benefits after leaving his job.\n[24] The panel notes that the Hungarian constitution and laws prohibit discrimination based on race, among other things, and the labor code provides for the principles of equal treatment.8 The panel acknowledges, however, that the employment level of the Romani population is much less than that of the non-Romani population, and their unemployment rate is much higher.9 The panel finds the employment situations experienced by both the PC's husband and her father consistent with the pattern of under-employment and unemployment experienced by a significant portion of the Romani population.\n[25] As indicated above, it is likely that the employment difficulties experienced by the PC's husband and by her father were, in large part, a result of the limited and inferior education they received. One of the claimants' documents10 highlights the problems faced by a group of Roma individuals who received what the first level court in Hungary called \"an inferior level of education.\" In these cases, it was clear that their difficulty in obtaining good jobs as adults was directly related to the inferior level of education they received in school as children.\nEducation\n[26] The PC spoke about the difficulties her children experienced at school - how they had been segregated and ostracized because of their Roma ethnicity. The PC's daughter XXXX, testified that she had been assaulted at school by some students, and that the teacher had spoken to the students but that they did not listen. The PC stated that they had transferred the children to another school, but that the poor treatment continued. The discriminatory treatment of Roma in the Hungarian education system is well-documented,11 with Roma children regularly being held back, segregated in Roma-only classes or worse, and forced into special classes for children with mental incapacities and learning disabilities.\n[27] That being said, in April 2014, the ombudsman (now the Commissioner for Fundamental Rights) released a comprehensive report on the educational situation in secondary schools with a curriculum designed for children belonging to any of the 13 officially registered national minorities.12 The report concluded, that secondary schools featuring curriculum designed for Roma and operated by the National Roma Self-government (ORO) or churches, generally provided substandard education to children, which raised the risk of denial of equal opportunities.13 Schools with a majority of Romani students employed a simplified teaching curriculum, lacked well-trained minority language teachers, were generally less well equipped, and were in significantly worse physical condition than those with non-Romani majorities.14 However, there was no indication that this was the type of school that any of these claimants attended in Miskolc. Thus, while the panel finds that while all the claimants likely faced discrimination in school, the panel does not find that the PC's children received substandard education.\n[28] The panel acknowledges that there is a long history of segregation of Roma in Hungary's school system. It is a troubling reality, not only in Hungary but it is also referenced by the European Union in the other states of Central and Eastern Europe. In Hungary, however, the government is demonstrating that it is taking and steps and implementing actions to provide better opportunities for Roma children. Indeed, Amnesty International15 reported the following last year:\n...a court in Eger issued a first-instance verdict that Roma children in Heves County were unlawfully segregated in schools and classes providing education designed for children with special needs. In June, the European Commission initiated infringement proceedings against Hungary for discrimination of Roma in education.\n[29] The panel acknowledges that the educational system in Hungary is not without discrimination towards Roma children. Nonetheless, the state has intervened to address some of the problems:\nAlthough the law provides for free and compulsory education between the ages of three and 16 and prohibits school segregation, NGOs reported the segregation of Romani children in schools and frequent misdiagnosis of Romani children as mentally disabled.\nIn November 2016 the Appeals Court of Pecs adopted a decision ordering the desegregation of a Roma-only school in Kaposvar. Despite the judgment, the municipality of Kaposvar, in cooperation with the local school authority and the county government, attempted to restore segregation by allowing and supporting a private foundation to establish a new school in the same building in which the segregated school was operating. The municipality proposed to offer education in a private school for the Romani children residing in the close vicinity of the building and thus avoid their integration into mainstream schools. The Ministry of Human Capacities intervened to prevent the private school from opening. On October 4, the Supreme Court affirmed the lower court ruling that segregation is illegal and ordered the desegregation of the school.\nIn 2015 a lawsuit was filed on behalf of 62 children against the municipality of Gyongyospata and the Klebelsberg School Maintenance Center for their segregation in the primary school in Gyongyospata, for damages stemming from the low quality of their education, and for nonpecuniary damages related to their segregation. The lawsuit was pending at year's end.\nAccording to the Roma Education Fund, 20 percent of Romani children attained a secondary school diploma (compared with 80 percent of non-Romani children) and only 2 percent obtained university diplomas in 2015. According to the EC's Roma integration indicators scoreboard (2011-16), the percentage of Romani students ending education and training early decreased from 78 to 68 percent.16\n[30] The panel finds no persuasive evidence before it to conclude that Roma cannot, and do not, pursue higher education opportunities in Hungary, if desired. The documentary evidence before this panel does not establish that Roma are being denied outright the opportunity to obtain an education at any level.\n[31] The claimants' experiences have prompted the panel to reflect on the experiences of Canada's indigenous people as well as its treatment of visible minorities. The discrimination of the Roma people, in many ways, has paralleled the discrimination faced by Canada's indigenous people with respect to education, housing, and employment. The treatment and profiling of Roma people by Hungarian security, in many ways, is reminiscent of the targeting of visible minorities in Canada by police forces through their policy of \"carding\". Are these acts of persecution? Perhaps in certain cases. It would be unreasonable, however, to generalize about the treatment of Canada's indigenous people and visible minorities as persecution, just as it is unreasonable to generalize about the treatment of Roma people in Hungry.\n[32] Notwithstanding the panel's finding that, in this case, the claimants' past treatment does not rise to the level of persecution, the panel most consider whether they will be persecuted should they return to Hungary due to their Roma ethnicity, and whether they could access state protection at the operational level.\nState Protection\n[33] In determining the availability and adequacy of state protection, it is important to reiterate some of the principles as set out by the courts. To rebut the presumption of state protection, a refugee claimant must provide \"clear and convincing\" evidence of the state's inability to protect its citizens.17 A refugee claimant who alleges that state protection is inadequate, must persuade the panel that the evidence establishes that the state protection is, in fact, inadequate. The evidence that state protection is inadequate must not only be reliable and probative, it must also satisfy the panel, on a balance of probabilities, that state protection is inadequate.18 Where a state is in effective control of its territory, has military, police and civil authority in place, and makes serious efforts to protect its citizens, the mere fact that the state's efforts are not always successful will not rebut the presumption of state protection.19 A refugee claimant cannot rebut the presumption of state protection in a functioning democracy by asserting only a subjective reluctance to engage the state.20 Doubting the effectiveness of the protection offered by the state when one has not really tested it, does not rebut the existence of a presumption of state protection.21\n[34] Refugee protection is meant to be a form of surrogate protection, to be invoked only in those situations where the refugee claimant has unsuccessfully sought the protection of their home state. The onus is on the refugee claimant to approach the state for protection in situations where state protection might be reasonably forthcoming.22 In the absence of a compelling explanation, a failure to pursue state protection opportunities within the home state will usually be fatal to a refugee claim, at least where the state is a functioning democracy with a willingness, and the apparatus, necessary to provide a measure of protection to its citizens.23\n[35] The refugee claimant's burden of proof is directly proportional to the level of democracy in the state in question: the more democratic the state's institutions, the more the refugee claimant must have done to exhaust all courses of action open to them.24 In a functioning democracy, a refugee claimant will have a heavy burden when attempting to show that they should not have been required to exhaust all of the recourses available to them domestically before claiming refugee status.25\n[36] A refugee claimant must show that they have taken all reasonable steps, in the circumstances, to seek protection, taking into account the context of the country of origin, the steps taken, and the refugee claimant's interactions with the authorities.26 Local failures by authorities to provide protection does not mean that the state as a whole fails to protect its citizens, unless the failures form part of a broader pattern of the state's inability or refusal to provide protection.27 No government is expected to guarantee perfect protection to all of its citizens at all times, and the fact that a state is not always successful in protecting its citizens is not enough to justify a claim, especially where a state is in effective control of its territory, has military, police and civil authorities in place, and is making serious efforts to protect its citizens.28 Less than perfect protection is not a basis to determine that a state is either unwilling or unable to offer reasonable protection.29\n[37] The panel is required to determine the \"...state protection actually provided at the present time that is relevant.\"30 The panel's analysis of the protection available to Roma, in Hungary today, is that such protection is operationally adequate based on its analysis that follows. The panel notes that regard must be given to what is actually happening, and not what the state is endeavouring to put in place.31 In this case, the panel finds the government's efforts to have \"actually translated into adequate state protection\" at the operational level.32\n[38] The panel notes from its reading of the documentary materials, including human rights monitoring groups, the customary annual reports that the Board references, and the diverse media sources, that there are no current reports of right-wing and nationalist marches or gatherings in Hungary that are targeting, harassing, and threatening Roma. While discriminatory attitudes persist among some groups and people in Hungary today, there is no documented evidence before the panel to suggest, or to establish, that other nationalist or right-wing groups have been targeting Roma today as they were in the years leading up to the claimants' departure, or that these groups are supported by the State.\nPolice\n[39] With respect to the claimants' specific experiences with the police, the panel notes that similar encounters like these lie at the heart of virtually all Roma claims from the rural villages and towns of northeastern Hungary, where anti-Roma sentiment has often manifested itself in the form of police indifference to the plight of the country's largest ethnic minority.\n[40] In the case at hand, the PIF narrative amendment indicates that in 2006, the PC and her husband were followed by four Guardists who beat them, breaking her hand and her husband's leg. Their neighbours contacted the police and an ambulance. The PC testified that the police took notes but that they never received a police report. Later, when they went to the police station, they were told that they could not find the report. The panel notes, however, that documentary evidence states that doctors are required to report to police, injuries sustained as a result of a crime.33 The panel finds it improbable that, if in fact the claimants had sustained the kinds of injuries they allege, that at least a hospital report would have been available. The absence of any report undermines the PC's credibility, and indicates a lack of effort in obtaining corroboration of a significant incident in her narrative.\n[41] The PC also described an incident that took place in 2003, when her son XXXX had been hospitalized with a XXXX XXXX. When they went to visit him, they found the nurse hitting his head against the grating of the bed. They complained to the hospital director, who refused to investigate, and contacted the police who refused to issue a report because they believed the nurse. While the incident is troubling, the panel does not find this isolated incident to be persuasive evidence of a lack of state protection.\n[42] The PC's father (XXXX) in his narrative, referenced an incident that occurred in 2008 or 2009 when was also attacked by four Guardists who ran away when pedestrians approached. He stated that he was beaten and cut in the attack. Although not mentioned in his narrative, he stated that the police made notes and informed him that he could make a report at the hospital. When asked if he reported the attack at the hospital, he indicated that he did not, that he wanted to but that it was late in the evening and that no one approached him while he sat in the waiting room. The panel notes that the claimant provided no information to either the police or the staff at the hospital. The panel finds the claimant's description of the event somewhat improbable, and also finds, that if one cannot provide relevant and pertinent details of what occurred, it is unreasonable to expect the police to launch an investigation.\n[43] In the Racz decision,34 the Federal Court dealt with a situation as that recounted by the claimant. In that claim, the applicants:\n...were at home when stones were thrown through their windows. Denes Csaba Racz, the father in the applicant family, ran out of the house to see what had happened but he was immediately kicked in his stomach and assaulted. By the time Timea Raczne Marodi, the mother in the applicant family, went outside, her husband was on the ground and his attackers were fleeing in a car. They were shouting that \"this is not over\" and that the applicants would die. Mr. Racz called the police. When they arrived, he showed them the broken windows and where he was kicked and punched. The police asked if he saw the perpetrators, and Mr. Racz replied that he did not because he was kicked very suddenly. Ms. Marodi did not get the license plate. The police said that there was not much they could do, but that they would patrol the area more often. They left without taking a report. They patrolled one more time that night but no additional patrols were made. The applicants also asked the Mayor of their village to help them but he said the police would take care of things.35\n[44] In dismissing the appeal, the Federal Court also referenced a similar analogy to that employed by the panel in this decision. The Court stated:\nI agree with the submission of the respondent that the Board's examination must focus on whether these persons, on clear and convincing evidence, have established that there is not adequate state protection at the operational level. I am unable to find, based on their submissions in this application, that the Board's decision that they did not establish the inadequacy of state protection is unreasonable. In fact, although not perfect, the response of the police to the applicants' complaints, given the specific circumstances of the assaults taken to the police, appears to have been adequate and in keeping with what Canadian police forces would be likely to do.36\n[45] XXXX also described the attack on the Roma area in Miskolc that took place in 2011. The attack was initiated by some fifteen to twenty Guardists, who threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at the Roma residences. He testified that he noticed police cars arrive after the attack and people being interviewed, but that he did not know what information was provided to the police as he was not involved or contacted by the police. While it became clear that the police failed in the 2011 incident to adequately protect the Roma residents, the claimants' overall experience with police is insufficient evidence to conclude that there is a lack of state protection. Moreover, the panel finds that, in considering this case, as well as the Court findings above, the failure by some police to provide protection is not indicative of a lack of police protection in the country as a whole.37\n[46] In contrast, the documentary evidence38 shows that Hungary has a functioning police force to uphold the laws of the country and provide protection against criminality, including physical violence, and if required, for seeking redress, if citizens, including Roma, are denied state protection or if their complaints are not taken seriously. The government has put in place other agencies, including the Independent Police Complaints Board (IPCB),39 which is specifically mandated to address complaints against the police. The panel determines that adequate state protection is available to these claimants in Hungary in their particular situation and circumstances.\n[47] The panel acknowledges that the behavior of some Hungarian police officers is no doubt, at minimum, unhelpful and, at times, clearly discriminatory. This reality, however, does not mean that every police officer in northeastern Hungary is unhelpful to every Roma, or that every police officer in Hungary treats Roma poorly, or that the existence of this type of officer is prima facie evidence of a lack of state protection. In its analysis of the facts of this case, the panel finds that the claimants have failed to show that their experiences with the police constitute a lack of state protection.\n[48] The panel notes, that despite isolated incidents like the 2011 attack, the police have been held accountable when their behaviour in their interactions with Roma have been found to be problematic and discriminatory. In its final ruling, the Hungarian Supreme Court (Curia) said that Hungarian police officers discriminated Roma in Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6spata,40 by failing to take appropriate action against extremist organizations. The judgment represents a particularly important and decisive development in terms of the protection of rights and case law in Hungary: this was the first time that the Curia stated in a public interest lawsuit that the police committed negative discrimination against Roma citizens.\n[49] In explaining its judgment, the Curia emphasized that the extremists patrolling Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6spata constituted a serious crime of racism, only outdone by the serial killings of Roma in Hungary. The police should have intervened, the court said. In addition to affirming the violation of rights, the Curia also banned the police from committing similar acts in the future, and the court called on the police to publicly apologize.\n[50] The Curia ruled, that by failing to protect the Roma population in the village of Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6spata from abuse in the spring of 2011, the police themselves had been guilty of harassment against the community, by which they had violated the Roma's right to equal treatment. The court barred the police department from further such breaches of rights. The lawsuit in the case was initiated by a human rights group Civil Liberties Union (TASZ), which argued that the police had discriminated against the Roma based on their ethnic background while extremist groups patrolled the village\nState Protection and the role of the police and other agencies\n[51] The documentary evidence noted below indicates that police arrest and prosecute the perpetrators of crimes, including crimes committed against Roma and other ethnic minorities and their property. If the claimants were to be dissatisfied with the response of the authorities to their complaints, documentary evidence noted below indicates that recourse would be available to them. For example, the Independent Police Complaints Board (IPCB) investigates violations and omissions by the police. If the claimants were to return to Hungary and encounter problems in education, employment, healthcare, housing or access to business establishments, the documentary evidence indicates that recourse would be available to them. Furthermore, the documentary evidence indicates that there are a number of organizations and agencies that assist Hungarians, of Romani ethnicity, in obtaining the appropriate services and protections from the government and the authorities. The panel emphasizes that it has considered the effect of these programs and initiatives at the operational level and on the ground..\n[52] The panel acknowledges that the issue of \"corruption\" remains problematic, however, the documentary evidence demonstrates that steps are being taken to prosecute officials and individuals when such abuse occurs.41 Furthermore, the Hungarian authorities have taken action against the Hungarian Guard Association, and have initiated processes for banning the Civil Guard Association, on the grounds that their anti-Roma activities threaten public order.42\n[53] The country documentary evidence further states the following: 43\nComplaints Mechanism\nSources indicate that complaints can be brought to the relevant police unit or the Independent Police Complaints Board (IPCB) (Council of Europe 30 Apr. 2014, para. 28; US 25 June 2015, 9; HHC 29 June 2015).\nIn correspondence with the Research Directorate, a representative from the Hungarian Helsinki Committee (HHC), a civil society organization that monitors the human rights and legal situation in Hungary (HHC n.d.), stated that complaints can be submitted to the responsible police unit within 30 days of the alleged violation and that complaints can also be submitted \"with the help of a legal representative\" (HHC 29 June 2015). The representative added that the complaint is decided on by the head of the relevant police unit during an \"administrative procedure\" (ibid.). The complainant may appeal the \"first instance decision,\" which is decided upon by the superior of the same police unit (ibid.). If the \"first instance\" decision was rendered by the \"National Police Chief, the head of the department responsible for internal affairs, or the head of the counter-terrorism unit, no appeal may be submitted\" (ibid.). In the cases of a \"first instance\" decision by aforementioned department heads, or a \"second instance\" decision, complainants may appeal to the courts (ibid.).\nThe same source further states that as a result of the police complaint being submitted to the police unit allegedly responsible for the incident, they \"cannot be regarded as an independent forum for deciding upon the given complaint\" and that this may have a negative impact on the effectiveness of \"ordinary complaint procedures\" (HHC 29 June 2015).\n[...]\nIndependent Police Complaints Board (IPCB)\nAccording to sources, the IPCB is available to investigate police activity that violate fundamental rights (UN 3 July 2014, para. 26; US 27 Feb. 2014, 8; Hungary n.d.c).\nAccording to the website of the IPCB, complaints must be filed, in person or in writing, within 20 days of the incident or 20 days of the time that the individual became aware of the infringement (ibid.). If there are extenuating circumstances that can be proven, such as a lengthy hospital stay, the time limit is extended (ibid.). The same source further states that if the 20-day deadline has passed, but not 30 days, an individual can file a complaint with \"the head of the police office (Police Chief) of which subordinate has taken the challenged measures against the complainant\" (ibid.).\nThe case will be forwarded by the IPCB to the relevant police organ if the board concludes that:\n* there was no violation of a fundamental right\n* the infringement of a fundamental right cannot be decided because of\n* the contradiction between the statement of the complainant and Police;\n* there was an insignificant infringement of fundamental rights. (ibid.)\nSources further state that, should the board find that a violation of fundamental rights has occurred, they submit a non-binding recommendation to the head of the National Police (ibid.; EU 2013, 38; US 27 Feb. 2014, 8).\n[...]\nThe Equal Treatment Authority\nAccording to the European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance, the Equal Treatment Authority is an independent body established by the Hungarian government \"to receive and deal with individual and public complaints about unequal treatment\" and it reviews the complaints it receives to establish whether the law on equal treatment has been violated, including on the basis of ethnic origin\" (EU n.d.). The UN Working Group report similarly states that the Equal Treatment Authority is an independent body that was established \"to protect, enforce and promote equality and the right to equal treatment by monitoring the observance\" of the Equal Treatment Act (UN 3 July 2014, para. 27).\n[...]\nThe Commissioner for Fundamental Rights\n...According to the same source, in 2012 a \"unified Ombudsman institution\" was created in order to replace the old structure, which had four Ombudsmen (Hungary 11 July 2012). The \"Closing and Miscellaneous Provisions\" of the Fundamental Law of Hungary provide the following:\n16. As of the entry into force of the Fundamental Law, the designation for the office of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Citizens' Rights shall be Commissioner for Fundamental Rights. The legal successor of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Citizens' Rights, the Parliamentary Commissioner for National and Ethnic Minority Rights and the Parliamentary Commissioner for Future Generations shall be the Commissioner for Fundamental Rights. As of the entry into force of the Fundamental Law, the Parliamentary Commissioner for National and Ethnic Minority Rights in office shall become Deputy of the Commissioner for Fundamental Rights responsible for the protection of the rights of nationalities living in Hungary; as of the entry into force of the Fundamental Law, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Future Generations in office shall become Deputy of the Commissioner for Fundamental Rights responsible for the protection of the interests of future genera generations; their mandates shall terminate upon the termination of the mandate of the Commissioner for Fundamental Rights. (Hungary 2011)\nThe Commissioner's website states that anyone can submit a complaint, orally or in writing, to the Commissioner\nif the activity or omission of the public and\/or other organs performing public duties ... infringes a fundamental right of the person submitting the petition or presents an imminent danger. When the person reporting has exhausted the available administrative legal remedies, not including the judicial review of an administrative decision, or if no legal remedy is available to him or her. (Hungary n.d.d.)\n[...]\nPolice Response to Hate Crimes\nAccording to the BBC, in Hungary \"[m]any people are not familiar with the concept of hate crime - the idea that the targeting of people because of the colour of their skin, their religious belief, or their sexual orientation is different to ordinary crime\" (BBC 28 Apr. 2013).\nAccording to sources, the police in Hungary lack both the resources and awareness of the proper procedures for investigating and responding to hate crimes (AI 6 Aug. 2013; Council of Europe 16 Dec. 2014, para. 85).\n...According to the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe's report, police in Hungary have been given powers, in the form of new legal provisions, to counter the activities of paramilitary groups \"engaging in racist violence and conducting certain activities such as patrolling areas inhabited by Roma\" (Council of Europe 16 Dec. 2014, para. 81). The same source reports that a professional network has been set up among those within the national police that are responsible for \"dealing with hate crimes\" (ibid. para. 84). ...The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) similarly reports that in 2013, 48 hate crimes were recorded by the police, 30 were prosecuted and 14 were sentenced (OSCE n.d.).\n[54] Regarding the government's actions to specifically address issues faced by the Roma population, the documentary evidence demonstrates, that at its meeting held on January 29, 2013, the Government decided on the establishment of the Roma Affairs Council (CET). Which elevates the cause of inclusion to the highest level. The main task of the body is to identify proposals concerning the strategic directions of inclusion and Roma policy, and to keep track of their implementation. The establishment of CET allows the evaluation of the implementation of the measures taken as part of a direct dialogue at the highest level of the government structure, and in response to direct feedback with the involvement of the ministers and stakeholders concerned, while it also creates a forum for identifying further measures necessary for promoting the inclusion of Roma. The Council makes recommendations, with respect to the Government's social inclusion and Roma policy, monitors the attainment of the targets in the framework agreement between the Government and the National Roma Self-Government, and reviews the reports prepared by ministers involved in the implementation of the framework agreement and the National Roma Self-Government. The Council is chaired by the Prime Minister and co-chaired by the President of the National Roma Self-Government. Other members include the Minister of Human Resources, the Minister for Internal Affairs, the Minister for National Economy, and the Minister of State leading the Prime Minister's Office. The Council meets at least once quarterly.\n[55] The Anti-Segregation Roundtable was established in June of 2013. Both governmental and civil parties are involved. It aims to review the current issues of educational integration and segregation, to discuss the competencies of churches, civil sector as well as of state and local actors, to review current professional standards and, where relevant, to propose new ones.\n[56] Hungary has put in place independent authorities specifically entrusted with the fight against racism. For example:\n[57] The Equal Treatment Authority (the Authority) was established by the Act on Equal Treatment and Promotion of Equal Opportunities (the Act), and has been functioning since February 2005. Following legislative amendments in 2011 and 2013, the Authority is now an autonomous administrative body; it is independent and cannot be instructed in the performance of its duties; and its budget constitutes a separate title within the budget chapter of Parliament. The Authority is headed by its president, who is appointed by the President of Hungary for a term of nine years. The vice-president is appointed by the Authority's president for an indefinite period. Civil servants and other employees of the Authority are also appointed by its president.\n[58] The Authority is a quasi-judicial body, whose main task is to make legally binding decisions in cases of alleged violations of the Act, either at the request of an injured party or ex officio. If it establishes a violation, a number of remedies are available, including the imposition of fines ranging from 50 000 to six million HUF (around 160 to 19 000 Euros). The proceedings are entirely free of charge.\n[59] The panel finds that the government has enacted legislation, and put in place many strategic initiatives across several departments that are producing results on the ground. The panel finds that the documentary evidence, as noted, demonstrates that Hungary continues to provide protection for all its citizens, including Roma and other ethnic minorities. Although not perfect, the panel finds that the evidence demonstrates that Hungary's progressively evolving measures\/actions to provide protection for its citizens, including Roma, are actually having an impact operationally on the ground. The evidence also demonstrates that police do investigate crimes against Roma, and that perpetrators are being held responsible when there is sufficient evidence. In the final analysis, the question to be answered, is if there is adequate state protection at the operational level for these particular claimants.\n[60] In Mudrak,44 the Federal Court states that:\nMore substantively, suggesting that police oversight agencies have no role in demonstrating adequate state protection is like saying senior policing management has no role in policing due to their oversight function, or saying that policing is a short-term operational exercise. Similarly, denying oversight agencies an important role in police protection would suggest that the police complaints process, and thereafter the courts in Canada, have no responsibility in ensuring adequate policing. This is surely an unsustainable proposition. It is no counter-argument that Canadian police are more responsive to complaints about their conduct, which in some recent instances at least, might be challenged. The point is that the evidence in the Hungarian Roma persecution claims indicates that the oversight agencies are diligent in their investigations and in reporting their findings to the police. The transparency and accompanying public criticism of the state protection apparatus is an important ingredient to reforms and improvement in protection services accorded to Roma citizens.\nThe requirement to access police oversight agencies is particularly important where the persecution is in the form of random incidents, such as is normally the case for members of the Roma community. Adequate state protection against random crime must operate at a community level over a longer time frame, because responding to any particular victim cannot assure that future random attacks from other assailants will not occur. To the extent that random criminal conduct can be prevented by means other than increased patrols, effective policing can have a deterrent effect by arresting and successfully prosecuting wrongdoers accompanied by the declaratory publicity attached to successful convictions.\nThus, looking ahead, no crime prevention process can be effective if victims of crime do not report incidents to the police and proactively cooperate in their investigations, including complaining if not satisfied with the efforts of the police. If the rhetorical question is whether all members of the Roma community will be better protected from a rule requiring they follow up instances of inadequate policing with oversight agencies, I would argue, yes it would.\n[61] The panel concludes that, as stated above, the burden is on the claimants to provide clear and convincing evidence that the state is either unwilling or unable to provide them with adequate protection. It is not for the panel to provide that proof, rather, it is the claimant who bears the legal burden of rebutting the presumption that state protection exists by adducing clear and convincing evidence which satisfies the panel, on a balance of probabilities.45 The panel concludes, after careful consideration of all of the evidence, that the claimants have not rebutted the presumption of state protection.\nThe Level of Democracy in Hungary\n[62] The claimants' counsel has submitted, that since state protection is linked to the level of democracy, the decline in the level of democracy in Hungary suggests that state protection may not be adequate. The panel notes that Freedom House, in its 2018 report, has assigned Hungary an overall democracy score of 3.71 - a decline in the level of democracy from 3.54 in 2017. (According to its rating system, 1 represents the highest level of democratic progress and 7 the lowest.) The organization acknowledges that the rating is a subjective evaluation based on its observations and analysis of events in the country. While there appears to be a decline in democracy, based on one assessment, the panel notes that Hungary is still a democratic functioning country, and a member of the European Union with all its concomitant safeguards and influences.\n[63] The US Department of State Report for 2017,46 has summarized the situation in Hungary in the following statements:\nHungary is a multiparty parliamentary democracy. The unicameral National Assembly (parliament) exercises legislative authority. It elects the president (the head of state) every five years. The president appoints a prime minister from the majority party or coalition in parliament following national elections every four years. In the 2014 parliamentary elections, the Fidesz-KDNP (Christian Democratic People's Party) alliance retained a majority in parliament. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) election observation mission's report concluded the elections were efficiently administered and offered voters a diverse choice following an inclusive candidate registration process. The OSCE also noted the main governing party enjoyed an undue advantage because of restrictive campaign regulations, biased media coverage, and campaign activities that blurred the separation between political party and the state. Viktor Orban, the Fidesz party leader, has been prime minister since 2010.\nCivilian authorities maintained effective control over security forces.\nThe most serious human rights issues included allegations that government action helped consolidate media outlets in the hands of progovernment owners , criminal penalties for libel (though court decisions limited their impact), restrictions on funding for nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) ,allegations of corrupt use of state power to grant privileges to certain economic actors, evidence of growing anti-Semitism, allegations of mistreatment of migrants, and a law requiring NGOs receiving foreign funding to brand themselves as such.\nThe government took steps to prosecute and punish security forces and other officials who committed abuses. Impunity for human rights abuses was not widespread.\n[64] While it is clear that Hungary continues to experience problems, it also apparent that it remains a functioning democracy.\nSur Place Element of the Claim\n[65] The claimants have indicated, that the incident involving the death of their son in Canada has established the element of sur place to their claim, and heightened the risk they will face on a return to Hungary. In the appeal of their decision, the Federal Court found that the RPD had not dealt with the sur place element of the claim.\n[66] In XXXX XXXX, the PC's son XXXX XXXX., was killed in a traffic accident as the family was returning from a trip to XXXX XXXX. The incident was reported in the XXXX XXXX,47 and picked up by several websites in Hungary, most notably XXXX XXXX XXXX, a far-right website that has been described as racist, and includes headings on its main page such as \"Immigrant Crime,\" \"Gypsy Crime,\" and \"Jewish Crime\". The website has a forum where individuals can post comments online. An interpreter translated certain segments of the website together with selected comments from the forum, posted in XXXX XXXX.48\n[67] The panel finds the comments translated by the interpreter to be clearly racist and reprehensible. The panel notes, nonetheless, that the translation is a \"summary\" of the website's content, and that the comments from the website forum were selected by the interpreter as \"typical opinions.\" The interpreter explained that she did not translate the entire content as the cost would have been several thousand dollars. The panel must therefore consider that the content chosen and translated by the interpreter, who is working on behalf of the claimants, is selective and therefore somewhat subjective. In fact, one of the selected comments is actually critical of the racist comments on the website. Nonetheless, the panel finds that there are sufficient examples of the comments that were translated to indicate that the site attracts a racist audience who are not shy about sharing their views on Roma people, even when it involves tragic consequences as in their son's death.\n[68] The question for the panel, is whether a story that elicited the racist response nearly XXXX years ago would continue to maintain the residual effect that is alleged by the claimants. The PC was asked why she was still seeking Canada's protection some eight years after they filed their claim. She referenced the story in the XXXX XXXX and stated \"they would kill us\". She testified that if they return to Hungary, they will have to register with the government, and that the racists will learn who they are and that they are back in the country. She was, however, unable to explain how their return would be discovered by racists and how the claimants would be connected to a story that appeared briefly online in XXXX. The panel notes that there are no recent online posts regarding the incident in XXXX or the claimants, and finds that there is insufficient persuasive evidence to conclude that the claimants are sur place refugees.\nCONCLUSION\n[69] After careful consideration of all the evidence, including the claimants' testimonies and their counsel's submissions, the panel finds that firstly, the claimants have experienced discrimination and harassment but that it does not rise to the level of persecution. Secondly, the panel finds that there is adequate state protection at the operational level.\n[70] For the foregoing reasons, the panel finds that the claimants are not Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. Accordingly, their claim is rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Anthony da Silva\"\nAnthony da Silva\nApril 15, 2019\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n2 James C.

He fears that he will be persecuted by friends and authorities if he returns to Namibia.\n[3] The CC alleges that after her mother died in 2000, she had to stay with her aunt who forced her to work as a prostitute to \"pay her way\" while living with the aunt. In 2003, the PC moved out of her aunt's home and went to live with her boyfriend, the PC. In 2006, she gave birth to her daughter, the minor claimant, but her aunt kept threatening that she would take her back by force. She fears that her aunt would force her and her daughter, who is now thirteen years of age, into prostitution.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] The panel finds that the claimants are neither Convention refugees in accordance with section 96 of the IRPA, nor are they persons in need of protection in accordance with sections 97(1)(a) and (b) of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] The claimants provided their genuine Namibian passports2 in support of their identity. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants are citizens of Namibia\nIssues\n[6] The panel finds that the key issues in this claim were credibility, persecution versus discrimination\/harassment, and internal flight alternative (IFA).\nCredibility\nThe PC\n[7] The PC alleges that he is bi-sexual and was involved in same-sex relationships, both in Namibia and in Canada. In support of his allegations, the PC's brother and sister-in-law appeared as witnesses at the hearing. Both witnesses gave sworn testimony that they were aware that the PC was involved in same-sex relationships.\n[8] In addition to the witnesses, the PC provided a Statutory Declaration and a letter3 from a former same-sex partner in Canada, XXXX XXXX. The PC also submitted a psychological counselling report,4 which indicates that he has experienced symptoms consistent with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (XXXX), and which the psychotherapist believes may, in part, be related to his bisexual orientation.\n[9] Initially, the CC was present during the PC's testimony as their claims have been joined. Early in the PC's testimony, the CC was visibly upset when the PC talked about his same-sex activities. After discussing the situation with both the CC and her counsel, it was agreed, given that the basis of their claims are substantially different, that the CC would wait outside the hearing room until the PC finished testifying.\n[10] The panel has considered the PC's evidence as well as his testimony at the hearing, and is persuaded that he is bisexual.\nThe CC\n[11] The CC alleges that she was forced into prostitution by her aunt, who insisted that the CC pay her way while living with her. In support of her allegations, the CC has provided a Statutory Declaration and a letter5 from her sister, as well as a psychological counselling report,6 which indicates that she has experienced symptoms consistent with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX which the psychotherapist believes may, in part, be related to her experience of forced prostitution.\n[12] The panel has considered the CC's evidence as well as her testimony at the hearing, and is persuaded that she was forced into prostitution by her aunt during the period 2000-2003.\nPersecution versus discrimination\/harassment\nThe PC's situation\n[13] The panel has reviewed country documentation and finds that, while there has been extensive discussion as to whether the rights of LGBT individuals are legally protected in Namibia, there is consensus that they are protected under the Namibian constitution, as well as international agreements to which Namibia is a signatory. As stated in the document, Namibian Law on LGBT Issues:\nExisting international law agreements and principles, applicable to Namibia both directly and via Article 144 of the Namibian Constitution, clearly prohibit discrimination against LGBT individuals and groups in the enjoyment of their human rights.7\n[14] The panel also notes, however, that country documentation indicates that:\nHomosexuality itself is not illegal in Namibia, but sodomy and certain other sexual acts between consenting adult males are criminal offences. Even though these crimes are seldom applied in practice, their existence has a negative impact on the LGBT community.8\n[15] While on one hand, the Namibian constitution, in principle, protects LGBT rights, the existence of laws which appear to target LGBT individuals encourages discrimination against those individuals. The PC has also provided documentation9 illustrating how the more conservative elements in Namibian society view LGBT individuals and activities as improper, and describing acts of violence against bi-sexuals in Namibia.\n[16] The panel further notes that country documentation indicates that, especially in the northern part of Namibia where the claimants hail from and resided, lesbians and gay men have been afraid to reveal their sexual orientation to their families and communities because of responses of \"hatred, extreme acts of violence or threats of violence and ostracism from their family and community members\".10 The claimant has stated in his Personal Information Form (PIF) narrative, that he had been spit upon and beaten up because of his sexual orientation. At the hearing, however, he testified that his main fear was having his sexual orientation discovered by his father. He stated that if his father found he was bi-sexual, he would \"probably hit [him].\" The panel also notes that, at the hearing, his brother testified that their parents did not believe what people were saying about the PC's sexual orientation and that \"if they really believed [what was being said] they would probably have a confrontation with XXXX [the PC].\"\n[17] The panel finds that the conclusion in the 2015 document, Namibian Law on LGBT Issues, provides a good overview of the situation regarding LGBT individuals in Namibia:\nThere is no consensus about LGBT issues in Namibian society. Vocal disapproval from prominent politicians and Parliamentarians and some community members sits alongside attitudes ranging from tolerance to acceptance in some communities.\nThe Namibian media gives coverage to a spectrum of LGBT issues, often sympathetically. NGOs formed and staffed by Namibians have advocated for LGBT rights since even before Independence - including Sister Namibia (established in 1989), The Rainbow Project (established in 1997 and now defunct), the Women's Leadership Centre (established in 2004) and OutRight Namibia (established in 2010) - and none have been obstructed in their work by government officials, although the relationship between these groups and government has not always been completely cordial. So there is official disapproval and sometimes shocking rhetoric by political figures, but no official repression of the LGBT community as a group.11\n[18] The most recent country documentation indicates that,\n[t]he constitution does not prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, that there are reports LGBTI persons faced harassment when trying to access public services, and that some politicians opposed any legislation that would specifically protect the rights of LGBTI persons.12\n[19] At the same time, recent country documentation also indicates:\nThe minister of health and the ombudsman both favored abolition of the common law offense of sodomy. LGBTI groups conducted annual pride parades recognized by the government as constitutionally protected peaceful assembly; the parades have not met with violence.13\n[20] The panel has considered the objective evidence regarding the situation of LGBT individuals in Namibia and of the PC's personal situation there, based on the PC's testimony and that of his brother and sister-in-law. It finds that while the PC may face discrimination and harassment in Namibia, it does not rise to the level of persecution.\nThe CC's situation\n[21] The CC has indicated that she was forced into prostitution by her aunt during the period 2000-2003. In 2003, she has stated that she moved in with her boyfriend, the PC, with whom she has been in a common-law relationship. In 2011, she came to Canada with the PC and their daughter, the minor claimant. She and the PC continue to live together and now are the parents of three children. While the CC was visibly upset when the PC started to testify about his bi-sexual activities, and is clearly not happy about them, she has been aware of them since they have been living together and has apparently accepted his bisexuality.\n[22] She has testified that she fears, if returned to Namibia, her aunt will force both her and her daughter, the minor claimant, into prostitution. The panel notes, however, that in her PIF narrative, she has indicated that when her aunt followed her to the PC's village (XXXX) and tried to force her to return with the aunt, she was unsuccessful. Later, the aunt apparently kept calling her and threatening to take her by force, but again the CC did not return. The CC left the aunt's house in 2003 and was in Namibia, living with the PC until 2011 when they left for Canada. During that period, the aunt would have had many opportunities to force the CC back into prostitution, but did not. The CC is now 35 years of age, has been out of the country for some eight years, and has not had any contact with her aunt since 2015. Despite the CC's assertion that her aunt is waiting for her, there is insufficient persuasive evidence that the aunt would be any more successful than she was during the eight year period in Namibia after the CC left her home. The panel finds that the CC's fear of being forced into prostitution by her aunt to be not well-founded.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[23] Notwithstanding its finding that the claimants do not have an objective basis for persecution, the panel suggested Walvis Bay and Windhoek as a viable IFAs for the claimants upon a return to Namibia.\n[24] The PC was asked if he would be able to avoid the problems he faced if he lived in either Walvis Bay or Windhoek. The PC replied that because Namibia is a small country, his father would be able to locate him because he has money. The panel notes, that there was no evidence that the PC's father has the interest or resources to try and locate his son, who left the country eight years ago. Even if the PC's father became aware of the PC's presence in either of the two cities, there is insufficient evidence to indicate that he would try to kill the PC as he indicated at one point in his testimony. While he was living in the village of XXXX, it appears that the father may have been aware that the community knew about the PC's sexual orientation. Even if the father was aware of the PC's sexual orientation, as was likely in the small community, the panel notes that he did not attempt to harm the PC. As larger and more cosmopolitan centres, the panel finds that the PC would likely not face the same difficulties in Walvis Bay or Windhoek he faced years ago in a small parochial centre such as XXXX, where he would have stood out more prominently and where, because of its location in the north, it appears there is greater animosity towards sexual minorities.\n[25] The panel finds, therefore, that either Walvis Bay or Windhoek would be reasonable IFAs for the PC upon a return to Namibia.\n[26] The CC testified that she cannot return to Namibia because she does not know with whom she would stay. She indicated that her father has died and can no longer protect her, and that her sister is living in \"the village\" with her boyfriend. Her counsel has submitted that the CC would have to be living in hiding if she went to Windhoek, and because Namibia is a tribal country, it is unreasonable to have the CC move with her three children to an area with which she is unfamiliar.\n[27] The panel notes that the CC's aunt lives in Windhoek, and although the aunt was aware of the CC's location during the eight-year period following the CC's departure from her house, and was unable to force her back into prostitution, the panel finds that a relocation to Walvis Bay would avoid any potential conflict with the aunt. The panel also notes that, while the CC is unhappy with the PC's same-sexual activities, she has been with him for some sixteen years in a common-law relationship and they are the parents of three children. No reason or evidence was put forth to indicate that were they to be returned to Namibia, they would not stay together. If the claimants continue to be concerned about a confrontation with the CC's aunt, then Walvis Bay would be a better IFA for them. Regardless of whether they chose to relocate in Windhoek or Walvis Bay, the panel finds that employment opportunities, housing options, and medical resources would naturally be more available in a larger and most populous centres than in XXXX, where they previously experienced difficulties.\nCONCLUSION\n[28] After careful consideration of all of the evidence, including the claimants' testimony, as well as their counsel's submissions, the panel determines that the claimants have not satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on Convention grounds, or that, on a balance of probabilities, they would be subject personally to a danger of torture, or face a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, if they were returned to Namibia.\n[29] The claim is, therefore, rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Anthony da Silva\"\nAnthony da Silva\nMay 9, 2019\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n2 Exhibit 1, Package of information from the referring CBSA\/CIC, passports.\n3 Exhibit 24, at p. 1 & 10.\n4 Ibid, at p. 6-7.\n5 Ibid, at p. 2 & 11-12,\n6 Ibid, at p. 8-9.\n7 Exhibit 5, National Documentation Package (NDP) for Namibia (March 29, 2019), item 6.2, s. 3.4.\n8 Ibid, s. 4.1.\n9 Exhibit 19.\n10 Ibid, at p. 89.\n11 Exhibit 5, NDP for Namibia (March 29, 2019), item 6.2, chapter 12.\n12 Ibid, item 2.1, s. 6.\n13 Ibid.\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRPD.29.1 (August 31, 2012)\nRPD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SPR : TB1-13815\nTB1-13836\nTB1-13876\n",

The Applicant asks the Legacy Task Force (LTF), of the Refugee Protection Division (the Division) to reinstate the claim which was withdrawn by written notice to the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB), on June 17, 2017.\nBACKGROUND\n[2] The Applicant's claim was filed as part of a claim by a family of five, consisting of his parents, his two brothers, and his sister. On October 31, 2012, the Division appointed XXXX XXXX, the mother, the designated representative for XXXX XXXX and the Applicant, XXXX XXXX.\n[3] On October 14, 2015, the Division granted the father's application to disjoin his claims from that of the other four claimants. However, before their claims for protection could be heard, the Division received Notices of Withdrawal of their claims for the other four claimants, including the Applicant, who was then 17 years old. The Division withdrew the claims as directed on the Notices of Withdrawal, and confirmed the withdrawal on June 21, 2017.\n[4] On March 1, 2019, the Division received the present Application to reinstate the Applicant's claim.\n[5] The basis of the Application is,\n1. That the Applicant was a minor when his mother, acting as hid designated representative withdrew his claim;\n2. The Applicant had no input into the decision to withdraw the claim, nor was he given any choice in the matter.\n3. That given these circumstances Rule 60 (3) of the Division's Rules apply. That is, it is in the interests of justice to allow the Application.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] The Application is denied.\nReason for the Decision\n[7] Rule 60 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules allows for the reinstating of a claim that was withdrawn under certain conditions. Rule 60(1) provides, \"A person may make an application to the Division to reinstate a claim that was made by the person and was withdrawn.\"\n[8] Rule 60(3) states, The Division must not allow the application unless it is established that there was a failure to observe a principle of natural justice, or it is otherwise in the interests of justice to allow the Application. Counsel for the Applicant does not argue that there was a failure to observe a principle of natural justice when it accepted the Notice of Withdrawal that was filed on the behalf of the Applicant. Counsel concedes that his mother, in her role of designated representative, was able to make the decision to withdraw the Applicant's claim. Rather, Counsel for the Applicant contends, that given his minority and lack of input into the decision, it was in the interest of justice to allow the Application.\n[9] On the behalf of the Minister, his representative opposes the Application. He put forward the following arguments, namely:\n1. The Applicant has not established that it is in the interests of justice to allow the application.\n2. The Application in a timely manner and the Applicant had not provided adequate justification for the delay.\n3. There had been no breach of Natural Justice.\n[10] In response, Counsel for the Applicant urged the Division to disregard the Minister's response because it failed to comply with Rule 51, which sets out how a reply was to be made. Counsel notes that the Minister's Response was provided well outside the five day time limit set out for responses. As well, the Minister's evidence was not set out in an Affidavit or sworn statement as required by Rule 51(2). Furthermore, the response contained errors regarding the date on which the Minister received the Application.\n[11] In the alternative, Counsel for the Applicant argues that contrary to the Minister's assertion, the Applicant was not challenging the legality of the actions of the Division in accepting the withdrawal. The Applicant's position was that it was not in the interests of justice, as well as not in keeping with the principles of fundamental justice under s. 7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, to bind the Applicant to the actions of his mother (designated representative) when he was a minor.\n[12] Additionally, Counsel for the Applicant submits, that the Minister's representative had erred when he said that the Applicant had returned to Canada for a year before he made the Application to reinstate his withdrawn claim. Further, the Minister erred by arguing that the Applicant's actions did not demonstrate that he had a subjective fear of return to Croatia and also erred when he alleged that the Applicant had returned to Canada using false documents. Counsel for the Applicant also took issue with the Minister's comments respecting the residency status of the Applicant's relatives in Germany.\n[13] While I agree that the Minister's response was not in conformity with Rule 51(2), or Rule 51(4), as it did not conform with either the requirement as to time and form, I decline to exclude the response from consideration for the following reasons. First, Rule 70(b) permits the Division to change the requirement of a rule. However, there is a prerequisite that the Division should give notice to the parties and provide them with the opportunity to object to its proposed action. As the Applicant is due to be removed from Canada on Friday, March 15, 2019, and the complete brief, Application, Minister's response and Counsel's reply, were put before me only a few days ago, there is not sufficient time to observe Rule 70. Moreover, Rule 71 allows the Division flexibility with respect to proceedings, providing that the proceeding remain valid unless the Division declares them invalid.\n[14] As well, the Applicant's materials are not themselves without issue. Specifically, the Affidavit of Geneveieve Giesbrecht, to which copies of the Personal Information Forms filed by the Applicant's parents; the Confirmation of Withdrawal, and the letter from the Applicant's former counsel are exhibited, reveals no discernible link to the documents exhibited. The Affidavit states that Ms. Giesbrecht,\n...is a student at Osgoode Hall Law School and am interning at the Refugee law Office. I am assisting Andrew Brouwer, senior counsel, in the immigration matters of the applicant XXXX XXXX, and as such have knowledge of the matters set out below.\n[15] The matters set out below are simply the exhibits described as being attached to the Affidavit. There is no explanation as to why the documents are being exhibited or how Ms. Giesbrecht came to have knowledge of the documents. Nonetheless, given the urgency of the matter as stressed by Counsel for the Applicant, I am prepared to accept and consider these documents too.\n[16] I find that the Affidavit of the Applicant also delves into matters that are properly dealt with at a hearing. He goes into great detail about the discrimination and harassment that the family and he allegedly endured while they were in Croatia, both before and after their return from Canada. On the principle of he who seeks equity must do equity, I am deciding this application on the basis of all of the documents before me.\n[17] Rule 60 (1) allows for the reinstating of a claim that was withdrawn under certain conditions. \"A person may make an application to the Division to reinstate a claim that was made by the person and was withdrawn.\" Rule 60(3) provides that the Division must not allow the application unless it is established that there was a failure to observe a principle of natural justice, or it is otherwise in the interests of justice to allow the application.\n[18] Rule 60(4) sets out factors that the Division must consider when deciding the application. Thus, per Rule 60(4), in deciding the application the Division must consider any relevant factors, including whether the application was made in a timely manner and the justification for any delay.\nThe Timeliness of the Application\n[19] The Applicant, together with the other claimants, returned to Croatia a XXXX after the claims were withdrawn, that is by the end of XXXX 2017. He returned to Toronto in XXXX 2018, by which time he had attained eighteen years of age and was legally an adult. The Applicant sought legal advice on how to proceed, and went to Germany as his family were visiting that country at the time. He returned to Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2019.\n[20] The Division received the Application on March 1, 2019. This is some six and a half months after the Applicant first returned to Canada. In his affidavit, the Applicant sets out his actions and attempts to regularize his status in Canada. At paragraph 32 of the Affidavit, he states that he took legal counsel about making a new refugee claim or reinstating his withdrawn claim. It is clear from his affidavit that the Applicant decided to pursue a \"working holiday visa\" as opposed to making an application to the Division to reinstate his claim. According to him, it was in the course of obtaining this visa that he ran afoul of Canadian Immigration authorities who arrested him as he tried to re-enter the country on XXXX XXXX, 2019. And it was during the process of his detention review that he received advice that he should apply to the Division to reinstate his claim.\n[21] Looking at these events objectively, I find that it can be said that, but for the fact that he was arrested, the Applicant likely would not have filed this application. By his own admission, he was advised of the possibility of making an application to reinstate his claim well before his arrest. However, he did not do so. I am not satisfied that he has put forward a reasonable explanation for his failure to make an application to reinstate his claim before March 1, 2019. I find that in the circumstances where the Applicant had legal advice that he could make an application to reinstate and did not, doing so six and a half months after he entered Canada, as an adult, he has not made his application in a timely manner. I also find that he has not provided a satisfactory justification for the delay.\n[22] In his response, the Minister's representative raises issues of credibility, including whether the Applicant had been truthful with CBSA as to how he gained entry into Canada in XXXX 2018, where his mother and siblings live and their status in Germany, as well as his own status in that country. While counsel for the Applicant objected to the Minister's reference to these issues, I find that they are relevant factors that should be considered in the decision. The Minister's IECS travel history shows that the Applicant entered Canada in 2012, and again on XXXX XXXX, 2019. As the Applicant states, he entered Canada in XXXX 2018 and worked until he went to Germany for one week as his family were on a visit there, any evidence that tends to establish that they, in fact, had a permanent status in that country is relevant as it goes to whether the Applicant has been straightforward in his claim, that he had been living in Croatia since the family left Canada in XXXX 2017.\nOther factors\n[23] As part of the justification for reinstating the claim, the Applicant has tendered additional facts. He claimed to have suffered persecution upon his return to Croatia. The Minister's evidence, regarding the residence of his family members, undermines these claims. Given that his mother and siblings appear to be living in Germany, I find on a balance of probabilities, that the Applicant was also living in Germany.\n[24] Similarly, if the Applicant did return to Canada in XXXX 2018 as he states, the fact that CBSA has no record of this entry points to an irregular arrival. I find that this allows me to conclude, on a balance of probabilities, that the Applicant did use irregular channels to enter Canada in XXXX 2018. I also find that this irregular entry likely indicates that the Applicant has demonstrated a willingness to mislead Canadian authorities, and that, as he admitted, his main goal was not to reinstate his withdrawn claim. All of which tends to indicate that it is not in the interests of justice to reinstate his withdrawn claim, which the Applicant concedes was properly withdrawn.\nCONCLUSION\n[25] For the above-mentioned reasons, the Application is refused.\n(signed)\n\"H.

However, they can be summarized as follows.\n[4] Her fears are based on harboring a Falun Gong (FG) practitioner, namely, her cousin for approximately 3 weeks. Her cousin's FG group had been raided, and she needed a place to hide.\n[5] The P.C. provided her cousin with accommodation and meals, however, prohibited her cousin from using her home phone and also prohibited her cousin's family members from visiting her and insisted that she remain at her house.\n[6] On XXXX XXXX, 2011, the P.C. went to work. That morning she received a phone call from her parents, who told her that the Public Security Bureau (PSB) had attended at her home and arrested her cousin. Her home was also searched and her parents were told that the P.C. was also a suspect of practicing FG, but at the very least harboring one.\n[7] As a result, the P.C. went to hide at the home of her maternal uncle. The following day, the PSB returned to her parents' home with an arrest summons; they sealed her home, and one week later, the P.C. was notified that her son's schooling was suspended because of her harboring a criminal. While in hiding, the P.C. learned that the PSB continued to pursue her at her parents' home.\n[8] With the help of a smuggler, the P.C. came to Canada. The P.C. alleges that her cousin remains in jail, is being treated badly, and the PSB remains in pursuit.\nDETERMINATION\n[9] The RPD finds that the claimants would not face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground and that, on a balance of probabilities, they would not personally be subjected to a risk to life or danger of torture.\nDETERMINATIVE ISSUES\n[10] The determinative issues are identity, credibility, and identification as having been pursued by the PSB for allegedly harboring a fugitive.\nIdentity\n[11] It is established that the issue of identity is tied to the issue of credibility. The panel is aware that the sworn testimony of a claimant is presumed to be true unless there are valid reasons to doubt it.\n[12] As noted by the Federal Court in Su, \"[t]he onus is on the claimant to produce acceptable documentation establishing his or her identity.\"1 Furthermore, the Federal Court in Duale noted that \"it is up to the claimant to establish his identity and he must make a genuine, substantive effort to do so.\"2\n[13] Section 106 of the IRPA states:\nThe Refugee Protection Division must take into account, with respect to the credibility of a claimant, whether the claimant possesses acceptable documentation establishing identity, and if not, whether they have provided a reasonable explanation for the lack of documentation or have taken reasonable steps to obtain the documentation.3\n[14] Similarly, section 11 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules (\"the Rules\") requires that:\nThe claimant must provide acceptable documents establishing identity and other elements of the claim. A claimant who does not provide acceptable documents must explain why they were not provided and what steps were taken to provide them.4 [emphasis added]\n[15] The burden therefore rests on the claimant to establish, with credible and trustworthy evidence, on a balance of probabilities, that she is who she says she is, and that she is a national of the People's Republic of China. In the Husein decision, the Federal Court held that once the panel concluded that the identity of the claimant has not been established, it was not necessary to analyze the evidence any further.5\n[16] The P.C. indicated in her PIF questionnaire that she would provide her RIC prior to the hearing. However, she did not. When asked why not, she testified that she \"suspects\" that the PSB took it away when they searched her home. The P.C. was asked specifically why she would have indicated in her PIF that it was forthcoming, to which she responded \"I do not know.\" Moreover, she acknowledged that she arrived in Canada on a fraudulent passport provided by a smuggler. She did indicate that at one time she had a genuine passport, which she obtained in the US, but it had expired in 2007. The panel asked the P.C. where this expired passport was to which she responded that she did not know. When asked if she had attempted to obtain it, she stated that her parents could not find it and she had not renewed it as she didn't expect to leave China. Finally, the panel asked the P.C. why none of this information was contained in her PIF, to which she responded she did not know that this information was required.\n[17] The panel considered the identification documents that were submitted on her behalf, i.e. a hukou and driver's license. The RPD finds that these documents do not establish the P.C.'s identity.\n[18] The most important document to establish the claimant's identity as a national of the People's Republic of China is the Resident Identity Card (RIC), as every Chinese citizen over the age of 16 must have one.6 Both the first and second generation RIC'S contain a number of security features. However, the second-generation card has many more security features, some of which are visible to the naked eye, some of which can be seen under ultra-violet light and some, which can be tested forensically. This is even more important, in the absence of a genuine passport.\n[19] The claimant did not submit into evidence even a copy of her RIC. The panel rejects her testimony that she \"suspects\" that the PSB have it. This is merely speculation, and the panel finds that at the very least, the P.C. ought to have had a copy of it. More importantly, the panel finds that this contradicts her statement in her PIF questionnaire that she would provide this document for the hearing. Furthermore, as stated above, the claimant seemingly failed to recognize the importance of establishing her identity, yet she was represented by competent counsel. The onus is on her to do so, and therefore, the panel concludes that her identity has not, in fact, been established. However, with respect to her son, we acknowledge that she did provide a birth certificate, a hukou, and school records,7 but since the son's claim is based on her allegations, it is her identity which is at issue. In the alternative, the panel will examine the merits of the claim.\nANALYSIS\n[20] The issue of whether the P.C. harboured a fugitive was not the determinative issue in this claim. The determinative issue is whether she were being sought by the PSB for this alleged action. The P.C.s fear of return to China is based on the fear of persecution from the authorities because of this alleged action, not whether or not she actually harboured a Falun Gong practitioner.\nCredibility\n[21] In assessing this claim, the panel has focused on the credibility of the P.C.'s allegation of assisting her cousin, who was an alleged Falun Gong practitioner and was being sought by the PSB, and the risk of persecution or harm that she might face upon her return to the People's Republic of China.\n[22] The panel is aware of the difficulties faced by claimants in establishing their claims; these include cultural factors, the milieu of the hearing room and the stress inherent in responding to oral questions through an interpreter. The panel has taken these considerations into account in arriving at its determination. The panel has also considered the passage of time namely 7 seven years since these claimants arrived in Canada. In this regard, the panel does not expect precise details of what occurred at that time.\n[23] The Federal Court of Appeal held in Orelien that \"one cannot be satisfied that the evidence is credible or trustworthy, unless satisfied that it is probably so, not just possibly so.\"8 Therefore, findings of fact, as well as the determination as to whether the claimant's evidence is credible, are made on a balance of probabilities. A witness' testimony does not have to be accepted simply because it was not contradicted at the hearing. The Refugee Protection Division is entitled to make reasonable findings based on implausibility, common sense and rationality, and may reject evidence if it is not consistent with the probabilities affecting the case as a whole.9\nPSB's interest in P.C. not proven\n[24] The panel considered the documentation with respect to the harboring of a FG fugitive. Firstly, it found very little documentation which referred to non FG practitioners who had harbored FG fugitives. This P.C. clearly had no FG connections. She was simply helping her cousin.\n[25] The P.C. stated that her cousin was detained for almost three years. When asked if she had any proof, she indicated that she had gone to request information, while in hiding, but was refused. She then corrected it to say that her parents had gone to the jail, but they did not visit her cousin; rather, they had asked for proof of her detention and were denied. The P.C. was unaware if others had been arrested. The panel finds that if the P.C.'s assertions are true, it begs the question as to why her parents would not have paid a visit, and in this manner, would have been in receipt of a jail visiting card, particularly since this was her cousin, not just a friend.\n[26] The P.C. was asked how many times the PSB had visited her home while she was in hiding for approximately three months, to which she responded more than 10 times. The panel asked the P.C. why this information was not in her PIF, to which she responded \"because they did not ask me those detailed questions.\" The PSB's last visit was, according to the P.C., sometime in XXXX 2012, after her arrival in Canada, at which time her parents told the PSB that she had gone to Canada. The panel categorically rejects the P.C.'s response as she has been represented by competent counsel and the instructions for filling out the Basis of Claim form make it clear that information of this nature ought to be included. Moreover, the P.C. submitted three amendments (albeit minor) to the panel prior to the hearing, which were accepted.10\n[27] More importantly, however, the RPD considered the fact that no coercive summons had been issued.\nSummons\n[28] The P.C. submitted an arrest warrant, which she alleges was given to her parents two days after her cousin was arrested, namely the second visit by the PSB. However, the interpreter at the proceedings indicated that it was, in fact, a summons. Giving the benefit of the doubt to the P.C., even if the panel accepts that it is, in fact, a coercive document, the panel questions why a summons would not have preceded the issuance of an arrest warrant.\n[29] The RPD notes that the objective evidence11confirms that a coercive summons can be issued in cases of non-compliance. In other words, if the P.C. has not responded to a non-coercive summons, then it would follow that a coercive or an arrest warrant would have been issued.\n[30] The RPD finds, on a balance probabilities, that the PSB summons is not a genuine document, considering the above analysis, the lack of a coercive summons (according to the interpreter) when one would reasonably have been issued, and if this is erroneous, and it is in fact a coercive summons in the absence of a non-coercive summons having been issued initially, and that fraudulent documents are readily available in China.12\nSuspension of school\n[31] Case law indicates that, where there is sufficient evidence to cast doubt on the authenticity of the document, whether because of an irregularity on the face or the questionable circumstances in which it was obtained or provided, the document may be assigned little or no weight.13 Further, evidence of widespread availability of fraudulent documents in a country is not by itself sufficient to reject foreign documents as forgeries, but it may be relevant if there are other reasons to question the documents or a claimant's credibility.14\n[32] The RPD further notes that submitting a false or irregular document may have an impact on the weight assigned to other documents provided by the P.C., especially when they are interrelated,15 and on the overall credibility of a claimant.16\n[33] Having found that the summons issued by the Public Security Bureau is a fraudulent document, the RPD has considered the other related document which is the notice of suspension from school on behalf of the P.C.'s son. The RPD finds that these documents are all significantly interrelated and refer to the PSB's investigation into the P.C. The RPD finds that this is also a fraudulent document and that no weight can be assigned to it to corroborate the claim.\nFamily members\n[34] No evidence was adduced to persuade the panel that the P.C.'s family members had encountered any problems as a result of the P.C.'s not turning herself in to the authorities. The P.C. did indicate that the home had been sealed, but there was no evidence to suggest that any ill-harm had come to them as a result of the P.C.'s allegations.\n[35] The panel draws an adverse credibility finding based on the ability of the P.C.'s family in China to carry on with their lives without facing serious consequences at the hands of the PSB.17\nLack of corroborative evidence\n[36] On the issue of corroborating evidence, the panel wishes to note the Federal Court case in Bhagat,18 which states:\nCorroborating evidence is not always necessary to establish the applicant's subjective fear. The Board, however, determined that in the particular circumstances of this case, corroborating evidence of persecution was expected. An absence of corroborating evidence, then, permitted it to make a negative inference against credibility of the applicant. The respondent relies on Sheik v. Canada (M.E.I.) (C.A.), [1990] 3 F.C. 238, at page 244, for its argument that the Board did not err in law when making that conclusion:\nThe concept of \"credible evidence\" is not, of course, the same as that of the credibility of the applicant, but it is obvious that where the only evidence before a tribunal linking the applicant to his claim is that of the applicant himself (in addition, perhaps, to \"country reports\" from which nothing about the applicant's claim can be directly deduced), a tribunal's perception that he is not a credible witness effectively amounts to a finding that there is no credible evidence on which the second-level tribunal could allow his claim.\n[37] The RPD finds that the P.C. has failed to provide any corroborative evidence with respect to the existence of her cousin, her cousin's detention, attempts to obtain identification documents, in light of the credibility concerns cited above.\n[38] Finally, the panel notes the following in the Board's NDP:19\nAccording to the Executive Director of Friends of Falun Gong USA, \"anyone who publicly supports Falun Gong or its practitioners is dealt with harshly\" (22 Sept. 2013). A spokesperson for the Falun Dafa Association of Canada added that people are afraid of being associated with Falun Gong because there are cases of people \"getting into trouble\" for being linked to the movement (17 Sept. 2013). However, the lecturer explained that while simple association or showing sympathy for practitioners may \"raise eyebrows,\" he offered the opinion that this would not be sufficient to pose a \"real danger\" to those involved, adding that there would need to be a \"clear, credible sense of assisting Falun Gong\" or clear links to the movement to attract the attention of authorities.\n[39] After considering all of the evidence, the RPD concludes that a short period of time in which the P.C. allegedly allowed her cousin to reside with her and adhere to strict rules and regulations, if this in fact occurred, would not give rise to the PSB's interest in her to the extent that she would be a target upon return to China.\n[40] The onus is on the P.C. to provide sufficient credible evidence to support the material allegations of her claim, however, she has failed to do so. The RPD makes this finding based on the following:\n* P.C.'s failure to establish her personal identity;\n* Lack of material evidence in the P.C.'s PIF;\n* Finding of fraudulent documents;\n* Family members not sustaining any ill effects from their daughter's alleged problems;\n* Lack of evidence with respect to the existence of the cousin, her detention, or any evidence with respect to others that may have been victims of the so-called raid.\n[41] Even if we believe that the P.C. harbored a FG practitioner, namely her cousin, the panel finds that the PSB are not in pursuit of her, nor would they be upon return to China.\nCONCLUSION\n[42] The RPD finds, on a balance of probabilities, the P.C. did not harbour a Falun Gong fugitive. This finding is based on a number of credibility issues described in this decision. Even if, the P.C. had harboured a Falun Gong fugitive, there is no probative evidence that this alleged act was discovered by the PSB. In addition, the RPD finds, after careful review of the documentation, that the P.C. and therefore her son are not at risk of the alleged persecution for allegedly harbouring a Falun Gong fugitive.\n[43] Accordingly, these claims are rejected. The panel finds that the claimants would not face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, and that, on a balance of probabilities, they would not personally be subjected to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture upon return to China.\n(signed)\n\"Roslyn Ahara\"\nRoslyn Ahara\nApril 3, 2019\nDate\n1 Su, Sai v.

At the second sitting, April 23, 2019, in addition to the first two observers, XXXX XXXX XXXX was also present with the permission of the claimant.\n[3] The Minister informed the RPD in writing that he wishes to intervene in the claim by making observations and submitting evidence in writing,4 pursuant to paragraph 170 (e) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and according to Section 29 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules.5\n[4] The claimant was represented by Lily Luwam Tekle, Barrister and Solicitor.\nApplication apprehension of bias\n[5] On April 18, 2019, counsel submitted an application in writing,6 for the panel to recuse itself. Counsel submitted that:\nUnfortunately, I did not have an opportunity to prepare and provide this motion in advance due to limited resources and scheduling conflicts which prevented me from preparing the motion at an earlier time.7\n[6] The panel notes that the application did not adhere to Rule 50(1) of the RPD Rules; which requires applications must be received by the Division no later than 10 days before the date fixed for the next proceedings. In this case, the proceeding was scheduled for April 23, 2019.\n[7] The panel treated the written application as an oral application, and allowed the application notwithstanding Rule 50(1), and counsel's inadequate reasons for the late application.\n[8] In the application counsel submitted that:\n[a]t the first sitting of this claim on February 11, 2019, the Member demonstrated a lack of sensitivity and understanding of the claimant's mental health condition and cultural context, a lack of respect for the claimant and a lack of respect for a professional observers who attended the hearing to support the claimant. The Member also made statements that reflected pre-judgment of the claim. Her refusal to admit counsel's evidence which was submitted to the Refugee Protection Division in a timely manner is a denial of natural justice and a breach of principles of fairness. Cumulatively, this conduct by the Member constitutes bias.8\n[9] At the second sitting, it is worthy to note that, counsel withdrew her allegation that the member had refused to admit counsel's evidence, and her allegation of a denial of natural justice and a breach of the principles of fairness. As the transcripts of the first hearing clearly indicate, the panel had entered all the documents submitted by counsel as an exhibit. The transcript of the second sitting in this respect is as follows:\nCOUNSEL: Right. My concern was I had summarized that report itself and I had also summarized some objective news articles about stigma, individuals suffering from mental health conditions, right, in Nigeria. So initially, I was trying to get this letter entered as an exhibit, and you mentioned that it's not necessary and, if I wished to do so, I could summarize it in my oral submissions. So what I would --\nMEMBER: Yes. Because I already have documents in front of me, the full documents, I don't need your summarization.\nCOUNSEL: Right, right. I understood your position on that.\nMEMBER: Okay.\nCOUNSEL: But when I was preparing this motion for recusal I had initially raised that as a ground that I was concerned about, that you weren't willing to accept this letter as part of the claimant's disclosure. I ended up withdrawing that specific argument from the motion of recusal, so perhaps that's why that statement remained. But my motion for recusal, again, just focuses on the two issues that I raised.\n[10] In the application, counsel submitted that \"the member has shown bias in the claim in the following ways;\nThe Member made an inappropriate comment towards counsel when the claimant broke down and started crying during the hearing which demonstrated a lack of understanding and sensitivity towards Claimant's mental health condition. In addition, she was reluctant to provide procedural accommodations to the claimant when it became apparent that the Claimant was struggling to continue with her testimony and stated that counsel was \"encouraging\" the client when counsel requested a break.\nThe Member asked questions of an observer in he hearing room who was there in her professional capacity to support the Claimant and these questions indicate that the Member is biased towards racialized persons or persons of colour. Moreover, she made a general comment about cultures in Africa which reflect her lack of understanding and knowledge about the diversity and cultural differences between the various different countries on the continent.\nIt is therefore requested that the Board Member remove herself from the hearing of this claim and that a de novo hearing be held.9\n[11] The panel, after considering the application, Ruled that the application did not meet the test for \"reasonable apprehension of bias\" formulated in the Supreme Court of Canada case Committee for Justice and Liberty v. National Energy Board,10 as follows:\nWhat would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically, and having thought the matter through, conclude. Would he think that it is more likely than not that [the decision-maker], whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly.\n[12] The panel informed the claimant and counsel that the reason for dismissing the application would be included as part of the reasons for the decision.\nReasons for the ruling\n[13] The allegation of an apprehension of bias should be first put to the person against whom the allegation is being made, in order to allow the person an opportunity to respond.11 It was therefore appropriate for this Panel member to decide the motion against it.12 The Panel member considered Counsel's application regarding bias with an open mind before ruling on the matter.13\n[14] The common-law principles of natural justice are recognized in section 162(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n[15] With respect to the issues raised by counsel, the panel is mindful of the following.\n162. (2) Each Division shall deal with all proceedings before it informally and quickly as the circumstances and the considerations of fairness and natural justice permit.\n[16] The principles of natural justice include the common-law rule against bias. That rule disqualifies a decision-maker from determining any case in which there is actual bias or an appearance of bias, also described as a reasonable apprehension of bias.\n[17] Despite Counsel's motions and allegations in order to get a De Novo hearing, the claimant received a fair hearing, and her claim was determined on its own merits.\n[18] The panel notes that, counsel did not raise any objections during the first hearing regarding the concerns raised in the application.\n[19] The panel is mindful that the impartiality of decision-makers is not judged from the decision-maker's perspective, but from that of a reasonable bystander, fully informed of all relevant facts. For example, certain activities and associations of a member may seem quite inconsequential from the member's perspective, and yet still appear highly suspect from an observer's point of view.\nFirst issue\n[20] Counsel submitted that:\nDuring the Member's questioning the Claimant broke down during her testimony and started crying. Due to her mental health symptoms and the psychiatrists report that was provided well in advance of the hearing, the Member would have been aware that the Claimant becomes easily distressed and would need some time to express her emotions, calm down, and then regain her focus. However, during the claimant's sobbing, the Member looked over at counsel and advised counsel during the Claimant's sobbing, \"to control your client\". Counsel was surprised by the comment and responded that nothing could be done to control that type of behavior as it is a symptom of her mental health condition. ... the two observers took the Claimant outside of the hearing room...counsel reiterated again that she would not be able to \"control\" her client's behavior if she gets upset again or experience another outburst...14\n[21] The panel notes that counsel's entire lengthy account noted above does not appear [emphasis added] anywhere on the full transcript of the first sitting, therefore it never took place as per the record.\n[22] Counsel submitted that:\nAt another point during the Member's questioning counsel became concerned that the Claimant May start crying again and experience another outburst, Counsel interjected during the Member's questioning and asked the Claimant if she needed a break. The Claimant nodded yes. The Member insisted that a break was not needed at that point and she also told counsel that she should not \"encourage\" her client's behavior. Counsel was shocked at the accusation and responded that she could recognise her client was coming close to getting upset and crying again. The Member advised counsel that she had a psychology background and insinuated that she knew how to handle the Claimant. She reluctantly allowed a 5 minute break... It is not clear why the member was reluctant to accommodate the Claimant when she was struggling to cope during the hearing.\n[23] As stated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Arsenault-Cameron v. Prince Edward Island, \"The test for apprehension of bias takes into account the presumption of impartiality. A real likelihood of bias must be demonstrated.\"15 The Supreme Court reiterated this principle in Wewaykum, \"The standard refers to an apprehension of bias that rests on serious grounds, in light of the strong presumption of judicial impartiality.\"16\n[24] The panel member is also mindful that the court will require clear evidence that a predetermination had in fact occurred. The Federal Court reiterated in Ali17 that:\n... the Court of Appeal in Arthur v. Canada (Attorney General), [2001] F.C.J. No. 1091 [(F.C.A., no. A-991-90), MacGuigan, Linden, Gray, November 2, 1992, reported: 18 Imm. L.R. (2d) 22 (F.C.A.)], has emphasized that an allegation of bias cannot be done lightly. It cannot rest on mere suspicion, pure conjecture or mere impressions of an applicant. It must be supported by material evidence.\n[25] It is clear that the circumstances of this situation, counsel's erroneous allegation regarding the observer, is pure conjecture and a mere suspicion that the panel deliberately chose to focus on the \"racialized\" person.\n[26] Counsels submissions in this respect are not accurate, and her allegation regarding \"should not encourage\" above does not appear [emphasis added] anywhere on the full transcript of the first sitting. Counsel has exaggerated and has taken the Member's action out of context. The transcript in this respect is as follows:\nMEMBER: Okay. I assume that person had a passport for you. Do you know whatever happened to that passport?\nCLAIMANT: I don't know. I don't know.\nMEMBER: Okay. Do you know which country it was, was it from Nigeria?\nCLAIMANT: I can't explain.\nMEMBER: That's fine. If you don't know, you don't know. Nothing to worry about. Now, when you arrived and you went to the church, how many days after you arrived did you go to make your claim?\nCLAIMANT: Two days. Because I don't even know the man, he just came around to help me.\nMEMBER: Okay, I don't need to know the name, that's fine. Now, when you came in, you arrived in Canada, did you have any documents showing who you are, like a birth certificate, national ID card, anything?\nCLAIMANT: I cannot explain, can't.\nMEMBER: What do you mean you cannot explain? You cannot remember or you don't know...?\nCLAIMANT: I can't remember, because it's been a while this thing happened.\nMEMBER: Okay. Now, do you remember when you left Nigeria, if you had your national ID card or birth certificate with you?\nCLAIMANT: I can't remember.\nMEMBER: Okay.\nCLAIMANT: I can't remember.\nMEMBER: That's fine.\nCLAIMANT: I can't remember.\nMEMBER: Okay, that's fine. No need to get upset.\nCOUNSEL: Can we take a break at this point?\nMEMBER: No need to get upset, it's fine. Okay, she will tell me if she needs a break. I've already instructed her to do so.\nCOUNSEL: Do you need a break? [claimant nods] Yes, she needs a break.\nMEMBER: Okay, five minutes. I like to give break when it's appropriate, not when you [counsel] think she should have a break.\nCOUNSEL: If I just see her --\nMEMBER: Now she's -- yeah, but I also see her too and I have a psychology background as well, just for your information --\nCOUNSEL: I work with her very closely, so --\nMEMBER: -- and I didn't see her need it, but we'll give five minutes break. Okay? Five minutes. It's now 3:30, we'll give a break until 3:35.\n[27] The Panel member's statement regarding \"having a psychology background\" was made to reassure counsel that the panel member was cognisant of the claimant's emotional condition and the psychological reports regarding the claimant's condition.\n[28] Moreover, the panel is mindful of the Chairperson Guidelines 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution and Chairperson Guideline 8: Procedures with Respect to Vulnerable Persons Appearing Before the IRB. In the case at hand, the panel was also mindful of the medical and the Psychiatric reports.18\n[29] Counsel ought to recognize that the panel has the responsibility for conducting the hearing. The panel will determine when accommodation is reasonable and appropriate, not when counsel, in her mind, anticipates and becomes \"concerned that the Claimant May [emphasis added] start crying again and experience another outburst\". As evident by the transcript, the situation was under control. The claimant did not express verbally or nonverbally that she needed a break, given that she was instructed to do so when she saw the need. As evident by the transcript there was no \"insistence\" on the part of the Member not to give a break. A break was given without any hesitation when the claimant nodded \"yes\" in response to counsel's question.\n[30] As illustrated by the transcripts of the second sitting, the claimant became emotional on many occasions. To make the point that not all emotional expressions require a break on part of the claimant, after each display of emotion, the panel asked if the claimant needed a break. The claimant in response stated \"no.\" On at least two occasions, the claimant, as instructed, asked for a break and it was granted immediately. This supports the fact that not every display of emotion requires a break, and the determination to grant a break is at the discretion of the panel after assessing each instance.\n[31] Chairperson Guideline 8: Procedures With Respect to Vulnerable Persons Appearing Before the IRB states the following:19\n4.2 The IRB has a broad discretion to tailor procedures to meet the particular needs of a vulnerable person, and, where appropriate and permitted by law, the IRB may accommodate a person's vulnerability by various means, including:\na. allowing the vulnerable person to provide evidence by videoconference or other means;\nb. allowing a support person to participate in a hearing;\nc. creating a more informal setting for a hearing;\nd. varying the order of questioning;\ne. excluding non-parties from the hearing room;\nf. providing a panel and interpreter of a particular gender;\ng. explaining IRB processes to the vulnerable person; and\nh. allowing any other procedural accommodations that may be reasonable in the circumstance.\n[32] The review of the transcript of the first sitting, illustrates that the panel member, in the case at hand, not only provided reasonable accommodation by allowing reasonable breaks when necessary, it also allowed counsel to ask questions of the claimant during the panel's questioning or show the claimant documents to refresh the claimant's memory. The panel was diligent in ensuring that all questions were understood by the claimant. The panel encouraged the claimant by providing positive strokes, like commending the claimant when appropriate to encourage her in giving her testimony. The panel tried to calm the claimant when she showed signs of stress. The panel was respectful of the claimant, empathised and sympathised with her at times to gain her trust and create a conducive and informal environment for the claimant to testify. The panel member, on several occasions, explained its role and the reason for questioning to the claimant.\n[33] It is clear that, in the circumstances of this case, counsel's erroneous allegations are pure conjecture and a mere suspicion, in her mind, is not supported by the material evidence.\nSecond issue\n[34] With respect to the second issue regarding the observer, counsel asserts that the member asked the observer, a \"visible minority\" and not the other observer who is a \"non-racialized\" person if she was a refugee claimant. Counsel, in her application, alleged that\n[t]he court supporter and the counsel were both uncomfortable with this line of questioning. The Member could have asked the same questions to both observers but she deliberately chose to focus on the racialized court supporter worker. This is a concerning example of explicit bias which the Member did not even attempt to hide.20\n[35] It should be noted, that apprehension of bias does not apply to observers. However, the panel will address the issue raised by counsel.\n[36] The panel notes that this conversation took place prior to the commencement of the hearing, while the panel member was setting up the recording device.\n[37] Firstly, during the very short exchange, no visible uncomfortableness on part of counsel or the case worker or anyone else present in the room was displayed or expressed, verbally or non-verbally.\n[38] Secondly, questioning the persons present in the hearing room is a routine practice by Members. It is to establish the reasons for their presence. It is a practical and administrative function, to ascertain whether they are observers, witnesses, or present in any other capacity prior to the start of the hearing, and to make arrangements accordingly i.e. witnesses to return to the reception area and to exclude non-parties from the hearing room.\n[39] Thirdly, often counsels bring other refugee claimants to a hearing to expose them to the hearing room environment, in preparation in advance for the observer's hearing, which is usually allowed with the permission of the claimant.\n[40]\n[41] Counsel further submitted that:\n... during the Member's questioning of the Claimant, the Member made a comment that she had previously worked in Africa for the United Nations and although she never worked in Nigeria specifically her work experience on the continent allowed her to understand the \"culture\". The comment was likely made to reassure the Claimant about her personal circumstances. However, it was offensive to hear the Member's statement as it insinuated that she believed all cultures throughout the continent would be similar. This is a problematic assumption on the Member's part which does not make any sense as working in one area of Africa does not make her an expert or knowledgeable on all cultures throughout the continent. It is submitted that the Member's conduct in the above instances exhibits a bias that could affect the outcome of her adjudication of the Claimant's refugee proceeding.21\n[42] Counsel has taken the Members comments out of context. Shortly after the questioning of the claimant by the panel commenced, the claimant became emotional when a question regarding school was asked. A recess was provided. The transcript in this respect is as follows:\nMEMBER: Well, did you go to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Primary School? You have to answer me. Shaking of the head is not recorded.\nCLAIMANT: I didn't go to the school mentioned, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, at all. Because my parents, they didn't have money to train me in school, so I didn't go to school at all. [emotional]\nCOUNSEL: XXXX... She wanted frequent breaks, that's part of the reason we had the psychiatrist's report.\nMEMBER: Okay, we'll give you a break. I haven't even asked you anything that would make you upset.\nCOUNSEL: I asked her questions, and the school triggered the same reaction, so it's not you --\n- - - HEARING RECESSED - - -\n- - - HEARING RESUMED - - -\nMEMBER: We're back on the record, everyone is present, including the claimant.\nMadam, I'm just going to give you some information on why I'm here. Okay? There's nothing for you to be nervous about or upset about. I'm here to hear your story and decide whether I should make you a convention refugee or not. So it's very important for me to get clear evidence from you. If there is even a slight little information that's different from what I have in the file it's my job to bring it to your attention and give you a chance to correct it. Okay? So there's nothing to be upset about or to worry about, just listen to the questions. Okay? If at any time you feel like you want to have a break, just let me know, I'll be happy to give you a break. Okay? This is a very informal hearing. Okay?\nCLAIMANT: All right.\nCLAIMANT: It's just that when I remember my children, when I remember my kids it just...\nMEMBER: Oh, I understand that. I understand, as a mother, that you will feel like that. But you have to be strong. One way you can help them is by being strong and give me the information I need to receive from you. If it makes it any easier, I have worked in Africa, I'm very familiar with Africa, not necessarily Nigeria, so I'm very familiar with the culture. Okay? Do you understand that?22\nCLAIMANT: I understand what you're saying.\n[43] Firstly, it is clear from the transcript that the panel is mindful of the psychological reports23 and the Chairperson Guidelines 4 and 8, and was attempting to empathise with the claimant, to put the claimant at ease, and to create an atmosphere where she could be relaxed to give her evidence. The panel wanted to have the claimant understand that the panel is familiar, identifies, and has an appreciation of cultures in Africa in general, which is different than North America. Secondly, at no point did the Member state that she worked for the UN, any information that counsel has imported into her submissions, is from outside of the hearing.\n[44] It is clear that in the circumstances of this case, counsel's erroneous allegation is pure conjecture and a mere suspicion in her mind, and is not supported by material evidence.\nConclusion\n[45] The panel finds that an informed person, viewing the allegations made by counsel realistically, and in context, would conclude that counsel's submission is, pure conjecture and an exaggeration.\n[46] For all the above reasons, having correctly applied the test for bias as set out in the Committee for Justice and Liberty above, and mindful of the duty of RPD members under the Code of Conduct for Members of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, to decide every case on its merits and to not be influenced by any extraneous factors, and having considered whether any comments made could constitute a valid ground for reasonable apprehension of bias, the application for Recusal was dismissed.\nALLEGATIONS\n[47] The claimant's allegations are detailed in the narrative of her Personal Information Form (PIF), dated 29-11-2012,24 when she claimed refugee protection, and PIF narrative Addendum, dated Sept 14, 2018.25 In summary, the claimant alleged that she entered Canada using a fraudulent document.\n[48] The claimant alleged she is a citizen of Nigeria, and in support of her identity and citizenship, proffered a copy of a Registration of Birth,26 a copy of a voter's card,27 a Driver's Licence, and copies of Birth Certificate and Registration of Birth28 for the claimant's alleged children, and affidavits.29\nANALYSIS\n[49] The determinative issues in this case are identity and credibility.\nIdentity\n[50] In view of the totality of the evidence, the panel finds the claimant has not met the burden of establishing her identity. The panel finds the claimant, on a balance of probabilities, is not a citizen of Nigeria and has not established her personal identity.\n[51] Absent a finding that the personal and national identity has been established on a balance of probabilities, an assessment of the potential merits of a claim cannot be properly performed. In cases where personal and national identity of a claimant have not been established on a balance of probabilities, an assessment of the remainder of the claim is not necessary.30\nCase Law\n[52] The panel, with respect to establishing identity, is guided by the following case law and IRPA and RPD rules and guidelines.\n[53] It is the claimant's duty to provide acceptable documentation establishing their identity on a balance of probabilities.31 In the absence of documentation, they must provide a reasonable explanation for the lack thereof, or demonstrate that they have taken reasonable steps to obtain such documentation.32\n[54] Section 106 of IRPA states:\nThe Refugee Protection Division must take into account, with respect to the credibility of a claimant, whether the claimant possesses acceptable documentation establishing identity, and if not, whether they have provided a reasonable explanation for the lack of documentation or have taken reasonable steps to obtain the documentation.33\n[55] As well, Section 11 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules (RPD Rules) requires that:\nThe claimant must provide acceptable documents establishing identity and other elements of the claim. A claimant who does not provide acceptable documents must explain why they were not provided and what steps were taken to provide them.34\n[56] In Su the Federal court stated, \"[t]he onus is on the claimant to produce acceptable documentation establishing his or her identity.\"35 Furthermore, the Federal Court in Duale noted that \"it is up to the claimant to establish his identity and he must make a genuine, substantive effort to do so.\"36\n[57] The panel acknowledges that, at times it can be difficult for claimants to obtain and provide documentation to establish their claim, the UNHCR Handbook reiterates the need for claimants to provide any evidence establishing identity that may be available.37\n[58] The panel also notes, however, that the burden still rests on the claimant to establish their personal and national identity, on a balance of probabilities, with credible and reliable evidence through other means when there is a lack of official, government-issued identification. As the identity findings are to be based upon the totality of the evidence, the panel considered and assessed each document submitted by the claimant in support of her identity.\n[59] The panel concludes that, in the case at hand, the personal and national identity of the claimant has not been established, on a balance of probabilities, with credible and trustworthy evidence for the following reasons.\nCredibility\n[60] The determination as to whether a claimant's evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities.38 Although statements given under oath are presumed to be true, that presumption can be rebutted by contradictions or inconsistencies in the evidence.39 The onus is on the person making a claim, to present evidence that is credible, on a balance of probabilities, to support the allegations which form the basis of the claim. In this case, the panel finds that the claimant has not discharged her onus.\n[61] The panel took into consideration the doctor and the psychologist reports, Chairperson Guidelines 4 and 8, and the various factors that could affect the claimant's oral testimony, including the setting of hearing room, presence of observers, the claimant's anxiety, age, cultural differences, education, and the use of an interpreter.\n[62] While not every piece of evidence will be referred to in these reasons, the panel carefully considered the entirety of the evidence in reaching its decision.40\nClaimant's Registration of Birth\n[63] The Minister submitted that there were different spellings of the claimant's name, and middle name, between her PIF, Immigration forms, and the Registration of Birth form as follows:\n[64] The claimant declared in her personal information (PIF) that her name is XXXX XXXX XXXX,41 and the Registration of Birth indicates her name as XXXX XXXX XXXX.42 The Minister submitted that, given the different spelling of the name XXXX vs XXXX [emphasis added] and middle name XXXX vs XXXX [emphasis added] \"there is reason to doubt the claimant's identity.\"43\n[65] The panel is not persuaded by the Minister's submission, regarding the different spelling between the Registration of Birth and the claimant's spelling of her name in the PIF, given the claimant's level of education.\n[66] The Minister further submitted that the birth certificate [Registration of Birth] was analysed by the Canada Border Survives Agency's Intelligence Division (CBSA), Document Analysis Unit. The minister submitted that the analysis indicates that, since it appears the certificate itself was folded prior to lamination, \"the possibility exists it was not laminated by the Issuing Authority.\"44 The minister submitted that \"because the birth certificate's security features are obscured by lamination, it is no longer a valid form of identification.\"45\n[67] Furthermore, the Minister submitted that further analysis indicates that the birth certificate contains a spelling error on the stamp (wet seal). Instead of \"Burial\" it states \"Buraial. [emphasis added]\" The minister submitted that this error reduces the probative value of the birth certificate as a whole.\nThe Minister asks that the birth certificate be found invalid due to the likelihood that it was laminated by someone other than the issuing authority, sometime after issuance. Additionally, Minister asks that it not be accepted as a proof of identity in consideration of the identified spelling error in the wet seal.46\n[68] The Minister's finding, with respect the spelling of \"Burial\" vs \"Buraial\", the wet seal, and the lamination of the card was put to the claimant for explanation and clarification. However, no explanation was provided by the claimant. The panel draws a negative inference regarding the misspelling on the wet stamp. It is reasonable to expect that a document issued by the government authorities, where English47 is an official language, would contain correct spelling.\n[69] With respect to her name, the claimant testified that her full name is XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimant spelled her name several times during the hearing as XXXX and her middle name is XXXX. The claimant testified that she is known as XXXX XXXX and not by any other names. The claimant was asked to explain that her PIF indicates that she has also used XXXX XXXX XXXX.48 She explained that XXXX was the name of the man who fathered her children. Her evidence indicates that is the name of her common-law spouse.49 Her evidence indicates that they were never officially married. The claimant failed to explain the reason she had used XXXX when she was not married to the man who fathered her children. The panel does not accept her explanation as persuasive, as it was internally contradicted by her own evidence in the PIF.\n[70] Furthermore, when the claimant was shown the Registration of Birth form she testified that \"I've never received it before\" and \"I don't know\" how immigration got a hold of the document and \"I did not give them [immigration Canada] any document.\"50 The panel does not accept the claimant's explanation as persuasive, as there is no evidence before the panel that any other persons, on a balance of probabilities, would have proffered the document to the Immigration authorities aside from the claimant. The panel draws a negative inference in this respect.\n[71] In view of the cumulative effect of the above issues with the Registration of Birth, and in particular the misspelling of the word \"Burial\", the panel finds that this document is, on the balance of probabilities, fraudulent and not a reliable identity document.\nVoter's card\n[72] The Claimant, in support of her identity, submitted a copy of a Voter's card.51 It indicates that the claimant's Name as XXXX [emphasis added], which is inconsistent with the spelling of the same name on her Registration of Birth form XXXX [emphasis added]. This inconsistency was brought to the attention of the claimant. The claimant's evidence indicates that the only way she spells her name is \"XXXX\". It is reasonable to expect the voter's ID card, a document issued by the government, to be consistent with the spelling of the claimant's name on other government issued documents, like the Registration of Birth. The panel draws a negative inference from the different spelling of the claimant's name on the Voter's card.\n[73] The Voter's card indicates the occupation of the claimant as \"XXXX\". The claimant explained that she worked as a \"XXXX XXXX\" prior to getting married (age 18).52 The panel does not find her explanation reasonable, as the Voter's card was issued on January28, 2011, when the claimant was approximately 43 years old. Furthermore, she is contradicted by her own testimony \"I never worked in Nigeria...\",53 \"I did not work.\".54 Which is, in turn, contradicted by her evidence in the work history in the PIF,55 indicating the claimant was \"owner\/operator of an XXXX, from 2002 to 2012... self-employed... in Logos Nigeria\".56 When asked to explain the contradictory evidence, she testified that \"I never operated as a XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX\".57 She further testified that she helped at the church, as she does in Canada, and also helped as a XXXX. The panel does not accept the claimant's explanations as persuasive. The panel finds it is not reasonable that, on a balance of probabilities, the card issued to the claimant when she was allegedly about 43 years old to indicate the claimant's occupation from when she was about 18 years old. The panel draws a negative inference with respect to the claimant's occupation on the Voter's card.\n[74] In view of the cumulative effect of the issues regarding the Voter's card, the panel finds the Voter's card, on a balance of probabilities, is fraudulent and is not a reliable identity document.\nEducation\n[75] The claimant testified at the hearing that she had two years of elementary education. This contradicts her evidence in the PIF, stating that she has six years of education, at the XXXX XXXX XXXX Primary school from XXXX XXXX XXXX in Logos.58 The claimant explained that \"I never went to school\"... \"It's only in Canada that I attended... I didn't go to the school mentioned ...because my parents, they did not have money...59 The panel does not accept the claimant's explanation as persuasive, given that the claimant had benefit of counsel, a Barrister and Solicitor, and an Igbo interpreter when she signed and declared that the content of the PIF is true and correct on November 29, 2012.60 The panel finds the claimant has misrepresented her profile.\n[76] Furthermore, although an addendum was provide to the narrative of the PIF, no corrections or addendums were provided regarding the questioned sections of the narrative. The panel draws a negative inference regarding the claimants' evidence on education, which is not credible.\n[77] The panel does not find the claimant's evidence regarding her education to be credible.\nDriver's Licence\n[78] In support of the claimant's identity, a National Driver's licence, issued on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX2011,61 was proffered to Immigration Canada. The claimant testified that she never drove in Nigeria \"I no got money, (inaudible) drive a car. Don't drive a car I don't know -- I don't know what thing you call driving licence\"62. After putting the question to her several times and showing her the copy of the document on file, the claimant testified that she remembered \"I never drive -- I never drive, but I have driving licence.\"63 The claimant explained that she was issued a Driver's Licence despite the fact that she did not know how to drive because she intended to learn how to drive. She further testified that it was obtained by her common-law spouse, and she did not know how he obtained it. The panel does not accept that, on a balance of probabilities, a driver's licence would be issued to a person who wished to learn driving, and draws a negative inference in this respect.\n[79] The claimant testified that the signature on the Driver's Licence is not hers, as she only signs with her initials \"XXXX\"64 or \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\"65 The panel draws a negative inference from the fraudulent signature on the Driver's Licence.\n[80] The Driver's Licence was issued to XXXX XXXX, the claimant was asked to explain the inconsistency between the name on the Driver's licence and her name XXXX XXXX XXXX, and she explained that XXXX was her common-law husband's name. The panel does not accept the claimant's explanation as reasonable, as it is contrary to her evidence that she only has one name XXXX XXXX XXXX. The panel draws a negative inference in this respect.\n[81] The claimant testified that, in 2011, she lived at XXXX Street. However, the address on the Driver's licence indicated the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX LAGOS address. The claimant was asked if she knew the address, however, she speculated \"Maybe that is the office that they did the licence\".66 The panel is not persuaded by the claimant's explanation. It is reasonable to expect for the Driver's Licence to show the address of the claimant as \"XXXX Street\". The panel draws a negative inference in this respect.\n[82] The claimant testified that she was not present when the Driver's Licence was issued. The claimant was asked to explain how her picture got on the Driver's Licence when she was not there. The claimant explained that \"How he got my picture, somebody I'm living with, he knows me, he has my picture. He has my pictures. That was when we were still dating, everything was going well...\"67 The panel does not accept the claimant's explanation as persuasive or reasonable, given the claimant's original response that she did not even know what a Driver's Licence was. It is reasonable to expect that, if the claimant is alleging that she was learning how to drive, she would know what a driver's Licence is. The panel draws a negative inference in this respect.\n[83] The documentary evidence68 indicates the following:\n[t]he applicant for driver's Licence \"must also provide a signature on a signature mandatory card,\" which is then scanned into a database and displayed on the driver's licence. The applicant must provide two passport photographs that will also be scanned into the database and displayed on the driver's licence (ibid.). Once the application has been processed and the documents verified, the driver's licence is mailed to the applicant's \"residential or chosen mailing address\" (ibid.). Applicants \"can never obtain an on the spot drivers licence because the application must be processed\" (ibid.).\n[84] In view of the cumulative issues noted above with respect to the Driver's licence proffered, and coupled with the country documents, the panel finds that the driver's licence, on the balance of probabilities, is fraudulent and is not a reliable identity document.\nSiblings\n[85] The claimant's testimony regarding her siblings was convoluted and inconsistent with the information in her PIF.69 The claimant was asked to list her relatives, living or dead... Brothers and sisters, including half-brothers and half-sisters. The claimant only entered three names, two brothers and one sister. However, she testified that she has eight half and full siblings, including XXXX, XXXX (who is deceased), XXXX, XXXX or XXXX, and XXXX. Which is contrary to information contained in the PIF, indicating only three siblings XXXX (brother), XXXX (brother), and XXXX (sister).\n[86] The claimant testified that XXXX was \"my uncle\",70 and XXXX was her \"cousin\".71 Which is contrary to her PIF. The claimant was asked the reason XXXX was omitted from the PIF, and the claimant explained that \"... there was no particular reason why they were not listed...The ones listed are the ones I was able to remember.\"72\n[87] The panel notes that when the claimant completed the PIF she did have the assistance of a counsel and an interpreter. The claimant completed the PIF on November 29, 2012. There was no evidence before the panel that, at that time, the claimant had any memory issues. The claimant first saw the psychologist approximately six months after the PIF was completed, on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2013. The psychologist, during her typically 60 minute73 interview of the claimant, stated in part that the claimant\n[C]ooperated fully, she stablished full eye contact and responded directly to the question...She developed a headache. Concentration problems rendered it difficult to focus. At times her mind went blank...has become somewhat distracted and forgetful, e.g [she] confuses dates and details of past events, she requires time to recall the name of people she knows well....\".74\n[88] The doctor's report indicates that the claimant was assessed on XXXX XXXX, 2018.75 It states that, in part, the claimant,\n[E]xperiences with symptoms of consistent with cognitive decline... her memory appears to fluctuate...she suffers from dementia, mild severity and anxiety disorder...she will be prone to emotional dysregulation, memory lapses , impaired processing and decision making, disorganized thinking, and confusion.\"76\n[89] Given the above psychologist reports, the panel finds on the balance of probabilities, her testimony regarding her siblings is not reliable evidence.\n[90] In view of the two above noted medical reports, the panel concludes that the claimant's testimony regarding her siblings is not reliable enough to base a determination regarding the claimant's identity.\n[91] The panel observed that, despite the medical reports, the claimant had full appreciation of the nature of the proceedings. She was able to recall her name, date of birth, information learned at school in Canada, her work at the church in Canada, the alleged reason she had come to Canada, who she fears and why she fears if she were to be deported from Canada. The panel observed, and supported by the transcript, that the issue of memory and convoluted testimony arose predominately during the questioning with respect to her documents, who and where they were obtained, when and how she received the Voter's ID card, Driver's licence and Registration of birth, who proffered them to immigration Canada when she made an asylum claim, and her family composition.\nCertificates of Birth and Registration of Birth\n[92] The claimant proffered three Certificates of birth (CB)77 for her children.\n[93] The CB for XXXX XXXX, was issued on XXXX XXXX, 2004, when she was born on XXXX XXXX, 1995. Furthermore, the name of the mother is written as XXXX XXXX XXXX, which is contrary to the claimant's testimony, stating that her name is XXXX XXXX XXXX. It is reasonable to expect the authorities to spell the claimant's name as XXXX not XXXX. It bares the stamp of the National Population Commission and the Public registry of Nigeria. The panel draws a negative inference regarding the claimant's name on the documents.\n[94] The CB for XXXX XXXX, was issued on XXXX XXXX, 1997, when he was born on XXXX XXXX, 1994. The name of the mother is entered as XXXX XXXX XXXX. It is reasonable to expect the name of the claimant to be written correctly, and not reverse the middle name and the first name of the claimant. The claimant's name is also spelled as XXXX not XXXX. It bares the stamp of the National Population Commission and the Public registry of Nigeria. The panel draws a negative inference regarding the claimant's name on the documents.\n[95] The CB for XXXX XXXX, was issued on XXXX XXXX, 1999, when he was born on XXXX XXXX, 1999. The name of the mother is written as XXXX XXXX XXXX instead of XXXX XXXX XXXX. It bares the stamp of the National Population Commission and the Public registry of Nigeria. The panel draws a negative inference regarding the claimant's name on the documents.\n[96] The claimant also proffered three Registrations of Birth78 in support of her identity. In all three, the name of the claimant was written as XXXX XXXX XXXX instead of XXXX XXXX XXXX. The panel draws a negative inference regarding the claimant's name on these documents.\n[97] The documentary evidence79 indicates the following,\nNigeria is a highly bureaucratic society where citizens are required to obtain and routinely produce a variety of official documents. These are often in the form of paper originals that are signed\/stamped by local government and other officials. Because these documents typically lack basic security features (e.g. watermarking), they are easily forged. Because of the high prevalence of official corruption, however, it is also possible to fraudulently obtain genuine documents in exchange for a bribe. This makes it difficult to determine the authenticity of a specific document.\nAccording to sources, documentation fraud is highly prevalent in Nigeria. ...that document fraud can occur through the falsification of an entire document; the partial falsification of a document; the use of false information to obtain genuine documents; impersonation, where one person assumes the identity of another (deceased or alive; with or without the person's consent); and renting out documents to someone else.\n[98] The panel is mindful of documentation fraud in Nigeria, therefore, the panel does not assign any probative value to these documents given that there are different spelling of the claimant's name. Furthermore, it is reasonable for all CB to have both stamps, while one is missing a stamp, as they were issued on the same form and by the same agency.\n[99] There were no copies of the identity cards of the claimant's alleged children proffered. It is reasonable to expect that such documents would be available and accessible to the claimant to have accompanied the Certificates of Birth, and Registrations of Birth when it was mailed by DHL80 to Canada.\n[100] Therefore, the panel finds that these documents are not reliable sources to make a determination regarding the claimant's identity and citizenship.\nAffidavits\n[101] The claimant, in support of her identity, proffered four affidavits.\n[102] Affidavit of XXXX XXXX XXXX,81 alleges to be the claimant's sister. However, the affidavit does not provide any tomb stone data of the claimant. Furthermore, there is no evidence regarding the authors or the claimant's citizenship. The panel acknowledges that the author resides in Port Harcourt, River State, Nigeria, however, there is no evidence before it that she is a citizen of Nigeria, absent a copy of her pictured identity card which is available and accessible to the claimant.\n[103] Affidavit of XXXX XXXX,82 alleges to be the claimant's son. However, the affidavit does not provide any tomb stone data of the claimant. Furthermore, there is no evidence regarding the authors or the claimant's citizenship. Additionally, the street name on the affidavit is the same as the claimant's Voter's ID Card. Having found that the claimant's ID card is fraudulent, no probative value is assigned to the affidavit.\n[104] Affidavit from XXXX XXXX,83 alleges to be the claimant's brother. He provides information regarding the claimant referring to the claimant's registry of birth. Having found earlier that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant's Registration of Birth is a fraudulent document, no probative value is assigned to this affidavit.\n[105] Affidavit of the XXXX XXXX,84 alleges that he is the pastor of the church the claimant attended in Nigeria. He states that he knows the claimant and is aware of her marital problems, however, it makes no reference to the claimant's citizenship or residence address in Nigeria, the information required to make a finding of the claimant's identity and citizenship.\n[106] As noted above, the panel is mindful of documentation fraud in Nigeria, therefore, the panel does not assign any probative value to the four affidavits. Which were not accompanied by any picture ID documents to establish the identity and citizenship of the authors. It is reasonable to expect that such documents would be available and accessible to the claimant to have accompanied the Certificates of Birth, and Registrations of Birth when it was mailed by DHL to Canada.\n[107] Therefore, the panel finds these affidavits are not reliable sources to make a determination regarding the claimant's identity and citizenship.\n[108] Furthermore, the mere fact that all these documents were mailed via DHL from Nigeria, does not substantiate that the claimant is from Nigeria, or is a citizen of Nigeria.\nKnowledge\n[109] Claimant's knowledge of Nigeria was limited. She testified that Nigeria had 55 states, which is contrary to the documentary evidence indicating that it has 36 states.85 She further described the area she lived was in the bush, and that Lagos was a large city. Given the claimant's limited education, and the doctors' reports, the panel cannot base an identity finding based on her limited knowledge of Nigeria.\nLanguage\n[110] The panel notes that the claimant had knowledge of the English language. During the hearing, at times, she replied and provided her evidence in the English language. The panel also notes, that an Igbo interpreter was present at the hearing and the claimant provided her testimony in the Igbo language. However, the panel finds that the ability to communicate in the Igbo language is insufficient to make a finding that the claimant is from Nigeria, noting that Igbo is also spoken in, Equatorial Guinea [west coast of Central Africa], Sierra Leone [southwest coast of West Africa] and Ghana [West Africa]\".86\nCONCLUSION\n[111] Having considered the totality of the evidence, the panel finds the claimant has failed to provide sufficient credible trustworthy evidence to establish her identity and citizenship. Given that the identity of the claimant, including nationality, has not been established, the panel will not analyze the merits of the claim.\nDECISION\n[112] The panel, therefore, finds that the claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX is neither a Convention refugee under section 96, nor a person in need of protection under subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\n[113] The claim is therefore rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Fahimeh Mortazavi\"\nFahimeh Mortazavi\nMay 29, 2019\nDate\n1 Exhibit 2, PIF, at p. 2, question 1(g).\n2 Ibid, question 1(h).\n3 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n4 Exhibit 9.\n5 Refugee Protection Division Rules, SOR\/2012-256.\n6 Exhibit 14, Application for recusal.\n7 Exhibit 14, cover sheet.\n8 Exhibit 14, at p. 1.\n9 Ibid.\n10 Committee for Justice and Liberty et al. v.

The claimant is a citizen of Cuba and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The facts and events alleged in support of the claim are set out in the claimant's respective Basis of Claim (BOC) form. In summary, the claimant alleges persecution in Cuba on the basis of his perceived political opinion. The claimant alleges that he is being targeted by the police and Committee for the Defence of the Revolution (\"CDR\") for his lifestyle.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] The panel finds that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee within the meaning of section 96 of the IRPA, nor is the claimant in need of protection within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\nDETERMINATIVE ISSUES\n[4] The determinative issue is the failure of the evidence to establish that the treatment suffered by the claimant amounts to persecution.\nANALYSIS\n[5] In making this assessment, the panel considered all of the evidence including the oral testimony, the documentary evidence, and counsel submissions.\nIDENTITY\n[6] The claimant's identity was established as a citizen of Cuba through the certified true copy of his Cuba-issued identification card and certified true copy of the birth certificate which were seized1 by CBSA. Therefore, the RPD is satisfied that the claimant has met his burden and established his identity.\nTreatment Suffered Does Not Amount to Persecution\n[7] For treatment to amount to persecution, it must be \"sustained or systemic violation of basic human rights demonstrative of a failure of state protection.\"2\n[8] The claimant states that he was subject to harassment and intimidation from the police and CDR. On a forward-looking basis, the claimant fears that upon return he would not be given an opportunity to work and would be persecuted and jailed.\n[9] The panel finds that the treatment suffered in Cuba, viewed individually or cumulatively, does not amount to persecution because it is not sustained or systemic violation of basic human rights. The panel also finds that there is insufficient evidence, from the male claimant's personal circumstances or the objective documentary evidence, to establish a serious possibility that in the future he would be jailed or subjected to other treatment amounting to persecution.\nHarassment and Intimidation from Police and CDR\n[10] The male claimant testified that problems with the police started around XXXX 2016. The claimant was working at a XXXX where his job consisted of working at a XXXX and XXXX XXXXand supplies, including XXXX and related products for the XXXX. The claimant was transporting the XXXX in a truck with another man who was the driver when they were stopped by police. The claimant indicated that receipts had to be kept for all products under Cuban regulations in case of inspection by a company auditor or police. The claimant testified that because XXXX is scarce in Cuba, any orders of XXXX and products given to XXXX are always checked in case any products are sold on the black market. The claimant indicated that it was routine and he had been stopped several times by police before, but on this occasion, he did not recognize the police officers. The claimant indicated that the police officers made them wait for an hour as they inspected the receipts. The claimant was told to sit in the patrol car while he waited. The claimant indicated that even though the products were all accounted for, he and the driver were brought to the police station where the police contacted their employer to verify that they worked for the XXXX. When the employer confirmed their employment, the claimant and the driver were released without any charges.\n[11] The claimant testified that before he was released, one of the police officers told him they were going to keep an eye on him because they did not like the way he dressed. The claimant indicated that the average Cuban citizen could not get the running shoes, clothes, watches, or chains (jewellery) like he had and that people who dressed like him are looked down upon by society. The claimant insinuated that his lifestyle could be seen as anti-Communist. The claimant indicated he told the officer that the items were given to him by his sister in Canada. The claimant has a sister who lives in Canada that often visits him and his family in Cuba. The claimant testified that his sister buys his family appliances and nice clothes and accessories. The claimant provided photographs of him out with friends and inside his house showing some of the clothes and items he owned.3 The panel finds that the photographs are not dated or time stamped and are not conclusive that the claimant necessarily dressed or acted differently than the average, young male Cuban citizen.\n[12] The claimant testified that about XXXX XXXX after the XXXX truck incident, two police officers showed up at his house with the woman in charge of the CDR and the neighbourhood leader responsible for keeping an eye on residents in the area. The claimant only knew the woman from the CDR by her first name, \"O,\" and the neighbourhood leader's first name as \"R.\" The claimant lives in the house with his mother. The claimant indicated that the two officers with O and R checked the electrical appliances in the house and the claimant's clothes. The group checked receipts for the items and asked where the claimant got such items. The claimant indicated that his sister and her husband from Canada have business in Cuba and travelled to the country many times and bought the items for him and his family. The claimant testified that the group insinuated that he was selling merchandise on the black market, which the claimant denied. The claimant testified that the group told him that he could be accused with enemy propaganda. After they checked the receipts, the group left his house but told the claimant they would be keeping an eye on him. The claimant indicated he was not given any paperwork regarding the inspection or any further notices when they left.\n[13] The claimant described a second time when two police appeared at his house around XXXX 2016. The claimant testified that one of the officers handcuffed him and began checking everything in his house. The claimant and his mother were told that \"O\" from the CDR had told the police she saw a truck stopped in front of their house which unloaded boxes into the house. The claimant indicated the police also questioned his mother about the boxes, to which they both denied a truck unloading anything to the house. The claimant indicated that after the police checked the items in the house, including the refrigerator for any XXXX, the police left. The claimant indicated they were not charged with anything, but the police told him again that they would continue to keep an eye on him. The claimant indicated that the police did not confiscate any items from his house or any of his clothes.\n[14] The claimant testified that apart from the two inspections at his house, he was often stopped by police on the streets and questioned, particularly when delivering goods for the XXXX. The claimant suspected that the way he dressed caught the police's attention and he was also targeted because of his age. The claimant testified that the police often target young men as they suspect increased criminality amongst that population. The claimant testified that he was often with his friend \"E\" when they were stopped by police. The claimant indicated \"E\" on many occasions accompanied him to the store to purchase items for the XXXX and police would stop them to search their bags. The claimant's friend provided a letter that indicated he was with the claimant when they would get stopped by police to search his bags and check receipts.4 The panel accepts that the police did stop the claimant to check items he had with him when delivering goods.\n[15] The claimant was asked if he did not wear the clothes that his sister bought him when he went out, would he still be stopped by police. The claimant responded that he would still be stopped by police because of his job. The claimant testified that people who worked in XXXX and the XXXX like him are constantly stopped by police to check if the merchandise is legal and not being sold on the black market. The claimant testified that his mother also worked for the XXXX and she had also been stopped over the years, but to a lesser extent. The claimant indicated that the police do not harass the older people as much as the younger ones.\n[16] Based on the claimant's testimony, the panel finds that he was subjected to police stops and inspections due to the nature of his job. The panel accepts that the claimant was likely further scrutinized and harassed by police due to the way he dressed. However, the panel does not find that such instances amount to persecution. As the claimant testified, it was common for police in Cuba to do inspections for this group of workers due to possible sales of the products on the black market. The panel finds that if the police were indeed concerned with the claimant or wanted to charge him or penalize him, they had multiple opportunities to do so through their interactions. The panel finds that the police not pursuing the matter any further than stopping the claimant or his friend for questioning indicates that the police are not motivated to charge or arrest the claimant or his acquaintances.\n[17] Based on the claimant's testimony, the panel finds that there is no indication that the police or CDR ever escalated their treatment of the claimant beyond the verbal warning stage. The panel acknowledges that the claimant had to go to the police station with the truck driver in XXXX 2016 before they were released and that the claimant was handcuffed in his house as the police searched through his belongings around XXXX 2016. There is no evidence to indicate that the claimant, or any of his family members, were physically assaulted, arrested, jailed, prosecuted, or subject to any other form of punishment except for increased scrutiny. At best, the police harassment and societal admonition can be said to be an attempt to restrict the male claimant's right to dress as he pleases and by extension, his political opinion for not being in line with Communist standards of living. However, the fact that the male claimant along with other Cuban citizens suffers curtailment of their freedom of speech and expression does not, in itself, amount to persecution.5\nPersecution upon Return to Cuba\n[18] The claimant also alleges that he would be persecuted should he return to Cuba for illegally exiting the country. The claimant testified that after he left Cuba, the CDR and police came to his house about two times asking about his whereabouts. The claimant indicated that the CDR often goes around the neighbourhood to check up on the residents and if someone does not show up for work, they investigate into the matter.\n[19] The claimant indicated that during the first time, his mother told them she did not know where he went because he had not told her he fled to the USA. The claimant indicated that on the second occasion that the CDR and police visited his mother, he had told her that he arrived safely in the USA and his mother did tell the police that the claimant had left the country about XXXX XXXX or XXXX after the claimant had left. The claimant testified that the police did not come back again after the second visit to his mother. The claimant did not indicate that his mother faced any repercussions or charges for the claimant's actions in leaving the country. The panel notes that the claimant's mother provided a letter in support of the claimant's claim but did not mention any follow-up by police or CDR regarding the claimant's whereabouts.6 The panel finds that the police and CDR have not been actively looking for the claimant.\nFleeing Cuba by Boat\n[20] The claimant testified that he left Cuba with a group of around XXXX people by boat. The claimant indicated that the group supplied the boat and he helped with the XXXX and XXXX. The claimant testified that they landed in Mexico before making their way over land to the United States. The claimant then came into Canada through the United States. The claimant indicated he could not return to Cuba because he had fled Cuba by way of a boat that the group had built, which are both illegal, and he would be arrested upon his return to Cuba for leaving the country illegally and that he would also be denied an ability to work in Cuba again.\nOBJECTIVE EVIDENCE\n[21] The National Documentation Package for Cuba does include information on what is likely to happen to those that travel outside Cuba illegally and return.\n[22] The panel finds that travelling by sea to Mexico is not uncommon for Cubans leaving the country towards the United States. The National Documentation Package for Cuba includes information on the different migration routes which Cubans have historically taken to the United States:\n...In January 2013, the Cuban government abolished their exit permit requirement, opening the way for many Cubans to apply for passports and making the land route even easier. Most Cubans start their journey in Ecuador, a country that only cancelled visa-free access for Cubans in December 2015. From Ecuador, migrants can hire a car, take a bus or risk the perilous speedboat Darien Gap crossing between Colombia and Panama. Others take a more direct route, attempting to enter any part of Mexican territory by sea. Those with connections or money can obtain a Mexican visa at the consulate in Havana, either as tourists, with work permits or via arranged marriages.7\n[23] The Cuba NDP also talks about leaving the country by boat:\nDespite recent changes in Cuba's migration laws, which partially eliminated the requirement for authorization to leave the country, Decree 194 of 1999 still makes it an administrative offence punishable with a fine to try and leave by boat, or to be involved in the construction of a boat, among other things.\n...In practice, it is at the discretion of law enforcement officials whether and how a range of laws are applied to those intercepted trying to leave the country by boat.8\n[24] The panel finds that the claimant was never intercepted leaving Cuba by boat, nor was there evidence presented that the claimant helped build the boat. The panel was also not presented with evidence as to how police or state authorities would even find out that a boat was built by the group that the claimant travelled with. The panel finds that based on the objective evidence, the claimant may be subjected to a fine or other punishment at the discretion of law enforcement officials should he have been intercepted leaving the country by boat. The panel does not find that there is evidence to show that the claimant built a boat with a group of people or that the authorities would be able to find out the exact way the claimant left the country should he return.\nNo Serious Possibility of Forward-looking Persecution\n[25] The male claimant fears that he would face persecution if returned to Cuba because he has left the country illegally. The panel finds that this is not objectively indicated by the documentary evidence. There is insufficient evidence to indicate that the claimant is at risk solely by virtue of his return and failed refugee claim. The Board's own documentation contains research regarding the risk to returning refugee claimants:\nWhat happens to failed asylum seekers in Cuba after they return depends upon what they did before they left [Cuba]. If they were good citizens before they left, very little if anything is done to them. However, if for example the asylum seeker was wanted for a felony in Cuba before they left[,] it is certain that they will be arrested and dealt with accordingly.9\n[26] The panel finds that the claimant may not be seen as a \"good citizen\" by police or the CDR due his lifestyle and by extension, his possible perceived political opinion against the government for not living in accordance to the standards of the average citizen of Cuba. However, there is no evidence that the claimant is wanted for a felony in Cuba. Based on the claimant's testimony, he was never arrested or charged with any crimes or punished by police or state authorities for the way he dressed or for the appliances and goods he had at home. The panel also did not see evidence of the claimant's mother being subjected to any charges or detainment, even though they both shared the house and the claimant's sister bought items for the family. Based on the past treatment he received in Cuba and the demonstrably low level of state interest in him, the panel finds the claimant is still much closer to the \"good citizen\" end of the spectrum.\n[27] Accordingly, the panel finds that while there is a mere possibility that the male claimant would be persecuted due to his exit from Cuba and failed refugee claim in Canada, there is insufficient evidence to establish a serious possibility of persecution.\nAbility to Work after Return to Cuba\n[28] The claimant also testified that he would not be able to obtain employment in Cuba if he returned. Severe restrictions on the right to earn a livelihood and systematic governmental interference with the opportunity to find work may, in some circumstances, amount to persecution.10 However, in this case, the panel finds that the claimant has not provided sufficient evidence that he would not be able to obtain a job upon return to Cuba. The claimant was working up until he left Cuba and even obtained a letter from his employer after he arrived in Canada attesting to his position and length of employment at the XXXX.11 The claimant testified that his mother also worked at the same XXXX and had done so for around 35 years. The panel notes that the claimant's mother is still living in Cuba in the same house and is also working at the same XXXX.\n[29] The panel did not see evidence of the claimant's mother being punished by the state for the actions of the claimant leaving Cuba despite the claimant's testimony that his mother had told authorities he left the country. The panel finds that the claimant's allegations that he would be denied a job if he returned to Cuba to be speculative. The panel does not find there was sufficient evidence to show that the claimant is still wanted by police or state authorities and would not face a serious possibility of risk upon his return to Cuba.\nCONCLUSION\n[30] Having considered all of the evidence and based on the above analysis, the panel finds that the claimant is not a Convention refugee. For the same reasons, the allegations do not give rise to a claim under section 97(1) of the IRPA. The panel concludes that the claimant is not a person in need of protection.\n[31] Accordingly, the panel finds that the claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution in Cuba or, on a balance of probabilities, that he would be subjected to a risk to his life, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture.\n[32] Therefore, the panel rejects his claim.\n(signed)\n\"S.

They allege their home was targeted and destroyed by ISIS and that he is on a to-be-killed list, and fear for their safety should they return to Iraq.\nANALYSIS\n[4] The main issues in the claim were credibility and internal flight alternative. The panel finds the claimants have not established with credible evidence that they were living in Mosul and targeted by ISIS as alleged, and that they have an internal flight alternative in Erbil. As noted by counsel for the claimants, the panel considered the Gender Guidelines in this case. In this case, the panel found that the claimants were not credible in their allegation to have lived in Mosul during ISIS's presence in the city, and are not targeted or at risk of gender-related violence from ISIS as alleged.\nCredibility\nOriginal allegations and testimony\n[5] The claimants' original BOCs stated that they lived and worked in Mosul during the period they lived in Iraq and during ISIS's control of that city, stating they \"moved to different parts of Mosul because relocating to another city was not possible\". As part of the screening process for the claim, the claimant was requested to provide copies of their U.S.A. visa applications and the Minister was notified of concerns raised by information in the intake forms that suggested that the adult claimants were working in Erbil, in the Kurdistan Region, during this period.\n[6] The claimants subsequently amended their Basis of Claim formsii by providing a new narrative, in which the adult claimants state that they did work in XXXX in Erbil from 2015 to 2017, in addition to having attended schooling and internships in the region previously. They allege they were not entitled to purchase or own property in Erbil or the KRI as they allege they are Arabs, not Kurds. They were advised in 2015 that the male claimant's name was on the so-called \"to be killed\" list posted in a Mosque in Mosul. He added that he travelled to Jordan in XXXX 2016 to try to get employment or residency there, and returned to Mosul in order to process the passports of the children. He stated that while waiting for the passports, he learned he could obtain a U.S.A. visa and come to Canada where they have family to seek protection, and so did so.\n[7] In testimony, the claimants confirmed and clarified that the adult male claimant had been born in Erbil and the other family members were born in Mosul, and they were married in Mosul. The adult male claimant stated he had worked at a XXXX in Erbil from XXXX 2015, and did not have other jobs during that time. He stated that the principal claimant also started working at a different XXXX in Erbil at the same time. He stated that he had worked at a XXXX and XXXX XXXX in Mosul prior to this, and the principal claimant had worked at the same Mosul XXXX. Documents provided show the claimants held permanent, full-time work and Ministry of Health cards to work in Kurdistan Regioniii.\n[8] The claimant alleged in testimony that he had lived in a home in Mosul until 2015, after which he lived in another location for approximately one year and four months, and then a third location in Mosul for two months before leaving the country in XXXX 2017. They stated they travelled back and forth to Erbil for work and other reasons during this time.\nU.S.A. visa application\n[9] The claimants applied for U.S.A. visas in XXXX 2017iv. On those applications, they stated that they were living in Erbil, and provided an address. When asked about this, they stated that they provided an address of a XXXX who offered to help them, and used a false address because they did not believe they would be approved as Arabs from Mosul.\n[10] While the claimants' counsel rightly points out that persons may have to lie on such applications in order to obtain safety, in this case there are many other reasons to support a finding that, rather than being untruthful on their visa applications regarding their residence, the claimants are being untruthful in their refugee claim. As the visa application information is broadly consistent with numerous other documents and given the other concerns noted below, the panel is of the opinion that the claimants likely did live in Erbil as stated on their visa applications, not Mosul as alleged. The below-noted examples of these documents and concerns are non-exhaustive, given the many identified issues in the hearing.\nExplanation for travel to and from Erbil for work and school\n[11] The claimants allege that, following a loss of their jobs and home in 2015, the claimants moved to another location in Mosul city and obtained jobs in Erbil. They allege they remained living in Mosul until 2017. Initially the principal claimant stated they were in Mosul during this period except when they would go to Erbil for work. When asked about how he was able to do this, he stated he was going to Erbil for two days, then would return to Mosul, where he would rarely leave the home.\n[12] He was asked how he was able to actually get between Erbil and Mosul, given the activities of ISIS in the area and the ongoing war, and he stated that it was possible to take one road when there were no problems, then another road another time where there were no problems, and that professional drivers knew which roads they could take. He stated that he would travel this way approximately four times per month for two years. He further stated that the children also drove to Erbil to take exams for school, as he was tutoring them at home in Mosul and they were permitted to take the examinations in Erbil. When asked how many times the children travelled to Erbil, he stated that the children went with the parents most times when they were travelling to Erbil for work, except when they did not have school.\n[13] The panel finds it strains credulity that the claimants would have travelled back and forth from Mosul to Erbil for two years, during the height of ISIS activities and control of Mosul, in this manner. The panel notes that during this period of time, there was active conflict between ISIS and security forces based out of Erbil, and ISIS was known for their brutal treatment of the local populations under their control. The deployment of mines, improvised explosive devises, suicide bombers, and other weapons of war and control were used to enact violence on a widespread scale by ISISv. It would be, in such a context, exceedingly unlikely that it would be a simple matter of knowing a driver who knew the right road to take in order to travel back and forth between the two cities.\n[14] Further, the claimants allege that, during this period, they had been personally targeted by ISIS, in that their home was destroyed and the adult male claimant was put on a to-be-killed list. When asked why they would continuously return to a city under the control of a group who had so-targeted them, the male claimant first stated that for the female claimant as a Sunni Arab, she had no problem entering Mosul, and that it was only the male adult claimant that was afraid. The panel rejects this explanation - the female claimant and children were also at risk in ISIS territory, given the targeting of the home and the types of actions they took against many civilians in their territories. It is unlikely that a female XXXX married to a Shia man who was travelling back and forth to territory controlled by opposing forces would have been safe entering ISIS territory simply because she was Sunni.\n[15] The claimant then stated that he was hiding his driver's licence, which was the only identification he held that showed his tribal name, the name which showed him to be Shia. The panel has numerous concerns regarding this licencevi, but particularly notes that, despite stating he had to hide this from view, the licence he presented in the claim was issued to him in Mosul in XXXX 2015. He stated that he did not use this licence, and renewed it because one might get a large fine if driving without it. However, in Mosul there were no traffic police to ask for the licence, so did not carry it. It beggars belief that the claimant would have renewed his driving licence in Mosul in XXXX 2015, after ISIS held control of the city, when this is the only document that allegedly has information that would show his Shia background, particularly as he was not using it during this period. In addition to the general credibility concerns raised by this, the panel notes this renders unreliable the only document that the claimant provided that supports his association with a Shia tribe as alleged. The panel rejects the claimant's explanation that he was safely able to navigate back and forth into Mosul because he was hiding a licence that in fact was issued in Mosul during the period of ISIS rule.\n[16] Finally, the adult male claimant stated that they were treated badly and felt unwelcome in Erbil as Arabs. He stated they would need a sponsor to stay, and if they lost their jobs they would have to leave the city. He stated it was hard to get a private residence, and that Arabs have different licence plate numbers. He further stated that Erbil was not safe also, noting explosions in the city. The panel rejects this explanation. While some of the above-noted may be accurate, these issues pale in comparison to what the claimants stated they faced in Mosul at the hands of ISIS - the destruction of their home and being marked and targeted for death.\n[17] When pressed on this significant issue, the adult male claimant suggested that, while ISIS was in control in Mosul, they were not seen in the street. He also expressed that it was possible during this time to move around and go to Erbil. He also suggested that while he was in hiding, he preferred to be in hiding in his city, and that their ultimate goal was to leave Iraq entirely, not relocate to Erbil. The panel finds the description of life under ISIS control provided by the claimant, where one who has specifically been put on a to-kill-list by them and is living in an area they control, and yet is able to move in and out of their territory and live in \"hiding\" while in their territory is inconsistent with the country documentation regarding the brutality and control enacted by ISIS in areas under their control. This included the ability and willingness to enact what has been called a genocide against Yazidis, Christians and Shias living in areas they controlledvii. It is simply completely unbelievable that a person who has been marked as a Shia would return to a territory where Shias are being subject to atrocities described as genocidal simply for the reasons given by the claimant.\n[18] The panel further notes that the claimants stated in their visa applications that they had been working in Erbil at the XXXX since 2011, not 2015 as stated. They provided no documentary evidence to establish the length of their work, such as contracts or letters of employment. The documents relating to work in Mosul were dated or did not clearly support their continued employment there until 2015. Given all of the issues above, the panel finds it unlikely that the claimants started working in 2015 as alleged, but rather were working (and likely living) in Erbil prior to 2015 as alleged.\n[19] The panel finds the claimants' allegations to have been living as targeted individuals in Mosul from 2015-2017 to be not credible.\nIdentity cards\n[20] The principal claimant obtained a new National Identity Card in 2016viii. The card indicates it was issued in Mosul. The claimant was asked about why he obtained a new card at this time, and he hesitated before responding that the prior card had expired. He was asked how he had obtained the new card and he stated he went to the civil status office in Mosul. When the panel asked if this office was functional during ISIS control of the city, the principal claimant stated that in fact it was issued in a small city outside of Mosul that remained in government control. The panel would have expected the claimant to provide that detail spontaneously, had this been the case, when asked about where and how he obtained this new card. The panel finds his hesitant answer that lacked detail consistent with a broader pattern of a lack of credible evidence regarding his association with Mosul during this period. Given these cards are widely available in false and fraudulent mannersix and the above-noted problems, the panel finds this document fails to establish a connection to Mosul during the above-noted period as alleged.\nAdult claimants' passports\n[21] The panel noted that the adult claimants' passports were issued in Erbil in 2012x. When asked about why this was done in Erbil, rather than Mosul, he stated that it was because of his family register being in Erbil. The panel then noted that the claimant had actually provided his father's family register, and that it says they were registered in Mosul. So he was asked again why his passport was issued in Erbil in 2012, at which time he stated that passport and other government departments were being targeted in Mosul, so he was afraid to go to the office there. The panel finds that the claimant's evolving testimony about why he was being issued a passport in Erbil in 2012 further undermines the credibility of his allegations regarding the claimants' connections to Erbil and Mosul and his general credibility.\nInvestigative court complaint\n[22] The adult male claimant provided a document related to making a complaint with an investigative judge related to his house that he states was destroyed by ISISxi. When asked what evidence was required to support the application, he stated just their own statements and the statement of a person from the area. These statements provided did not include any dates of when the destruction of his property occurred other than \"2015\", and were done shortly before they left Iraq. When asked about the purpose of making such a complaint just before leaving the country, the claimant stated it was so they may someday make a request for compensation. He had not followed up as of the date of the claim. Given the significant credibility issues in this claim, the fact that the preponderance of the evidence in support of this complaint came from the claimants themselves or someone described as a friend of the male claimant, and the timing of the claim days before leaving in order to seek protection, the panel finds it cannot believe the claimant's statements that these were produced for the purpose of future compensation rather than to support an otherwise false refugee claim. Furthermore, even if the documents are accurate, they do not establish when or why the home was destroyed nor that the claimants were living in the home. Given the widespread destruction in Mosul, the panel finds the claimants owning property effective by the conflict insufficient to establish a forward-looking risk should they return to Iraq.\nChildrens' school in Erbil\n[23] At the first hearing, the claimants alleged that the children went to school for exams in Erbil, and that the principal claimant home-schooled them in Mosul. Between the first and second sitting, they were able to produce school recordsxii. These school records do not state or support that it was only exams that were done at the schools, but instead appear as regular yearly school reporting. In addition, the panel noted that one of the claimants had records from a different school. When asked why, the adult male claimant stated that he was evaluated and able to go to a higher, elite school. The claimant was asked to explain why they would do this if he was not actually attending this elite school, to which the claimant stated it was to show proof they were in school in order to be able to leave Iraq. The panel rejects this explanation. If the purpose of the registration was only to take exams and support an exit from the country, it remains unclear how applying and registering in a more elite school achieves this goal. The panel finds it far more likely, particularly given the other evidence noted above, that the claimants have records of their children attending school in Erbil because they attended school while living in Erbil.\nAttempts to exit and returns to Iraq\n[24] The panel finally notes that both adult claimants left Iraq entirely during the period they state they were living in fear of ISIS in Mosul, to Jordan and Turkey. The panel finds it unlikely that, had they faced the threats alleged at the hands of ISIS in Mosul, it is unlikely they would have returned to Iraq. The panel notes the claimants stated these trips were related to larger attempts to leave Iraq that included seeking out educational opportunities in other countries. In provided records of these attempts, the panel notes again that the claimants stated they were living in Erbil, not Mosul. The panel finds the claimants' actions suggest they were living in Erbil seeking to migrate, rather than living in Mosul seeking safety.\nConclusion - Credibility\n[25] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel finds the claimants not to be credible witnesses, given their inconsistent, evolving, and at times hesitant testimony, the incredible allegation that they continuously travelled back and forth between Mosul and Erbil for two years prior to leaving Iraq, and the other issues noted above. The panel finds the claimants have failed to establish with credible evidence that they were living in Mosul and targeted by ISIS as alleged, but rather finds that the preponderance of evidence suggests that they had, at some time prior to the alleged events, relocated to Erbil, found work, put their children in schools, and were not targeted by nor are they currently at risk of harm from ISIS or requiring of international protection as alleged.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[26] The panel above noted that the claimants had likely relocated themselves to Erbil at an unknown time, where the adult claimants had previously (or continuously) had significant professional and scholarly experience and where the principal claimant was born. The panel finds that their ability to move to Erbil, find work as XXXX XXXX, put their children in schools, and leave and re-enter supports that they are both reasonably able to live in the city and are safe when doing so.\nAbility to live in Erbil\n[27] While the claimants have suggested they would be unable to obtain residency in the Kurdistan region, their own experience belies this. Their incredible testimony about continuing to live in Mosul has precluded the panel from obtaining detailed information about how the claimants were able to live in Erbil during this time, such that it could find that this option is no longer available to them.\n[28] Further, the panel notes that the adult male claimant was born in Erbil. While he states he is Shia Arab, the evidence that would support this allegation is his own testimony which has been found to lack credibility and a driver's licence that cannot be relied upon which includes a Shia-Arab tribal name. The panel noted above its concerns related to the reliability of this document. The panel is not satisfied that the claimant is not, in fact, Kurdish, as he was born in Erbil, attended school there, has worked in the region and speaks the language. At the very least, the panel finds that these personal aspects of his history suggest he is able to enter and remain in the region with his family. The claimant himself suggested in writing and in testimony that access to the region is facilitated by his place of birth being Erbil.\n[29] The panel acknowledges that there are restrictions on residence and working in Erbilxiii, but finds in the claimants' circumstances, where both adults have extensive work experience as XXXX in XXXX XXXX, the children have attended schools, and the adult male claimant was born in the region, they are likely to be able to meet the requirements of residency (as they likely have in the past). In other words, their extensive and personal history in the region suggests they would have the ability to fulfill the requirements of residency, such as obtaining government employment, engaging locals to sponsor their residency or having significant personal connections such as having been born in the region. The evidence does not suggest that this ability would not pass to their children, including the adult child of the principal claimant. The panel finds that, given the significant credibility concerns in this case, it is unwilling to accept the claimants' testimony and evidence that they would be unable to reside in the KRI, and instead prefers the evidence that establishes a lengthy and significant personal history in the region and an ability to work and live legally and continuously in the region as evidence of the likelihood they could continue to do so should they return.\nOther issues regarding reasonableness\n[30] The panel notes the counsel's submission and evidence regarding the difficulties for internally displaced persons in the KRI, but finds that these claimants can be distinguished from these reports. The panel finds that, given their ability to work as XXXX XXXX in the region, access to English-language education, abilities in the Kurdish language (that range from significant to limited, according to their testimony), and broader experiences within the region, it is likely that should they return to Erbil they would face similar treatment to that which they encountered in the region prior to leaving Iraq, circumstances which do not support a finding that such relocation would be unreasonable.\nConsideration of risk in KRI\n[31] With regard to the concerns related to discrimination and maltreatment of Arabs, the panel notes that in this case, the claimants have extensive history in the region, including prior to ISIS being in the area, such that it is unlikely they would be seen in a similar light to Arab persons otherwise displaced by ISIS and subjected to suspicions and potential mal-treatment as a result. Such perceived affiliation to ISIS forms the basis for the preponderance of reported serious harm experienced by Arabs in the region. The adult claimants allegedly exited and entered the region without difficulty at the port of entry when travelling internationally. There is no indication that authorities or others held any concerns related to their involvement with or alignment with ISIS or central government forces during their lengthy studies or work in the region, such that they would be subject to maltreatment as a result. On the contrary, both adult claimants were employed by the XXXX XXXX XXXX as XXXX XXXX during the height of the ISIS conflict. While they may encounter some discrimination, the evidence does not support that the discrimination they have or would experience would result in them experiencing serious harm amounting to persecution.\n[32] The documentary evidence does not support that ISIS currently has any significant presence or control in Erbil. The preponderance of the objective evidence indicates that the KRG and its security forces are steadfast in combatting ISIS and have proven effective in preventing ISIS from significantly infiltrating into Erbil. The panel distinguishes the documentation referenced by the claimants' counsel, as this speaks to the situation \"along defensive lines\", not in the city itself. The panel notes that other documentary evidence supports that security services have been able to provide a level of safety in the KRI and Erbil in particular that is not enjoyed in other areas of Iraq. For example, a response to information request statesxiv:\nSeveral sources describe the current security situation in the city of Erbil as \"safe\" (Project Consultant 24 Jan. 2016; KRG 21 Jan. 2016; US 19 Jan. 2016). In a telephone interview with the Research Directorate, an official from the US Department of State who specializes in security in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq reported that \"most people enjoy a normal day; they go to work, go shopping and go out at night\" (ibid.). According to the same source, no major incident occurred in 2015 apart from the 17 April attack (see section 2) (ibid.). Similarly, in correspondence with the Research Directorate, a research fellow at the French Institute of the Near East (Institut fran\u00e7ais du Proche-Orient, Ifpo) in Erbil [1], who has published several articles on the history of the Kurdish people, reported that [translation] \"few violent incidents occurred in 2015\" (research fellow 19 Jan. 2016). On its \"Iraq Travel Warning\" webpage, the US Department of State indicates that \"[t]errorist attacks within the Iraqi Kurdistan Region (IKR) occur less frequently than in other parts of Iraq\" (US 4 Dec. 2015)\n[33] The panel finds the evidence does not support that the claimants would be likely to face treatment in Erbil as Arabs that would result in it either being unreasonable for them to live there, nor that would result in them facing a lack of safety. The evidence does not support a finding that they face a serious possibility of persecution, or a risk to their lives, risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture, on a balance of probabilities, in Erbil. As such, the panel finds the claimants have access to an internal flight alternative in Erbil.\nCONCLUSION\n[34] For the above-noted reasons, the panel finds the claimants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. The do not face a serious possibility of persecution, nor do they face a risk to their lives, risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture. The claims are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"K. Pike\"\nK.

She reports lifelong discrimination due to her ethnicity. She also reports that police officers in Bulgaria have threatened to force her into prostitution.\n[2] The panel finds that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor is she a person in need of protection. The determinative issue is credibility, primarily on the issue of her Roma ethnicity.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[3] A certified copy of the claimant's current Bulgarian passport was included with the referral.3 The panel finds this is sufficient to establish the claimant's identity and nationality.\nCredibility\n[4] The onus is on the person making a refugee claim to present evidence that is credible, on a balance of probabilities, to support the allegations which form the basis of their claim. In this case the Panel finds that the claimant has not met that onus.\n[5] While statements given under oath are presumed to be true, that presumption can be rebutted by contradictions or inconsistencies in the evidence.4 This basic statement of trite law has been clarified and modified in the almost 40 years since the Moldonado decision, from which it is taken, was first released. Later decisions have clarified this statement, saying that in reviewing the evidence, the panel \"may also conclude that a claimant's evidence is implausible, or improbable, or dubious, or untenable, or unreliable, or absurd, or unconvincing.\"5 The panel \"also is entitled, in assessing credibility, to rely on criteria such as rationality and common sense.\"6 A more recent decision from the Federal Court addresses further the effect of the Moldonado decision forty years on stating that the Maldonado decision has been tempered considerably since first issued in 1980 and no longer applies to corroborating evidence, as it is a circular proposition. In addition, corroboration is required to enhance the weight of evidence when the narrative raises questions of improbability and the applicant's self-interest reduces its probative value. Moreover, the Maldonado line of jurisprudence does not apply to evidence arising and available in Canada, as opposed to originating in foreign jurisdictions. For such evidence, it is expected that the party will adhere to Canada's high standards of bringing forward all the best possible evidence to prove a significant alleged fact. A decision-maker may reject a fact or finding based upon insufficient supporting evidence without the need to make credibility findings.7\n[6] The panel must also consider the requirement of Refugee Protection Division Rule 11, for the claimant to provide acceptable documentation in assessing the credibility of the claimant's evidence.8 As the decision on a refugee claim is made after an oral hearing, the panel's assessment of the credibility of the claimant's evidence includes a consideration of how the claimant testified at the hearing.\n[7] The panel's main concerns regarding credibility arose from the claimant's testimony. Primarily, these concerns were with the testimony and other evidence regarding her Roma ethnicity. Specifically, the letter and membership certificate from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX; the summons and medical reports submitted to substantiate the events and threats she alleges; the claimant's descriptions of Roma celebrations; and her explanation regarding how she is recognized as a person of Roma ethnicity.\nXXXX Documents\n[8] The claimant presented a certificate of membership in the XXXX and a letter, dated XXXX XXXX, 2018, signed by XXXX XXXX, addressed to \"To Whom It May Concern\" stating that the claimant is a person of Roma ethnicity, that she is considered as such by non-Roma in Bulgaria; that he had \"spoken and communicated\" with the claimant and he is convinced that she has suffered persecution and discrimination due to her Roma origin.9 Mr. XXXX was not present at the hearing to explain his statements. There are several points which the panel would have liked to address with him in order to determine the weight to be given to his letter. To start with, to whom, other than the Board, and for what purpose, did he think this letter was being presented? More importantly, how did he reach the conclusions regarding the claimant's ethnicity and her experiences in Bulgaria? These are related questions since the brief statements he makes in the letter, if found credible and given weight, would be dispositive of the claim. Considering that Mr. XXXX is in Toronto, and considering the importance of the statements he is making in his letter, the panel finds that his failure to be present and explain his statements means that, even in the absence of other concerns, as set out in the following paragraphs, this letter, as it is presented, can be given little weight.\n[9] At the start of the hearing the panel asked the claimant what she could tell the panel about the letter. This turned into a very long line of questions which elicited very little information from the claimant.\n[10] She identified Mr. XXXX as the XXXX XXXX XXXX of the XXXX, as is stated on the letter itself, and that he had interviewed her for the purpose of the letter and, when the panel asked if there was anything else, she said that he was also a Roma from Bulgaria. The panel then asked about the interview. The claimant testified that she had gone to the office and asked to be enrolled in the organization and Mr. XXXX told her about the organization and the events she could attend as a member and that he would offer her advice should she require it. The panel asked the claimant a further six times to provide more detail about the interview. The claimant repeated that Mr. XXXX had interviewed her; that the interview, in Bulgarian, lasted one half hour; that the office was on XXXX Street; that the letter had been given to her at the end of the interview; that he had asked her where she lived in Bulgaria and where she lived in Toronto; that the conversation was primarily focused on the XXXX itself; and that it was not necessary to be Roma to join the XXXX.\n[11] As open-ended opportunities for the claimant to tell the panel whatever information she wanted to about the interview had yielded so little, and had barely touched on the information in the statements of Mr. XXXX in the letter, the panel next addressed some of the specifics of the letter. The panel asked if Mr. XXXX had inquired about her about her life in Bulgaria and she replied that she had told him which town she was from and what she was doing there. The panel then asked why she had not mentioned this in the multiple opportunities she had been given to talk about the interview. She replied that she did not recall since it was about a year ago. The panel notes that the interview, which the claimant testified was when she got the letter, was XXXX XXXX, 2018, which is actually just over eight months before the hearing. The panel then asked if she recalled telling Mr. XXXX about anything else and she replied that she had told him about what she was doing when she was back in Bulgaria. When the panel asked her to clarify this statement, she said that she had told him she was going to school and that she had had problems because she was Roma. The panel asked if she told him anything else and she replied that she had not. The panel then asked what she meant when she said that she had told him she had problems because she was Roma. She replied by speaking of school, her arrival in Canada and that her parents were worried. When asked if there was anything else, she replied that Mr. XXXX told her he was well aware of many Roma coming here because of discrimination. The panel then pointed out that the letter also identified her caste using a different word than she had used in her narrative. She said that the difference was that one was a Romany word and the other was Bulgarian and that she uses both words. The panel then asked why, in the many times she had been asked about this interview, she never mentioned discussing her caste. She replied that it was a year ago and that she did not remember what she had been asked. Again, it was actually just over eight months before the hearing.\n[12] The panel finds the claimant's testimony regarding the interview, which she alleges resulted in the letter in support from the XXXX, evasive and repetitive. She only recalled the specific information contained the letter when prompted. She did not volunteer anything of substance herself, despite many opportunities. She appeared to have little knowledge of the interview and it is clear to the panel that the statements about the claimant's ethnicity and experiences in Bulgaria could not be conclusions the letter writer reached based on the information given in the interview. There was little, if any, discussion which could have led him to his conclusions. At best, the letter writer was told by the claimant that she was Roma and had faced discrimination and persecution in Bulgaria and he put those statements in a letter and signed it. If Mr. XXXX had been at the hearing, the panel would have asked him why he did that, i.e. what was his motivation or inducement? As stated above, the letter as presented, can be given little weight. In light of the claimant's testimony, the panel give it no weight as corroboration of the central allegation of the claim - the claimant's Roma ethnicity. The fact that she renewed her membership adds nothing. The claimant's evasive testimony regarding the letter impugns her credibility.\nMedical Report\n[13] According to the claimant's intake documents10, she was neither working nor studying at the time of the alleged XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017 assault. She had not yet decided to come to Canada and make a refugee claim, although she had obtained an Electronic Travel Authorization eight days previously. She did not actually go in to the Citizenship and Immigration Canada office to make a refugee claim until March 1, 2017. In light of these circumstances, the panel asked the claimant why she had obtained the medical report dated XXXX XXXX, 2017. She replied that it was standard practice in Bulgaria that any time a person goes to see a doctor they are given a medical report. The panel expressed surprise that this would be the practice in Bulgaria but not in Canada - a more affluent country with, likely, a better funded medical care system. The claimant replied that she was also surprised by this. The panel notes that the medical report is actually identified as a referral to a specialist but yet there is no actual referral to anyone. That part of the report is blank. Counsel, in his submissions, argued that there was no evidence to contradict the claimant's assertion that providing such a report any time someone went to see a doctor was the usual practice in Bulgaria and therefore the medical report should be given weight as corroboration of the claimant's allegations. This submission is contrary to the law regarding the burden of proof in the refugee determination process. The onus is on the claimant. Even in the absence of direct contradiction, there is good reason to doubt the document and the claimant's explanation for it. The panel finds that while the form itself may be a genuine form used in Bulgaria, it was not, on a balance of probabilities, issued to the claimant in the circumstances she alleges and therefore does not corroborate her allegations. The proffering of this document impugns the claimant's credibility.\nPolice Summons\n[14] The only information the claimant could provide at the hearing regarding the summons was that it had been sent to her home requiring her to go to the station for interrogation regarding some thefts and when she failed to appear, the police went to the house and her mother told them she had gone to Canada. She was not aware whether an arrest warrant had been issued. The panel pointed out that the summons cited section 95 of the Bulgarian Penal Procedural Code and asked the claimant if she knew what that was referring to. She replied that it was something connected to thefts but she had not looked it up. During the recess the panel obtained a copy of the Bulgarian Penal Procedural Code from a publically accessible open source11 and entered the relevant sections into evidence12. Section 95 is in the part of the Code dealing with court appointed Defenders and s. 95 specifically forbids the defender from refusing a defence \"except it becomes impossible to execute his obligations\". Clearly this makes no sense in the context of the claimant's allegations regarding the summons. Counsel, in his questions to the claimant, asked if it was possible that the summons was just a pretext by police to get her to the station and the claimant agreed. In his submissions, counsel argued that this was the only relevant aspect of the summons. The panel finds it implausible that the police in Bulgaria, who are allegedly intent on taking the claimant and forcing her into prostitution, would use the pretext of inquiring into theft to get her to come to the station but yet filled out the summons sent to get her in to the station with a nonsensical Bulgarian Penal Procedural Code section. If the summons had actually been filled out by a police officer, it is reasonable to assume that they would know which section of the Code to write on it. The panel finds that while the form itself may be a genuine form used in Bulgaria, it was not, on a balance of probabilities, issued to the claimant in the circumstances she alleges and therefore does not corroborate her allegations. The proffering of this document impugns the claimant's credibility.\nTestimony Regarding Roma Celebrations and Motion to Recuse\n[15] The claimant gave detailed descriptions of several Roma celebrations. There is no evidence before the panel to which the panel could compare her testimony in order to determine if her descriptions were accurate. It is unclear what weight the panel should give to the claimant's testimony in this regard. She was particularly detailed in her, almost minute by minute, description of a three day Roma wedding which she alleged she had attended six or seven years previously. The panel had a couple of concerns regarding this part of the claimant's testimony. The first was that she apparently had exceptionally detailed recollection of an event six or seven years in the past when she had previously given the passage of a year - actually about eight months - as the explanation for why she could not recall the conversation which resulted in the XXXX letter, as discussed above. The second was that during the course of her testimony, the panel noticed that she generally used the subjunctive form, i.e. in the course of the wedding this \"would\" happen and then that \"would\" happen. The panel asked the interpreter if she was using the subjunctive form in Bulgarian or if this was simply a matter of interpretation. He initially confirmed that he was interpreting accurately and that she was using this form but then he said that one may use this form when speaking of the past. The panel accepted this explanation for the apparent use of the subjunctive. That said, the claimant's testimony regarding Roma celebrations did sound, to the panel listening to her in the hearing room, more like a recitation of something memorized than recollection of something experienced.\n[16] At this point counsel objected, raising concerns about the fairness of the hearing based on the panel's questions, the like of which counsel stated he had not seem in 28 years appearing before the Refugee Protection Division. Along with the question regarding the use of the subjunctive, counsel took exception to the questions the panel had asked earlier in the hearing which counsel characterized as \"specific' and complained that the claimant was not being given opportunity to explain. Counsel alleged that this demonstrated bias on the part of the panel and that the panel should recuse itself. The panel is charged with testing the credibility of the evidence. While some of the questions were specific, the panel is not aware how asking specific questions is an indication of bias and counsel did not elaborate. The panel notes that one of the more significant credibility concerns of the panel arose from the claimant's testimony on the matter of the XXXX letter when the panel asked the claimant open-ended questions to allow her to provide any information about the background of the letter she wished to provide. With regard to allowing the claimant to explain her answers to the panel, she was not prevented from elaborating on her answers to the panel. Also, she was, at this point in the hearing, being questioned by her counsel and could offer further explanations if she wished. The panel finds counsel's request for recusal to be without basis in the evidence. A reasonable person viewing the proceedings would not see the panel's questions as an indication of bias against the claimant.\n[17] The claimant's testimony when she was answering questions from her counsel, aside from the descriptions of Roma celebrations as discussed above, generally consisted of reciting, often word for word, paragraphs of her BOC narrative (as did her witness when he testified), and agreeing with explanations for the evidence suggested by her counsel. Simply being able to recite her narrative and agree with counsel's statements is not necessarily an indication of level of the truth of the former nor does it bolster the weight to be given to the latter. The panel finds that her testimony was largely a rehearsed recitation. Her statements were not credible.\nHow the Claimant Is Recognised as Roma\n[18] The claimant stated several times that she is recognizable as Roma due to her accent, her dark hair and dark skin. There is insufficient evidence before the panel for the panel to find that the claimant's accent singles her out as Roma. With regard to the claimant's hair colour and her skin tone, the panel is not an expert on the hair colour or skin tone which would identify a person as Roma. The panel does note however that the both claimant's hair colour and her skin tone appeared darker when she was seen at the hearing than either appeared in the photograph taken of her when she first made her claim. As the panel is not an expert, as stated above, the panel cannot determine if this might be a manifestation of the claimant's Roma ethnicity or caused by something else. Considering the panel's findings of the claimant's lack of credibility as discussed above, the panel gives no weight to the claimant's statements that her accent, hair colour and skin tone make her recognisable as a person of Roma ethnicity.\nCONCLUSION\n[19] The credibility concerns discussed above are not an exhaustive list. However, based on the credibility findings above, the panel finds that the claimant has not met the onus on her of providing credible and trustworthy evidence to establish that she is Roma, or that she has been targeted by police in Bulgaria to force her into prostitution if she returned to that country. The panel finds that these core aspects of the claim are, on a balance of probabilities, fabrications. The claim is rejected. The credibility findings apply to a claim under s 96 and s 97(1) of the IRPA.\n[20] In accordance with s. 107.1 of the IRPA, because the panel has found that core aspects of the claim are fabrications supported by documents which, while they may be genuine forms, were not issued to the claimant as alleged, the panel must find that this is a manifestly unfounded claim.\n(signed)\n\"D.

The panel, further, considered the Chairperson's Guideline 3: Child Refugee Claimants: Procedural and Evidentiary Issues.5\nDETERMINATION\n[5] The panel finds that the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. The reasons are as follows.\nTHE USA BORN CHILD\n[6] The minor claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, a USA citizen, also claims refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and 97 (1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.6 Her claim was joined to the above noted family member. Her USA citizenship was established by a true copy of her passport.7 The panel asked the claimant what was her claim against the USA on behalf of the minor USA claimant. She indicated that she did not have a claim against the USA. Given that no evidence was adduced as against the USA and the fact that the USA is a democratic country with police force able to provide effective and adequate protection for its citizens, the panel finds that the USA minor claimant is neither a convention refugee nor a person in need of protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 91(1) of the Immigration Refugee Protection Act.8 Her claim is dismissed.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[7] Based on the claimant's testimony and a copy of the claimants' passports found in Exhibit 1, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants' personal and national identity as nationals of Nigeria has been established. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has established, on a balance of probabilities, her dual citizenship as a citizen of the USA and Nigeria.\nALLEGATION\n[8] The claimant alleges that her in-laws want to force her daughter (minor claimant) to undergo circumcision and that she (the claimant) will be forced to have sexual intercourse with the masquerade to complete the traditional rite. The claimant further alleges that her problems began in XXXX 2016, and that she left Nigeria to claim asylum in the USA on XXXX XXXX, 2018.\n[9] She arrived in the USA on XXXX XXXX, 2018, however, she did not file asylum in the USA. Instead, she decided to come to Canada through irregular border crossing on XXXX XXXX, 2018, and file her BOC February 8, 2018.\nISSUES\n[10] Central to this claim is credibility, failure to claim elsewhere and subjective fear.\nCredibility\n[11] \"When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are indeed true unless there is valid reason to doubt their veracity.\"9 The determination as to whether a claimants' evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities. The panel took into consideration that the claimant is well educated with 5 years of college and three years of work experience as a XXXX XXXX.\n[12] In assessing credibility, the panel is mindful of the many difficulties faced by the claimants in establishing a claim including nervousness, cultural factors and the setting of the hearing room. The hearing was conducted in English without the assistance of an interpreter as requested by the claimant.\n[13] Taking into account the claimant's testimony, supporting documents disclosed by the claimant including counsel's submission, the panel is not persuaded, on a balance of probabilities, that the events took place as described by the claimant. The claimant demonstrated great difficulty providing details with respect to incidents she experienced in Nigeria, even when asked specifically to provide details. Of further concern for the panel is the claimant's failure to provide a reasonable explanation for the omissions and discrepancies between her testimony, the supporting documents she provided, her narrative and her interview with CBSA, when given ample opportunity to do so. The claimant also demonstrated a lack of subjective fear which will have a negative impact on her credibility.\n[14] For example, the claimant testified that her problems began in XXXX 2016, when she returned to Nigeria from the USA after giving birth to her daughter. She indicated that her in-laws want to subject her daughter to FGM and that, as her mother, she would be forced to have intercourse with the head of the masquerade as per her in-laws family tradition. The panel asked the claimant what was the consequence of her refusal. The claimant indicated that people from her in-laws family will die. The panel asked how they would die. The claimant indicated that she did not know, but that is what she is being told by the head of her in-laws family. The panel asked the claimant what was the consequence to \"her\" for refusing to comply with her husband's family tradition. The claimant said that there was no consequences to her because she has to do it. Later in her testimony, she indicated that she will be killed for refusing to comply with her in-law's tradition. Given this evidence, the panel asked the claimant to explain why earlier in her testimony she indicated that there was no consequence to her for refusing to comply with her in-law's family tradition and now she is giving evidence that she will be killed. With no answer forthcoming, the panel asked the claimant again why she said earlier there was no consequence to her refusal to comply with the in-law's family tradition and now she states that they threatened to kill her if she did not comply with their tradition. After a very long pause and the panel waiting for a response the claimant did not answer. This raised several concerns for the panel.\n[15] The first, being that the panel finds it reasonable to expect a reasonable person given the same circumstances to be consistent with respect to the consequences of her refusal to comply with her husband's family tradition. The second concern is the fact that the claimant was unable to provide an explanation for the inconsistencies within her testimony on that issue. Taking into account the above noted analysis, the panel finds that had the threats to follow family tradition of the claimant's daughter to undergo FGM and the claimant being forced to have intercourse with the head of the masquerade been genuine, it is reasonable for the panel to expect the claimant to be consistent with respect to the consequences of her refusal to comply.\n[16] The panel asked the claimant what would be the consequence to \"her husband\" for refusing to produce them to her in-laws. The claimant replied that they would not do anything to him because it is her that they are after. Later in her testimony, the claimant indicated that her husband is threatened to produce her and her daughter. In light of this evidence the panel asked the claimant to explain the \"threats\" to her husband and asked to provide as much details as possible with respect to the alleged threats. The claimant indicated that her in-laws tell her husband that he wants to destroy the family and that if something happens, he will pay for it. The claimant testified that her in-laws came to their house on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017. The claimant and her husband were beaten and the neighbours intervened. The claimant further testified that in XXXX 2018, almost 10 months after she left Nigeria for the USA, the head of the shrine came to their house and \"almost\" beat her husband. They said that he has to provide the claimant because \"something deadly is about to happen.\" The panel finds the claimant's description of the threats to her husband to be vague leaving the panel not knowing what the threats to her husband are if he refuses to produce the claimant to his family. The panel also takes into account that the claimant was asked specifically to provide as much details as possible with respect to the threats against her husband and her failure to do so will have a negative impact on the claimant's credibility.\n[17] The panel asked the claimant to describe the first incident with her in-laws with respect to her refusal to comply with their family tradition. The claimant testified that on XXXX XXXX, 2017, she was invited by her in-laws to go to their house where they planned on settling their family issues. However, when she got there, four of her in-laws attacked her. The attack resulted in her sustaining bruises and a cut to her stomach. The claimant further testified that, with the help of her husband, they managed to fight them off and escape. In support of her testimony the claimant submitted an affidavit10 from her husband which states that, \"immediately he was informed\" of this terrible act and asked the claimant to go to the police and file a complaint. This implies that he was not there. There is no mention in the husband's affidavit that he was present during the XXXX XXXX, 2017 incident. When asked to explain, the claimant explained that her husband was outside. This defies logic as the claimant testified that she, with the help of her husband, managed to fight off the in-laws and escape. Further, the claimant's explanation that her husband was outside does not explain the inconsistency between her husband's affidavit which states that he was informed of the incident and the fact that the affidavit makes no mention of him being there and the claimant's evidence that he was there and helped her fight off her in-laws.\n[18] The panel asked the claimant if she had anything to add with respect to the incident of XXXX XXXX, 2017. The claimant said she had nothing to add. Given this evidence, the panel asked the claimant to explain why, when asked on several occasions to provide details of the XXXX 2017 attack, she never mentioned that her in-laws \"almost succeeded in raping her\" as described in her narrative. The claimant explained that she forgot and confirmed that she did almost get raped. The panel does not accept this explanation as reasonable and here are the reasons why. The panel finds that it is reasonable to believe that a reasonable person given the same circumstances would not have forgotten to mention this traumatic event. Further, considering the fact that the panel asked the claimant to provide details of the XXXX 2017 event, it is reasonable to expect the claimant to have provided details surrounding the circumstances of how she was almost raped when she confirmed that she was almost raped. The claimant's failure to provide a reasonable explanation for omitting to mention that she was almost raped in combination to her failure to provide details surrounding the alleged incident leads the panel to find, on a balance of probabilities, that the event did not take place.\n[19] Of further concern for the panel is the claimant's evidence that she went to the family meeting on XXXX XXXX, 2017, with her husband and no one else. She never mentioned that her daughter was with her and that, \"her daughter was almost circumcised on that day\" as described in her narrative. When asked to explain the discrepancy, the claimant explained that she thought the panel was asking about relatives and that \"of course\" her daughter was with her. The panel put to the claimant that her explanation does not explain why she omitted to mention that her daughter was with her and almost circumcised as mentioned in her narrative. The claimant indicated that she did not understand the question and again stated that she thought the panel was asking about relatives.\n[20] The panel rejects this explanation as the question was straight forward when she was asked if she had anything to add to her description of the XXXX XXXX, 2017 incident. Further, there was no mention of relatives in the question at hand. Given the claimant's evidence that this incident is what caused her to go live in hiding at her mother's house in combination to the claimant's failure to provide a reasonable explanation for omissions with respect to this event, central to her claim, leads the panel to find, on a balance of probabilities, that the event did not take place as described by the claimant.\n[21] In support of her testimony, the claimant submitted a copy of the police report11 with respect to the XXXX XXXX, 2017 incident. The police report states that the claimant's in-laws almost succeeded in raping her and having her daughter circumcised. In light of the credibility finding with respect to the XXXX XXXX, 2017 incident in combination with the fact that the claimant failed to mention the above during testimony and failed to provide a reasonable explanation for this omission, the panel will give the police report no weight.\n[22] The claimant gave evidence that her husband's parents threaten to kill him for not producing the claimant and her daughter and that he was almost beat by her in-laws for not producing them. This took place XXXX 2018, 10 months after she left for the USA. The claimant gave further evidence that her husband has lived and continues to live at the same address where the alleged attacks took place. According to the claimant, her husband continues to work and go about his daily routine. Given this evidence, the panel finds the claimant's husband's action to be inconsistent with the action of someone whose life is being threatened. If her husband's life was in danger for refusing to produce the claimant and her daughter, it is reasonable to expect the claimant's husband to take some action to minimize his risk of being subjected to further attacks and the possibility of being killed. However, from the evidence, the claimant's husband clearly did not take any action to protect himself from the threats from his parents. For example, he made no attempts to go in hiding as one would expect from a reasonable person who genuinely fears for his life. As a result, the panel finds that the claimant's husband's actions support a finding that his life is not in danger for the reasons as alleged.\n[23] In support of her claim the claimant submitted affidavits from her mother, neighbor, relative and friend, all of which can be found at Exhibit 5. The panel finds that the affidavits do not add anything to the claimant's story which was found not credible. As a result, the panel will give the above noted affidavits no weight.\n[24] The claimant also submitted photographs she allegedly took when she went to meet her in-laws on XXXX XXXX, 2017. The claimant indicated that she took photos of the ceremony and circumcision rituals that others were going through at the hands of her in-laws before it was her turn because she wanted evidence of what happened that day. The photographs show the circumcision ceremony, her sister in-law at the shrine smiling for the camera, a women being prepared for initiation, a pot of blood before the shrine and a photo of the masquerade amongst other photographs which the panel will give no weight for several reason. The first, being the credibility finding with respect to the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017 incident. The second is that, given the above noted circumstances, it defies logic that the claimant's main concern at the time was to stick around and take photos as evidence as opposed to trying to escape to prevent her and her daughter to be subjected to the family ritual which she claims caused her to leave Nigeria and seek protection.\nFailure to claim elsewhere; subjective fear\n[25] The claimant testified that her intention when she went to the USA was to claim asylum. However, a few days after her arrival in the USA, she went to live with a friend who referred her to a lawyer. After meeting with the lawyer, she was informed that the legal fees to file asylum in the USA was $4,000, she had no money and neither was she allowed to work. That is when she decided to look for an alternative. She went online and did research about Canada. She found out that Canada provided shelter as opposed to USA where she would have to pay for everything to support herself and her daughter and would not be able to obtain a work permit. That is when she decided to come to Canada. Given this evidence, the panel asked the claimant if she did any research about Canada before leaving Nigeria. The claimant testified that she knew nothing about Canada and that she only did research about Canada after she experienced financial difficulties in the USA. The panel reminded the claimant of her interview with CBSA12 when she was asked the following questions, \"Why are you coming to Canada.\" Her reply was, \"I come to Canada to seek asylum. Because that's my dream country in the whole world. I believe Canada will give me a new life and will accept me so we can live a great life here me and my daughter.\" The CBSA Officer asked, \"Does anyone or a group of persons told you how to cross illegally into Canada.\" To which she replied, \"No, not at all. I searched it online.\" The CBSA Officer asked, \"Did you know how to come \"illegally\" to Canada \"before\" leaving Nigeria.\" To which she replied, \"I googled it.\" The panel read the transcript of her interview with CBSA and asked the claimant to explain the discrepancy between her testimony that she knew nothing about Canada before she left Nigeria and that she never had in mind coming to Canada until she found herself experiencing financial difficulties in the USA and the evidence during her interview with CBSA where she clearly states that she googled about coming to Canada to claim refugee status here before leaving Nigeria. The claimant explained that the CBSA Officer made a mistake. The panel put to the claimant that, from the evidence, the CBSA Officer did not make a mistake, he asked her the questions and recorded her answers. The claimant insisted that the CBSA Officer made a mistake, she did not know anything about Canada before leaving Nigeria and that it was never her intention to come to Canada. However, contrary to the claimant's evidence, her responses during the interview with CBSA clearly demonstrate that she did research about Canada and what Canada had to offer as opposed to the USA before leaving Nigeria. This strongly suggests that the claimant's intention, when she left Nigeria with no money, was to come to Canada and claim refugee status because she knew that Canada would provide for her and that in the USA she would have to provide for herself, including paying legal fees. Therefore, the claimant's attempt to mislead the panel with respect to her intentions when she left Nigeria and her reason for her failure to claim in the USA fails.\n[26] Given the claimant's personal situation, leads the panel to find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant came to Canada because in this country she could get financial support, a better life and better work opportunities than the USA had to offer. Economic hardship is not a protected right freedom or basic right specified under s. 96 or 97 of the IRPA,13 therefore it is not within the panel's jurisdiction. This leads the panel to find that the claimant is an economical migrant.\n[27] Of further concern for the panel is the fact that the claimant arrived in the USA on XXXX XXXX, 2018, and came to Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2018, only three days after her arrival in the USA. She had $44.00 and her USA Visa was about to expire on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018. In the case at hand, the panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant simply preferred asylum in Canada over the USA and fabricated her story to seek status in Canada by way of filing for a refugee claim because her USA visa was about to expire and she was facing possible deportation.\n[28] The panel takes judicial notice of the fact that the USA is a signatory of the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol on the status of refugees, and offers a refugee determination system that complies with international obligations.\n[29] In the decision of Hibo Farah Mohamed and Ardo Abdi Omer v. MCI, the Court held:\nThe Geneva Convention exists for persons who require protection and not to assist persons who simply prefer asylum in one country over another. The Convention and the Immigration Act should be interpreted with the correct purpose in mind.14\n[30] Justice Roger Hughes held, in Stojmenovic,15 that,\"a refugee claim should not be looked at simply as one of many choices as to how best to seek status in Canada.\"\n[31] Given the above noted analysis, the panel does not accept the claimant's evidence that her inability to pay for a lawyer caused her not to file asylum in the USA. The evidence clearly demonstrates that the claimant did not file asylum in the USA because the USA would not provide for her as Canada would. The evidence also clearly demonstrates that the claimant came to Canada to gain status which she was about to lose in the USA and possibly face deportation.\nCONCLUSION\n[32] As a result of the above noted analysis and pursuant to subsection 107(2) of the IRPA,16 the panel finds that there was no credible basis for this claim.\n[33] The panel finds that the claimants do not have a well-founded fear of persecution by virtue of any of the 5 Convention grounds; therefore, they have failed to meet the requirement of section 96 of the Convention definition. Having found that the claimants are not Convention refugees, the panel needs to determine if they are persons in need of protection.\n[34] In light of the credibility finding the claimants have not established that they would be subjected personally, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture, in Nigeria.\n[35] Therefore, the panel finds that the claimants are not persons in need of protection and their claim under section 97 of the IRPA17 fails.\n[36] As a result, their claims are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Lynda Gaignard\"\nLynda Gaignard\nApril 16, 2019\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Refugee Protection Division Rules SOR\/2012-256 made under Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n3 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n4 Guidelines issued by the Chairperson pursuant to Section 65(3) of the Immigration Act.\n5 Guidelines issued by the Chairperson pursuant to Section 65(3) of the Immigration Act.\n6 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n7 Exhibit 1.\n8 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n9 Maldonado v.

She faced problems throughout her life on account of her religion. In 2003, she worked for a XXXX of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Because of this and her religion, she received threats and harassment. In 2004, as a university student, she was also threatened, bullied and harassed due to her religion. In 2005, someone posted a note on her family's door that stated \"your daughters must marry Muslim men.\" In 2007, the claimant moved to Dohuk in Kurdistan because of the threat against Christians and Yazidis in Mosul. From 2008 to 2011, the claimant attended university in Lebanon.\n[3] In 2011, the claimant returned to Dohuk and started working for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Initially, she worked in the XXXX department. In 2012, the claimant and her family moved to Erbil. In 2013, she became a XXXX XXXX XXXX. In 2015, when an ISIS sleeper cell was discovered in neighbourhood, her family moved to majority Christian area of Erbil. In 2017, another ISIS sleeper cell was found among students at the university. The general security situation in Erbil deteriorated.\n[4] In XXXX 2017, the claimant married a man who had become a Dutch citizen in 2013. She continued to face mistreatment, particularly when travelling past checkpoints. In early 2018, she was travelling in a taxi while wearing a cross, when the driver stated that all Christians should be beheaded and he motioned his hand across his throat.\n[5] In XXXX 2018, the claimant left the country for the U.S., where the minor claimant was born. Her husband was unable to get an American visa, so he went to Canada instead. In XXXX 2018, the claimant and her son came to Canada to join him. She fears that if she returns to Iraq, she will face persecution and other risks due her religion.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] I find that the claimants are not Convention refugees as they do not have a well-founded fear of persecution related to a Convention ground in Iraq, or the United States in the case of the minor claimant. I also find that the claimants are not persons in need of protection, in that their removal to Iraq, or the U.S. in the case of the minor claimant, would not subject them personally to a risk to life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. There are also no substantial grounds to believe that their removal to Iraq, or the U.S. as the case may be, would subject them personally to a danger of torture.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[7] The claimants' identities as nationals of Iraq, in the case of the claimant, and the U.S. in the case of the minor claimant, are established by their respective passports in evidence.2 I am satisfied of their identities by these documents.\nCredibility\n[8] At the hearing, the claimant responded to questions posed to her in a direct and succinct manner. There were no material inconsistencies or contradictions between her testimony and the other evidence that were not reasonably explained. She also submitted evidence to corroborate some of her allegations. This includes: her national identity card and marriage certificate which identify her religion; her birth and baptism certificate; letters from the claimant's church in Iraq and Canada confirming her membership; her XXXX XXXX identity card; an employment verification letter from the XXXX XXXX; her husband's Dutch passport; and proof of her husband's employment with the XXXX XXXX in Iraq.3 These documents establish that the claimant is Christian and was living and working for a XXXX XXXX in Iraq.\n[9] The Minister intervened in this case by disclosing documents and making written submissions. The Minister argues that since the claimant's husband is a Dutch national, the claimant may have access to Dutch citizenship. According to the Minister, a Dutch citizen may sponsor their spouse for a residency permit which allows the spouse to live and work in the Netherlands. After five years of uninterrupted residence, the spouse may apply for permanent residence or citizenship. Since the claimant's son has a right to Dutch citizenship through his father, the claimant may also apply for residency as the parent of a Dutch national. After five years of continuous residency, she can apply for naturalization.\n[10] The Minister argues that the claimant's failure to pursue status in the Netherlands undermines her credibility. Since the claimant married her husband in XXXX 2017, she had access to this option while still in Iraq. Rather than choosing this alternative, the claimant went to the U.S. where neither she nor her husband have access to residency. It is submitted that the claimant's failure to make a claim in the U.S. is evidence of a lack of subjective fear. The Minister finds that a genuine refugee would seek protection at the first opportunity. The Minister does not find it credible that the claimant would then opt to come to Canada, where neither she nor her husband or child have residency rights, rather than pursuing status in the Netherlands where her husband is a national and her son is entitled to citizenship. Another issue raised by the Minister is the claimant's reavailment to Iraq following trips to France, South Africa and her first trip to the U.S. The Minister suggests that the claimant's actions do not demonstrate subjective fear and instead reflect someone who is country shopping.\n[11] In response to the Minister's arguments, the claimant maintains that she did not make claims in South Africa, France or the U.S. and instead reavailed herself to Iraq because she was unmarried and still living with her family during those work-related trips; tradition dictates that she remain with her family until marriage. Since her family could not leave with her, she felt she had a duty to return. She was married in XXXX 2017 and then moved into a separate home with her husband. She then had greater liberty to leave the country if the circumstances warranted it. The claimant testified that although she tolerated mistreatment in Iraq for many years, once she was pregnant and threatened with death by a taxi driver in early 2018, she became very fearful and promptly applied for a U.S. visa. She explained that she was too fearful to consider other possibilities in the moment. In the U.S., she had her in-laws to rely on for support, but had no such support system in the other countries to which she had travelled. Since she speaks English, there would be no language barrier for her in the U.S. She also explained that when her husband was unable to obtain a U.S. visa, she did not want to make an asylum claim there because she would not be able to be with him. Since he was able to get a Canadian visa, she opted to apply for refugee status here.\n[12] The claimant further testified that there is no Dutch consulate in Iraq so to apply for a visa, she would have to travel to the consulate in Jordan first. Applying for an American visa through the consulate in Iraq was much easier. In terms of the claimant's ability to access Dutch residency and citizenship, she argues that in order for her husband to sponsor her for residency, he would first have to live and work in the Netherlands for one year and needs to earn about 1,600 euros per month. Since the claimant's husband has not lived in the Netherlands for several years because he was living and working in Iraq, this was not an option that could be executed quickly. Furthermore, the claimant would be required to take a civic integration test from abroad to demonstrate knowledge of Dutch language and culture. Finally, the claimant and her husband have no family support in the Netherlands.\n[13] I find that the claimant's delay in departure, failure to claim elsewhere and reavailment were reasonable in the circumstances. I took into account that culture and patriarchy may have influenced the claimant's decision not to make a claim in other countries and to return to Iraq. I accept that an individual's duty to family and gender expectations can supersede one's experience of subjective fear. Furthermore, the claimant testified that her fear only crystalized in 2018. In the meantime, her family took steps to improve their security situation. They moved from Mosul to Dohuk in 2007 and then to Erbil in 2012. When security in their neighbourhood deteriorated, they changed neighbourhoods in that city. When a taxi driver threatened to kill the claimant in 2018, it was the most serious personal threat she had ever experienced and her pregnancy heightened her fear. She decided to flee and was less encumbered in doing so because she had started a new life with her husband.\n[14] I also do not find that the claimant's failure to pursue residency in the Netherlands undermines her credibility. The Minister's own evidence from the Netherland's immigration department confirms that the claimant's husband would have to live in the Netherlands for one year before applying for residency for the claimant.4 However, he was living in Iraq and working for the XXXX XXXX and therefore was not in a position to do so. The evidence confirms that the claimant would be required to take a civic integration test before qualifying for residency.\n[15] The claimant did not provide sufficient evidence to address why she did not pursue Dutch residency through her son. The Minister's evidence from the Netherland's Nationality Act clearly indicates that a child born to a Netherlands national is also a Netherlands national. Thus, the minor claimant can assert his right to Dutch citizenship. The Minister also provided the conditions under which the parent of a citizen can apply for Dutch residency. I find no barriers for the claimant in this list of requirements. There is no indication that claimant would be required to take the civic integration test. It does not appear that the claimant or her son would be required to be living in the Netherlands for any amount of time beforehand and there are no employment or income requirements. The claimant did not adequately address this issue in her evidence.\n[16] While it appears that there is the potential for the claimant to obtain residency in the Netherland through her son, I do not find that her failure to do so is fatal to her claim. It is not unreasonable for the claimant to consider family support and language when choosing in which country to make an asylum claim. The claimant was pregnant when she fled Iraq and while she has no family support in the Netherlands and does not speak Dutch, her in-laws were living in the U.S. and she stayed with them when she arrived there. When her husband could not obtain an American visa, they had to look for other options. Choosing Canada instead of the Netherlands at this point seems questionable given that the claimant had time to consider her options while safe in the U.S. Whereas in Canada, neither she nor her husband and son have status, in the Netherlands, two of them do. As the Minister suggested, Canada seems like a riskier option for her family than the Netherlands. The claimant explained that she has relatives in Canada. However, I note that those relatives are in Toronto, not in Vancouver where the claimant resides.\n[17] Even though the claimant failed to pursue residency in the Netherlands instead of coming to Canada, this does not negate her allegations against Iraq. Overall, the claimant gave clear and consistent evidence concerning her allegations. The subjective fear issues were reasonably explained or were not fatal to her claim because she was otherwise credible.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution & Risk of Harm\n[18] In his case, no allegations against the United States were advanced on behalf of the minor claimant. At the hearing, counsel for the claimants conceded that the minor claimant makes no claim against his country or citizenship. Given that there are no allegations against the U.S. from the minor claimant, I find that there is insufficient evidence that he faces a serious possibility of persecution, or a likely risk of harm within the meaning of 97(1) of the Act, if he returns to the U.S.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[19] I find that the claimant could live safely, without experiencing a serious possibility of persecution or a likely risk of section 97 harm, by relocating to places such as Dohuk. There is insufficient evidence before me to demonstrate that Christians face treatment amounting to persecution or section 97 risks in this part of Kurdistan. Relocation there is also reasonable in the claimant's circumstances.\n[20] The claimant moved to Dohuk in 2007 and is therefore familiar with it. In the claimant's BOC, she does not indicate that she experienced treatment that might rise to the level of persecution. Rather, she states that living there was difficult because she does not speak Kurdish. She also indicates that she was discriminated against because she is Christian and was incorrectly considered to be an Arab. The claimant cites no specific mistreatment in her BOC. At the hearing, the claimant testified that she did not feel \"comfortable\" in Dohuk. When asked for specifics, she testified that \"we faced harassment.\" When asked to be specific again, she referred to being considered Arab and that there is hostility between Arabs and Kurds. She also testified that employment was difficult to obtain and there were difficulties when completing paperwork. On one occasion, she was discriminated against when applying for a job at the university. She testified that being forced to renew residency annually in Kurdistan made her feel like she was not a citizen and was instead a \"stranger\" in her own country. Finally, she testified that taxi drivers sometimes harassed her by holding up the Quran.\n[21] I do not find that the claimant's past experiences in Dohuk, even when considered cumulatively, rise to the level of persecution or section 97 risks. They do not reflect serious, sustained or systematic human rights abuses or violations of fundamental freedom. While the claimant may have been discriminated against when applying for employment, she ultimately found a job in Dohuk with the XXXX XXXX. Although harassment by cab drivers, renewing residency and difficulties with language and paperwork may be inconvenient and aggravating, it does not meet the threshold for persecution or section 97 risks. While a claimant is not required to have experienced persecution in the past to be a refugee, the claimant's past experience in Dohuk suggests that she could live there safely in the future.\n[22] Christians in Iraq have faced appalling human rights abuses and some of their towns are in ruins. The claimant submitted multiple reports about the devastation faced by Christians in the cities of Mosul and Nineveh. But, it is important not to conflate the conditions in the semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan with the situation in the rest of Iraq; Kurdistan's trajectory, particularly as it relates to Christians, has not followed the same course as other regions of the country. For example, one source states, \"If you are a Christian living in Ankawa (outside Erbil), you have generally been in a safe situation over the last 15 years.\"5 Kurdistan has been described as possessing a \"robust state of religious freedom\" and being a \"haven of religious freedom\" where \"religious groups have been targeted less frequently\" and are \"free to worship as they choose.\"6 Christians from Iraq proper have typically fled to Kurdistan for safety over the course of the war,7 much as the claimant and her family did. Kurdistan experienced lower levels of insecurity than other regions of Iraq perhaps due to the greater capacity of the Kurdish security forces and the lower levels of ethnic and religious diversity in the region.8 Thus, I have given much less weight to the conditions for Christians in regions of Iraq outside Kurdistan or disputed areas in my analysis. In addition, when reviewing the objective country condition information, I have been mindful that there have been significant changes in the country over the course of the war; consider the gains and losses of vast territory by the Islamic State. Thus, I have relied more heavily on the more recent country condition documents in evidence in my analysis.\n[23] By way of example of the issues raised above concerning Kurdistan's unique conditions and the changes over time, the claimant relies on a UNHCR report in evidence that discusses violence against Christians.9 I find this 2012 report to be outdated. There have been significant changes in the country in the last seven years during which, for example, Mosul was captured by the Islamic State (IS) in 2014 and recaptured by the government in 2017. However, I note that even in 2012, this report makes the distinction between Kurdistan and the rest of Iraq in specifying that \"the rights of religious minorities are generally respected and groups can worship freely without interference\" in Kurdistan.\n[24] A 2016 Response to Information Request (RIR) in evidence addresses the security situation in Dohuk.10 Sources therein describe Dohuk as \"relatively safe,\" \"satisfactory\" and \"relatively stable.\" It is also stated that the region became \"safe\" after U.S. coalition air strikes and the presence of Kurdish fighters. The RIR indicates that IS does not pose a danger in Dohuk because of the Kurdish security forces' control of the region. Multiple experts consulted report that there have been no terrorist attacks there since early 2015. It finds that in many regions except Kurdistan, minority groups of any religion said they continue to experience violence and harassment from the majority group in the region. Sources relied on also report that \"Christians live safely\" in Kurdistan; there are no \"systematic incidents\" targeting Christians in Dohuk; Christians can practice their faith \"freely\" in Dohuk; and Christians in Dohuk \"enjoy good relations with Kurds.\" The RIR goes on to state that the Kurdish government policy \"has been to accommodate for minorities in an attempt to show its international (namely Western) allies that it can be a beacon of hope and a safe haven for minorities.\"\n[25] A report also issued in 2016 by the Home Office states that Kurdistan has\n\"traditionally been a haven for religious minorities\" and that authorities there \"provide effective protection.\" 11 As such, there were \"relatively fewer reports [than those related to GoI] of official abuse and discrimination based on religious affiliation\" in Kurdistan. Although there are reports of discrimination against Yezidis, Christians and Kakai, the Home office concludes that a person from a religious minority will not be at risk of persecution or serious harm in Kurdistan. It finds that relocation to Kurdistan for religious minorities is feasible and religious minorities do not face unreasonable difficulties in gaining access to the region.\n[26] In yet another 2016 report, the Danish Immigration Service's report finds that Christians do not need a residence card to pass through checkpoints and it may be easier for Christians to enter Kurdistan than it is for Arabs. 12 According to this report, the Kurdistan government \"has been keen on showing that it protects minorities, especially Christians\" and that Christians have a \"stronger position\" in Kurdistan than other minority groups\n[27] The Middle East Research Institute's 2017 report finds that Christians living in Kurdistan \"fared better than those in the disputed territories.\"13 It maintains that Christians have been \"better protected by legal provisions and enjoyed equal business and employment opportunities,\" notwithstanding grievances over land ownership and development issues.\n[28] The 2018 Department of State report reveals that whereas there were continued reports of societal violence by sectarian armed groups in many parts of the country, there are \"few reports of religious violence\" in Kurdistan.14 This document also states that some Christians reported harassment and abuses by the Peshmerga and Asayish which impeded movement from Dohuk to Sinjar. However, it finds that except for Kurdistan, minority groups of any religion report violence and harassment in Iraq.\n[29] The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's 2018 report maintains that \"violence against Christians in the Kurdistan Region is less common, but Christians in the region continue to face discrimination in the form of intimidation and denial of access to services.\"15\n[30] The Home Office states in its 2019 report that Christians are generally permitted entry to Dohuk without pre-existing residence documents or a sponsor.16 This is because access permissions consider the \"ethnosectarian background\" of returnees, which means that minorities are generally admitted to Kurdistan.17\n[31] The evidence reveals that the situation in Dohuk is secure for Christians. This is not to say that the conditions are perfect, as Christians are likely to face discrimination, but I find insufficient evidence to demonstrate that Christians would face treatment amounting to persecution or that would put them at a likely risk of section 97 harm.\n[32] I also find that relocating to Dohuk is reasonable in the claimant's circumstances. The Commission on International Religious Freedom finds that rule of law is \"strong\" in Kurdistan.18 It states that the Kurdistan Regional Government \"makes special efforts to provide for Christians\" and displaced individuals have been \"well provided for, with Christians receiving better care than many others thanks to the support networks organized by local and international churches.\" Christians also do not require a residency permit any longer, which was of concern to the claimant.19 Also, the claimant is not an Internally Displaced Person (IDP) as traditionally defined in that she was not forced to flee her home in one region of Iraq and move to another due to the conflict. Rather, she would be relocating from Canada. There is not sufficient evidence to indicate that she would be forced to live in a refugee camp as opposed to finding her own housing. However, even for IDPs, Refugees International finds that:\nThose IDPs who were able to enter and remain in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) - currently estimated at 840,000 -have been arguably more protected and better served than those who landed in central and southern Iraq. Humanitarian agencies have better access to vulnerable populations in the KRI due to the more stable security conditions and a regional government that has been more willing to facilitate the work of international and local aid groups than the central government in Baghdad.20\n[33] There is evidence that Christians may face some economic disadvantages in Kurdistan.21 For example, finding employment can be challenging, though I note that the claimant was able to secure employment there in the past. Also, whereas poverty rates are high in the rest of Iraq, this is not the case in Kurdistan.22 According to the UNHCR, the overall housing situation in Dohuk is \"relatively optimal as 94% of the total households in urban areas, on average, live in either individual houses or apartments\" as opposed to temporary shelters and unfinished buildings.23 It also states that health care access is rated well by refugees, IDPs and the host community.\n[34] I also considered the Gender Guidelines and find that whereas it may be unreasonable for a lone, single woman to relocate and live alone, this is not the case for the claimant as she would be relocating with her husband. There is insufficient evidence to indicate that non-domestic gender-based violence is systematic or at a level that would render relocation unreasonable. The Home Office concludes that it would not be \"unduly harsh\" for a woman fearing persecution to relocate.24 The claimant is also highly educated, young and fit with consistent employment experience in Kurdistan. The vast majority of the unemployed in Dohuk have very low or no education and most women are illiterate.25 As such, I find it likely that the claimant has some advantages in pursuing employment. Insufficient evidence was raised by the claimant to suggest that it would be unreasonable for the claimant to relocate. An IFA is therefore reasonable.\nCONCLUSION\n[35] Having considered all of the evidence, I find that the claimants are neither Convention refugees as set out in section 96, nor persons in need of protection within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the Act. Their claims are therefore denied.\n(signed)\n\"Preeti Adhopia\"\nPreeti Adhopia\nMay 10, 2019\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibit 1.\n3 Exhibit 4.1.\n4 Exhibit 5.\n5 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP), Iraq, March 29, 2019, Item 1.23.\n6 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 12.11\n7 Exhibit 3, NDP, Items 12.2 Response to Information Request (RIR) IRQ104716.E, 12.10, 12.11, 12.15, 1.7.\n8 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 1.19.\n9 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 1.7.\n10 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 12.6 RIR IRQ105461.E.\n11 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 1.21.\n12 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 1.18.\n13 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 12.16.\n14 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 12.1.\n15 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 1.19.\n16 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 1.14.\n17 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 2.1, 2.9.\n18 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 12.11.\n19 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 14.5.\n20 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 14.4.\n21 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 12.11.\n22 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 1.19.\n23 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 14.9.\n24 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 1.22.\n25 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 14.9.\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRPD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SPR : VB8-05226\/05240\n11\nRPD 29.1 (2014\/02\/18)\n",

At the end of his oral testimony his wife was given the opportunity to express herself verbally. The panel has taken into consideration the Chairperson's Gender Guidelines4 in this matter. All relevant factors were examined and guided in respect to the Chairperson's Gender Guidelines in coming to its decision, such as the social and cultural context in which the claimant's wife found herself.\nHISTORY OF THESE CLAIMS\n[4] The initial hearing was held on November 2, 2012. Written reasons were issued on January 30, 2013. The claimants were determined not to be Convention refugees.\n[5] On XXXX XXXX, 2014, Madam Justice Strickland granted the appeal for judicial review. The hearing for judicial review was heard by Mr. Justice Harrington on XXXX XXXX, 2014 and the application was granted. The matter was remitted back to the RPD to be determined by a different panel.\n[6] Miss Geraldine Mac Donald was the lawyer representing the claimant at the Federal Court for the judicial review and was retained by the claimants for the De Novo hearing. However, due to the death of Miss Mac Donald in February 2018, new counsel was retained and eventually present counsel was retained for this De Novo hearing.\nALLEGATIONS and SUMMARIES FROM INITIAL RPD HEARING\n[7] The principal claimant was the author of the narrative contained in Personal Information Form (PIF)5 that was signed by the claimant on January 17, 2012.\n[8] The principal claimant, his spouse and nephew are Roma from Kalisz, Poland. They are identified by appearance, attire and Romani dialect. His nephew, who is mentally challenged, is the son of his deceased brother. The claimant and his spouse have raised his nephew since the age of one. His nephew was removed from school by the principal claimant due to abuse from teachers and students. His nephew rarely left the house because of treatment at the hands of Polish youth and skinheads.\n[9] The principal claimant alleged that his home was vandalized many times and swastikas as well as racist messages such as \"Gypsies go to gas chambers\" were sprayed on the walls. Windows were broken on many occasions and his car was vandalized. They were compelled to live in the Gypsy Ghetto because the Polish citizens did not want them in their neighborhoods.\n[10] In 2002 the principal claimant was swarmed by skinheads and his arm was slashed with a knife. He went to the police who advised him to go to the hospital. The police installed security cameras surrounding houses in his neighborhood. He reported fights with skinheads to the police but he asserts that the cameras were not working. He was involved in fights with skinheads and when he complained to the police he also told them to look at the camera footage around his area but they refused.\n[11] In XXXX 2011, skinheads attacked the principal claimant in the square. He was injured and taken to the hospital for one week.\n[12] In XXXX 2011, three skinheads attempted to sexually attack the co-claimant. Her front teeth were knocked out.\n[13] In XXXX 2011, skinheads set the claimants house on fire by throwing a bottle through the window. They left Poland shortly afterwards.\nREASONS FOR APPEAL\n[14] On XXXX XXXX, 2014, Mr. Justice Harrington heard the appeal of the claimants. On XXXX XXXX, 2014, he issued written reasons. The application for judicial review was granted and the decision of the RPD was quashed. The matter was referred back to another member of the RPD for redetermination. The Federal Court did not agree with the negative credibility findings and the lack of analysis of state protection. Essentially, the findings were of \"procedural unfairness\".\nEXHIBIT LIST FOR THIS DENOVO HEARING\n* Exhibit 1 -Package of information from CBSA\/CIC and exhibits from initial RPD hearing of November 2, 2012 including Federal Court Documents and Decisions;\n* Exhibit 2 -Personal Information Form of principal claimant TB1-20929 signed January 17, 2012;\n* Exhibit 3 -Personal Information Form of co-claimant TB1-20939 signed January 17, 2012;\n* Exhibit 4 -Personal Information Form of nephew TB1-20930 signed January 17, 2012;\n* Exhibit 5 -NDP for Poland version 29 MARCH, 2019;\n* Exhibit 6 -Personal Documents including handwritten letter from a psychiatrist and translated articles -23 pages in total; and\n* Exhibit 7-copies of RPD decisions and unindexed documentary evidence dated from 2010-2014. Entered as an exhibit for purposes of identification.\nISSUES\n[15] The issues in these joined claims are identity, identity as Roma, credibility, subjective fear including failure to claim in the U.S.A., and state protection.\nIdentity\n[16] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities that the claimants are citizens of Poland based on information contained in the certified true copies6 of their passports that were seized by CBSA\/CIC.\nIdentity as Members of the Roma Ethnicity\n[17] The claimants were determined to be members of Roma ethnicity at the initial hearing in 2012.\nFailure to claim asylum in the U.S.A. in 2005\n[18] The claimants alleged that they have been targeted by skinheads and that they have experienced violence in Poland because of their Roma ethnicity. They went to the U.S.A. in 2005 for permanent status. The principal claimant said that he was going to attend an immigration office but he did not do so because he had no time. Despite the fact that he was arrested and detained together with the services of a lawyer while in the U.S.A., he was unaware of the asylum process. As a result, he was deported to Poland where the family remained until 2012. The principal claimant has not provided a reasonable explanation for not claiming asylum in the U.S.A. in 2005. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities that the failure to claim negates a subjective fear of persecution.\nSUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS OF WRITTEN NARRATIVE\n[19] The principal claimant in his narrative stated that he and his wife raised his nephew since the age of one. This child is the son of his deceased brother. The principal claimant removed his nephew from school at an early age because of abuse he received at school.\n[20] The principal claimant's house was vandalized, windows were broken and swastikas and racist messages were sprayed with paint on the walls. He was swarmed by skinheads and he was physically injured with a knife slash on his arm in 2002. He went to the police but they were unable to help him because there were no witnesses. The police told him to go to the hospital. He went to the USA in 2005 and returned to Poland in 2005.\n[21] The principal claimant narrated three incidents that occurred after his return to Poland in 2005.\n[22] In XXXX 2011, the principal claimant was attacked by skinheads and he required hospitalization for one week.\n[23] In XXXX 2011, there was an attempted rape of the co-claimant. She fought her attackers and her front teeth were knocked out.\n[24] In XXXX 2011, a bottle of liquid was thrown through a window of his house that started a fire. The principal claimant tried to get footage from cameras but the authorities refused [to assist]. They then left Poland.\nSUMMARY OF ORAL TESTIMONY\n[25] The principal claimant, a 56 year old man, in oral testimony, said that he was born and brought up in the suburban area of Kalisz, a city some 235 kilometers from Warsaw, the capital. He lived in the Roma Ghetto. He said there were about 30 families and he lived in a home that initially had been granted by the government to his grandparents.\n[26] The principal claimant said he only completed grade 2. However, he is able to read, do math calculations and he has a driver's licence. He said he can easily read road signs and directions. He was employed initially on a casual basis and he then worked for a private XXXX.\n[27] The principal claimant went to the U.S.A. in 2005, in order to get permanent status. He was accompanied by his wife and nephew. He was not legally married at that time. He raised money from his work, family and friends. He intended to go to an immigration office but he did not have time. He did not make a claim for asylum in the U.S.A. He said he did not know about making a claim despite having had a lawyer for a criminal matter. He was detained and he was eventually deported back to Poland in 2005. The principal claimant married his wife in 2011, and he legally took her family name. He said the reason for his name change was that it was his wife's wish.\n[28] When asked what caused him to come to Canada the principal claimant said when his wife was attacked in the square, his wife lost her front teeth due to the physical assault. He said a couple on a bicycle screamed and the skinheads ran away. When asked if he took the dental report to the police, he said no because they were threatened. When it was pointed out to the principal claimant that his wife received dental care for her missing tooth, he said she was treated by a friend of his who was a dentist. He also said that skinheads tried to set fire to his house. He said he called the police, a fire truck arrived but he had put out the fire himself.\n[29] The claimants came to Canada in XXXX 2011. The principal claimant said the authorities at the airport wanted to send him back to Poland because he did not have money. An Immigration Officer told him that he could claim refugee status. His cousin was waiting in reception for the family and they stayed with this cousin for two weeks. They were then taken to another office in Toronto where they were assigned accommodations in an apartment. The principal claimant eventually obtained a work permit and was able to be legally employed. He together with his nephew, XXXX XXXX.\n[30] The panel noted that it has been over seven years since the principal claimant left Poland and referred to some changes contained in Response to Information Request POL104838.E7 wherein it is stated the procedure to file a complaint against police officers. The principal claimant said that there is no change because of what happened to him. When asked about relatives in Poland and their difficulties with police, he said everyone is scared. The principal claimant said that his wife sees a doctor who is a specialist on a regular basis and his nephew works with him XXXX XXXX.\n[31] The principal claimant's wife, was asked if she agreed with her husband's testimony and she said yes. When asked if she had anything to add, she said that she does not want to go back [to Poland] and she is scared.\n[32] When questioned by counsel, the principal claimant said he will not have health care for his wife and nephew. He said that his mother's home has a small square footage. He said that he does not trust doctors. He does not think he could get adequate health care. He said that 50% of Polish people are racist.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[33] In consideration of these claims, the panel has assessed all the information, including Counsel's submissions,8 including the RPD decisions by other RPD Members as they relate to other Roma who were granted Convention refugee status. To summarize Counsel's submissions: the Roma face discrimination in all facets of their lives. The claimants, in a forward-looking manner, would not get protection from the police. The panel finds that each case is decided on a case-by-case review and consideration of the facts presented. The information in each claim is dependent upon the personal circumstances of the claimant. The panel finds that not every Roma in Poland has experienced what amounts to persecution. The panel agrees with Justice Harrington as stated in Varga v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 510 [Varga] at paragraph 20:\nEach case turns on the particular history of the claimant, the record, the adequacy of the analysis by the Tribunal and, indeed, the appreciation of that evidence by various judges of this Court: Banya v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2011 FC 313, [2011] FCJ No 393 (QL), at para 4.9\n[34] The panel notes that the evidence states that Roma in Poland face discrimination, high levels of unemployment, and some experience violence by anti-Roma and racist factions of the population.10 The issues before the panel is whether adequate state protection is and would be available to the claimants in Poland should they return to Poland in 2019, over seven years since they left in 2011. The panel is guided by a number of cases when assessing state protection from the Supreme Court of Canada, the Federal Court and the Federal Court of Appeal. In this regard, the courts have established a number of principles relating to state protection and the panel has applied those principles to these claims.\n[35] The courts have found that states are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens, except in the case of state that is in complete breakdown.11 The panel finds the starting place then is the notion that states are capable of protecting their citizens.\n[36] This presumption underscores the principle that international protection comes into play only when a refugee claimant has no other recourse available. In order to rebut the presumption of adequate state protection, there must be clear and convincing evidence of the state's inability to protect its citizens.12 The evidence that state protection is inadequate must not only be reliable and probative, it must also satisfy the Board, on a balance of probabilities, that state protection is inadequate.13 This is not a simple statement that a person just went to the police and they did nothing, but to provide information as to what steps did the person take to obtain protection.\n[37] Furthermore, a claimant who alleges that state protection is inadequate must persuade the Board on a balance of probabilities that the evidence establishes that the state protection is inadequate.14 The test is not if there is a mere possibility that the states will not offer protection, but the higher test on a balance of probabilities. The protection need not be perfect,15 and the burden of proof that rests on a claimant increases with the level of democracy of the state in question. The more democratic the state is, the more the claimants must have done to exhaust all courses of action open to them to demonstrate state protection was or would not be forthcoming.16 The panel has considered the evidence of the claimants, including the packages of country documents provided.17 There is nothing in these documents to indicate that Poland is in a state of breakdown or not in control of its borders. Having considered the totality of the documentary evidence, the panel finds that Poland is a functioning democracy. The panel notes that Poland's bicameral National Assembly consists of an upper house, the Senate and a lower house (Sejm). The president, the prime minister, and the council of ministers share executive power. Observers considered October 2018, nationwide regional and local elections were free and fair.18\n[38] The panel finds that Poland has a functioning security apparatus and judicial processes, the security forces report to civilian authorities. While there were concerns related to police services in Poland, the evidence suggests that civilian authorities maintained effective control over the security forces, and the government had effective mechanisms to investigate and punish abuse and corruption. There were no reports of impunity involving the security forces during the year.19 The panel finds neither in the Board's own documents nor the documents submitted by the claimants, is there any evidence to suggest that Poland is in a state of complete breakdown. Thus, the panel finds that Poland is a democracy. In fact, the evidence indicates that Poland has a high aggregated score with 0 being the least free and 100 being the most, Poland scores 85.20\n[39] The panel recognizes that discrimination exists in Poland, which includes \"racially-motivated verbal abuse and physical attacks.\" Societal discrimination against Roma continued to be a problem. The 2011 national census recorded 16,723 Roma, although an official government report on the Romani community estimated that 20,000-25,000 Roma resided in the country.21 Discrimination is not solely directed at the Roma population, though societal discrimination against Roma continued. The panel notes that reports indicated that there were scattered incidents of \"racially motivated violence, including verbal and physical abuse, directed persons of African, Asian, or Arab descent\"22 and that there were reports that some local officials discriminated against Roma by denying them adequate social services. \"Romani leaders complained of widespread discrimination in employment, housing, banking, the justice system, the media, and education.\"23 While at the national level, approximately 80 percent of Roma were unemployed, levels of unemployment in some regions reached nearly 100 percent. 24\n[40] Thus, the panel does find that the Roma as a population in Poland face discrimination. However, the information in the documentary evidence also shows that the Polish government is making serious efforts in policy and at the operational level to combat violence and discrimination against the Roma population.\nPolice\n[41] The panel notes that the principal claimant went to the police in 2002, when his arm was slashed by skinheads. The police told him that they were unable to assist him because there were no witnesses and they advised him to go to the hospital. The principal claimant did not present a hospital report to substantiate his medical treatment. It is also reasonable to expect that the principal claimant could not receive help from the police when he was unable to identify the skinheads who assaulted him. The panel does not find that the police were unwilling to help the principal claimant with respect to the 2002 incident. The panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities that the police in Canada could not assist in this situation.\n[42] The claimants went to the U.S.A. in 2005 and returned the same year. In fact, the principal claimant was deported. The principal claimant referred to three incidents that occurred in 2011. The first incident was in XXXX 2011, when he was attacked by skinheads and he was hospitalized for a week.\n[43] The second incident was in XXXX 2011, when there was an attempted rape of the co-claimant and an assault that knocked out her front teeth. The third incident was in XXXX 2011, when the principal claimant's house was set on fire. At no time did the principal claimant or his wife report the incidents to the police. The Courts have held that the police must be given the tools to aid them in their investigation.25\n[44] The panel finds that there are recourses available to the claimants that they did not utilize. The panel notes that failure at the local level does not mean that the authorities at other levels in Poland would not have aided them. The evidence that state protection is inadequate, must not only be reliable and probative, it must also satisfy the Board, on a balance of probabilities, that state protection is inadequate.26 When the state in question is democratic, a claimant must do more than simply show that he or she went to see some members of the police force and that his or her efforts were unsuccessful.27 As this is the case here, the panel does not find that there was a denial of protection, more of reluctance of the claimants' part to seek it. They cite historical statements that police are unwilling to aid the Roma, but the review of the documentation does not support their position.\n[45] The panel notes there have been positive actions taken by the authorities to address violence targeting the Roma population, that the police are making arrests in cases of assaults and attacks on the Roma population.28\n[46] The panel also finds there is redress available to the claimants if they truly believed that the police were purposefully not investigating the crimes.\nIn 11 April 2014 correspondence with the Research Directorate, a second lawyer in Warsaw, who also practices criminal law, similarly stated that police can refuse to investigate a case but the decision could be appealed to the district court (Lawyer 11 Apr. 2014). According to the representative of SIP, an individual submitting a complaint \"is not given written grounds for the decision,\" and the victim may challenge this decision in court (SIP 12 Apr. 2014). Moreover, the SIP representative said that;\n[i]f the investigation had been opened but its results are negative, the police or the prosecutor close the investigation due to the lack of evidence or failure to detect an offender. [...] This decision may also be challenged in court by the victim. (ibid.)29\n[47] In addition, the complainant or victim of a crime can submit a complaint against police officers directly with the chief of police. The following notice on the website of the national police outlines how complaints against police officers or suggestions can be filed with the chief police command:\nby mail to the address:\nKOMENDA GL\u00d3WNA POLICJI [KGP, Chief Police Command] ul. Pulawska 148\/15002-514 Warszawa\nin person -at the KGP Admission Office at ul. Pulawska 148\/150 daily between 8:15 and 16:15\nby fax - to the number: +48 22 60 135 7130\n[48] The panel notes there is recourse available to victims of crime if the police refuse to investigate a complaint:\nby means of ePUAP - web address www.epuap.gov.pl. [Electronic Platform of Public Administration Services, \"a coherent and systematic action program designed and developed to allow public institutions [to] make their electronic services available to the public\" (Poland n.d.b)]\nby e-mail - to skargi.kgp@policja.gov.pl\norally for the record - at the KGP Admission Office at ul. Pulawska 148\/150 02-514 Warsaw.\nDaily between 9:00 and 15:00 (Monday 9:00 to 17:00) in the building of the Chief Police Command, address as above. The KGP Control Bureau officers, acting on behalf of the Chief Commander of Police, receive clients in cases of complaints and suggestions regarding the activities of police and provide information by telephone (22) 60 - 122 72.31\nIMPORTANT!\nComplaints \/ suggestions cannot be filed by telephone.\nA complaint \/ suggestion must contain:\nthe complete name of the person making the complaint \/ suggestion;\nthe detailed address for correspondence; and\na detailed description of the incident.32\n[49] The evidence indicates that complaints on behalf of other persons can be filed only if those persons are aware and consenting. In the absence of consent, such a complaint will remain in complaint records with no answer sent to the applicant.33\nAccording to \u00a7 8, point 1, of the Cabinet of Ministers' decree of 08 January 2002 concerning the procedure of reception and examination of complaints and suggestions, those complaints and suggestions that do not contain the full name and address of the person filing will be left unexamined. (ibid. n.d.a).34\n[50] The panel notes there is also an Ombudsman who may offer aid to the co-claimant in her dealings with the police.35 The panel finds the documentary evidence provides that the Human Rights Defender is the constitutional authority for legal control and protection.36 In his activities, the Defender is integral and independent from other state authorities.37 The Defender acts pursuant to the Constitution of the Republic of Poland and the Human Rights Defender Act of 15 July 1987.38 Applications for assistance can be made in writing, personally, by electronic form and by email.39\n[51] Even where the protective services of the home state have gaps or deficiencies, a claimant who alleges a subjective fear must, in the absence of a compelling justification, take reasonable steps to access those services.40 The claimants have failed to demonstrate they have taken reasonable steps to access any services as it relates to the police.\n[52] The panel is aware that there is a high level of unemployment in Poland for the Roma population, caused in part due to the economic downturn, the lack of education and training of the Roma population, and other grounds. The government has funded education, health care, employment and improved living conditions for the Roma. Support of social inclusion of persons endangered by social exclusion or socially excluded persons through the development of services with special focus on marginalized Roma.\n[53] As it relates to housing, the claimants lived in a house that was assigned to the principal claimant's grandparents. There is nothing before the panel to suggest the claimants could not return to that home. In addition, the claimants have family who reside in Poland and who previously assisted the claimants financially, in coming to Canada. The panel notes that housing is a problem in Poland for all its citizens, while the government is investing in addressing this matter, much like Canada it takes time.\n[54] The panel notes the information is mixed on the situation for the Roma in Poland, there are problems at the certain local areas with the allocation of funds, however, the Polish government funded 773 projects by 316 agencies, including 77 Roma NGOs active at the local level.41 The panel finds there is evidence of concrete action on the part of the central government, for example improving housing conditions for Roma, which is viewed as one of the priorities in the Polish government's overall plan to improve conditions for Roma, and the implementation of various programmes to combat racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and the implementation of the Programme for the Roma Community in Poland (2004-2013).42\n[55] The panel finds there are legitimate concerns from some groups that there is impunity for racially motivated attacks and the police responses are not sufficient, the documentary evidence supports these concerns. However, the preponderance of evidence indicates that the state is taking action against extremists and others targeting the Roma population.\n[56] The panel notes there is also evidence that at the operational level, the state is taking action to address the discrimination and violence targeting the Roma population. Despite these efforts by the Polish government, statistics indicate that Roma are still underemployed and less educated. Critics claim these programs do not go far enough or are just superficial. Even so, the panel finds the preponderance of evidence is that there are programs in place, and the government has taken serious efforts to improve the lives of the Romani minority. Furthermore, the documentary evidence indicates that there are recourses available to Roma who wish to pursue complaints against the police for inaction. Therefore, based on the evidence which has been provided to the panel, the claimants have not satisfied the burden by providing clear and convincing evidence that, on a balance of probabilities, adequate state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming if the claimants should need it.\nHealth Care\n[57] The principal claimant alleged that he and his family would not get social assistance and health care in Poland. He alleged long wait times and the fact that he had to pay. The principal claimant presented a letter from a psychiatrist in Poland with respect to his nephew's XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that is dated XXXX XXXX, 2012.43 The letter indicated that his son was treated from 2009-2011 by the same psychiatric facility in Poland. A handwritten letter from a psychiatrist in the Toronto area was submitted by counsel.44 The letter is general in nature and states that the principal claimant's wife and nephew are treated with psychiatric medication and are dependent on the principal claimant.\n[58] According to the documentary evidence45 the Roma have full access to pre-school education as well as education in public schools at all levels of education and in all types of schools. Eighty per cent of Roma children attend school. Roma pupils have free access to make up classes of the Polish language and other subjects. Roma education assistants are hired to teach bicultural and bilingual pupils. Other measures support community daycare and scholarships for pupils of Roma origin.\n[59] According to the same documentary evidence, in a report submitted in February 2017, to the U.N. Human Rights Council, the Polish government indicates that the Programme for the integration of the Roma community for 2014 - 2020 receives 3.5 million dollars (Canadian) annually for education, housing, promotion of employment and health care.\n[60] Roma access and use of healthcare are limited because of a lack of trust of the Roma population in non-Roma individuals. There is no reliable evidence before the panel that the Roma population does not have access to healthcare.\n[61] The principal claimant has not provided a reasonable explanation as to why he could not get adequate health care in Poland.\nRECENT CASE LAW AND STATE PROTECTION IN POLAND\n[62] The panel had considered the recent Federal Court decision of Jaworowska46 which is a review of a Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) decision that confirmed the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) which pertained to the claims of a married Roma couple from Poland who were assaulted by unknown individuals because of their Roma ethnicity. The facts in Jaworowska are similar to the present case. Madam Justice Walker found that both the RPD and RAD correctly identified and applied the test for state protection. The decision reads in part as follows:\nThe RAD also conducted its own assessment of the documentary evidence regarding the treatment of the Roma population in Poland. The panel considered the Applicants' evidence relating to the December 2014 attack and the reasons they provided for why they did not seek police protection or action. The RAD referred to the Applicants' background, employment history, education, and living arrangements in Poland. The RAD noted both the efforts of the Polish government to provide protection and the concrete results of those efforts as confirmed in the documentary evidence.\nIn my view, the RAD did not make its Decision in a factual vacuum. Its consideration of the documentary evidence for Poland and the Applicants' narrative and evidence was transparent and intelligible. Its conclusion regarding the Applicants' failure to rebut the presumption of adequate state protection was based on the lack of clear and convincing evidence of attempts to involve the police or other authorities outside of the statement Mr. Dyszko gave to police in the hospital. The RAD's assessment of the weight of this statement against the additional recourses available to the Applicants was reasonable and its denial of the Applicants' appeal was within the possible outcomes for the case.\n[63] When all of the above is taken into consideration, the panel finds that the claimants have not rebutted the presumption that Poland is able to protect its citizens.\n[64] The claimants have been in Canada since 2012. They have relatives in Canada. However, Humanitarian and Compassionate Consideration is not the mandate of the Refugee Protection Division.\nCONCLUSION\n[65] The panel concludes that the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n[66] Therefore the panel rejects these claims.\n(signed)\n\"M.

The female claimant states that she has been diagnosed with XXXX, or the tendency to XXXX XXXX XXXX. She states that her condition is rare and puts her at increased risk to her health.\n[3] Both claimants testified that they desire a large family. They claimed that, were they to be returned to Croatia, this objective is threatened because the female claimant's genetic condition places her at high risk of miscarriage. They make the further claim that the only way she could have successful pregnancies, and the large family they desire, is for the female claimant to be provided with the type of rigorous monitoring and treatment she received from Canadian medical providers during her two previous pregnancies.\n[4] The claimants allege that, to obtain this treatment, they would have to pay bribes every step of the way, namely to doctors, nurses and for blood tests and results, which they would not be able to afford. In addition, the female claimant worries that, as she ages, her condition would worsen and she would not be able to afford the required treatment, namely XXXX XXXX.\n[5] The issues that are determinative of the hearing include identity, credibility, nexus, and state protection.\nThe Claimants' Position\n[6] On their behalves, Counsel for the claimants advanced a number of arguments. With respect to section 96 of the IRPA, counsel submitted that a nexus to the Convention Ground had been established, in that,\n* The female claimant fell into a particular social group, that is, women of child bearing age who suffer from rare genetic disorders, in the female claimant's case XXXX XXXX XXXX, who are denied access to publicly funded medical treatment;\n* The claim engages the female claimant's reproductive liberty; and that\n* In Croatia the female claimant's reproductive rights and, therefore, her human rights, would be compromised.\n[7] With regard to subparagraph 97 (1)(b)(iv) of the IRPA, Counsel also argued that given the particular circumstances of the female claimant, she is exempted from its operation. IRPA subparagraph 97 (1)(b)(iv) of the Act provides that where the risk the person fears is caused by the inability of the country or countries claimed against to provide the claimant with adequate health or medical care, protection will not be extended to the claimant.\n[8] In the view of Counsel for the claimants, subparagraph 97 (1) (b)(iv) of the IRPA does not operate to exclude the claimants because the female claimant would be forced to pay bribes in order to obtain the necessary medical attention, effectively denying her medical attention. Further, the female claimant would be at additional risk if she did not pay a bribe as other doctors would know that she had refused to do so and, in turn, would refuse to treat her (a kind of blacklisting). The claimants submitted that they would have no recourse to the police. In fact, the female claimant testified that she ran the risk of being prosecuted for paying a bribe to obtain the medical services she may require.\n[9] Much reliance was placed on the experiences of a member of the opposition, Ivana Nincevic, who denounced the treatment she received during a dilation and curettage procedure. The Member of Parliament claimed that the procedure was done without anaesthetics. In Parliament, she raised the matter as an example of the treatment that women received in the medical system. However, the Minister of Health denounced the Member as a liar. On their behalf, counsel for the claimants' submit that if a Member of Parliament could receive substandard treatment this was indicative of the way in which the female claimant would be treated, unless she was able to pay a bribe.\n[10] The claimant gave the example of Ljubica Adjaip, who paid a bribe to a doctor in order to obtain heart surgery for her husband. She was prosecuted on bribery charges even though she had taped a conversation between herself and Split's Cardiac surgeon, in which he acknowledged that she had paid him a bribe to facilitate the heart surgery of her husband. In fact, the doctor not only acknowledged that Mrs. Adjaip had paid him a bribe, he returned the money so that she could pay for her husband's funeral. When she took the taped conversation to the police, it was Mrs. Adjaip and not the doctor who was charged.\n[11] I considered the claimant's testimony and evidence and make the following findings:\n1. The identities of the claimants as citizens of Croatia is satisfactorily established.\n2. The female claimant carries or has the XXXX XXXX XXXX, genetic mutation\n3. The claimants were, overall, credible and trustworthy witnesses. They testified earnestly without embellishing their evidence. The female claimant was able to clarify any questions that arose during her testimony.\n[12] Nonetheless, for the reasons set out below I find that the claimants are neither convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\nThe Female Claimant's Medical Condition\n[13] The documentary evidence3 describes XXXX XXXX XXXX as a mutation of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. This mutation can increase a person's chance of developing XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The documentary evidence goes on to explain that most people with XXXX XXXX XXXX never develop XXXX XXXX but that, in people who do, these XXXX XXXX can lead to long-term health problems or become life-threatening. Both men and women can have the mutation, [however] women who carry the XXXX XXXX XXXX mutation may have an increased tendency to develop XXXX XXXX during pregnancy or when taking the hormone estrogen. The documentary evidence also distinguishes between two types of the mutation in the gene, namely XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[14] Early in her first pregnancy, the female claimant was diagnosed with the XXXX form of the mutation.4 At the urging of her aunt, who had herself been diagnosed with XXXX, and had suffered several miscarriages, she had herself tested for the mutation. She left for Canada before she received the results. The female claimant arrived in Canada quite early in that pregnancy. Soon after coming to Canada she felt unwell and sought medical treatment. At the hospital, she received a XXXX injection, followed by a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Her pregnancy was deemed a \"high-risk\" pregnancy, and the female claimant was closely monitored throughout. The claimants have had a second child and the same protocol was followed during this second pregnancy. In the context of medical treatment of pregnant women in Canada, I find nothing unusual in the medical actions that were taken vis-a-vis the claimant. Indeed, if these actions had not been taken that would have been seen as an anomaly in the standard of medical care available to pregnant women in Canada.\nIs there a nexus between what the female claimant fears and a Convention Ground?\n[15] As stated above, the position of the claimants and their counsel is that there is a nexus between what the claimants fear and the convention ground of membership in a particular social group. Having considered the claimants' narrative, oral testimony, the documentary evidence, and counsel's submissions, I conclude that a nexus to a Convention ground has not been established.\n[16] I do not dispute that the female claimant has a potentially serious medical condition, nor do I dispute that should she become pregnant she would likely require constant monitoring of her condition in order to ensure a successful pregnancy. The female claimant described her condition as \"rare\". I am not persuaded of this description. Her particular mutation is \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\"5 Thus, I am of the view that the female claimant's mutation is found in or affects a significant portion of the white population, as opposed to being a rare condition.\n[17] Counsel for the claimant provided an extensive examination of situations where \"medical reasons\" have provided a nexus to a Convention ground. Her examples encompassed mainly forced sterilisation, forced abortions etc. circumstances that have been identified as forming clear violations of a basic human right. That this type of situation can be classified as a human rights violation can be traced back to the statements of Heald, J. A. in Cheung.6, At p. 322 of the decision, the Court stated that \"forced or strongly coerced sterilization\" constituted persecution since sterilization violated a woman's security of the person and subjected her to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. Heald, J.A. also agreed that it had not been shown that sterilization of a man was qualitatively different from that of a woman and that, therefore, forced or strongly coerced sterilization would amount to persecution.\"\n[18] After the decision in Cheung was rendered the UNHCR issued a \"Note on Refugee Claims based on coercive family planning laws or Policies\" in which the question of such policies and nexus to the Convention ground is discussed. At paragraph 26, the note states: -\nC. Nexus to the Convention grounds\n26. In the context of refugee status determination, one needs to examine whether the treatment concerned (e.g. coerced or enforced abortion and\/or sterilization, as well as various penal, administrative or economic sanctions or discriminatory measures) is feared for reasons of one or more of the five Convention grounds.7\n[19] In the same document, the UNHCR referred to the impact of the motive or intent of the persecutor, stating,\nIn this context, it is important to recall that nowhere in the drafting history of the 1951 Convention is it suggested that the motive or intent of the persecutor was ever to be considered as a controlling factor in either the definition or the determination of refugee status. This should be noted as the question of the motive or intent of the persecutor has been considered in a number of cases related to coercive family planning policies, where refugee status has sometimes been denied with a reference to a lack of evidence of persecutory intent, unless they cannot get care because of persecution or discrimination.\n[20] I find that the cases cited by counsel for the claimants are qualitatively different from the female claimant's case, which involves no pressure, force or coercion to do or to refrain from doing any act detrimental to her reproductive rights. To put the matter baldly, in Croatia, the female claimant is not being prevented from having other children. However, should the female claimant desire to have more children she will have to do so in the context of the Croatian social climate that involves rampant bribery.8\n[21] Counsel for the claimants made the further submission that what the female claimant fears is medical corruption based on her particular social group. She argued that the Croatian government was unable and unwilling to offer protection to women in the female claimant's particular social group, and therefore, the medical corruption she faced was discriminatory. Moreover, the medical corruption prevented the female claimant from obtaining access to good quality reproductive health care, which amounts to gender-based violence.\n[22] As facile as Counsel's argument may be, I find that the evidence does not support it. By the claimants' own testimony, which is borne out by the documentary evidence, corruption is endemic to Croatian society. The female claimant testified that bribery is a criminal offence. Both her testimony and the documentary evidence indicate that, in Croatia, bribery is not limited to pregnant women. It appears pervasive, extending to almost all areas of life. Thus, in this regard, the female claimant is not in a position that would distinguish her from any of her fellow Croatian citizens. To be sure, I am not stating that the claimants must pay a bribe, I merely find that if the female claimant were to be returned to Croatia, and if she should decide to become pregnant, she is at risk of criminality as opposed to persecution. This, in my view, is a risk that is generalised among the Croatian population. I also find that the female claimant has not identified a particular social group that requires protection under s. 96 of the IRPA.\n[23] Accordingly, I find that a nexus between what the female claimant fears and a Convention ground has not been established and she is, therefore, not a Convention refugee. The male claimant relies on the facts put forward by the female claimant, therefore, he too is not a Convention refugee.\nIs the Female Claimant a Person in need of Protection?\n[24] Counsel for the claimants submitted that the female claimant is a person in need of protection. As stated earlier, she argues that subparagraph 97 (1)(b)(iv) of the IRPA does not apply to the female claimant's case.\n[25] Subparagraph 97(1)(b)(iv) of the IRPA provides as follows,\nPerson in need of protection 97. (1)\nA person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\n(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or\n(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.\n[26] At issue in this claim is the meaning of the phrase \"inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care\" in subparagraph 97(1)(b)(iv). This is, of course, a question of law.\n[27] In Covarrubias,9 which appears to be the leading case on this issue, Justice Moseley certified the following question:\nDoes the exclusion of a risk to life caused by the inability of a country to provide adequate medical care to a person suffering a life-threatening illness under section 97 of the IRPA infringe the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in a manner that does not accord with the principles of fundamental justice, and which cannot be justified under section 1 of the Charter?\n[28] A coram of Justices Linden, Nadon and Malone in deciding the matter stated that the denial must be for an illegitimate reason. The judges made the following statements:\n[22] The appellants submit that the Applications Judge [Gibson] erred in his interpretation of the exclusion from protection in subparagraph 97(1)(b)(iv) because he did not distinguish between a risk to life owing to a country's unwillingness to provide medical care, and a risk to life resulting from a country's genuine inability to provide medical care. The appellants submit that the exclusion in section 97 is intended to contemplate only the latter.\n[23] The appellants argue that in interpreting the exclusion in subparagraph 97(1)(b)(iv), the Court must take into consideration that section 97 is intended to protect risks to life which are premised on another country's violation of international standards. This is because the purpose for creating the expanded ground of protection in section 97 is to ensure Canada's compliance with its international human rights commitments. The appellants refer to the Clause by Clause Analysis of Bill C-11 (later enacted as the IRPA), wherein it states in reference to section 97: This new provision applies only to persons who claim refugee protection in Canada. It generally consolidates the existing protection-related grounds which are spread through various provisions of the current Act and regulations and are evaluated under separate procedures. This provision upholds Canada's obligations under international conventions and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and provides a clear definition of a person in need of protection under one provision.\n24] The appellants refer to various international conventions and declarations to argue that the right of access to medical care is a legally recognized human right in international law. On this basis, the appellants argue that, to maintain the purpose of section 97, the exception in subparagraph 97(1)(b)(iv) must be interpreted narrowly so as to exclude from protection only those from countries which are truly unable to provide needed medical treatment to their nationals.\n[25] The appellants' proposed interpretation leaves open, therefore, the possibility for persons to obtain refugee protection where they can show that they face a human rights violation on account of their country's unwillingness, not its inability, to provide them with life-saving medical treatment. The appellants submit that such unwillingness to provide health care exists when that country has the financial ability to provide emergency medical care, but chooses, as a matter of public policy, not to provide such care freely to its underprivileged citizens. This, in the appellants' view, is a violation of international standards and precisely the type of risk to life that is contemplated by section 97.\n[26] The respondent, on the other hand, argues for a broad interpretation of the exclusion in subparagraph 97(1)(b)(iv) so as to exclude virtually any risk to life on account of a person's health care needs. The respondent argues that there is no distinction between a country's unwillingness and its inability to provide such health care. Moreover, there is no evidence that Parliament intended section 97 of the IRPA to confer the new human rights as advocated by the appellants. The respondent points out that Canada has never assumed the obligation of offering refugee protection to persons who base their claims solely on the inability or unwillingness of their own national governments to meet health and medical care needs.\n[27] The Canadian jurisprudence on this issue is limited. There are only three recent decisions of the Federal Court which have considered this issue in varying depth. In Mazuryk v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2002), 112 A.C.W.S. (3d) 745 (F.C.T.D.), the applicant from the Ukraine claimed a risk to life on account of her deteriorating medical condition. She was suffering from Parkinson's disease and thyro-toxicosis. The Ukraine's inability to provide her with the medication and the medical services she required, at a cost that she could afford, was the basis of her claim under the earlier legislation. Dawson J. found, at para.25, that the risk to life in this case was not a risk which the Post-determination Refugee Claimants in Canada (PDRCC) Class (now the PRRA) is designed to provide protection against.\n[28] Likewise, in Singh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2004] 3 F.C.R. 323 (T.D.), the applicant claimed a risk to life on account of kidney failure and the inability of India to provide her with access to dialysis at a cost she could afford. The PRRA officer denied her application. On judicial review, the parties disputed the scope of the exclusion in subparagraph 97(1)(b)(iv), focusing primarily on the meaning of the phrase \"adequate health or medical care\" in subparagraph 97(1)(b)(iv). Russell J. stated the following (at paras.23 and 24):\nI believe the honest answer to this issue is that it is not entirely clear what Parliament's intent was in this regard, and that we are left to deal with a statutory provision that, on the facts of this Application, is somewhat ambiguous. The Applicants' arguments would mean accepting that Parliament intended to exclude risks based upon the non-availability of adequate health care but not risks associated with a particular applicant's ability to access adequate health care. Bill C-11 tells us that lack of \"appropriate\" health or medical care are not grounds for granting refugee protection under the IRPA and that these matters are more appropriately assessed by other means under the statute.\nThis leads me to the conclusion that the Respondent is correct on this issue. A risk to life under s. 97 should not include having to assess whether there is appropriate health and medical care available in the country in question. There are various reasons why health and medical care might be \"inadequate.\" It might not be available at all, or it might not be available to a particular applicant because he or she is not in a position to take advantage of it. If it is not within their reach, then it is not adequate to their needs.\n[29] Russell J., nevertheless, concluded that the PRRA officer was \"correct and committed no reviewable error\".\n[29] Most recently, in Travers v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2006), 53 Imm. L.R. (3d) 300 (F.C.T.D.), the applicant was diagnosed as HIV positive and claimed a risk to his life caused by the unwillingness of Zimbabwe to provide him with adequate medical care. Barnes J., in upholding the Board's denial of the application for refugee protection, held at para.25:\nI am in agreement with the decisions in Singh and Covarrubias. Given the findings of the Board in this case that Mr. Travers would not face discrimination or persecution in his access to treatment in Zimbabwe (such as it is), I do not believe that he can bring himself within the protection of section 97 of the IRPA. Even in countries with the most deficient health care systems, there will usually be access to quality medical care for persons with the means to pay for it. [...]\n[30] Barnes J. nevertheless opened the door to some claimants on the basis of unavailable health care (para.27):\nNotwithstanding my conclusions above and despite the Respondent's capable arguments, I am not satisfied that the section 97(1)(b)(iv) exclusion is so wide that it would preclude from consideration all situations involving a person's inability to access health care in his country of origin. Where access to life-saving treatment would be denied to a person for persecutorial reasons not otherwise caught by section 96 of the IRPA, a good case can be made out for section 97 protection. [...]\n[31] Having considered the parties' arguments and the limited authorities, I am of the view that the provision in issue is meant to be broadly interpreted, so that only in rare cases would the onus on the applicant be met. The applicant must establish, on the balance of probabilities, not only that there is a personalized risk to his or her life, but that this was not caused by the inability of his or her country to provide adequate health care. Proof of a negative is required, that is, that the country is not unable to furnish medical care that is adequate for this applicant. This is no easy task and the language and the history of the provision show that it was not meant to be.\n[30] The justices went on to opine that \"The inability of a country to provide adequate health or medical care generally can be distinguished from those situations where adequate health or medical care is provided to some individuals but not to others. The individuals who are denied treatment may be able to establish a claim under s. 97(1) (b) because in their case, their risk arises from the country's unwillingness to provide them with adequate care. These types of situations may also succeed under the refugee ground if the risk is associated with one of the Convention reasons. This was the situation in Ahmed,10 where Gibson J, allowed the appeal on the basis that the PDRC officer had not taken the applicant's particular health circumstances (schizophrenia and lack of family support) into consideration.\"\n[31] Holding that a sufficient evidentiary basis had not been established, the Court declined to answer the certified question and dismissed the appeal. The certified question being: -\n[58] whether, in view of the evidence before it, the exclusion of risk to life caused by the inability of a country to provide adequate medical care to a person suffering a life-threatening illness under section 97 of the IRPA infringes the Charter in a manner that does not accord with the principles of fundamental justice, and which cannot be justified under section 1 of the Charter.\n[32] Counsel for the claimants argues that the female claimant's health circumstances place her in a position analogous to Ahmed. In her view, Croatia's \"inability\" to provide health care results from the need of the claimants to pay bribes to doctors and medical personnel to secure prompt or any medical treatment. I am not in agreement with this view. I have already found that the \"need to pay bribes\" is not exclusive to the female claimant or pregnant women, and in my view, it is highly speculative what treatment the female claimant would or would not receive in the face of her diagnosis of XXXX XXXX XXXX. Therefore, I find that counsel's position is not supported or established.\n[33] In the international context, the question of whether exclusion is foreclosed where the outcome is speculative was addressed by the European Court of Human Rights. In a case involving the expulsion of a schizophrenic from the United Kingdom that Court held that while his expulsion could potentially violate Article 3 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the risks were purely speculative.\n[34] Article 3 of the Convention provides that, \"No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\" Article 3 finds repetition in section 97 (1) of IRPA.\n[35] The case note from the European Court of Human Rights reads as follows,\nBensaid v. The United Kingdom, May 6, 200111, concerned the expulsion of an Algerian, following findings by immigration officials that his indefinite leave to remain in the U.K. had been obtained by deception, his marriage being one of convenience. The applicant was a schizophrenic suffering from long-term mental illness. He argued that his expulsion would result in a relapse and the deterioration of his condition due to the difficulties obtaining medicine, and the stresses and violence involved with living in an area where there was active terrorism. While the Court recognized that, in principle, an expulsion with such consequences could violate Article 3, in this case, the risks were purely speculative.\n[36] The claimants have expressed a desire to have more children, however, as with Bensaid, I find that this is entirely speculative. They may or they may not have more children. Therefore, I am unable to find that the claimants have established that the female claimant is not caught by subparagraph 97 (1)(b)(iv). I also find that, if indeed there is a risk to the female claimant, the risk complained of is a risk based on the inability of Croatia to provide medical treatment to the female claimant, which is a risk that is expressly excluded by subparagraph 97 (1)(b)(iv).\nThe Female Claimant's other health issues\n[37] The female claimant has been diagnosed with mental health issues, to wit, mild depressive disorder,12 for which she is receiving treatment. When asked, she admitted that following the death of her grandmother when she was about twelve, her mother had taken her to consult with a psychiatrist or psychologist. This speaks to the availability of such services in Croatia. Accordingly, I am not persuaded that the female claimant would not be able to receive treatment for her depression in Croatia.\n[38] With respect to her XXXX XXXX XXXX mutation, the female claimant testified that in the normal course of her life she receives no special treatment. She does not take medications on a daily basis. In her words, she would \"bleed out\", if she were to do so. It is only during pregnancy that she is provided with XXXX XXXX. However, she is afraid that her condition might worsen as she ages.\n[39] The documentary evidence indicates that \"XXXX XXXX XXXX is a weak risk factor for developing XXXX XXXX; [and] in fact most people who have XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (like the female claimant) never develop XXXX XXXX.\"13 While it is acknowledged that the risk increases with age, I am of the view that it is not, at this point, possible to predict what course the female claimant's mutation will take, that is, that the risks are purely speculative. When the speculative nature of what the female claimant fears is coupled with the documentary evidence regarding the risks to her, I find that she is not excluded from the operation of subparagraph 97 (1)(b)(iv). Therefore, the female claimant is not a person in need of protection.\n[40] As stated earlier the male claimant's claim rests entirely on that of the female claimant, therefore I find that he too is not a person in need of protection.\nCONCLUSION\n[41] The claimants, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, claimed protection in Canada pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).14 For the reasons set out above, I find that the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\n\"H.

The principal claimant alleges that he is a XXXX.\n[4] The claimants allege that, on XXXX XXXX, 2013, the principal claimant was at a caf\u00e9, with a client, when the client was shot and killed. During the course of the fatal shooting, the principal claimant was shot in the XXXX. As the principal claimant's client died, he said \"the guerrillas have killed me.\" The principal claimant assumes that the client meant that the assailant was a member of the FARC was the assailant.\n[5] The claimants allege that the principal claimant was taken to the hospital, where he stayed for a little over a week. While there, the police interviewed him and he claims he was able to identify the shooter. The claimants allege that this led to the arrest of the shooter.\n[6] While the principal claimant's brother, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (XXXX), was visiting the principal claimant at the hospital, the claimants allege he was approached by two men. They claim that these two men told XXXX that they were going to kill the principal claimant, along with the rest of the claimants, for being an informer.\n[7] A few days later, the claimants allege that the principal claimant's other brother, XXXX XXXX XXXX (XXXX) was approached by two men outside of his home. They allege that these men told XXXX that they were going to kill the principal claimant and his family.\n[8] The female claimant and the minor claimants began to stay with the female claimant's mother, who also lives in Bogota. Upon his release from hospital, the principal claimant alleges he stayed there too.\n[9] The claimants lived there for about two and a half weeks before they left Colombia. The claimants left Colombia on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2013 and travelled to the United States of America. They then made their way to the border and claimed refugee protection on September 13, 2013.\n[10] Shortly after they left Colombia, they allege that another XXXX was abducted by the FARC. Although this man was able to flee, the claimants have heard that this man blames the claimants as this man believes he was mistaken for the principal claimant.\n[11] This claim was first heard by the RPD on November 5, 2013. On January 16, 2014, the RPD rendered a negative decision. The RPD found that the claimants had not rebutted the presumption of state protection in Colombia with clear and convincing evidence.\n[12] The claimants appealed this decision to the Federal Court of Canada. On XXXX XXXX XXXX2015, the Federal Court, on consent, returned the claim to the RPD for re-determination.\n[13] The first re-determination was heard by the RPD on January 18, 2018. On February 6, 2018, the RPD rendered another negative decision. The RPD found that, again, the claimants had not rebutted the presumption of state protection in Colombia with clear and convincing evidence.\n[14] The claimants appealed this second decision to the Federal Court of Canada. On XXXX XXXX, 2018, the Federal Court returned the claim to the RPD for a second re-determination. The Federal Court found that the RPD misstated and omitted key evidence.\n[15] This is the second re-determination of this claim.\n[16] In November of 2016, the government of Colombia and the FARC reached an agreement to end their 52-year armed conflict. This will be discussed further below.\nPROCEDURAL MATTERS\n[17] At the first RPD hearing held on November 5, 2013, the principal claimant was designated as a vulnerable person based on the psychological assessment of Dr. XXXX dated XXXX XXXX, 2013.4 This designation was maintained at the second RPD hearing held on January 18, 2018. As the designation was five and a half years old, at the commencement of the hearing held February 18, 2019, I asked the principal claimant a number of questions to determine whether he remained severely impaired from presenting his case and determined that he was no longer a vulnerable person.\n[18] A vulnerable person is a claimant whose ability to present his case is severely impaired.5 This designation is to address difficulties that go beyond those that are common to persons appearing before the RPD.6 The designation applies to the most severe cases of vulnerability.7\n[19] In making my decision, I considered the principal claimant's behaviour and statements during the first hour of the hearing. He was able to understand and respond to my questions. The principal claimant's answers were coherent and directly addressed the questions I posed. His answers were extremely detailed and he was able to articulate a timeline when my questions required it. For example, the principal claimant was able to put together a chronology regarding where he has lived since the 1990s. Further, he was able to communicate, not just what happened during these times in his life but, why these experiences were important and how they made him feel. This exhibited a higher form of communication. I found that the principal claimant's ability to present his case was no longer severely impaired.\n[20] I acknowledge that the principal claimant indicated that he was nervous and that talking about what happened in Colombia was hard for him. However, being nervous is natural in a setting where the stakes are high and the vast majority of claimants testifying before the RPD are nervous.\n[21] I considered both the psychological assessment of Dr. XXXX dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 20138 and the updated psychological assessment dated XXXX XXXX, 2018.9 The RPD was not provided with more up to date psychological assessment for this second re-determination. I find that neither of these psychological assessments indicate difficulties that go beyond what is common for those appearing before the RPD. Dr. XXXX diagnosed the principal claimant with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); however, this type of diagnosis is extremely common for people who appear before the RPD, as most claimants, if not all, have experienced trauma. In any event, Dr. XXXX assessments do not indicate a severe impairment. Dr. XXXX indicates that the principal claimant responded directly to questions during the assessment and cooperated fully.\n[22] Further, while the principal claimant has refused medication to treat PTSD, he is accessing counselling. He testified that this counselling has improved his sleep habits as well as his stress levels. I acknowledge that the claimant lost his train of thought one time during the course of the questioning; however, this is common, even in everyday conversations with the average person.\n[23] Further, the principal claimant is currently working as a XXXX XXXX in Canada. He spoke about his work on the frontlines connecting with XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX. He described duties which demonstrated that, in the work place, he has exhibited superior communication and organizational skills.\n[24] While I am not certain how the principal claimant presented at the first RPD hearing or the second, given his ability to answer my questions with precision and detail, I did not find that he was severely impaired from presenting his case. I de-designated the principal claimant as a vulnerable person.\n[25] In communicating my decision to de-designate the principal claimant as a vulnerable person, I advised that I did not intend to ask any questions directly about the shooting itself. However, during the course of the hearing, the principal claimant testified that he was at risk because he was the only witness to the shooting. However, the shooting occurred on the patio of a caf\u00e9; and the claimants tendered an article wherein other witnesses are interviewed by a reporter.10 Therefore, I asked the principal claimant whether any of these other witnesses were interviewed by police, like he was, in order to assess his forward facing risk. The claimant answered that he did not know but became upset as he remembered back to the shock he felt at being shot. Counsel objected to my question, indicating that I was doing exactly what I said I would not do. I do not agree. I did not ask the claimant any questions about the shooting, I simply asked, to the best of his knowledge, whether anyone else was interviewed by police. While I acknowledge that the claimant became upset as he remembered the incident, my question was periphery in nature and not in contradiction to my earlier indication of the type of questions I would be posing.\nDETERMINATION\n[26] I find that the claimants are not Convention Refugees as they do not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Colombia. Further, I find that they are not people in need of protection as their removal to Colombia would not subject them personally to a risk to life, to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or to a danger of torture.\nISSUES\n[27] There are four issues in this claim:\na. Have the claimants established their identities?\nb. Is there a nexus to the Convention?\nc. Is there a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) for these claimants in Colombia?\nd. Are there compelling reasons, arising out of the previous harm, which would allow the claim to be accepted, despite the fact that the reasons for which the claimant sought refugee protection have ceased to exist?\nANALYSIS\nHave the claimants established their identities?\n[28] The claimants' identities are established by the supporting documentation filed; namely, certified copies of their passports.11 I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that all of the claimants are citizens of Colombia.\nIs there a nexus to the Convention?\n[29] I find that the claimants' fear is not linked to any of the five (5) Convention grounds; namely, race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group.\n[30] Counsel argues that this claim has a nexus; either (1) an imputed anti-FARC political opinion or (2) as a member of a particular social group being a witness of crime. I do not agree.\n[31] Counsel submits that FARC has imputed a political opinion to the principal claimant because he identified one of its alleged members as an assassin to the police. Counsel submits that the principal claimant, in doing so, took an action against the FARC to the extent that FARC would impute a political opinion to him.\n[32] To find that there is a nexus, the harm inflicted on the claimants must be for reasons of one of the five convention grounds. The principal claimant was not shot \"for reasons of\" his political opinion. The principal claimant was shot as an innocent bystander. Further, FARC did not tell the principal claimant's brothers that he and his family were going to be killed \"for reasons of\" his political opinion. The evidence is that the threat was for being an informer to the police. Even in cases where murders are committed by government agents, the Court has found that a political opinion could not be imputed merely as a result of witnessing and reporting a crime.12 Identifying the assassin to the police is a sign of the principal claimant's integrity, it is not an expression of a political opinion; it is more of a criminal nature.13\n[33] Counsel also argues that the claimants are members of a particular social group; namely, witnesses of crime. However, a claimant who witnessed a murder is at risk not because of membership in a particular social group but because of a very personal characteristic, namely, his ability to give evidence which could lead to a prosecution.14 I find that the claimants are not members of a particular social group.\n[34] The Federal Court has held that victims of crime, corruption or vendettas generally fail to establish a link between their fear of persecution and one of the Convention grounds in the definition of a Convention refugee.15 In this case, the claimants' risk is based upon a vendetta the FARC would have against the principal claimant for identifying one of its alleged members to the police.\n[35] In this case, given that the claimants fear retaliation because the principal claimant identified a suspect of a crime to police, I find that their fear is not linked to any of the five (5) convention grounds as it is a personal vendetta. As a result, this claim fails under section 96 of the IRPA. I will go on to consider section 97 below.\nIs there a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) for these claimants in Colombia?\n[36] The claimants have an IFA in Colombia; namely, Barranquilla, Atl\u00e1ntico. I make this finding because, on a balance of probabilities, claimants are not at a risk of harm in Barranquilla and the claimants have profiles of people who could reasonably relocate there.\nRisk of the claimants being harmed in Barranquilla\n[37] I find that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimants would not face a risk of harm in Barranquilla because: the FARC does not continue to have the ability to locate people like they once did, and they no longer seem motivated to find the claimants, in any event.\nFARC's Ability to Locate the Claimants\n[38] I find that, given the FARC's weakened state as a result of the peace accord, they no longer have the ability to locate people like they once did.\n[39] After four years of formal peace negotiations, the Colombian Government signed a revised final peace accord with the FARC in November 2016, which was subsequently ratified by the Colombian Congress.16 The accord calls for members of the FARC to demobilize, disarm, and reincorporate into society and politics, and it creates an alternative system for transitional justice to address accountability for conflict-related crimes and established truth-telling mechanisms.17\n[40] The FARC completed demobilization in February of 2017 with around 6,900 FARC members, in 26 transition zones, taking part.18 They completed disarmament on August 15, 2017. Estimates indicate that more than 11,000 fighters and collaborators from the FARC handed over their weapons.19 The FARC launched their own political party on September 1, 2017.20 Reintegration of FARC members into society, which entails educational programmes for former FARC members in demobilisation camps, has started.21 The Colombian government and the FARC have agreed to remove landmines and explosives, aiming to complete demining by 2025.22\n[41] Before demobilisation, the FARC had approximately 5,700 foot soldiers, and allegedly made USD 500-600 million profit from the illicit drug trade.23 The FARC was active throughout the country, but especially in Arauca, Meta, Norte de Santander, Cauca, and Antioquia.24\n[42] Some units and members of the FARC broke off from the organization at various stages of the peace process.25 In total, an estimated 800 to 1,000 dissidents did not participate in the demobilization.26 The Colombian military estimates that the dissident groups count some 1,200 members.27 Counsel has provided a report that indicates that there are 1,400 dissidents.28 Other sources put the number of FARC members who did not demobilize at approximately 1,500, which accounts for 15% of former FARC members. It seems that the FARC lost, at most, approximately 85% of its membership in the peace process.\n[43] Of the remaining 15%, who are supported by drug trafficking and illegal mining,29 demobilisation has caused a split within this dissident group, with some members refusing to demobilise and others defecting or deserting.30 While there has been a movement by General Duarte to unite the FARC dissidents,31 they are currently decentralised.32\n[44] Further, this \"movement\" recently encountered a huge setback when the person in charge of regrouping former FARC militants, Rodrigo Cadete, was killed in an operation carried out by the Colombian security forces.33 An article published in Insight Crime indicates that the death of FARC dissident leader, Rodrigo Cadete, dealt a severe blow to the FARC dissidents who wish to reunite. Therefore, attempts to unite the dissidents have been derailed.34\n[45] However, the article also indicates that his effort to unite the dissidents had not been overly successful to begin with. According to Insight Crime, Cadete had attempted to unite with the 48th front but the proposal was rejected.35 The article also indicates that the Colombian security forces have also recently neutralized \"Gaucho,\" who led the Oliver Sinisterra front in the southern part of Nari\u00f1o.36 This was also seen as a major blow to the FARC dissidents.37 The article goes on to state that the numbers of high-ranking dissidents with both criminal and military experience is dwindling.38\n[46] Counsel also provided an article that indicates that the Colombia security forces also killed, Robinson, the head of FARC dissident group 28 in Boyaca.39\n[47] The FARC is not the powerful guerrilla group it once was when the principal claimant witnessed his client being murdered.\n[48] The major dissident faction is the FARC's \"First Front,\" which counts some 400 fighters and operates mainly in Guaviare and Meta departments.40 Other estimates include approximately 110 members or 200 members.41\n[49] A smaller number of dissidents, originating from the \"8th Front,\" is active in Cauca department.42\n[50] Other dissidents formed criminal groups or aligned with criminal organizations, for example in Tumaco, Nari\u00f1o department.43 Some 400 FARC dissidents are estimated to be active in Tumaco.\n[51] A group composed of an estimated 300 former FARC members is operating along the border with Ecuador in Putumayo department.44\n[52] What is clear from all of objective documents is that the FARC dissident presence is largely concentrated near the borders of Panama and Ecuador, as well as in the Meta department, where the flat plains transform into Amazonian jungle and rivers take over from roads as the main transport arteries for drug trafficking. Further, and most importantly, none of these documents indicate that the FARC dissidents are active in Atl\u00e1ntico, the department in which Barranquilla is located, or any of Atl\u00e1ntico's surrounding departments.\n[53] Counsel has submitted a letter from Mr. XXXX XXXX, who is the editor of a website called XXXX XXXX.45 Mr. XXXX has apparently \"evaluated the security risk for two former victims of the FARC....\"46 In order to do this he has reviewed the Basis of Claim forms for these people.47 I, on the other hand, have not been provided with this information. Therefore, given that I am unable to determine if the facts of that case are similar to the facts of the case before me, Mr. XXXX opinion as to these people's risk is of limited assistance to me. Further, this letter seems to address the risk for these people in Bogota;48 however, I have not suggested that the claimants return to Bogota.\n[54] This letter advises the RPD to be careful in relying on maps used by various organizations to track the activity of armed actors because they are based on a specific period of time and only include the activities the particular group has taken credit for.49 Mr. XXXX indicates that these maps do not predict where future security risks may present themselves.50 This statement by Mr. XXXX is trite as obviously nobody can perfectly predict the future. Mr. XXXX indicates that there could possibly be more activity that a particular actor has not taken credit for.51 While there could be, there also could not be. The RPD is required to make a determination on a balance of probabilities. It is also required to make a decision on the evidence before it. There are a number of resources before the RPD that indicate where the FARC has been active in recent times. On a balance of probabilities, it is likely that where the evidence indicates that they are active is where they are currently active. While I accept that Mr. XXXX worries that there could be additional activity not accounted for or there may be other places where FARC could be active in the future, the determination is to be based on a standard of \"more likely than not, based on the current evidence\" before me, not whether there is a mere possibility that something may change.\n[55] While initially the FARC party leadership tried to maintain some contact with dissidents to convince them to return to the peace process, the FARC party leaders have since renounced the dissidents and emphasized that the group will move forward as a peaceful political party.52 On October 31, 2017 the government authorised the targeting of the FARC dissident groups with air strikes.53\n[56] Counsel argues that the demobilization process only applies to the soldiers, but not to the \"Popular Militia,\" who are allegedly the guerrillas inside the cities. However, the evidence indicates that both fighters and collaborators were affected by the demobilization54. In any event, there is no evidence to suggest that these people, if they exist, are actively targeting people within Barranquilla. Absent evidence to the contrary, on a balance of probabilities, the demobilization weakened both the soldiers in the field and their collaborators within the city.\n[57] I acknowledge that the FARC used to be a powerful and violent force operating throughout Colombia with the ability to gain access to a variety of public and private institutions; however, this is no longer the case. Approximately 85% of the FARC members have demobilized, disarmed and formed a peaceful political party. The remaining 15% are not part of a central, authoritative location or group but are fragmented.\n[58] What is clear from the documents is that: (1) the number of FARC dissidents is small in comparison to those who laid down their arms; (2) FARC dissidents are currently decentralized; (3) they are not located in the IFA city of Barranquilla or its surrounding area; (4) and Colombia, as compared to when the claimants left, is much safer. Given this, I am not persuaded, on a balance of probabilities, that the FARC dissidents would have the ability to locate the claimants or that they would use their limited manpower and left over resources to do so.\nFARC's Ongoing Motivation to Locate the Claimants\n[59] I am also not persuaded that the FARC is motivated to find the claimants because nobody in the claimants' family has been approached regarding their whereabouts, since XXXX XXXX, 2013.\n[60] While I acknowledge that the principal claimant's brothers were approached within days of the shooting, over the last five and a half years, nobody has followed up with them as to the whereabouts of the claimants. For example, the principal claimant has his two brothers as well as a sister who continue to live in Bogota. The FARC even knew where XXXX lived (although he has since moved) and did not bother to follow up with him. The female claimant also has two brothers in Bogota as well as her parents, all of whom have never been approached.\n[61] The claimants allege that another XXXX was held by FARC in XXXX of 2013 and this was a case of mistaken identity. But, again, this was five and a half years ago and nothing has happened since. The female claimant continues to have contact with a former colleague and there has been no indication of an ongoing hunt for the claimants within the XXXX community. Another XXXX even bought their XXXX and they have not heard any rumours of ongoing targeting at their former XXXX.\n[62] The claimants suggest that the FARC has not followed up with anyone because they have the resources to know that the claimants have left Colombia. In a Response to Information Request dated April 9, 2013, it states that guerrillas groups can trace people living aboard; however, it is based on the behaviour of the individual rather than a structure to detect the immigration and emigration of people.55 Therefore it does not seem as if the FARC has an institutionalized system to detect that the claimants have left Colombia. The Response goes on to say that guerrilla groups can watch family; however, the evidence is clear that there has been no ongoing contact or intimidation of the claimants' family.\n[63] It seems that, since the claimants left Colombia in XXXX of 2013, nothing has happened to indicate that the FARC remains interested in the claimants. Given this, I am not persuaded that the FARC dissidents have the motivation to locate the claimants if they were to move to Barranquilla.\n[64] Counsel argues that there is no evidence to suggest that lengthy absences from Colombia will make these claimants safe. He points to a Response to Information Request dated April 9, 2013 which indicates that, if a person is an objective of high value, family and assets can be watched and, if the victim returns to Colombia and makes contact with these family members, these groups can locate the victim.56 However, in this case, we know that the claimants' family has had no contact with the FARC is over five and a half years, so there is no indication that they are being watched. Further, this Response was prepare in 2013 when the FARC had the ability to track down victims throughout the country. As discussed above, the FARC is now weak and decentralized. I am not persuaded that they continue to have this ability.\n[65] Counsel also submits that the UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Asylum-Seekers from Colombia states that IFA, for victims of the FARC, is unreasonable.57 However, this document is also dated. It was prepared in 2015, prior to the demobilization. IFA may have been unreasonable in 2015, when the FARC was powerful. However, the FARC is now demobilized, has lost 85% of its members and, those that remain, are decentralized.\n[66] Lastly, counsel submits that the FARC dissidents are working with other criminal organizations. While this is true, it is highly speculative to suggest that: (1) the faction of the FARC that was interested in the claimants are dissidents and have not laid down their arms like 85% of other members; (2) that the faction that was interested in the claimants also have joined another criminal organization; and (3) that this new criminal organization has the same interest in using its resources to harm the claimants. The likelihood of all three of these factors coming together is slim.\n[67] I find that the FARC dissidents have neither the ability, nor the motivation, to pursue the claimants in Barranquilla given their weakened state, decentralization and that they are not active in the area.\nConditions in Barranquilla and the Claimants' Profiles\n[68] The principal claimant has two university degrees, one as a XXXX XXXX and the other as a XXXX XXXX. He specialized in XXXX on XXXX XXXX. The principal claimant worked as a XXXX in both Germany and in Colombia. He has worked in XXXX owned by others as well as owning and operating his own XXXX. The principal claimant currently works as a XXXX XXXX in Canada. Likewise, the female claimant also has a degree in XXXX XXXX and XXXX as a XXXX in Colombia.\n[69] The education and employment histories of these claimants will allow them to find work in Barranquilla. They could either practise in a XXXX owned by someone else or re-start their own. The principal claimant testified that the most important thing was to have passion for XXXX and he definitely exhibited this in his testimony.\n[70] Barranquilla is a large metropolitan city with a population of 2 million people.58 While I acknowledge that there are some criminal groups located in Barranquilla, it is speculative to suggest that the claimants would become targets of a different criminal organization if they were to return to Colombia.\n[71] Counsel argues that returnees to Colombia are internally displaced people and the documents show that this is very difficult. However, when the documents refer to internally displaced people they are largely referring to people whose land was stolen from them and they are trying to reclaim it.59 The documents are referring to people who are poverty stricken. They are not referring to people like the claimants, who are highly educated, with strong employment backgrounds.\n[72] I have also considered whether the principal claimant's PTSD diagnosis would make it unreasonable for him to relocate to Barranquilla and find that the claimants have not shown this on a balance of probabilities. His most recent assessment is over a year old and he is working in Canada. The principal claimant has been able to re-establish himself in Canada and I find that PTSD would not prohibit him from doing the same in Barranquilla, which is quite far away, over a 15 hour drive, from his home in Bogota.\n[73] I find that the claimants have not met their burden of proving that Barranquilla is an unreasonable place for them to move to.\nAre there compelling reasons, arising out of the previous harm, which would allow the claim to be accepted, despite the fact that the reasons for which the claimant sought refugee protection have ceased to exist?\n[74] While this decision has not turned on a change of circumstances in Colombia, but rather on IFA, the demobilization has played a central role in my analysis. As such, I have also assessed whether there are compelling reasons to accept this claim.\n[75] The RPD is required to give recognition of refugee status on humanitarian grounds to this special and limited category of persons, i.e. those who have suffered such appalling persecution that their experience alone is compelling reason not to return them, even though they may no longer have any reason to fear further persecution.60 However, the exceptional circumstances envisaged must apply only to a tiny minority of present day claimants.61\n[76] The case law indicates that the threshold necessary to demonstrate \"compelling reasons\" is a high one. It must be remembered that the nature of all persecution, by definition, involves death, physical harm or other penalties. The compelling reasons exception only applies to extraordinary cases in which the persecution is relatively so exceptional, that even in the wake of changed circumstances, it would be wrong to return refugee claimants.62\n[77] While I am sure the principal claimant considers being shot as an innocent bystander, and his resulting PTSD diagnosis, fits within the scope of the compelling reasons exception, I am not persuaded that this treatment is sufficiently atrocious or appalling to trigger the \"compelling reasons\" exception.\n[78] Examples of the treatment where the compelling reasons exception has been applied are: when the claimant had suffered serious physical and sexual abuse while in detention for 45 days, and his relatives had been killed;63 the claimant was brutally and severely ill-treated by government agents while in detention, including being hung upside down for long periods of time, being burnt with hot irons and cigarette fire, being whipped on the back and being made to expose his genitalia to the guards who inserted broom sticks and needles into his penis;64 and when the claimant was sexually assaulted as a tool by the police against the claimant's sexual orientation.65\n[79] I am not persuaded that the facts of this case rise to the level of atrocious or appalling to trigger the \"compelling reasons\" exception.\nCONCLUSION\n[80] Having considered all the evidence, I determine that, for these claimants, there is a viable IFA in Barranquilla. Barranquilla is both a reasonable place for them to seek refuge and, on a balance of probabilities, they will not be at risk of harm there.\n[81] Therefore, there is not a serious possibility that the claimants will be persecuted in Colombia, or that, on a balance or probabilities, they would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if returned to Colombia. Accordingly, their claims for refugee protection are rejected.\n(signed)\nM. A. McColl\nM. A.

The Principal Claimant is a professional XXXX but is also trained as a XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. She was employed as a XXXX employee with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The associate Claimant, who is first cousin to the Principal Claimant, is a professional in XXXX XXXX and prior coming to Canada, worked in XXXX. They alleged that they were being persecuted by the ELN. They made a denunciation on XXXX XXXX, 2017 in Colombia and shortly thereafter, on XXXX XXXX, 2017, the Claimants departed their country.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] Having considered the totality of the evidence, the Panel finds that the Claimants are not Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA or persons in need of protection, pursuant to s. 97 of IRPA. 3 The claims fails on the availability of adequate state protection.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[4] The Claimants' personal identities as a nationals of Colombia are established on a balance of probabilities, by certified copies of their Colombian passports.4\nNexus\n[5] The Panel finds that the ELN targeted the Principal Claimant for reasons beyond the expansion of their criminal enterprise. The Panel is satisfied that on the facts of the claimant's case, the ELN targeted the Principal Claimant because she refused to cooperate with the ELN, by releasing confidential data such as addresses, fixed telephone numbers, places frequented by XXXX XXXX XXXX and further, XXXX XXXX XXXX against the ELN. It was on this basis that the ELN made the Principal Claimant a target. In the Panel's view, from the perspective of the agent of persecution, the Principal Claimant's refusal to cooperate and provide information to their organization was perceived as opposition to their explicitly political objectives in Colombia. As a result, they imputed to her an anti-ELN political opinion. This is distinguishable from refusals to comply with ELN extortion demands in general that do not have a nexus to the State.\n[6] The Panel finds that the Claimants have established a nexus to a Convention ground, namely, for the principal Claimant, based upon her imputed anti-ELN political opinion; and for the Associate Claimant, based on her membership in a particular social group, family.\nObjective Basis: Risk of Persecution and State Protection\nObjective Basis: Risk of Persecution\n[7] The National Documentation Package (NDP) for Colombia corroborates the objective basis for the Claimants' fears. The Colombian government signed a revised final peace accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in November 2016, completing FARC demobilization in February 2017. In contrast, the peace process with the ELN has stalled. The ceasefire with the ELN ended in January 2018 after the armed group resumed attacks and the government suspended the peace negotiations.5 Since the end of the ceasefire with the ELN, \"armed conflict has intensified in many regions of Colombia\" and some FARC dissidents have joined the ELN, leading to an expansion of its territory and operations.\"6\n[8] The ELN is \"Colombia's biggest guerilla group\" and has somewhere between 1,500 to 2,500 combatants which operate in war fronts or urban militias which function as \"independent groups loosely united under central authority.\"7 The ELN continues to \"regularly carry out kidnappings, extortion, assassinations, bombings, and other terrorist activities\" and is increasing and expanding its operations in Colombia into areas formerly controlled by the FARC with an active presence mostly in the NortheastChoco, and parts of the Pacific coast.8 They also maintain a Guerro Urbano front in Barranquilla, C\u00facuta, Medell\u00edn, Barrancabermeja, Bogot\u00e1, Ibagu\u00e9, Cali, Popay\u00e1n and Neiva.9 The ELN has been \"consolidating and even expanding their power in key areas\" and continues to engage in kidnappings, bomb attacks, recruitment of children, and the killing of civilians.10\n[9] The Panel finds that the Claimants' claims are objectively well-founded. The totality of the country condition documentation supports their allegations. Therefore, the Panel finds that the Claimants have a well-founded fear of persecution.\nState Protection\n[10] There is a presumption, except in situations where the state is in a complete breakdown, that it is capable of protecting its nationals.11 A claimant who alleges that state protection is inadequate must persuade me that, on a balance of probabilities, the evidence establishes that the state protection is inadequate.12 In this case, the Refuge Protection Division is not obliged to prove that Colombia can offer the Claimants effective state protection; rather, the Claimants bear the legal burden of rebutting the presumption that inadequate state protection exists by adducing clear and convincing evidence which satisfies the Panel on a balance of probabilities.13\n[11] While the effectiveness of the protection is a relevant consideration,14 the preponderance of Federal Court decisions have held that the test for a finding of state protection is whether the protection is adequate.15 The protection need not be perfect.16\n[12] In determining whether protection is adequate, it is important to consider both whether a legislative and procedural framework for protection exists and also whether the state, through the police or other authorities, is able and willing to implement that framework.17\n[13] While the state's efforts are relevant to an assessment of state protection, they are not determinative. The efforts must have actually translated into adequate state protection at the operational level.18 But again, no government is expected to guarantee perfect protection to all of its citizens at all times, as no state can guarantee perfect protection.19\n[14] Furthermore, the law states that the burden to prove an absence of state protection is directly proportional to the level of democracy of that state.20\n[15] Despite decades of internal conflict and drug related security challenges, Colombia maintains relatively strong democratic institutions characterized by peaceful, transparent elections and the protection of civil liberties.21\n[16] The Principal Claimant is a XXXX employee of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\nThe Claimants initially made a denunciation on XXXX XXXX, 2017 and shortly thereafter, left Colombia on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018. The Claimants did not give the state the opportunity to protect them. They left the country within three days of making their denunciation. The Claimants must give the authorities sufficient opportunity to respond to the request for assistance.22 Doubting the effectiveness of protection offered by the state, when one has not really tested it, does not rebut the existence of a presumption of state protection.23\n[17] The Claimants' provided a BOC amendment declaring that the Principal Claimant's father was approached by the ELN, making threats against his daughter. The father was later advised on XXXX XXXX, 2017 by the Fiscallia that the criminal complaint the Principal Claimant filed on XXXX XXXX, 2017 was in the process of being distributed.24 According to the Principal Claimant's testimony, the lastes times the ELN had any contact or shown any interest in the Claimants' families were on XXXX XXXX, 2017 with the Associate's Claimant's brother and further on XXXX XXXX, 2017, with the Principal Claimant's family. Given the Claimants were no longer in Colombia, it is not unreasonable that the Fiscallia may not attach the same level of urgency to the matter.\n[18] The Claimants' BOC amendments also noted that the Associate Claimant's brother, XXXX, approached the Fiscalia to put in a denunciation with respect two incidents involving suspicious men at his workplace.25 While the Panel accepts that these incidences occurred, on a balance of probabilities, given the particular circumstances of the Claimants, the Panel does not find that state protection would not be forthcoming, upon their return to Colombia.\n[19] Further, the Panel finds that the Claimants did not exhaust their options for state protection. It does not seem as if the Claimants applied to the UNP, the unit with the ability and resources to provide the longer-term protection they desired. A claimant must show that they have taken all reasonable steps in the circumstances to seek protection.26 Given the Principal Claimant is an employee with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, she would have been eligible for this program and the Panel would reasonably expect the Claimants to exhaust all avenues for protection available. Further, in this particular case, it is likely that these Claimants would have access to more resources than the average person given the Principal Claimant's position with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[20] With respect to the protection that would be available to these particular Claimants, the Ministry of the Interior has developed an agency called that National Protection Unit (Unidad Nacional de Protecci\u00f3n, UNP). The UNP is responsible for providing protection to individuals, groups of persons, or communities that, given their position or activities, may be subjected to extraordinary or extreme risk.27\n[21] The UNP indicates that the program grants protection measures either: (1) based on the risk that a person faces; or (2) based on their position.28 In this case, the Principal Claimant is employed in the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX dealing with highly sensitive information pertaining operations and security officials' particulars. Give this position, the Panel finds that the Principal Claimant would have access to this program, if the Claimants were in the danger they allege.\n[22] Further, the protection, available to the Principal Claimant through the UNP, would extend to the Principal Claimant's family. For example, the UNP took measures with the aim of protecting the life of a social leader and his family.29 Also, with respect to an example of teachers, the protection and relocation of teachers falls under the Ministry of National Education and the departmental education secretaries but, the UNP retains responsibilities for the risk analysis and protection of family members.30 Therefore, if the Principal Claimant's family was at risk, the protection provided by UNP would extend to the Principal Claimant's family if the Claimants had applied to the Program.\n[23] Protection measures provided to people by the UNP include: (1) personal security details, which include bodyguards, vehicles, and bullet-proof vests; (2) transportation-related costs by land or sea, or plane tickets for national and international flights; (3) temporary relocation assistance, which consists of a monthly sum for up to three months (or six months in \"exceptional cases\") to help cover relocation-related costs; (4) moving-related costs; (5) telecommunication devices; and (6) the armoring of property.31\n[24] The Director of the UNP also indicated that protection measures are assigned for a minimum of one year; but, there is no limit on the duration.32 Each case is re-evaluated every year to determine if the person still needs protection.33\n[25] Further, the UNP has a large budget. UNP indicates that the budget for 2014 was 470.1 billion Colombian pesos [approximately C$196 million], and for 2015 the UNP was assigned 371.3 billion pesos [approximately C$152.3 million].34 In the course of 2016, the budget of the UNP came to US$ 151 million35 [approximately C$197 million].\n[26] The UNP had, as of the end of 2014, 506 \"conventional\" vehicles, 1,022 armored vehicles, 1,195 fuel cards, and 2,872 bodyguards, of which 324 were UNP personnel and the rest belonged to private security agencies.36\n[27] In order to apply for protection, a person must submit the following documents: (1) an application form, (2) a copy of the national identification card (C\u00e9dula de ciudadan\u00eda), (3) an original copy of a document that evidences membership to one or more of the groups considered to be a \"target population,\" and (4) an original copy of a police complaint or evidence of prosecution related to the case, if available.37 These documents can be submitted via email or to one of the UNP offices.38 There is no evidence before the Panel that shows the Claimants or for that matter, any of the Claimants' family members who remained in Colombia, applied to the Program.\n[28] Colombia has taken measures to protect a large and growing number of persons at risk as well as invested a considerable amount of economic resources so that the program can perform its functions.39 As of June 2016, the UNP has adopted measures to guarantee the rights to life, security, and humane treatment for 8,138 persons, among them political leaders, human rights defenders, trade union activists, representatives of ethnic groups, members of the Medical Mission, journalists, victims, and public officials, among others.40\n[29] The Panel acknowledges that the UNP program has been criticized for its bureaucratic delays;41 however, the Program has saved lives.42 Further, while the risk assessments are being conducted, people are covered by preventive measures taken by the National Police;43 and, in cases of imminent and exceptional risk, an expeditious procedure is provided for.44 As the Principal Claimant was an employee with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the Panel finds, more likely than not, protection would be forthcoming to these Claimants.\n[30] The Panel finds, in these particular circumstances, given the Principal Claimant's employment with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, that the Claimants have access to adequate state protection.\n[31] The Panel further finds that the Claimants have not rebutted the presumption of adequate state protection.\nConclusion\n[32] The Panel find that these Claimants are not Convention refugees, pursuant to s. 96 of IRPA or persons in need of protection, pursuant to s. 97 of IRPA.45\n[33] Therefore, the claims are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"E.

The question of inclusion is postponed pending the disposition of this matter.\nBackground\n[6] The claimants are a family of three, the claimants XXXX and XXXX were born in Afghanistan and the claimant XXXX was born in Italy.\n[7] They entered Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2018, from the United States of America (US).\n[8] The claimants previously resided in Italy.\nLegislative Provisions\n[9] The text of all statutory provisions referred to in these reasons is attached as Schedule \"A\". Section 98 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (IRPA) incorporates Article 1E of the Convention into domestic law. For ease of reference, the text of section 98 as well as Article 1E is set out below.\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27\n98. A person referred to in section E or F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\nUnited Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, 189 U.N.T.S. 150\n1E. This Convention shall not apply to a person who is recognized by the competent authorities of the country in which he has taken residence as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of the nationality of that country.\nLoi sur l'immigration et la protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, L.C. 2001, ch.27\n98. La personne vis\u00e9e aux sections E ou F de l'article premier de la Convention sur les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s ne peut avoir la qualit\u00e9 de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 ni de personne \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger.\nConvention des Nations Unies relative au statut des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, 189 U.N.T.S. 150\n1E. Cette Convention ne sera pas applicable \u00e0 une personne consid\u00e9r\u00e9e par les autorit\u00e9s comp\u00e9tentes du pays dans lequel cette personne a \u00e9tabli sa r\u00e9sidence comme ayant les droits et les obligations attach\u00e9s \u00e0 la possession de la nationalit\u00e9 de ce pays.\nThe Law\n[10] The test for Article 1(E) exclusion is set out in paragraph 28 of Zeng which provides,\n[28] Considering all relevant factors to the date of the hearing, does the claimant have status, substantially similar to that of its nationals, in the third country? If the answer is yes, the claimant is excluded. If the answer is no, the next question is whether the claimant previously had such status and lost it, or had access to such status and failed to acquire it. If the answer is no, the claimant is not excluded under Article 1E. If the answer is yes, the RPD must consider and balance various factors. These include, but are not limited to, the reason for the loss of status (voluntary or involuntary), whether the claimant could return to the third country, the risk the claimant would face in the home country, Canada's international obligations, and any other relevant facts.4\n[11] In undertaking an analysis of a principle claimant's basic rights in a third country, the Board should consider the following for criteria: (a) the right to return to the country of residence; (b) the right to work freely without restrictions; (c) the right to study, and (d) full access to social services in the country of residence.5\n[12] Determinations concerning the rights set out in Shamlou do not necessarily involve the strict consideration of all factors regarding residency, as the analysis depends largely on the particular nature of the case at hand.6\n[13] In asserting that a claimant is excluded under Article 1(E), the Minister must establish a prima facie case that the claimants is excluded from the Refugee Convention by virtue of the claimant's status in another country. Once the Minister has demonstrated that a prima facie case exists, the onus shifts to the claimant to demonstrate that the claimant no longer has that status.7\nFacts in Evidence\n[14] It is the claimant XXXX evidence that he is a citizen of Afghanistan who fled that country in 2008, and eventually travelled to Italy where he made a claim for refugee protection. The claimant XXXX was granted \"Subsidiary Protection Status\" on XXXX XXXX, 2009.8 In Italy a person is entitled to Subsidiary Protection and a Residency Permit for Subsidiary Protection (Permesso di Soggiorno per Protezione Sussidiaria) if they don't fulfill all the requirements for refugee status.9 A person who has been granted Subsidiary Protection in Italy is entitled to work in Italy, access the Italian healthcare, public education, and welfare systems and can bring family to Italy through family reunification.10 They are also entitled to apply for Italian citizenship after ten (10) years and obtain a \"Titolo di Viaggio,\" a travel document if they are not able to obtain a passport from their country of nationality, and after five (5) years of living in Italy apply for a \"Permesso UE per Soggiornanti de Lungo Periodo\" an EU Long Term Residency Permit.11\n[15] After receiving his Residency Permit for Subsidiary Protection, the claimant XXXX settled in XXXX Italy and found employment as an XXXX and then as a XXXX XXXX at a XXXX XXXX in XXXX, Italy.12 In 2014, the claimants XXXX and XXXX were married in Kabul Afghanistan. The claimant XXXX applied to bring his wife to Italy shortly after the marriage and she was issued an Italian Family visa on XXXX XXXX, 2015. She travelled to Italy on XXXX XXXX, 2015.13 Two years later, the claimant XXXX applied for and obtained a \"Permesso di Soggiorno\" (Family type of Residency Permit) that was issued on XXXX XXXX, 2017, valid to XXXX XXXX, 2019. This permit allowed her to work.\n[16] The claimant XXXX testified that he applied for and obtained an EU Long Term Residency Permit in 2015, which he renewed in 2017 when his son's name was added to the permit.14 There is no expiry date indicated on this permit, rather, after the words \"Expiry date\" is printed \"UNLIMITED.\"\n[17] The claimant XXXX applied for Italian citizenship in 2016 which was denied because he had not fulfilled the ten year residency requirement set under his immigration status.15\n[18] The claimant XXXX was born in Italy on XXXX XXXX, 2016,16 he is not an Italian citizen. Pursuant to Article 1, paragraph 1(b) of the Italian Citizenship Law, the child is not a citizen of Italy17 because under Article 9(2) of the Law on Citizenship of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, he is considered a citizen of Afghanistan.18 On XXXX XXXX, 2017, the child's name was added to his father's EU Long Term Residency card (see footnote 10). On XXXX XXXX, 2014, the child was issued a \"Documento Di Viaggio\" an Italian Travel Document that is not a passport.\n[19] In mid-2017 the claimants XXXX and XXXX applied for US visitor visas, which were issued on XXXX XXXX. They travelled to the US entering at Dulles International Airport on XXXX XXXX, 2017. The claimant XXXX applied for a Canadian visa which was not forthcoming, so he applied for a US visa on XXXX XXXX, 2017, which was issued. He left Italy in XXXX 2017 and joined his family in the US.\nANALYSIS\nDo the claimants have status in Italy?\n[20] Having obtained Subsidiary Protection in 2009, I find that the claimant XXXX was granted a Residency Permit for Subsidiary Protection that entitled him to a number of rights similar to those available to Italian citizens. In 2015 he applied for and received an EU residence permit for long-term residents (i.e., available to persons legally in Italy for at least five years) under Article 9 of Legislative Decree n. 286, 1998, which sets out the regulations on immigration and rules about the conditions of aliens.19\n[21] I find that as a EU Long Term Permanent Resident, the claimant was entitled to: reside in Italy and to enter its territory without a visa; freedom of movement; work; make use of welfare services; national insurance; health; school; and social services including public housing as long as his residency was proved; freedom of speech and association.20 The EU long term residence permit had no expiry date, that is, it is indefinite.21\n[22] The only limitation on the card is the requirement that the photo ID be updated every five years. According to RPD Request for Information Response (RIR)\nThe official at the Embassy of Italy in Ottawa noted that the EC Long-Term\nResidence Permit is a permanent document and that it does not expire. A document issued by the Ministry of Interior of Italy entitled Staying in Italy Legally similarly states that the EC Long-Term Residence Permit is valid for an indefinite period, although it notes that, in order to be valid as a personal identification document, it must be renewed with a new photo after five years.22\n[23] The EU Long-Term Residence Permit is to be revocable under certain conditions as set out in paragraph 7 of Article 9 of Decree n. 286 (1998), which provides at sub-paragraph (d) \"in case of absence from the territory of the Union for a period of twelve consecutive months.\"23 A person whose EU long-term residence permit has been revoked and who is not subject to expulsion, \"is issued a residence permit for other reasons implementing this consolidated act\"24 pursuant to paragraph 9 of Article 9, [Panel's emphasis]\n[24] The question of whether or not revocation is automatic was the subject of discussion at the hearing. No official translation of the Italian statue was available to the panel. The claimant's counsel relied an unofficial translation (hither to \"the unofficial translation\") which was sourced from the web site of \"Refworld.\"25 The Minister relied on an RPD document \"Italian residence permits, including the carta di soggiorno (permanent residence card); rights and obligations of holders; whether the holders have access to Italian citizenship\" Request for Information Response ITA104045.E, April 23, 2012 (hitherto \"RIR ITA104045.E\").26\n[25] As noted above and for more certainty, the unofficial translation of section 7(a-d) of Article 9 of Decree n. 286 (1998) states that\n7. The residence permit as mentioned under paragraph 1 is revoked:\na) if acquired fraudulently;\nb) in case of expulsion, as mentioned under paragraph 9;\nc) when lacking or coming to lack the conditions for the issuing, as mentioned under paragraph 4;\nd) in case of absence from the territory of the Union for a period of twelve consecutive months; [Panel's emphasis]\n[26] RIR ITA104045.E relates,\nFurther, the permit can be revoked in the following cases:\n* It has been acquired fraudulently;\n* The state has ordered an expulsion measure against the applicant;\n* The applicant no longer meets the requirements of the permit;\n* The applicant has been absent from EU territory for 12 consecutive months; [Panel's emphasis]\n[27] Both documents relate similar information, however, the unofficial translation uses the word \"Is\" whereas RIR ITA104045.E uses the words \"can be.\" The use of the word \"Is\" implies a more definitive outcome by operation of law whereas the use of the words \"can be\" is less definitive and implies room for discretion. To help resolve the dilemma, the Panel went to the web site referenced in RIR ITA104045.E which is maintained by the Italian State Police.27 As related at the English version of this site, the relevant information is as follows,\nYour EC long-term residence permit may be revoked in the following cases:\n* You have acquired it fraudulently.\n* An expulsion measure has been adopted against you.\n* You no longer fulfil the requirements set for its issue.\n* You have been absent from the territory of the European Union for a period of 12 consecutive months.28 [Panel's emphasis]\n[28] As it is clear that the information in RIR ITA104045.E derives from the Italian State Police document, the panel is uncertain why author of RIR ITA104045.E used the words \"can be revoked\" instead of \"may be revoked.\" That having been said, since it is inferable that the translation used by the Italian State Police was made under its auspice, and the source of the unofficial translation found at the web site of RefWorld is unknown, the panel will prefer the wording used in the Italian State Police document as being the truer representation of the original Italian text, on a balance of probabilities.\n[29] I find support for this conclusion in Omorogie, where the Federal Court held that,\n[54] I find the Board's determination was reasonable. Here, the Board acknowledged the applicants' permanent resident status in Italy was not lost on the date of the hearing. It observed the inconsistency in the documentary evidence on whether the applicants would automatically lose their permanent residence after one year outside of Italy. It chose to believe the information on the Italian police website (certified record at page 161) even though it did not completely contradict the Italian Embassy's report (certified record at page 159). The Italian police website indicates the applicants' permanent resident status \"can\" be revoked after one year outside of Italy. The Italian Embassy information indicates the applicants' permanent resident status \"will\" be lost after one year outside of Italy. The Board preferred the evidence from the Italian police website and reasoned this evidence means revocation is not automatic.29\n[30] Similarly in Rrotaj, the Federal Court held that,\n[24] The Applicants did not provide any evidence to meet their burden to demonstrate that they had lost status in Italy. The fact that they have been outside the European Union for far more than 12 months (and had been at the time of the hearing) does not mean that they have lost their status. The Board addressed this issue, acknowledging the inconsistency in the documentary evidence between the Canadian Embassy's March 2012 opinion, and the more recent (2013 and 2015) evidence confirming that revocation is discretionary, not automatic - information which was obtained from Italian police and consular officials. It is not my role to reweigh the evidence, and I find that this outcome was open to the Board.30\n[31] Rrotaj was affirmed by the Federal Court of Appeal which wrote,\n[9] The Federal Court held (at paras. 24-27) that the appellants did not provide any evidence to meet their burden to demonstrate that they had lost or could lose status in the third country, here Italy. Their absence from Italy for more than 12 months \"does not mean they had lost status in Italy\" (at para. 24). The Federal Court also held (at para. 27) on the basis of the evidence before it that the appellants \"held the right to work without restrictions, to study, to fully access social services, and to return to [Italy]\" and, thus, \"the evidence does not disclose a serious possibility, let alone a probability, that [the appellants] have no right to return [to Italy].\" The Federal Court noted (at para. 27) that the principal appellant conceded during the hearing that all the formal rights of an Italian citizen except the right to vote and the right to a passport were present. In Zeng, this Court held (at para. 1) that Article 1E \"precludes the conferral of refugee protection if an individual has surrogate protection in a country where the individual enjoys substantially the same rights and obligations as a national of that country.\" The Federal Court also found (at para. 31) that the appellants had not brought evidence they had lost their right of return and could not renew their status.31\n[32] Most recently, the Federal Court in Obumuneme the Federal Court held that,\n43. In my view, the RPD did not err in finding against the applicants on this question of fact. While the RIR [ITA104045.E] provided evidence that they could have lost their status for the reasons they pointed to, the applicants did not adduce any evidence that this had actually happened. Especially considering the absence of evidence that the applicants had ever attempted to ascertain their current status in Italy, it was open to the RPD to conclude that they still enjoyed permanent resident status there. The circumstances of the present case bear a close resemblance to those of Omorogie v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 1255, and Rrotaj v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 152 [Rrotaj], where the same result was reached by the RPD and upheld on judicial review. If anything, the evidence in the present case is less favourable to the applicants' position than that considered by the RPD in these other cases.\n44. For the sake of completeness, I note that at the hearing before the RPD, counsel for the applicants did not rely on Ms. Obumuneme's evidence that the permanent residence permit would have expired because she had failed to renew it within five years. While Ms. Obumuneme may well have been correct about this, it did not follow that the applicants would have lost their status in Italy due to this alone. According to another RIR (dated March 6, 2015) concerning Italian permanent residence permits which is included in a National Documentation Package that was before the RPD, while permanent residence permits must be updated with a new photograph every five years to remain valid as photo identification, the failure to do so does not invalidate one's status as a permanent resident.32\n[33] Based on the evidence before me, neither XXXX nor XXXX, have established that they had lost their EU permanent residency.\n[34] In the alternative, if they have lost this status, then it is clear to the panel that by operation of paragraph 9 of Article 9 of Decree n. 286 (1998), a person who loses their EU Long-Term Permanent Resident status reverts to the lesser status of a temporary resident who is allowed to enter and remain in Italy under a \"residence permit.\" Furthermore, the type of \"resident permit\" is styled \"for other reasons.\" The panel considered the wording of the relevant sections of the Decree, taking into consideration its intentions when read as a whole.\n[35] Paragraph 1 of Article 1 of the Decree provides,\n1. This consolidated act, implementing article 10, second paragraph, of the Constitution, is enforced, unless provided for otherwise, on citizens belonging to non-EU States and to stateless persons, hereinafter indicated as aliens.\n[36] Paragraph 3 of Article 1 of the Decree provides,\n3. When other provisions of law refer to statuses concerning persons with a citizenship different from Italian, or stateless persons, the reference is to statuses provided for by this consolidated act. The most favourable domestic, community and international provisions however in force in the State's territory remain withstanding.\n[37] As read, the panel infers that the Decree applies to Non-Italian non-citizens of the EU and is the equivalent of Canada's Immigration and Refugee Protection Act governing the right to enter into and remain in Italy.\n[38] The relevant portions of Article 2 of the Decree provides,\n1. The alien present at the border or on the State's territory is recognised the human being's fundamental rights provided for by the rules of domestic laws, by international conventions in force and by the principles of international law generally recognised.\n2. The alien legally present on the State's territory benefits from the civil rights recognised to Italian citizens, unless the international conventions in force for Italy and this consolidated act provide for otherwise. Should this consolidated act or international conventions provide for the condition of reciprocity, this is ascertained on the basis of the criteria and modalities provided for by the regulation implementation.\n3. The Italian Republic, implementing ILO's convention n. 143 dated 24 June 1975, ratified with law n. 158 dated 10 April 1981, guarantees to all foreign workers legally present on its territory and to their families equal treatment and full equality of rights compared to Italian workers.\n4. The alien legally present participates in the local public life.\n5. The alien is recognised equal treatment compared to the citizen as regards jurisdictional protection of rights and legitimate interests, relationships with the public administration and the access to public services, within the limits of what provided for by law.\n...\n9. The alien present on the Italian territory must however comply with the obligations provided for by the laws in force.\n[39] As read, the panel infers that the Decree extends to aliens, fundamental domestic and international human rights, the civil and employment rights enjoyed by Italian citizens (unless otherwise specified), freedom of participation and speech, equal treatment under the law and an obligation to comply with relevant Italian law.\n[40] Article 4 of the Decree deals with the right and conditions to enter and remain in Italy on a short or long-term basis. Article 5 of the Decree deals with the conditions and modalities for the issuance of \"Residence Permits,\" their periods for the purpose of employment, visits, business or tourism, study and for the cancellation of such permits under certain conditions (e.g. for criminality, or failure to comply with the act) and for punishment for infringement of the act (e.g., for uttering forged visas). As noted above, Article 9 of the Decree deals with the conditions and modalities for the issuance of EU Long-Term Resident Permits.\n[41] The point of all this is that Italy has a coherent legal framework for the regulation of immigration that is consistent with international law and domestic law, which provides rights and protections to individuals seeking to enter into and remain on its soil.\n[42] Thus, it is within this framework that the panel considers that, should EU Long-Term Residency be revoked, the affected alien (foreign national) does not lose his\/her right to enter or remain in Italy. Indeed, having lost EU Long-Term Residency pursuant to paragraph 7(d) for being absent for twelve months, pursuant to paragraph 9, the person's status reverts to that of a temporary resident on a term fixed by the issuing authority. Furthermore, paragraph 8 of Article provides for the recovery of a person's EU- Long-Tern residence status. As written, it provides that\n[t]he alien who has been revoked the residence permit pursuant to letters d) and e) of paragraph 7, can apply for it, with the same modalities as mentioned under this article. In this case, the period as mentioned under paragraph 1, is reduced to three years [from the five stipulated in paragraph 1 of Article 9].\n[43] What of the minor claimant XXXX? The evidence is that in 2017, his father XXXX had him added to his EU Long-Term Resident Permit.33 Thus, it is inferable that, in so doing, XXXX acquired the same status as his father, that being a permanent resident with the rights noted above who is able to enter and reside in Italy for an unlimited period of time. It is also inferable that should XXXX be absent for twelve months or more that his status could change from an EU Long-Term Resident to that of a temporary resident, and that like his father, he would be able to reapply to recover his status on the same terms as set out in paragraph 9 of Article 9 of the Decree.\n[44] What of the claimant XXXX? Her situation is a bit more complex. Paragraph 1 of Article 28 of the Decree provides,\n1. The right to keep or re-acquire family unity as regards foreign family members is recognised, under the conditions provided for by this consolidated act, to aliens holders of residence paper or permit for a duration not inferior to a year issued for subordinate or autonomous work reasons, or for asylum, for study, for religious reasons or for family reasons.\n[45] Paragraph 1 of Article 29 provides,\n1. The alien can apply for family joining for the following family members:\na) spouse not legally separated and not under eighteen years of age;\nb) minor children ...\n[46] The claimant XXXX and the claimant XXXX were married in 2014 and XXXX proceeded to apply for 'family joining\" presumably under Article 30 of the Decree. Article 30 provides for the terms and conditions for the issuance of a Resident Permit for Family Reasons. XXXX was issued such a permit which was renewed on XXXX XXXX, 2017, with expiry on XXXX XXXX, 2019.34 Pursuant to paragraph 2 of article 30, XXXX had the right to access welfare services, to study, employment, and unemployment list registration, and to enjoy the rights generally enjoyed by Italians as set out in Articles 34 through 42 of the Decree and to protection for discrimination under Article 43.\n[47] What is unclear, is the effect of the expiry of her Residency Permit on her right to enter and remain in Italy. However, notwithstanding that his status might revert to that of a resident permit holder, as discussed above, it follows that pursuant to paragraph 1 of Article 28, XXXX would have the right to make application under paragraph 1 of Article 9 for the issuing of that same status to his family members pursuant to paragraph 1 of Article 29 of the Decree.\n1. The alien in possession of, as of at least five years, a valid residence permit that shows the availability of an income not inferior to the annual amount of the social cheque and, in case of request as regards family members, of a sufficient income pursuant to the parameters indicated in article 29, paragraph 3, letter b) and of a proper lodging falling within the minimum parameters provided for by the regional law for lodging within public residential housing or compliant with the requisites of hygiene-sanitary eligibility ascertained by the Local Health Authority cognizant by territory, can submit application to the questore for the issuing of the ((EU residence permit for long-term residents)), for himself and for family members as mentioned under article 29, paragraph 1.\n[48] The panel considers all of this in respect of the test set out in Zeng, which it sets our below:\nConsidering all relevant factors to the date of the hearing, does the claimant have status, substantially similar to that of its nationals, in the third country? If the answer is yes, the claimant is excluded. If the answer is no, the next question is whether the claimant previously had such status and lost it, or had access to such status and failed to acquire it. If the answer is no, the claimant is not excluded under Article 1E. If the answer is yes, the RPD must consider and balance various factors. These include, but are not limited to, the reason for the loss of status (voluntary or involuntary), whether the claimant could return to the third country, the risk the claimant would face in the home country, Canada's international obligations, and any other relevant facts.35\n[49] Do the claimants have status, substantially similar to that of its nationals, in the third country? It is not argued that the claimants did not have permanent resident status in Italy that afforded them the opportunities and rights generally available to Italian citizens, at the time they came to Canada. It is unclear whether or not they retain their status in that country. The claimant XXXX argues that, because he has been outside Italy for over a year, he has lost his status. However, based on the panel's reading of the Italian statute, while he might have lost his EU Long-Term Resident status, at most, his status has reverted to that of a temporary resident similar to the status he enjoyed after he was awarded subsidiary protection. This status gave him all the opportunities and rights generally enjoyed by Italian citizens, save he could not vote.\n[50] Similarly, the status of his son XXXX, who had acquired EU long-term Resident Status on application by his father, would revert to that of his father who could reapply for him to recover his EU Long-Term status as he had in 2017.\n[51] As for the claimant XXXX, while her Residency Permit has expired, it is not at all clear that she has lost her right to enter and remain in Italy, and again, the claimants have introduced no evidence that she has. Moreover, XXXX could simply apply to have XXXX return under the family reasons provisions of the Italian statute as he did in 2014 after they were married. It is also available to XXXX to apply to have XXXX added to any new EU Long-Term Resident Permit that he could apply for after satisfying the shortened two year residency requirement as provided for in the statute (noted above).\n[52] It is clear from the claimant's testimony that they came to Canada with the intention of establishing themselves here. Their actions are entirely voluntary and, to the extent that their status as permanent residents of Italy might have changed, it was entirely within their control to return to Italy and resume living there within a year of coming to Canada in the case of XXXX and XXXX and prior to XXXX XXXX, 2019, on the part of XXXX.\n[53] Except for the fact that XXXX lost his job and they suffered the results of an earthquake, the claimants make no allegations of risk against Italy, and the panel finds that they can return there and live safely. The panel notes that, as permanent residents of Italy, the claimants had access to welfare and unemployment benefits. They also had the same rights as Italians to healthcare, education and civil society (freedom of speech and association). Based on the testimony, it is clear to the panel that the claimants were unhappy with their lot in Italy and set out to find a new safe third country in which to settle. Seen from their perspective, a perfectly rational decision, but from the perspective of refugee law, they are in effect \"asylum shopping\" as described by the Federal Court of Appeal in Zeng at paragraph 1.36\n[54] I did not hear any testimony on the situation of the claimants in Afghanistan as I am familiar with conditions there, and I take no exception to their narrative which on that subject I find credible. Consequently, I accept that the claimants would be at considerable risk if they were returned there, XXXX in particular, given her avowed rejection of the veil and Afghan social and patriarchal customs with respect to the treatment of Women. Both are \"westernized\" which puts them at risk, and XXXX, who acted as an XXXX, could face repression by those who opposed the American intervention in that country. However, given what the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that they can regain their status and live safely in Italy, there is no need for Canada to extend its protection to them.\n[55] For these reasons, the panel finds that the claimants are excluded pursuant to Article 1(e) of the refugee convention.\n(signed)\n\"Kenneth D.

In 2007, a local criminal gang began extorting money from him, on the condition that his business would be safe from other gangs. In 2008, the gang raised their tax rate. The claimant tried to negotiate without success. In July 2008, the claimant was beaten severely to the point where he paid the higher tax rate. However, by September, he no longer had the funds to pay.\n[4] In December 2008, the claimant closed his business but saved XXXX XXXX at a friend's place. In January 2009, members of the gang threatened to kill him if he did not pay the owing monies. He filed a police complaint, but XXXX, the leader of the gang, told him that he knew he had gone to the police, resulting in demands of three times the original monthly tax.\n[5] In December 2009, the gang forced him to sell his car to offset some of his debts. He went to the Organized Crime Unit to file another complaint but again without success. In May 2010, the claimant was kidnapped from his apartment, beaten and tortured. He was told to sell his apartment and give the gang the money to repay his debt. He was also told that they had found his former wife and daughter, and threatened to harm them if he did not comply. The claimant sustained injuries requiring medical intervention.\n[6] The claimant fears local criminals and corrupt police in his home area.\nDETERMINATION\n[7] The panel finds that the claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, and that, on a balance of probabilities, he would not personally be subjected to a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture upon return to Ukraine.\nISSUES\n[8] The determinative issues are credibility, nexus, generalized risk and internal flight alternative (IFA).\nIdentity\n[9] On a balance of probabilities, the panel finds that the claimant has established his Ukrainian citizenship based on a copy of his passport.3\nCredibility\n[10] In considering credibility, the panel is aware of the difficulties that may be faced by the claimant in establishing his claim, namely, the setting of the hearing room, and the stress inherent in responding to questions. The panel has also considered, the passage of time, since the claimant arrived in Canada in 2010.\nNexus\n[11] Although counsel conceded that this is a section 97 claim, and there is no nexus, the panel's analysis follows.\n[12] The first issue to be considered is whether there is a nexus to one of the five Convention refugee grounds, namely: race, religion, nationality, real or imputed political opinion or membership in a particular social group. The claimants fears members of a criminal gang who have made extortion demands, given the claimant's truck business, and the gang's knowledge that he had financial assets. The panel finds these perpetrators are acting in a criminal manner, which does not provide the claimant with a link to one of the Convention refugee grounds.\n[13] The law is settled that neither fear of reprisals constituting revenge or personal vendettas, nor fear of criminal acts, constitutes a fear of persecution linked to a Convention ground. The claimant provided no evidence that would suggest that this was anything but extortion at the hands of perpetrators who belong to gangs who are criminal in nature.\n[14] The RAD is further guided by the Federal Court in Bacchus:\n[The Court] agree[s] with the respondent. The documentary evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that crime, while a serious issue in Guyana, is neither politically nor racially motivated. As well, although the applicant has been the victim of violent crime, all Guyanese are at risk for these sorts of crimes. The Board had ample reason to conclude that the applicant was neither persecuted on the basis of race or political opinion nor would he face a personalized risk were he to return to Guyana...\nWhile [the Court] sympathize[s] with the applicant for the emotional turmoil he must have experienced as a result of receiving an erroneous notice of decision from the Board, that administrative error does not provide a ground for the Court's intervention.4\n[15] In Vickram, the applicant, a citizen of Guyana, claimed a fear of bandits because of his Indo-Guyanese ethnicity and because he was wealthy.5 The RPD rejected his claim, finding that \"the acts of violence perpetrated against [the applicant] were criminal acts with no link to his ethnicity,\"6 and that they were random acts faced generally by citizens. It also found that he had \"not rebutted the presumption of state protection.\"7 The Board's ultimate finding of lack of nexus to section 96 of the IRPA in that the applicant was not targeted because of his ethnicity, but because of his wealth, was supported by the evidence, including the applicant's own testimony. At one point in his testimony he did suggest that there was a link between his wealth and his ethnicity, but nowhere else did he expand on this or provide evidence to bolster that argument. The Board instructed itself correctly on the law regarding section 97, and concluded that the risk that the applicant \"faced was of criminal activity, and... was no greater than that faced by the population at large.\"8 Any deficiencies in the Board's discussion of state protection did not undermine its final decision, as it was an alternative argument.\n[16] The panel concludes that the objective behind the claimant's extortions was purely criminal in nature, rather than being targeted as a consequence of real or imputed political opinion. Accordingly, the panel finds that there is no nexus to a Convention ground in the case at hand. Therefore, the claim fails under section 96 of the IRPA. The balance of the analysis is pursuant to section 97 of the IRPA.\nGeneralized Risk\nDoes the claimant face a risk to life?\n[17] Claimants must establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the harm they face amounts to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. In Li, the court states that, \"[t]he degree of risk under section 97(1)(b) is that the risk is more likely than not.\"9 The analysis is prospective (i.e., likely harm faced on return to the country).\n[18] The evidence must establish a specific, individualized risk of harm with regard to the particular claimant. Country condition evidence describing generalized human rights violations, without a direct specific linkage to the claimant, is insufficient to establish a personal risk of harm and to ground a claim.10\nIs the risk faced generally by other individuals in or from that country?\n[19] A generalized risk need not be experienced by every citizen in the country in question. The Honourable Madam Justice Snider states that, \"[t]he word 'generally' is commonly used to mean 'prevalent' or 'widespread'.\"11\n[20] Where the subgroup that faces the risk is of a size that one can say that the risk posed to those persons is widespread or prevalent in a particular country, then it can constitute a generalized risk. The Honourable Justice Crampton found that:\n[it] is now settled law that claims based on past and likely future targeting of the claimant will not meet the requirements of paragraph 97(1)(b)(ii) of the IRPA where ... (ii) that sub-group is sufficiently large that the risk can reasonably be characterized as being widespread or prevalent in that country. In my view, a subgroup of such persons numbering in the thousands would be sufficiently large as to render the risk they face widespread or prevalent in their home country, and therefore \"general\" within the meaning of paragraph 97(1)(b)(ii), even though that subgroup may only constitute a small percentage of the general population in that country.12\n[21] A generalized risk does not have to affect everyone in the same way. Every victim of generalized violence will not be targeted with the same frequency or in the same manner. The assessment is made in relation to a particular country, and is based on evidence of country conditions.13\n[22] In Mendoza, the Honourable Justin Zinn states that, \"[t]he Board must examine both the nature of the risk faced by the claimant as well as the agent of persecution.\"14 The fact that the risk arises from criminal activity does not in itself mean that the risk is one faced generally by other individuals in the country. Some risks arising from criminal activity will constitute a generalized risk, and others will not.\n[23] In Gomez, the Federal Court stated:\nThe applicants were originally subjected to threats that are widespread and prevalent in El Salvador. However, subsequent events showed that the applicants were specifically targeted after they defied the gang. The gang threatened to kidnap Mr. Tobias Gomez's wife and daughter, and appear determined to collect the applicants' outstanding \"debt\" of $40,000. The risk to the applicants has gone beyond general threats and assaults. The gang has targeted them personally.\nThe same is true in respect of Luis. Although recruitment by gangs is a widespread and prevalent phenomenon in El Salvador, Luis was singled out and subjected to threats, assaults and kidnapping. These events show that the risk to Luis was personalized, not generally felt by the rest of the population.15\n[24] In Escamilla Morroquin, the Courts stated:\nThe Board therefore accepted that the applicant reported the theft of his truck to the police, that the Mara 13 became aware of this fact, and that the applicants fled El Salvador because they feared retaliation by the gang. This is the precise kind of factual scenario which may go beyond a generalized risk, as in the cases listed above.16\n[25] The panel finds that it is clear from the Federal court jurisprudence that the claimant's risk did, in fact, heighten. According to the claimant, he was abducted beaten and tortured in the process.\n[26] The panel concludes that the risk to the claimant increased immeasurably as a consequence of owing monies. Accordingly, the panel concludes that in the particular circumstances of this claim, the claimant's risk became personalized risk and not generalized.\nInternal flight alternative (IFA) to Odessa\n[27] The issue of IFA arises when a claimant is able to find refuge in her or his own country of citizenship. Once an IFA has been identified, it is the claimant's burden to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that she or he would be at serious risk of persecution in the IFA, or that it would be objectively unreasonable, taking into account the claimant's personal circumstances, for the person to seek refuge there.\n[28] The IFA analysis involves a two-pronged test. Under the first prong, the panel must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that there is not a serious possibility of persecution in the area of the country identified for the IFA.17 Under the second prong, the panel must assess the conditions in the IFA to determine if it is reasonable, in all the circumstances including those personal to the claimant, to relocate and seek refuge there.18 At the outset of the hearing, the panel identified Odessa as a potential IFA for the claimant.\n[29] For reasons set out below, the panel finds there is no serious possibility the claimant would be subjected, on a balance of probabilities, to a danger of torture or a risk to life or of cruel or unusual treatment or punishment in Odessa.\n[30] The claimant was asked if he could reside safely in Odessa, to which he replied that he would be targeted. He suggested that there are gangs everywhere, not just the gang that was extorting him, namely the Yumaks, which operated in the Ternopil region. The claimant also testified that he was located in Volochysk, which is approximately 30 kilometers from his residence. He then went to Berezhany from XXXX XXXX XXXX 2010, without incident. The claimant testified that he can only reside in Ternopil because he is registered there and owns his own home. According to the claimant, homes are too expensive in the named IFA, Odessa, and his home is in Ternopil.\n[31] The panel asked the claimant why, after nine years, this gang would be interested in pursuing him, to which he responded that there is corruption in Ukraine. Moreover, he stated that he would be perceived to have a lot of money, returning from Canada, and this would be the gang's motivation. When asked how the gang would locate him, he responded that the police are corrupt and he would have to go somewhere to \"report\" (the panel interpreted this to mean register his residency).\n[32] The panel noted that the claimant owns his own home, and he was asked if he could sell this residence and buy somewhere else. He replied that his daughter and her family reside there. Furthermore, the claimant stated that he would be unable to find work at the age of 56.\n[33] Counsel submits that the claimant bears the scars of a much older man, having sustained multiple injuries at the hands of the gang.19 Moreover, he argues that the claimant's testimony reveals an individual who sincerely believes, given his past, that he could be at risk. Furthermore, counsel submits that an IFA is not reasonable in the Ukraine, because it is not divided on ethnic or tribal lines, but rather Ukraine is a corrupt country and that gangs do not forget debts owed. Lastly, counsel argues that if the gang or other gangs that are connected do, in fact, locate him, there would be no state protection forthcoming. Counsel states that the claimant had attempted to obtain such protection, and notes the information contained in the NDP. Lastly, counsel submits that at the age of 56, his pension would have begun at the age of 55, thereby minimizing his chances of finding work. Moreover, given the number of displaced persons in Ukraine fleeing the war from Russia, there are fewer jobs. Finally, counsel submits it would not be reasonable to place him with his daughter in a one-bedroom home in Ternopil, in a population of 200,000 in Ternopil, where he would be located.\n[34] The panel finds that after nine years, on a balance of probabilities, the gang who were extorting the claimant would not be interested in pursuing him. Moreover, the panel notes that this is a local gang. Although submissions were made with respect to connections to other gangs, the panel finds insufficient persuasive evidence of any connection whatsoever, as this was a localized issue which occurred nine years in the past. The panel concludes that this gang would not have the motivation, the means, or the interest in attempting to locate the claimant at this time.\nSecond prong of IFA test: IFA to Odessa not objectively unreasonable given the claimants' personal circumstances\n[35] The second prong of an IFA consideration is whether the proposed location is reasonable in all of the circumstances, including those personal to the claimant. The panel finds that Odessa is a reasonable IFA location for the claimant to seek refuge.\n[36] Odessa has a population of over a million residents. Its sheer size and higher levels of diversity cannot be compared to Ternopil.\n[37] The panel finds that the claimant is in receipt of a government pension, is extremely well-educated, has various different skill sets from his business of buying and selling trucks, and he is independent. He came to Canada on his own, with no family support, and not speaking the language.\n[38] Freedom of movement and free choice of place of residence in the Ukraine is guaranteed to the citizens of Ukraine.20 The Ukraine is 603,550 sq. km., approximately the size of the state of Texas, with a population of about 44 million people.21 Odessa is the third most populous city of Ukraine and a major tourism center, seaport and transportation hub located on the northwestern shore of the Black Sea. Internal relocation is likely to be viable in many cases.22\n[39] The panel notes that the claimant completed high school, followed by four years of college in XXXX. Moreover, he was employed in a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. These are transferable skills, albeit it may be a little more difficult at the age of 56, but not impossible. Moreover, there are other jobs that he could perform. In addition to counsel's assertion, he was entitled to a pension at the age of 55.\n[40] With respect to the fact that the claimant owns his home in Ternopil, when asked if he could sell it, he stated that this provides a residency for his daughter and her family. The panel finds that this is a choice that the claimant has made to provide for his family, but it does not preclude other housing arrangements.\n[41] The panel appreciates that there is always some hardship, even undue hardship, involved when a person has to abandon the comfort of his or her home to live, work and\/or go to school in a different part of a country, and establish social connections often in the absence of friends and family. However, this is not the kind of undue hardship that the Court of Appeal was considering in Thirunavukkarasu, where it set a very high threshold for the unreasonableness test, such that conditions that fall short of endangering the lives and safety of the claimants are insufficient to constitute undue hardship.23 Moreover, a claimant cannot simply assert risks without providing concrete evidence; speculation is insufficient. Throughout his testimony, the claimant was unable to provide any examples of similarly situated individuals.\n[42] There is no evidence before this panel that the claimant has a medical or psychological condition that would make Odessa an unreasonable place to seek refuge.\n[43] The panel understands that the claimant would prefer to remain in Canada, where he is removed from the worsening political situation. However, because the panel finds that he has a viable IFA in Odessa, the claimant is not a Convention refugee, nor a person in need of protection under sections 96 and 97(1) of the IRPA.\nCONCLUSION\n[44] For the foregoing reasons, the panel finds the claimant has not discharged his burden to demonstrate that he faces a serious possibility of persecution in Ukraine. Moreover, he has not demonstrated that, on a balance of probabilities, he faces a danger of torture, or that there is a risk to his life, or of cruel or unusual treatment or punishment if he returns to Ukraine.\n[45] The panel concludes the claimant is not a Convention refugee, nor a person in need of protection and, therefore, rejects this claim.\n(signed)\n\"Roslyn Ahara\"\nRoslyn Ahara\nJune 20, 2019\nDate\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n2 Exhibit 2, Personal Information Form (PIF).\n3 Exhibit 1, Federal Court Package, at pp. 106-107.\n4 Bacchus, Amit v.

The officer had no interest in the outcome of the case. Furthermore, there is no evidence before the panel that the officer in question would still be employed in the same job in 2019 and would be attainable to testify.\n* The panel in dismissing the request has weighed all relevant factors including those enumerated in RPD Rules and considered submissions by counsel. Additionally, the panel was mindful that to grant the motion at this stage of the hearing, and adjourn the hearing to call a witness to give evidence on a document completed in 2011, was unreasonable. Furthermore, it would be contrary to the Board's mandate pursuant to subsection 162(2) of the IRPA; to proceed quickly but in accordance with considerations of fairness and the principles of natural justice, considering the Chairperson's Guideline 6 concerning Scheduling and Changing the Date and Time of a Proceeding.\nALLEGATIONS\n[8] The claimants' allegations are described in detail in their Personal Information Form (PIF) narratives,4 signed on December 12, 2011, and amended on April 23, 2019, (at the first de novo hearing, by a different panel). In summary, they alleged the following:\n[9] The claimants alleged that they travelled to Canada to seek asylum in 2011.\n[10] The male claimant testified that he has a Canadian-born daughter, XXXX, born in 2013.\n[11] The claimants alleged that, as Roma, living in Budapest, Hungary, they were differentially treated, harassed, discriminated and excluded from activities at school, and no access to health care. They alleged that they were discriminated by the police and did not receive protection. The claimants alleged being attacked by an extremist nationalist group, \"Gaurda\" created by the Jobbik party, and sustained physical injuries. The male claimant alleged that on several occasions his car was vandalised, because he was a Roma. The claimants alleged that their life was threatened, all their life, by the extremist Hungarians.\nSubjective fear\n[12] The claimants alleged that, as Roma, they fear discrimination in education, healthcare, housing, and employment if they were to return to Hungary. They alleged that their life would be in danger by the nationalist groups if they were to return. They also alleged that the minor claimant would not be able to comprehend the treatment she would receive by the Hungarians in Hungary, as a Roma, since she was raised in Canada.\nNEXUS\n[13] The nexus in these claims are ethnicity, namely, Roma.\nDETERMINATION\n[14] After considering the totality of the evidence and counsel's representations, the panel finds that the claimants are not Convention refugees, as their fear of persecution is not well-founded based on their ethnicity or any convention grounds in Hungary; as well, they are not in need of protection at the time of the hearing.\nISSUES\n[15] The central issues in this claim are credibility, discrimination amounting to persecution, and state protection.\nIdentity\n[16] Based on the certified true copies of the claimants' Hungarian passports,5 and absent any evidence that the passports are fraudulent or were obtained fraudulently, the panel finds the claimants, on a balance of probabilities, have established their personal identity and citizenship of Hungary.\n[17] The panel accepts that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimants are Roma based on the declarations in their PIFs,6 which they had affirmed was true and accurate, and the letter from the Roma Community Center7 stating that the female claimant, XXXX XXXX is of Roma identity.\nCredibility\n[18] The determination, as to whether a claimant's evidence is credible, is made on a balance of probabilities.8 Although statements given under oath are presumed to be true, that presumption can be rebutted by contradictions or inconsistencies in the evidence.9\n[19] With respect to POE notes the Federal Court, Appeal Division, has stated that:\nA person's first story is usually the most genuine and, therefore, the one to be most believed. That being said, although the failure to report a fact can be a cause for concern, it should not always be so. That, again depends on all the circumstances: see Fajardo v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1993] F.C.J. No. 915 at para. 5 (QL) (C.A.); Owusu-Ansah, supra; and Sheikh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2000 CanLII 15200 (FC), [2000] F.C.J. No. 568 (QL) (T.D.).10\n[20] In RKL v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 2003 FTC 116, the Federal Court opined, that credibility forms the crux of the Board's determination of refugee protection claims. The Court put the issue this way:\nThe determination of an applicant's credibility is the heartland of the Board's jurisdiction. This Court has found that the Board has well-established expertise in the determination of questions of fact, particularly in the evaluation of the credibility and the subjective fear of persecution of an applicant: see Rahaman v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2000] F.C.J. No. 1800 at para. 38 (QL) (T.D.); and Cepeda-Gutierrez v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1998), 1998 CanLII 8667 (FC), 157 F.T.R. 35 at para. 14.11\n[21] The panel was also guided by the Federal Court of Appeal in Dan-Ash,12 which stands for the proposition that an important indicator of credibility is the consistency with which a witness has told a particular story, including to Canadian immigration officials.\n[22] The panel is also mindful of Rrukaj,13 where the Federal Court held:\nThe Board's function includes assessing credibility, and one of the common tools for testing credibility is comparing the applicant's evidence at three different times during the refugee claim process:\n(1) the POE notes;\n(2) the PIF statements; and,\n(3) the oral evidence at the hearing.\n[23] In this case, the panel compared the narrative of the PIF, the oral evidence at the hearing, and the POE notes in the response to question 43, \"Why are you asking for Canada's protection?\" The panel has taken into account the instruction to the applicant, \"Please keep your answers short. You will have the opportunity to explain all the facts related to your claim to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada.\"\n[24] The claimant's response to question states the following:\nBecause the racism is going too far now in Hungary, everyone thinks that if you are a Gypsy you are automatically a criminal; Lately we have received so much more discrimination and assaults because of these groups are very strong; we have to leave. I was attacked by a group of Guardist, they were wearing a black uniform; I was stabbed that's why I have the scar on my thigh, my wife tried to protect me and they beat her too; some people came along the street and then they left us alone.14\n[25] The female claimants response is as follows:\nBecause these groups persecute the people with Roma background and they won't leave us alone and let us live our lives peacefully, when they hired me for a XXXX, I'd have to talk to the director personally when it normally wouldn't be done with any Hungarians. My daughter is 6 years old and should be in school but they said there was no space for her and now she's going to lose one year.\"15\n[26] The panel took into consideration the various factors that could affect the claimants' oral testimonies, including the setting of the hearing room, the claimants' anxiety, age, cultural differences, and number of years they have been living in Canada, education, and use of an interpreter, and that the case is a legacy case. While not every piece of evidence will be referred to in these reasons, the panel carefully considered the entirety of the evidence in reaching its decision.16 The panel finds that inconsistencies existed in the claimants' testimonies and omissions from the PIF and POE notes.17 When considered cumulatively, the panel finds the claimant's testimony, as to the reasons of the claimants fear of return to Hungary, are not credible as noted below.\n[27] The panel has also considered the claimants' explanation for the omissions of the allegations in the PIF from the POE notes. The male claimant explained that he dictated the information but did not know what was written. The female claimant explained that they were not asked these questions, they did not know they were supposed to say those things, and they were nervous about coming to a foreign land. She also testified that they were asked to tell the officer, in a few words, why they had come to Canada.\n[28] The panel does not accept the claimants' explanation as reasonable, given that the female claimant's evidence is that they came to Canada to seek protection. Furthermore, her parents and sister were living in Canada for five years when the female claimant arrived in Canada. The female claimant alleged that she did not consult her mother prior to coming to Canada. She testified that the claimants only knew that their photographs would be taken and their passports would be seized. The panel finds it is reasonable to expect the claimants, who had come to Canada to seek asylum, although tired and nervous, when asked why they were seeking protection of Canada to make a brief reference to the attacks and vandalism they had experienced, rather than talk about mundane generalities as noted above.\n[29] The panel notes that the claimants had the benefit of an interpreter when interviewed at the POE.18\n[30] Therefore, the panel finds the claimants' allegations in the circumstances of their case in general is not credible and that the allegations which form the basis of their subjective fear are, on a balance of probabilities, not true in the particular circumstances of their case.\nPast discrimination amounting to persecution\n[31] In determining whether the claimants past experiences amount to persecution, the panel is mindful of paragraphs 54 and 55 of the UNHCR Handbook, which states the following:\n54. Differences in the treatment of various groups do indeed exist to a greater or lesser extent in many societies. Persons who receive less favourable treatment as a result of such differences are not necessarily victims of persecution. It is only in certain circumstances that discrimination will amount to persecution. This would be so if measures of discrimination lead to consequences of a substantially prejudicial nature for the person concerned, e.g. serious restrictions on his right to earn his livelihood, his right to practise his religion, or his access to normally available educational facilities.\n55. Where measures of discrimination are, in themselves, not of a serious character, they may nevertheless give rise to a reasonable fear of persecution if they produce, in the mind of the person concerned, a feeling of apprehension and insecurity as regards his future existence. Whether or not such measures of discrimination in themselves amount to persecution must be determined in the light of all the circumstances. A claim to fear of persecution will of course be stronger where a person has been the victim of a number of discriminatory measures of this type and where there is thus a cumulative element involved.19\n[32] Therefore, the mistreatment suffered or anticipated by the claimants must be serious, and in order to determine whether their particular mistreatment would qualify as \"serious,\" one must examine what interest of the claimant might be harmed, and to what extent the subsistence, enjoyment, expression, or exercise of that interest might be compromised.\n[33] The Federal Court in Liang, citing paragraphs 54 and 55 of the UNHCR Handbook, affirmed that, in the exercise of determining whether cumulative discrimination and harassment constitutes persecution, it is necessary to evaluate the claimant's personal circumstances and vulnerabilities including age, health, and finances.20\n[34] In assessing whether cumulative acts of discrimination amount to persecution, it is necessary first to decide whether an individual act constitutes harassment or is discriminatory. The Federal Court in Hund21 concluded that it would be an error to consider acts that are erroneously characterized as discriminatory in assessing whether cumulative acts of discrimination amount to persecution. Such acts could include abandonment by one's own family, general threats made at community meetings, and relocating. Also, the \"cumulative effect\" should only consider incidents related to a Convention reason.\n[35] The following is the examination of the claimants' evidence regarding their experiences in Hungary prior to coming to Canada.\nEducation\n[36] In the circumstances of this case, the panel notes that, despite the differential treatment the claimants were subjected to at school in Hungary because they were Roma, the claimant completed 11 years of formal education.22 The female claimant completed 10 years of formal education.23 The minor claimant attended kindergarten in Hungary.\nEmployment\n[37] In the circumstances of this case, the claimant testified that he was always employed in Hungary. The PIF indicates that he was employed from 1991 to December 2011, in a variety of work, i.e., maintenance, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.24\n[38] The female claimant's evidence indicates that she was employed in Hungary from 2001 to 2004, as a XXXX and as a XXXX from 2010 to December 2011.25 However, her response in the Claim for Refugee Protection in Canada indicates that she was unemployed from 2001 to December of 2008. She was employed as a XXXX from December 2008 to December 2011.\nHousing\n[39] In the circumstances of this case, the claimant's evidence indicates that he owned a house with his deceased father. The building was built by the government. The claimant testified that he and his father were able to buy it when the government gave them the opportunity. The apartment is located in a Hungarian family neighbourhood of Budapest, with few Roma families. The claimant testified that his children from his first marriage are living in his apartment. His adult daughter lives on the same street.\n[40] The female claimant's testimony indicates that she lived in the district 19, \"little Budapest\". Her parents owned their home.\nAccess to health care\n[41] In the circumstances of this case, the claimant received medical treatment by paramedics and at the hospital when he alleged he was injured by the members of Jobbik guards. The claimant testified that the injury to his thigh, caused by stabbing, was superficial and did not require stiches. With respect to the alleged broken noses that both claimants allegedly sustained, they were sent home but the claimants did not peruse the normal follow-up and did not return to the hospital because they were afraid to go anywhere because they were \"Gypsies\".\n[42] The panel does not find the claimant's explanation as persuasive, as they did go to work. Furthermore, it is not reasonable to expect both claimants, on a balance of probabilities, would endure broken nose and the associated pain instead of seeking follow-up treatment. Additionally, the allegation of a broken nose is omitted from both claimants' POE notes, question 43.\n[43] It is reasonable to expect the claimant to state that he had a broken nose rather than a superficial stabbing to his thigh, particularly as he claims in his narrative \"...which [nose] is still disfigured.\"26 It is reasonable to expect the male claimant to have indicated that his wife's nose was broken when he alleged she was beaten.\n[44] As well, it is reasonable to expect the female claimant to mention the allegation of assault at the POE, rather than talk about her interview for the janitor position. The panel draws a negative inference from the cumulative effect of these omissions by the claimants at the POE and finds their allegations regarding the September 2010 incident is not credible.\n[45] The female claimant's evidence indicates that, during her pregnancy, she had issues with her immune system and had to receive infusions approximately twice per month throughout her pregnancy. She further testified that the nurses and doctors treated her differentially because she was a Roma. They looked down on her and on one occasion, she was placed on a sheet with blood \"spots\".\n[46] The claimant testified that the minor claimant suffered from kidney disease,27 which eventually led to the removal of 10% of her kidney. Prior to the surgery, from three months of age to age 3, she received dialysis every week. The claimant testified that his daughter is in good health after the surgery. The claimants alleged that the minor claimant was administered the wrong treatment when given antibiotics; however, further evidence indicates that it was to prevent her from getting infections.\nWere the claimants persecuted in the past?\n[47] The panel acknowledges that, according to Human Rights Watch (January 2018), Roma continue to face discrimination in housing, education and public health care.28 According to Freedom House (2018), Roma continue to face widespread discrimination, social exclusion and poverty.29\n[48] Notwithstanding the inconsistencies and omissions from the PIF noted above, in view of the totality of the evidence, the panel finds in the circumstances of this case, that the discriminatory acts the claimants alleged they had experienced in Hungary, when considered individually or cumulatively, are not serious enough to constitute persecution.\nPolice protection\n[49] In the circumstances of this case, during the alleged September 2010 attack (which was found to be not credible) the police arrived at the scene and took a report in their book. However, the claimants were unable to provide who the perpetrators were. The claimants only identified the attackers as wearing black. The claimants did not follow up on the matter, explaining that the police did not care, even if someone was killed. The panel does not find the claimant's explanation as persuasive given his testimony regarding XXXX XXXX, a Roma, murder in 2009, which contradicts his explanation. He testified that two persons associated with XXXX murder were arrested, tried, and sentenced to life in prison, and at the time of the hearing they remained in prison.\n[50] With respect to the incident on July 14, 2011, when the female claimant was attacked coming home, the claimant testified that he did call the police. This is inconsistent with his narrative in the PIF, which states they did not call the police. The claimant was asked to explain the inconsistency, he stated that \"a lot is missing.\" The panel draws a negative inference in this respect and finds the claimant's evidence regarding calling the police is not credible. Furthermore, the panel observes that this allegation is missing from the female claimant's question 43 in the POE notes.\n[51] With respect to the allegation of September 2011, when the female claimant and her daughter were returning home from the kindergarten school, a parent spat on them and called them names. The claimant testified that he did not report it to any authorities or school officials, they just came home.\n[52] The claimant testified that, prior to 2010, the tire of his Suzuki car was punctured, but he did not call the police. He explained that he did not want to call the police because they would note his name if he had made frequent calls, and would in turn persecute him. He alleged that the police did not do anything and used foul language to speak to them. The panel does not accept his explanation as persuasive, given his testimony which contradicts his allegation of the police response when he did report, to the police, his car being damaged by his neighbour. The claimant was asked to explain this inconsistency in his action of calling the police for damages to his car by his neighbour. The claimant stated that because his friend told him to do so. The panel does not accept his explanation as persuasive.\n[53] The claimants' evidence in the PIF narrative indicates that on March 6, 2010, they joined the XXXX XXXX XXXX organization. However, the panel observes that in response to question 26 of the Claim for Refugee Protection in Canada Form, instructing the claimants to respond to the question \"Have you ever been a member or supporter of an organization?\" both claimants responded \"NO\" and further responded \"I have never belonged to any organizations\".\n[54] The male claimant alleged that in 2010, when in Tatarszentgyotgy, where he drove around his aunt, who is the founder of XXXX XXXX XXXX organization, two of the tires of his car were slashed and the windows were broken. The claimant explained that he did not call the police, because the police of Orkeny had jurisdiction of Tatarszentgyotgy, and they hated his aunt.\n[55] The claimant testified that, in 2011, his neighbour ran his car into the claimant's car and damaged it. He reported it to the police and gave them his neighbours name as the perpetrator. However, when in Canada, the claimant received a copy of the police investigation report stating that the investigation had concluded and the damages were done by an unknown person. However, this allegation is omitted from the PIF narrative.\n[56] In view of all of the above, notwithstanding the credibility of their evidence, the panel finds that on the occasions police were called, the police took the report. However, absent any information regarding the culprits, one cannot say that adequate protection was not provided or that the police action was operationally not adequate.\nForward-looking aspect of the claim\n[57] The panel is mindful that the claimants arrived in Canada in 2011. Therefore, the panel will address the forward-looking aspect of the claim with respect to securing housing, employment, access to health, and regular education, if the claimants were to return to Hungary today, at the time of the hearing. With respect to the forward-looking aspect of the claim, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants would likely face some discrimination, however, the panel is not persuaded that it will rise to the level of persecution. The panel has considered the government's steps taken to improve these areas, to integrate Roma, and the impact of their efforts.\nGeneral background\n[58] The documentary evidence indicates the following:\nSources indicate that Roma account for approximately 7.5 percent of the population of Hungary ... the 2011 Hungarian census as stating there were 315,000 people who self-identified as Roma, accounting for 3 percent of the population, but that unofficial estimates range from 500,000 to 800,000 people.30\nSources indicate that Roma in Hungary face discrimination \"in all fields of life,\" including education, housing, employment, health care and political participation ...the office of the Ombudsman notes that Roma complainants \"most often talk about prejudices present in society, discriminative treatment as well as severe social and accommodation problems\" ....31\nEducation\n[59] Around the same time that the claimants came to Canada, a National Roma Integration Program and Strategy, which began in 2011, was directed at improving the situation of education and poverty in Hungary. It is noted that, at the time of the beginning of the program, one third of Hungary's population lived below the poverty line. As the Roma community do not comprise one third of the population, this poverty index and poor achievement in the area of education and employment applied to ethnic Hungarians as well,32 and took on significant importance in Hungary and the EU. With respect to the forward looking aspect of the claim, the panel notes that,\n[T]he law establishes cultural autonomy for nationalities (replacing the term \"minorities\"), and recognizes the right to foster and enrich historic traditions, language, culture, and educational rights, as well as to establish and operate institutions and maintain international contacts.33\n[60] However,\n...the public education system continued to provide inadequate instruction for members of minorities in their own languages, as required by law, and Romani-language schoolbooks and qualified teachers were in short supply.34\n[61] According to the United States (US) Department of State (DOS) report,35\nAlthough the law provides for free and compulsory education between the ages of three and sixteen, and prohibits school segregation. NGOs reported the segregation of Romani children in schools and frequent misdiagnosis of Romani children as mentally disabled.\nIn November 2016, the Appeals Court of Pecs adopted a decision ordering the desegregation of a Roma-only school in Kaposvar. Despite the judgment, the municipality of Kaposvar, in cooperation with the local school authority and the county government, attempted to restore segregation by allowing and supporting a private foundation to establish a new school in the same building in which the segregated school was operating. The municipality proposed to offer education in a private school for the Romani children residing in the close vicinity of the building, and thus, avoid their integration into mainstream schools. The Ministry of Human Capacities intervened to prevent the private school from opening. On October 4, the Supreme Court affirmed the lower court ruling, that segregation is illegal and ordered the desegregation of the school.\nIn 2015, a lawsuit was filed on behalf of 62 children against the municipality of Gyongyospata and the Klebelsberg School Maintenance Center, for their segregation in the primary school in Gyongyospata, for damages stemming from the low quality of their education, and for nonpecuniary damages related to their segregation. The lawsuit was pending at year's end.\nThe European Commission launched an infringement procedure against Hungary, due to school segregation in May 2016, since, according to the commission, the widespread segregation of Romany children constitutes a breach of EU regulations. In order to ensure compliance with European antidiscrimination standards, in June 2017, the Hungarian parliament amended the Equal Treatment Act, and extended the prohibition of school segregation even to entities of religious education. This step effectively eliminated the loophole in Hungarian legislation allowing for the segregation of Roma children, if it serves the purpose of \"Roma evangelization.\" The European Commission had yet to close the infringement case by the end of the year. In October, the K\u00faria agreed with the judgment of the P\u00e9cs Regional Court of Appeal, which ordered the closure of a segregated primary school in Kaposv\u00e1r last year. The decision will serve as important case law for the future.36\n[62] The panel concludes that, since the claimants have left Hungary some eight years ago, programs at the operational level have been put in place to foster education amongst all children, in spite of their ethnicities. Specific to the Roma education is the development of the Sure Start Centres, which offer early education intervention programs and opportunities for disadvantaged children, along with parenting assistance and tutoring.37\n[63] The documentary evidence before this panel does not establish that Roma are being outright denied the opportunity to obtain an education at any level.\n[64] Additionally, the European Union has become actively involved in funding programs in the area of extracurricular learning opportunities with alternative learning facilities all over Hungary.38\n[65] The panel overall does not find that the claimants have established persuasive evidence of discrimination amounting to persecution in the area of education in Hungary at the time of the hearing.\nEmployment\n[66] According to the US DOS report,39\n...discrimination in employment and occupation occurred with respect to Roma, women, and persons with disabilities. According to NGOs, there was economic discrimination against women in the workplace, particularly against job seekers older than 50, and those who were pregnant or had returned from maternity leave. A government decree requires companies with more than 25 employees to reserve 5 percent of their work positions for persons with physical or mental disabilities. While the decree provides fines for noncompliance, employers generally paid the fines rather than employ persons with disabilities. The National Tax and Customs Authority issued \"rehabilitation cards\" for disabled persons, which granted tax benefits for employers employing such individuals.\n[67] The panel acknowledges that Roma occupy the most disadvantaged position in the labour market as, formerly, the employment rate of the Roma population barely reached 20%.40 However, in 2011, a new law on public employment entered into force, creating a new system for public work and launching various programmes.41 One of these is the \"Start Work Programme,\" which provides public employment work as a first step to finding employment in the private sector.42 The wages for public employment are higher than social benefits but, in order to encourage a return to the competitive sector, lower than the minimum wage at any given time.43 As a result, Hungary has begun to see a decline in the unemployment rates for Roma people. In 2013, Roma women have labour market participation rate of 32% and Roma men 26%.44\n[68] The claimant's work history indicates that he worked in Canada from February 2012 to September 2012.45 He is not employed in Canada despite having a work permit. He explained that he is unable to work because he has diabetes and relies on welfare to financially support his family. The panel is not persuaded that diabetes, on a balance of probability, would prevent the claimant from obtaining employment if he were to return to Hungary.\n[69] The female claimant's evidence indicates that she has been unemployed in Canada since her arrival.\n[70] Given his history of employment in Hungary, the panel concludes that, on a balance of probabilities, the adult claimants will not experience problems in finding employment if they were to return to Hungary and intended to work.\n[71] The documentary evidence before this panel does not establish that Roma are being denied, outright, the opportunity to obtain any employment.\nHealth\n[72] According to the objective evidence:\n[i]n Hungary, every patient has the right to receive adequate and accessible (available in 24 hours a day) medical care with equal treatment, as considered necessary based on his\/her health status, without regard to the ethnicity of the patient, in accordance with conditions laid down in the applicable legislation. Pursuant to the definition in Act CLIV of 1997 of Healthcare (E\u00fctv.), a patient is a person using or receiving healthcare, and the scope of the law covers all natural persons living or staying in the territory of Hungary. No discrimination is made in the legislation on the basis of ethnicity when anyone is in need of medical care.46\nConcerning efforts to improve health care for Roma, the Hungarian embassy Official provided information about the Swiss-Hungarian Cooperation Programme (2012-2016), which, by 2015, provided health examinations to 19,000 people in northern Hungary, 40 percent of which were from the Roma community (Hungary 25 July 2016). The program also reportedly facilitated healthcare mediator training for 48 individuals to act as \"Roma health guardians\" within Roma communities (ibid.). In addition, the Swiss-Hungarian Cooperation Programme included a \"Roma mother-child health programme,\" in which district nurses provided counselling to mothers and health examinations to children in 13 of the \"most disadvantageous settlements\" (ibid.).47\n[73] Given the country condition documents, the panel does not find convincing evidence of a lack of access to medical care in Hungary for these claimants, if they were to return to Hungary.\nHousing\n[74] According to the documentary evidence,\nHungarian authorities report that approximately 500,000 to 600,000 Roma live in \"disadvantaged\" regions of Hungary (Hungary 12 Feb. 2016, para. 51). European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) reports that, according to the National Social Inclusion Strategy \"Extreme Poverty, Child Poverty and the Roma\" (NSIS), 60 percent of Roma live in rural areas, mostly in segregated residential zones in poor conditions (Council of Europe 9 June 2015, 27).48\nCivil society organizations monitoring the implementation of the Decade of Roma Inclusion strategy, have argued that very little concrete improvements have been made to improve Roma access to social housing by the government, and that the limited funds allocated to housing-related developments were funded by the EU, not from national funds.49\nAccording to Amnesty International (AI), authorities in Miskolc have forcibly evicted \"hundreds\" of Roma from the \"Numbered Streets\" neighbourhood of Miskolc, between May 2014, and June 2015; the vast majority were not offered adequate alternative housing or compensation (AI 29 June 2015).50\n[75] The panel, mindful of the documentary evidence, acknowledges that Roma are discriminated in obtaining housing, however, the panel does not find convincing evidence of a lack of access to housing in Hungary for Roma. The panel finds that having to live in a Roma area may be discriminatory, however, it does not amount to persecution.\n[76] In the circumstances of this case, the claimant owns his dwelling in a predominantly Hungarian neighbourhood of Budapest; therefore, the panel concludes that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimants have housing in Budapest to return to.\nSkinhead\/Jobbik Party\n[77] With respect to the Skinhead and the Jobbik Party, the panel notes the documentary evidence indicates the following:\nIn its 2015 report on Hungary, ECRI states that racist violence against Roma, including activities carried out by extremist groups, \"is one of the most important problems in Hungary,\" although it notes that the situation improved as of 2013 (Council of Europe 9 June 2015, 9). According to the US Overseas Security Advisory Council's (OSAC) 2016 Crime and Safety Report for Hungary, although the disbanded Magyar Guarda (Hungarian Guard) extremist group, which is associated with Jobbik, continued to operate and to \"intimidate and conduct anti-Roma activity\" across the country, \"it has lost much of its influence and ability to recruit new members in recent years\" (US 15 Feb. 2016).51[emphasis added]\n[78] The advisory committee on the framework convention for the protection of national minorities stated:\nAttacks against the Roma have continued in recent years. In the political arena, the largest opposition party, Jobbik, continued its campaign of prejudice and hate speech against the Roma, and the Internet has become the principal medium for dissemination of anti-Gypsy and anti-Semitic rhetoric. Although remedies against on-line hate speech exist and have been occasionally used, overall the Hungarian-language social media are rife with offensive content. Extremist right-wing movements continue to organise intimidating marches through Roma settlements harassing their residents. The susceptibility of a significant part of society to openly xenophobic and discriminatory rhetoric is a source of grave concern.52\n[79] The documentary evidence indicates that in November of 2016, Toroczkai the mayor of \u00c1sotthalom, a village of around 4,000 inhabitants, and while he was a member of Jobbik,\n...introduced decrees that prohibited Muslims from wearing \"Islamic\" attire in public, forbade the opening of mosques in town, banned the construction of minarets, and forbade the promotion of same-sex marriage in public or \"'any kind of propaganda activity' which presented marriage as anything other than a union between a man and a woman\" (Hungary Today 12 Apr. 2017). The Hungarian Free Press, an Ottawa-based, English-language online newspaper (Hungarian Free Press n.d.), explains that a fine of 150,000 Hungarian forints (HUF) [approximately C$713] would be given to \"[a]nyone 'apprehended' promoting gay rights in public or wearing traditional Islamic garb\" (Hungarian Free Press 29 Nov. 2016).53\n[80] However,\nSources indicate that Hungary's Constitutional Court invalidated the decrees as unconstitutional (HungaryToday 12 Apr. 2017; The Independent 13 Apr. 2017), ruling that local authorities cannot introduce regulations that affect basic rights (Hungary Today 12 Apr. 2017).54\n[81] With respect to the claimants accessing state protection, and with respect to skinhead or Hungarian racist attacks, the panel relies on its analysis noted below with respect to state protection.\n[82] The panel notes that the documentary evidence indicates that,\nAn amendment to the Act on the National Assembly was introduced in 2013, allowing members of Parliament to be fined or excluded from proceedings for abusive language or expressions offending the dignity of any national, ethnic, racial or religious community.\nThe Hungarian Guard Association was dissolved by the Metropolitan Court of Appeal in 2009 on account of its extreme right-wing paramilitary activities. The Criminal Code now also includes the offence of abuse of freedom of assembly.\nFollowing the \"Roma murders\" in 2008-2009, a specialised unit was set up in the police on hate crime and training sessions have been organised with the help of NGOs. Police constantly monitor areas at risk of conflict. They now also monitor files in cases of violence and can re-qualify an offence if any hate motivation is suspected.55\n[83] The panel notes, that while the documentary evidence indicates that racist violence against Roma is one of the most important problems in Hungary; however, it further states that the situation improved in 2013.56\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[84] For the purposes of section 96 of the IRPA, personal targeting or past persecution is not required in order to establish a risk. Rather, persecution can be established by examining the situation of similarly situated individuals.57 The panel finds that the Balogh decision is consistent with these principles. As explained by Justice LeBlanc at paragraph 19 of this decision,58\nMoreover, while the documentary evidence of general country conditions of Roma in Hungary raises human rights concerns, the mere fact of being of Roma ethnicity in Hungary is not, in and of itself, sufficient to establish that an applicant faces more than a mere possibility of persecution upon return (Csonka v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 1056, at paras 67-70 [Csonka]; Ahmad v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2004 FC 808, at para 22 [Ahmad]. Both subjective fear and objective fear are components in respect of a valid claim for refugee status (Csonka, art para 3). The applicant has a burden of establishing a link between the general documentary evidence and the applicant's specific circumstances (Proph\u00e8te 4 v Canada (Citizenship & Immigration), 2008 FC 331, at para 17; Jarada v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 409, at para 28; Ahmad, at para 22).\n[85] The Federal Court, in Molnar,59 has indicated that there are obvious and fully acknowledged problems in regard to human rights abuses in Hungary that have to be confronted by the Roma people, and, as a result, a state protection analysis is not easy. It further indicates that much will depend on the facts and evidence adduced in each case.\n[86] The claimants submitted that state protection was not, and would not, be available to them should they be returned to Hungary.\n[87] In 2015, the Roma Press Center \"collected accounts of approximately 50 incidents in which \"disproportionately high\" fines were imposed on Roma for \"absurd\" misdemeanours.60\nA 2018 report by the UN Human Rights Committee indicates that in Hungary, there is a \"prevalence of hate crimes and ... hate speech targeting minorities,\" including Roma, and states that \"police often fail to investigate and prosecute credible claims of hate crimes and criminal hate speech.61\nMinority Rights Group International (MRG) reports that Roma face \"continued hostility\" from police forces in Hungary, which includes a \"failure to protect\" them from attacks (MRG Jan. 2018). Amnesty International indicates that the state's response to violence against Roma \"has been feeble\" and that the police \"regularly\" treat hate crimes against Roma as \"ordinary crimes.62\n[88] The panel is mindful that the claimants arrived in Canada in 2011, and the panel must assess the claim based on the objective evidence before it at the time of the hearing, in this case, in 2019. The panel is mindful of the decision of the Federal Court in Kotai:\nThe country conditions do not suggest that the situation is so bleak that all Roma, regardless of their particular circumstances, should not be expected to make reasonable efforts to seek state protection before seeking refugee protection in another country.63\n[89] Refugee protection is meant to be a form of surrogate protection, to be invoked only in those situations where the refugee claimant has unsuccessfully sought the protection of their home state. The onus is on the refugee claimant to approach the state for protection, in situations where state protection might be reasonably forthcoming.64 In the absence of a compelling explanation, a failure to pursue state protection opportunities within the home state will usually be fatal to a refugee claim, at least, where the state is a functioning democracy with a willingness and the apparatus necessary, to provide a measure of protection to its citizens\n[90] The panel acknowledges, that anti-Roma violence and harassment are an everyday occurrence for many Roma. However, it is presumed that a state is able and willing to afford protection to its citizens unless it is in a state of complete breakdown.65 This is not the case, as Hungary is a democracy, perhaps they have shifted to the right, but it still holds free and fair elections, and as a member state of the EU with accountability beyond its own borders to the European Union. At times it may not be successful, the protection offered by the state need not be perfect, but it must be adequate.66 Claimants have an even heavier burden, in cases where they come from a 'democratic country'.67\n[91] Where the protective services of the home state has gaps or deficiencies, the fact that the state is not always successful in protecting its citizens is not enough to justify a claim. This is particularly true when the state is in effective control of its territory and has military, police, and civil authorities in place, and is making serious attempts to protect its citizens.68 The panel acknowledges that there are problems with the interaction between police and the Roma community. While some Roma had trouble with police, overall, the objective country evidence indicates that there were no reports of impunity in involving Hungarian security forces.69 There is evidence that Hungary enforces the law against corrupt police. The government took some steps to prosecute and punish officials who committed abuses. Impunity for human rights abuses was not widespread.70\n[92] The panel acknowledges that,\nThe European Roma Rights Centre (ERRC) indicates, in a submission prepared for three Hungarian cases before the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), that it \"survey[ed] recent evidence that the national bodies in Hungary responsible for protecting Roma against violence suffer institutional racism, particularly institutional anti-Gypsyism\".71\n[93] However, the panel also notes that,\n...the Hungarian Supreme Court established, in a February 2017 judgment, that the local police in Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6spata failed to protect Roma against harassment by extremist groups (US 20 Apr. 2018, 36; HCLU 17 Feb. 2017) \"that organized illegal patrols, marching through the Roma rows of the village for several weeks, intimidating local residents\" in the spring of 2011 (HCLU 17 Feb. 2017). According to the HCLU, in its February 2017 judgment, the Supreme Court of Hungary \"ruled that the failure to protect the Roma from racist harassment amounted to harassment under the [Equal Treatment Act]\" (HCLU 17 Feb. 2017).72\n[94] The panel finds this demonstrates the government's efforts of operational improvement. Furthermore, the government has implemented programs which provide hate crime training for \"police, courts and prosecutors\" and also provides legal assistance and support to victims of hate crime.73 As well, as to involve Roma in the state's security apparatus, and to encourage young Roma to join their ranks.74 The panel also notes, that the authorities had some success in curtailing abuse by the police by increasing the recruitment of Roma police officers, providing training in human rights and filling complaints against misbehaviour of the police.\nAn April 2014 article posted by the US Department of State reports that the Fraternal Association of European Roma Law Enforcement Officers (FAERLEO) was co-founded in 2006 by Gy\u00f6rgy Makula, a police major and Deputy Head of the Communication Service of the Hungarian National Police Headquarters (US 7 Apr.2014). Quoting Makula, the article states that\n\"FAERLEO aims to promote equal opportunities in the law enforcement agencies of Hungary and other EU member states, reduce mutual prejudices between law enforcement agencies and Roma communities, increase the number of Roma staff at law enforcement agencies, and improve the lives and service conditions of current Roma staff members. To achieve these goals, FAERLEO has international, national and regional initiatives.\" For example, FAERLEO is implementing a project titled the \"Roma Law Enforcement Community Tour,\" which is supported by the U.S. Embassy, as well as the British and Norwegian Embassies and the Hungarian police. (US 7 Apr. 2014).75\n[95] The panel acknowledges that, according to documentary evidence noted above, anti-Roma prejudice is present among police officers in Hungary, and Roma are subject to ethnic profiling by the police. Roma were disproportionately penalised by the police for petty offences.\n[96] The panel also notes that Hungary has taken serious steps to improve the Roma situation. According to the Council of Europe report,76 Hungary has continued its vigorous efforts to develop policies designed to protect national minorities. The new Fundamental Law (Constitution) adopted in 2011 enumerates a broad catalogue of rights of persons belonging to national minorities (in Hungarian terminology: \"nationalities\"). Detailed provisions defining the rights of national minorities are contained in ordinary legislation, such as the Cardinal Act on the Rights of Nationalities, the Act on the Election of Members of Parliament and the Act on Electoral Procedure, the Act on National Public Education and the Act on National Tertiary Education, adopted in 2011-2013. In spite of the good intentions, these rapid changes have resulted in some minority organisations experiencing insecurities with their implementation.\n[97] According to the 2014 article written by Gy\u00f6rgy Makula,\n[he served as a] Roma liaison officer to act as a point of contact between the police and the Roma [c]ommunity. Sometimes Roma fear speaking to the police or distrust them, because of previous ill treatment or discrimination, so having someone who understands their background and identity can help them to feel more comfortable. In addition, for other Hungarians, they can use our liaison officers to better understand Roma and acknowledge why certain problems may be occurring. (Open Society Foundations 3 June 2014)77\n[98] However, the situation has improved for Roma individuals since 2013.78 Since that time, important changes have been made with respect to state protection for Roma individuals.\nA specialised unit was set up by the police on hate crime, which provides support and legal assistance. In addition, one officer in every county (there are 20 including Budapest) is now specialised in hate-motivated crime. Training sessions have been organised with the help of NGOs, focusing on the identification of evidence, awareness raising, and support to victims. Police now monitor files in cases of violence, and can re-qualify an offence if any hate motivation is suspected. Officers have good contacts with civil society, including Roma organisations. This is seen as a very positive development, and the police have been commended by numerous NGOs. Furthermore, since the Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6spata incident (where the Supreme Court ruled that local police in Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6spata had discriminated against the local Romani community in 2011 by failing to protect them against harassment by extremist groups) the police constantly monitor areas at risk of conflict. Anti-terrorism authorities also monitor the communications and activities of paramilitary groups.79\n[99] In Mudrak,80 Mr. Justice Annis states that:\nMore substantively, suggesting that police oversight agencies have no role in demonstrating adequate state protection is like saying senior policing management has no role in policing due to their oversight function, or saying that policing is a short-term operational exercise. Similarly, denying oversight agencies an important role in police protection would suggest that the police complaints process, and thereafter the courts in Canada, have no responsibility in ensuring adequate policing. This is surely an unsustainable proposition. It is no counter-argument that Canadian police are more responsive to complaints about their conduct, which in some recent instances at least, might be challenged. The point is that the evidence in the Hungarian Roma persecution claims indicates that the oversight agencies are diligent in their investigations and in reporting their findings to the police. The transparency and accompanying public criticism of the state protection apparatus is an important ingredient to reforms and improvement in protection services accorded to Roma citizens.\nThe requirement to access police oversight agencies is particularly important where the persecution is in the form of random incidents, such as is normally the case for members of the Roma community. Adequate state protection against random crime must operate at a community level over a longer time frame, because responding to any particular victim cannot assure that future random attacks from other assailants will not occur. To the extent that random criminal conduct can be prevented by means other than increased patrols, effective policing can have a deterrent effect by arresting and successfully prosecuting wrongdoers accompanied by the declaratory publicity attached to successful convictions.\nThus, looking ahead, no crime prevention process can be effective if victims of crime do not report incidents to the police and proactively cooperate in their investigations, including complaining if not satisfied with the efforts of the police. If the rhetorical question is whether all members of the Roma community will be better protected from a rule requiring they follow up instances of inadequate policing with oversight agencies, I would argue, yes it would.\n[100] The panel finds the protection afforded to the claimants prior to coming to Canada, in the circumstances of their case, were adequate, although it did not meet the claimant's expectation. On the occasions the claimant approached the police, reports were taken. However, the police were unable to carry on an investigation due to lack of evidence, and the fact that the culprits were unknown. The panel finds that the protection offered by the state, in these circumstances, may not have been perfect, however, absent sufficient evidence to carry out an investigation, it was adequate and operationally effective.81\n[101] In the case at hand, the state is not the agent of persecution. There are no allegations of police brutality or impunity before the panel. However, the claimants were not satisfied with the responses they received from the police. In addition, the state has acknowledged the mandate of the police is to provide protection by also providing a means through which to address breaches on the part of the police. Complaints against police may also be brought through the Prosecutorial Investigation Office, which meets the threshold for criminal liability.82\n[102] In Jarada,83 Justice Yves de Montigny held that,\n[T]he assessment of the applicant's potential risk of being persecuted if he were sent back to his country must be individualized. The fact that the documentary evidence shows that the human rights situation in a country is problematic does not necessarily mean there is a risk to a given individual.\n[103] In Jean, Justice Shore also addressed the need for personalized risk,84 stating at paragraph 33:\nAn applicant must establish that there is a personalized risk based on his or her personal circumstances, which was not done in this case: the applicants did not show that their particular situation would cause a personalized risk, and the documentary evidence does not support their allegations.\n[104] The panel concludes that, should the claimants face any violence on return, the documentary evidence noted below indicates programs that came into effect after the claimants left Hungary. It indicates that police arrest and prosecute the perpetrators of crimes, including crimes committed against Roma and other ethnic minorities and their property. In fact, the courts have become involved in cases where the police have failed to exercise their discretion.\nIn January the ECHR ruled that police failed to provide adequate protection to two Romani individuals who were attacked with stones and bottles during a demonstration by Jobbik and paramilitary groups in Devecser in 2012 or to conduct a proper investigation of the incident.\nIn February the Supreme Court ruled that local police in Gyongyospata had discriminated against the local Romani community in 2011 by failing to protect them against harassment by extremist groups.85\n[105] If the claimants were ever dissatisfied with the response of the authorities to any complaint, there is recourse through the Independent Police Complaints Board (IPCB), which investigates violations and omissions by the police.86\n[106] Sources also confirm that \"there are legal aid services available in Hungary to 'indigent persons with legal problems, which may also include the violation of the right of equal treatment'.\"87 These services can also be of use in the police complaints process.\nCONCLUSION\n[107] The panel finds that there is less than a mere possibility that the claimants will be persecuted, if they were to return to Hungary, pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA,88 on a convention ground, ethnicity, if they return to Hungary.\n[108] No evidence was presented that they face particularized risk of harm in accordance with section 97(1) of the IRPA. Further, on a balance of probabilities, their removal to Hungary will not subject them to a risk to life, to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or to a danger of torture pursuant to section 97(1) of the IRPA.89\nDECISION\n[109] For these reasons, the panel finds the claimants, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX, are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.\n[110] Their claims are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Fahimeh Mortazavi\"\nFahimeh Mortazavi\nJuly 15, 2019\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1)\n2 Refugee Protection Division Rules, SOR\/2012-256.\n3 Exhibit 1, Package of information from the referring CBSA\/CIC, received December 7, 2011.\n4 Exhibit 2, Personal Information Form (PIF) - TB1-19642, amended April 15, 2019; Exhibit 3, PIF - TB1-19650, amended April 15, 2019; Exhibit 4, PIF - TB1-19652, amended April 15, 2019.\n5 Exhibit 1, Package of information from the referring CBSA\/CIC, received December 7, 2011.\n6 Exhibit 2, PIF - TB1-19642, Question 1(g), at p. 2, amended April 15, 2019; Exhibit 3, PIF - TB1-19650, Question 1(g), at p. 2, amended April 15, 2019; Exhibit 4, PIF - TB1-19652, Question 1(g), at p. 2, amended April 15, 2019.\n7 Exhibit 7, Additional Disclsoure, at p. 311, received August 1, 2012.\n8 Orelien, Joseph v.

She returned to China from the United States XXXX XXXX XXXX 2011, to seek medical help. While there, she saw a doctor who diagnosed her with migraines.\n[6] In December of 2011, the claimant's friend introduced her to Falun Gong (FG). After practicing at home she joined the group practice in January 2012. The group practice was raided by the Public Security Bureau (PSB) on February 5, 2012. The claimant escaped and went into hiding. The PSB went to her home, accused her of being a FG practitioner, and confiscated some photos. The claimant left China and came to Canada. The PSB are still looking for her. She fears being arrested and not being able to practice FG freely, if she has to return to China.\nAddendum\n[7] In a PIF Addendum3 received by the Board on May 15, 2018, the claimant indicates that she has given birth to two children in Canada in 2013 and 2016, and hence, she fears that if she were to return to China, she would be forced to wear an intrauterine device (IUD) or use other forms of birth control, which she does not wish to do.\nDETERMINATION\n[8] Based on the evidence before me, I find that the Minister has not met the legal burden that there are serious reasons to consider that the claimant was involved in a serious non-political crime before she arrived in Canada and claimed refugee protection. The claimant is, thus, not excluded pursuant to Article 1F(b) of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees (\"Refugee Convention\").4\n[9] I also find that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nIDENTITY\n[10] I find that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant is a citizen of China. Her identity has been established by her oral testimony, and documents submitted by the Minister.5\nEXCLUSION 1F(B)\n[11] The Minister provided documentary evidence6 submitting that the claimant should be excluded due to serious non-political criminality, pursuant to section 98 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act7and Article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention.8\n[12] The Minister provided the following facts and submissions regarding exclusion:9\nThe Minister is of the opinion that article 1F(b) of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees has been raised by this claim. The grounds for this intervention are the claimant's criminal activities in the United States prior to her entry into Canada.\n...\n...The Minister submits that there are serious reasons to consider that she has committed serious non-political crimes in the United States prior to her admission to Canada.\n[13] The claimant is wanted in the United States for having committed burglary, theft, and the fraudulent use of a credit cards prior to entering Canada.\n[14] Canada considers theft and fraudulent use of credit cards to be serious crimes, which is indicated by the fact that they can be treated as indictable offenses, punishable by a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment under the Criminal Code of Canada.10\n[15] According to section 98(1) of IRPA: \"A person referred to in section E or F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention is not a Convention Refugee or person in need of protection.\"11\n[16] Subsection 1F(b) of Article 1, of the Refugee Convention states:12\nThe provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:\n...\nb) he has committed a serious nonpolitical crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee...\n[17] The standard of proof on which the Minister must demonstrate the case for exclusion before the Board is that of \"serious reasons for considering\", which is below the civil standard of proof of a \"balance of probabilities.\"13 The crime does not have to have been prosecuted for the standard of proof to be met.14\n[18] According to the Federal Court, any offence for which a maximum sentence of 10 years could be imposed under Canadian law is presumed to be serious.15\n[19] In order for crime to be considered political it must be committed with the motive of changing a government, or government policy.16 In this case, there is no indication that the crimes were politically motivated.\n[20] The Minister has submitted evidence, which indicates that:17\nOn October 12, 2011, the claimant was arrested and charged by the North Brunswick Police Department of Middlesex County, New Jersey with: seven (7) counts of Burglary, four (4) counts of Theft, five (5) counts Unlawful Theft or Receipt of a Credit Card and four (4) counts of Fraudulent Use of a Credit Card. On January 19, 2012, the Superior Court of New Jersey, Middlesex County Criminal Division issued a bench warrant for the claimant's arrest.\n[21] The UNHCR Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status defines \"serious crime\" as \"a capital crime or a very grave punishable act.\"18 For the purpose of exclusion under Article 1F(b), this serious crime is to have been committed by an applicant \"outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee.\"19 In this case, the state of refuge is Canada. According to the UNHCR Handbook: \"The aim of this exclusion clause is to protect the community of a receiving country from the danger of admitting a refugee who has committed serious common crime...\"20\nSeriousness of the Crimes\n[22] Subsection 101(2)(b) of the IRPA states that a claim is not ineligible by reason of serious criminality under Article 1(f), unless \"in the case of inadmissibility by reason of a conviction outside Canada, the conviction is for an offence that, if committed in Canada, would constitute an offence under an Act of Parliament punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 10 years. 21 In the case of a crime committed outside Canada, subsection 101(2)(b) makes the length of the sentence actually imposed by a foreign government, irrelevant.\n[23] The Federal Court of Canada has considered the issue of what constitutes a \"serious, non-political crime.\" In Chan22 the Court presumed, \"without deciding, that a serious non-political crime is to be equated with one in which a maximum sentence of ten years or more could have been imposed had the crime been committed in Canada.\" However, as indicated by Mr. Justice Kelen in the Xie23 decision, that benchmark is not the end of the analysis and adopting Mr. Justice Robertson's guideline in Chan \"does not preclude an examination of all the relevant surrounding circumstances...\"\n[24] The Federal Court of Appeal, in Ramirez24 held that the term \"serious reasons for considering\" imposed a lower than civil standard of proof. Further elaboration is provided in Zrig25 and Sivakumar,26 where the standard of proof to be met by the Minister is described as being well below that required in criminal law (beyond a reasonable doubt) or of civil law (balance of probabilities). The Court has held that the standard of proof requires more than suspicion or conjecture.\n[25] Therefore, there is a measure or standard to apply to determine firstly, whether there are serious reasons for considering in the first part of Article 1F(b).\n[26] The original charges against the claimant in regard to the theft and use of credit cards are applicable under section 342 of the Criminal Code of Canada.27 This is a hybrid offence, which may be prosecuted summarily or by indictment. However, it is the maximum sentence for the indictable offence that must be considered to determine whether the presumption of seriousness comes into play. In this case, it does.\n[27] Minister's counsel argues that had the claimant committed the alleged crime theft of credit card and fraudulent use of credit card in Canada, she could have received the maximum penalty ten years of imprisonment and, thus, under Article 1F(b), is excluded from claiming refugee protection in Canada.28\n[28] The first determination to be made is whether there are \"serious reasons for considering,\" and what evidence there is to support such a consideration. Minister's Counsel maintains that court records and the warrant for the claimant's arrest issued by the same courts in New Jersey, are indisputable documentary evidence of the claimant's criminal activity in the United States. Minister's Counsel argues that this documentation is prima facie evidence as \"serious reasons\" for considering. Justice Richards in the Lai29 decision indicated:\n...it was established that an 'exclusion' hearing under Article 1F(b) is not in the nature of a criminal trial where guilt or innocence must be proven by the Minister beyond a reasonable doubt. Rather, the onus upon the Minister is to establish, based on the evidence presented to the Board, that there are \"serious reasons for considering\" that [the claimants] committed serious non-political crimes... prior to their arrival in Canada.\n[29] The Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) in the Ezokola rules that the standard of evidence to be applied to this threshold is higher than a mere suspicion but lower than proof on the civil balance of probabilities.30\n[30] Minister's counsel submits that based on the court records from New Jersey, the acknowledgement of the court records by the claimant in sworn testimony, and the acknowledgement that she committed the crimes, except for the one alleged attempt of theft from a car, there is evidence that a prima facie case has been satisfactorily established that there is sufficient information for the Board to find that there are \"serious reasons for considering.\"\n[31] I am mindful that the United States of America is a highly democratic nation, governed by a president chosen in multiparty elections. Civilian authorities maintain control of the security forces, the country has not been invaded, there is no civil war and the United States is otherwise in control of its own territory. It is against this background, along with the arguments and testimony provided, that I must determine the \"serious reasons for considering.\" I am satisfied that based upon the warrant for the claimant's arrest, along with the court records from New Jersey, issued by a democratic country, that it carries enough weight as evidence sufficient for \"serious reasons\" for considering. It is not my responsibility to determine her guilt or innocence with respect to the charges laid against the claimant in New Jersey. It is only my responsibility to determine if there is more than a mere suspicion that there are \"serious reasons for considering\" that there were such charges.\n[32] I find, based upon the production and acknowledgement of the outstanding warrant from the United States of America, a democratic nation, together with the claimant's admission of the crimes, that there are \"serious reasons for considering\" under Article 1F(b).\n[33] The next element of exclusion is to consider whether or not the claimant \"committed a serious non-political crime.\" I rely on the decisions of Xie31 and Jayasekara32 with respect to what is considered a serious non-political crime. The factors to be considered include:\n* The nature of the act;\n* The harm inflicted;\n* The form of procedure used to prosecute the crime;\n* The nature of the penalty for the crime; and\n* Whether most jurisdictions would consider the act in question to be a serious non-political crime.\nThe nature of the act\n[34] The claimant admitted in the hearing room that she stole credit cards and cash from the lockers in the gym she belonged to over a period of several months, and that she fraudulently used those credit cards to buy clothes and a purse. The theft of the credit cards and their fraudulent use are acts that would be contrary to subsection 342(1) of the Criminal Code of Canada,33 carrying each a maximum penalty of 10 years if persecuted by indictment. As a result of the claimant's actions, several persons were victimized by having personal property stolen, and were also victimized by having their personal space and privacy invaded.\nThe harm inflicted\n[35] There is no persuasive evidence before the Board that anyone was physically harmed by the claimant's actions. However, the victims of the claimant's crime suffered financial harm and possible emotional harm by having their space invaded.\nForm of procedure used to prosecute the crime\n[36] The claimant was not prosecuted because she absconded and came to Canada, instead of attending court. The victims, therefore, had no form of redress.\nThe nature of the penalty for the crimes\n[37] Theft of and fraudulent use of credit cards is considered a serious offence in Canada. In Canada, persons committing this offence can face up to 10 years in prison\nWhether most jurisdictions would consider the act in question to be a serious non-political crime\n[38] No persuasive evidence was placed before the Board to indicate that the claimant committed the offence(s) to overthrow the government of the United States or to change a government policy of that country. The evidence placed before the Board indicates that the crimes committed were committed for financial gain and no other reason. Therefore, the crimes committed were non-political crimes.\nMitigating and aggravating circumstances\n[39] Minister's counsel submits that there are several aggravating factors to consider. The claimant did not take responsibility for her crimes. She did not appear before the courts in New Jersey and instead, fled the lawful jurisdiction of the American courts and is now wanted in the United States. When she came to Canada she was also not forthright in that she denied she ever lived in the US, and denied any criminality until faced with the biometric data and the existence of the bench warrant from New Jersey. The claimant therefore exhibits a history of not taking responsibility. She showed no remorse.\n[40] The victims were women from the athletic gym she belonged to. While the victims exercised, the claimant targeted their lockers. The claimant admitted to stealing credit cards and cash from the lockers. She confirmed that she stole cash from five victims and credit cards from six victims. She used three of the stolen credit cards. I find that these circumstances are an aggravating factor as the claimant violated the trust of these women, who had a right to expect that their property would be safe while they were exercising among fellow members.\n[41] The claimant's excuse for committing these crimes is that her mother needed immediate cash for medical treatment in China. At the same time, the claimant testified in the hearing room that she used the credit cards to buy clothes and a purse. I do not find that the claimant was compelled to steal money and credit cards for this purpose, as she had a younger brother working in the US who could have helped the claimant, if she needed to financially assist her ill mother. Furthermore, her brother allegedly borrowed $3,000 so the claimant could return to China. As well, the claimant stated that she was desperate for cash, but was able to purchase a plane ticket to China as she feared being deported from the US, where she had been living and working illegally since the age of 17. The Minister submits that the claimant did nothing to pay restitution to the victims and the fact that she absconded deprived the victims of being able to face the perpetrator and the ability to seek restitution.\n[42] The claimant was not a minor at the time of the crimes and she was not motivated by political gain.\n[43] After a careful review of both counsel's and Minister's counsel's submissions, I find no mitigating factors apply to this claim.\nSupreme Court of Canada (SCC) decision\n[44] As Justice de Montigny wrote in Jung,34 \"the presumption that a crime is 'serious' under Article 1F(b) if , were it committed in Canada, it would be punishable by a maximum of at least 10 years' imprisonment, was consistently applied by the courts.\"\n[45] However, I note that in the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Febles the court made comments regarding the test applicable to determine the seriousness of the criminality under s. 98 of IRPA and Article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention that are determinative in this case.\n[46] In Febles, the majority of the Supreme Court stated:35\nWhere a provision of the Canadian Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, has a large sentencing range, the upper end being ten years or more and the lower end being quite low, a claimant whose crime would fall at the less serious end of the range in Canada should not be presumptively excluded. Article 1F(b) is designed to exclude only those whose crimes are serious. The UNHCR has suggested that a presumption of serious crime might be raised by evidence of commission of any of the following offences: homicide, rape, child molesting, wounding, arson, drugs trafficking, and armed robbery. These are good examples of crimes that are sufficiently serious to presumptively warrant exclusion from refugee protection. However, as indicated, the presumption may be rebutted in a particular case. While consideration of whether a maximum sentence of ten years or more could have been imposed had the crime been committed in Canada is a useful guideline, and crimes attracting a maximum sentence of ten years or more in Canada will generally be sufficiently serious to warrant exclusion, the ten-year rule should not be applied in a mechanistic, decontextualized, or unjust manner. [footnotes omitted]\n[47] The Minister submits that the SCC comments in Febles are merely obiter; I, however, find the comments persuasive and also note that the reasoning was followed by Justice de Montigny in Jung36 and Justice Gleason in Tabagua.37\n[48] The offence in Canada under s. 342 is a hybrid offence. The Minister did not provide me with any documentation as to what range of sentence the claimant would likely get in Canada, considering that there is no evidence except for the claimant's testimony that the use of a stolen credit card was for approximately $1000 US dollars. It is my judgement that the claimant's sentence would not approach the maximum of 10 years, since the amounts in question were relatively small, there were no serious aggravating factors and no violence.\n[49] I, therefore, find on a balance of probabilities, that the offences would not be considered serious enough in Canada to cause the claimant to be excluded under Article 1F(b).\nIdentity Theft\n[50] Following the claimant's testimony that she purchased a social security card for $1,000 US in order to obtain a driver's license in the US, the Minister added the additional crime of identity theft, pursuant to s. 403 of the CCC.38\n[51] The claimant testified that she purchased a social security card in the US which she used to obtain a driver's license. I find that there is no evidence that the name on the social security card is that of a living or dead person, and therefore does not fit the definition of identity theft as per s. 403 of the CCC. There is also no evidence that the aliases the claimant used in the United States were those of real people, alive or dead.\n[52] Therefore, I find that the claimant would not be found guilty in Canada of identity theft as per the CCC.\n[53] Thus, I find that the claimant is not excluded from claiming refugee protection in Canada.\nCREDIBILITY\n[54] The claimant testified that she came on false passport to the United States in 2002, when she was 17 years old. She obtained the passport from a smuggler. She came \"just for fun\" and was not concerned she was using fraudulent documents. She remained in the US, working illegally, as her parents had told her that she did not have to return to China. The claimant also obtained a driver's license by purchasing a social insurance card. The claimant also used several aliases in the US.\n[55] When the claimant came to Canada in 2011 she was not forthright with Canadian immigration officials about her time residing in the US. It was only when she was shown the fingerprint evidence and the warrant that she finally admitted that she had lived in the US for nine years.\n[56] The claimant broke criminal laws in the US over a period of six months, by engaging in theft and credit card fraud.\n[57] I find that the claimant has shown that she is not a person who respects the rules and regulations of a democratic state and that she is ready to lie to authorities. Therefore, I find that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant lacks general credibility and her testimony is suspect.\nFalun Gong\n[58] I find that the claimant has not provided sufficient credible evidence that she was a FG practitioner in China.\n[59] The claimant allegedly left the United States, where she had been living illegally since she was 17 years old and returned to China in order to get medical treatment for her headaches and insomnia. She testified that she returned to China with a fraudulent passport and came to Canada with a different fraudulent passport, which were both supplied by smugglers.\n[60] I find that the claimant's reason for allegedly going to China for medical treatment does not make sense. The claimant alleges that she suffered from severe headaches and insomnia while in the US and could not get treatment for them because she could did not have medical insurance. However, the claimant did not try to go to a Chinese medicine doctor in the US. I do not find it credible that the claimant, who worked in a Chinese restaurant and lived one hour from Chinatown, could not get a referral to Chinese medicine practitioners. All she did when she went to China is go to a Chinese medicine doctor, as I believe she could have done in the US. The claimant was asked why she did not go to see a western medicine doctor while in China. The claimant said that she did not go because she had already tried Tylenol, which was not helpful. I do not believe that the claimant is so na\u00efve that she does not know Western doctors have a larger arsenal of treatment than just Tylenol. I also find it not credible that the claimant began practicing FG, which she knew was illegal in China, without first approaching western medicine doctors, if the Chinese medicine treatment was not helpful. In addition the claimant has no documentary evidence that she ever visited any doctor in China.\n[61] The claimant also does not have any documentary evidence that she actually returned to China from the United States, before coming to Canada to make her refugee claim. She allegedly used a fraudulent passport to return to China and a different fraudulent passport to come to Canada. She did not submit either of these passports. Further, the claimant has no documentary evidence that she came to Canada directly from China, as she alleges.\n[62] There were several inconsistencies that go to the heart of the claim with regard to the claimant having been a FG practitioner in China. I do realize that it has been a long time since the claimant came to Canada and that her memory may not be as accurate as when she first came to Canada in XXXX of 2012. However, it would be expected that the claimant would remember the most important features of her alleged practice. The claimant testified that she attended a FG group practice for a few months. However, her PIF39 indicates that she attended the group for only three weeks, from mid-January of 2012 to February 5, 2012. The claimant's only explanation for the discrepancy is that she forgot. I find that it not credible that the claimant would make such a significant mistake, especially given her testimony that she was in China for only a few months.\n[63] The claimant testified that the group practice was held at the organizer, Mr. XXXX house, when it was raided by the PSB on February 5, 2012. However, in her PIF,40 the claimant indicated that the group practice was at Mr. XXXX home when the raid occurred. When faced with the inconsistency, the claimant insisted that it was at Mr. XXXX home the night of the raid, even though they sometimes practiced at Mr. XXXX home. The claimant did not explain why the name was different in the PIF. It would be expected that since she went to the group practice for three weeks, that she would recall where she was when the raid occurred.\n[64] The claimant also gave confusing testimony as to where she was when the PSB came to her home to search for her. When asked the question of where she was when the PSB came to her home, she testified that she was at Mr. XXXX house. When the question was repeated for her, she gave the same answer, although she testified that after the raid, she went to her cousin's house as per the PIF. As noted above, the claimant indicated in her PIF that the raid was at Mr. XXXX house.\n[65] In her PIF, the claimant indicated that the PSB searched her house and found a photo of her with her friend who introduced her to FG, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who was one of the three arrested FG members. The PSB confiscated the photos. However, at the hearing, the claimant testified that when the PSB came, they searched the whole house and only took some clothes. To explain the inconsistency, the claimant said that she forgot because it has been a long time. The clothes have nothing to do with being a FG practitioner, but the photos do. I find that the claimant would not likely have forgotten about the PSB finding the photos of her with her friend, the introducer if the PSB had truly confiscated the photos..\n[66] The claimant has no documentary evidence that she is wanted by the PSB, such as a summons or a warrant.\n[67] Based on the totality of the above negative findings, I find that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant was not a FG practitioner in China.\nFalun Gong practice in Canada\n[68] The claimant testified that, once in Toronto, she continued to practice Falun Gong. She testified that she does the exercises in a group on Sundays at Milliken Park and that she reads Zhuan Falun every evening. She did not indicate that she attends any FG events and demonstrations. She did not submit any documentary evidence of her involvement in a group practice, such as letters from fellow practitioners.\n[69] I find that the claimant has little knowledge of FG philosophy and exercises. She was only asked a few questions, but was not able to answer any appropriately. The claimant admitted that she does not know the verses that are said before each exercise. The courts have held that a FG practitioner should be expected to know these 5 verses, which are simple, rhyme, and are extremely short.41 The claimant testified that she can recite them only a little bit. I note that the claimant has allegedly been a FG practitioner for over seven years, and would be expected to know the verses.\n[70] The claimant could not explain what is meant by \"evil cultivation\" and she did not know what is meant by \"sending out righteous thoughts.\"\n[71] I note that claimant's counsel did not ask the claimant any questions regarding her knowledge or practice of FG.\n[72] Moreover, having found that claimant's story of his alleged Falun Gong practice in China not to be credible, there is no reason for me to believe that she is now a practitioner of Falun Gong in Canada. In reaching this conclusion, I am guided by the dicta of the Federal Court in Jiang.42 Per Zinn, J., \"the Board must be entitled to import its credibility findings into its assessment of [a claimant's] sur place claim.\"43 I find that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant is not a FG practitioner in Canada, and would not continue the practice Falun Gong if she returns to China.\nFamily Planning Jeopardy\n[73] The claimant is married to a Canadian citizen and has two children who were born in Canada. They are not claimants and are not required to return to China. It is the claimant's and her husband's choice whether the children would move to China.\n[74] The claimant fears that if she returns to China she would be forced to wear an intrauterine device (IUD) and that she would be put in prison because she gave birth to more than one child. She also testified that she wants to have more children.\n[75] The claimant is not presently pregnant and it is speculative whether she will have more children.\n[76] As of January 2016, the one child policy has been replaced and all couples are permitted to have two children. The documentary evidence indicates that Chinese authorities have implemented the new law and also that more than two children may be allowed in some circumstances.44\n[77] I note that even before the Chinese government changed its one child policy, social compensation fees were imposed for children born out of plan.45 I also note that forced abortions are illegal in China.46\n[78] In fact, current documentary evidence indicates that Chinese authorities are concerned about a declining birth rate and are therefore discussing ways to encourage women to have more children. The Congressional-Executive Commission on China states the following:47\nAccording to a May 2018 Bloomberg News report, central government authorities were considering and may have reached a decision to end birth limit policies due to demographic concerns of a declining birth rate, an aging population, and a shrinking workforce. The report also cited international criticism of the policies as a factor in the decision. Chinese authorities reportedly may replace the existing birth limit policies with one of ''independent fertility,'' allowing couples to decide for themselves the number of children to have.38 According to the report, a decision may be announced toward the end of 2018 or in 2019... [footnotes omitted]\n[79] I have reviewed the Regulations of Fujian Province on Population and Family Planning, including the February 2016 amendments and I note the following:48\nArticle 10 When both the husband and wife are Chinese returned from overseas, whose children were born overseas and are residents of foreign countries before they return to China shall not be counted towards the number of children in the regulations.\n...\nArticle 16 In order to practise family planning, couples who already have children may choose to adopt safe, effective and appropriate contraceptive and birth control measures to prevent and reduce the incidence of unwanted pregnancies.\n[80] Further country document evidence49 indicates that Fujian province, where the claimant is from, has amended its family planning regulations in response to the new two-child policy.\n[81] This document states as well that the National Population and Family Planning Commission indicates that a choice is available as to contraceptive methods, and this is reiterated in Article 16 of Fujian's Regulations of Fujian Province on Population and Family Planning, as noted above.\n[82] I cite country document evidence in a Response to Information Request (RIR) concerning the implementation of the two-child policy, which indicates that according to a professor at the Institute of Population and Labour Economics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, \"all children born should be registered, no matter if they are second or third or higher births, prior to or after the regulations.\"50\n[83] Since the claimant has only two children, I find that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant would not be at risk of forced sterilization if she were to return to China, in the context of the lack of any evidence that Fujian family planning officials utilize forced measures after the implementation of the two-child policy, the context of Fujian policy requiring a social compensation fee as to the birth of additional children out of the , and also the widely reported Chinese government recognition that constraints on child-bearing have created a significant demographic problem as to needed population growth in the future.\n[84] With regard to being forced to wear an IUD, the United States Department of State's (DOS) \"China 2017 Human Rights Report\"51 indicates that the law is such that \"couples of child-bearing age shall voluntarily choose birth planning contraceptives and birth control measures to prevent unwanted pregnancies.\"\n[85] This document further states that \"[a]fter the transition to a two-child limit, the available mix of contraceptives shifted from mainly permanent methods like tubal ligation and IUDs toward other reversible methods.52\n[86] I acknowledge that previously, the insertion of an IUD was the preferred contraceptive method in many provinces. There is, however, no evidence before me that the IUD was ever the only method used, and no evidence in particular, that it was the only method used in Fujian province. I note that both Article 19 in the National Population and Family Planning Commission and Article 16 in Fujian's regulations clearly allow flexibility in the choice of contraceptive methods and make no specific IUD requirement.\n[87] In sum, I find that since the two children born in Canada would not be counted in the number of children the claimant would be allowed to have, the claimant would be allowed to have two more children in China without negative consequences. If she is allowed to have two more children, then it follows that she would not be sterilized or forced to wear an IUD if she returns to China for that reason alone.\n[88] In this case, I have considered the Chairperson's Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.53 However, I find that the Guideline does not constrain my findings regarding family planning in Fujian province.\n[89] Therefore, I find that, on a balance of probabilities, and in the context of the analysis above and the lack of any evidence in country document evidence or disclosed by the claimant to support the claimant's allegation that Fujian family planning officials would force her to wear an IUD, that alternative contraceptive methods would be available to the claimant; if she were to return to Fujian province, then there is only a mere possibility that she would be forced to wear an IUD.\nCONCLUSION\n[90] I find that the claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, and that, on a balance of probabilities, she would not personally be subjected to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture upon return to China.\n[91] I, therefore, find that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. The Refugee Protection Division rejects her claim.\n(signed)\n\"R. Andrachuk\"\nR.

In March 2002, they had contracted a XXXX XXXX from the village, which after three years, began to glean profits. In fact, by 2008, they were able to lead decent lives and build a new house. However, on September 19, 2011, they received a notice from the town government and were told to vacate the land before December 19, 2011, followed by a notice of compensation, which they believed to be far below the market value.\n[4] The P.C. and other villagers approached the town government with their concerns, however, they were told that the government intended to build a factory. They were informed that they should write letters to the District Government if they wished to pursue the matter further. The P.C. and seven other property owners took their letter to the district government in early October 2011, and were told that they would later be provided additional compensation.\n[5] On December 12, 2011, the P.C. and his wife, and about one hundred individuals in total, went to the District Government to see the mayor. However, all of a sudden, the Public Security Bureau (PSB) vans showed up and began to beat people. The P.C. and his wife were able to escape, following which they hid in a relative's home.\n[6] That same afternoon, the PSB allegedly went to the P.C.'s home to arrest him and his wife, and they were accused of protesting against the government and playing a leading role in the protest. Sixteen villagers were arrested, and a summons was left with the P.C.'s father for the P.C. and his wife.\n[7] Later, the P.C. learned that ten villagers were released, and six were still detained because they were considered to be representatives. The six people, according to the P.C., were sentenced to three years imprisonment. According to the P.C., the PSB continued to come to their home, as well as the homes of relatives. Later, they learned that their children had been suspended from school due to their problems.\n[8] With the help of a snakehead, arrangements were made for the claimants to leave the country. The claimants allege that the PSB remain in pursuit. The farm was leveled without any compensation.\nAddendum to PIF\n[9] The claimants submitted an addendum in which they indicate that the P.C's wife and two children have adopted the Christian faith in Canada.3 They allegedly began practicing in May of 2018, and were baptized on August 18, 2018.4\nDETERMINATION\n[10] The panel finds that the claimants are neither Convention refugees, nor persons in need of protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the IRPA.\nISSUES\n[11] The determinative issues are credibility, persecution vs. prosecution, identification as a Christian, and the well-foundedness of the claims with respect to the issue of Christianity.\nIdentity\n[12] Based on the claimants' Resident Identity Cards and passports, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that their identities have been established.5\nCredibility\n[13] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are indeed true unless there is valid reason to doubt their veracity.6 The panel is aware that the real test of the truth of a story of a witness is that it be in \"harmony with the preponderance of probabilities which a practical and informed person would readily recognize as reasonable in that place and in those conditions.\"7 Furthermore, the panel cannot be satisfied that, \"the evidence is credible or trustworthy unless satisfied that it is probably so, not just possibly so.\"8 The determination, as to whether a claimant's evidence is credible, is made on a balance of probabilities.\n[14] In assessing credibility, the panel is cognizant of the many difficulties faced by the refugee claimant in establishing a claim, including cultural factors, the milieu of the hearing room, and the stress inherent in responding to oral questions through an interpreter. The panel has also considered the passage of time, namely seven years, and in this regard, it is not expected that details, such as precise dates or times ought to impugn the claimants' credibility.\nUnited States of America (US) visa\n[15] The claimants travelled on falsified US visas, and then entered Canada illegally. When questioned by the panel, the P.C. testified that the information provided on the visa application was correct. However, the panel was then more specific in its line of questioning with respect to answers provided in the application, i.e. the employment, income, assets. When confronted with the information contained in the record, namely that the visa was improperly obtained, the P.C. responded that the smuggler had not told him about this information. Likewise, the P.C. was unaware if he had entered Canada illegally. The P.C. was also asked why he did not make a refugee claim in the US. His initial response was that he did not know anything about this; what he meant was that he had told the smuggler they wanted to come to Canada because they had a friend here. However, later the P.C. acknowledged that the smuggler had, in fact, told him that it would be more difficult to file a refugee claim in the US.\n[16] In this regard, the panel is guided by the Federal Court in Wang, particularly when Justice Zinn stated that:\n...a refugee claimant may need to lie in order to obtain a visa to get to Canada and make a refugee claim, but when he does so, he ought to immediately correct the record and most certainly not later than when the refugee claim is made.9\n[17] The panel finds that it was not until it prodded the P.C., that he testified that the smuggler did everything, and he had no knowledge of the contents of his US visa application, his reason for not claiming in the US, and his lack of knowledge of entering Canada illegally. The panel finds that it is implausible that, with a high school education, he would have no knowledge of anything. Moreover, he contradicted himself when stating the reason for coming to Canada, and not claiming in the US, thereby impugning his credibility.\nPSB visits\n[18] The P.C. testified that the PSB went to his home on December 12, 2011, when he first went into hiding after the alleged protest at the District office. Initially, he stated that he was in hiding for four days, but when asked to clarify since he did not leave China until XXXX 2012, he acknowledged that he had made a mistake and he was in hiding until he left China. The P.C. went on to say that on the first visit by the PSB, they left a summons, and that they had returned on two occasions prior to the claimants' departure from China. This is in contrast to what the P.C. attested to at the original hearing, at which time he stated it was two times.10 He insisted, however, that it was three times.\n[19] The P.C. then stated that the PSB had returned three times until the end of 2013, followed by a number of times; he could not recall the exact number. He stated that his father had entered a seniors' home in 2016, and in 2018 he was very ill, but the PSB had gone to see him in April 2019, information which is not contained in any of the addendums to the original PIF. The panel rejects the explanation provided by the P.C. that this information was not submitted to the Board because 'it just happened.' This, in the panel's opinion, is a significant event and one which allegedly occurred recently.\n[20] More importantly, much later in the questioning, as a result of counsel's line of questioning, the P.C. testified that the PSB had gone to the homes of his sister-in-law and uncle. However, previously he had stated that they had gone to his father's home.\n[21] The panel concludes that the contradictory foregoing evidence calls into question the veracity of any of this evidence relating to the PSB visits, which in turn, leads the panel to conclude that the PSB were not, in fact, pursuing the P.C., although this finding in not based solely on this as will be analyzed below.\nLack of a coercive summons\n[22] The panel notes that the summons tendered by the claimants is a non-coercive investigative summons,11 issued under the authority of the Article 82 of the Public Security Administration Punishments Law of the People's Republic of China (PSAPL), which requires the claimant to appear for interrogation.12 The panel notes that the objective evidence confirms that a coercive summons can be issued in cases of non-compliance.13 However, the panel notes that the P.C. has not tendered a coercive summons. The panel finds that, given that the objective evidence makes it clear that Chinese authorities' view of political opponents, and in light of the objective evidence regarding the vigorous efforts the authorities undertake to pursue these individuals, it is reasonable to expect that a coercive summons would have been issued when the claimant failed to report for the interview. The panel finds that the absence of a compulsory summons, when it is reasonable to expect that the claimants would have been issued such a summons, undermines the genuineness of the summons the P.C. did tender.\n[23] Furthermore, the panel notes that the documentary evidence states that a summons can be oral or written. More specifically, a written summons:\n...can be issued only after a case has been filed for investigation and when suspects or defendants are not subject to certain conditions, such as preparing to commit or committing a crime, being found in possession of criminal evidence, or of tampering with evidence, refusing to identify oneself, or being suspected of committing crimes in different places.14\n[24] Regardless of the form they take, public security summonses cannot last more than twelve hours, or twenty-four hours if the person is suspected of administrative violations punishable by detention.15 However, the P.C. has alleged that the PSB attended his home in an effort to arrest him. The panel finds that the alleged actions of the PSB is inconsistent with the use a public security summons.\n[25] The panel finds that this is particularly noteworthy given the alleged number of visits by the PSB to the claimants' home, and additional occasions to his relatives' homes. Additionally, if as alleged, sixteen fellow villagers were detained, six of whom were sentenced to three years' imprisonment, this, in the panel's opinion, is all the more reason that a coercive summons ought to have been issued, if the allegations are in fact true.\n[26] The panel notes that the documentary evidence states that coercive summons and arrest warrants are instruments that can be used by the PSB.16 The panel finds that it is reasonable to expect that, given the allegations of the PSB's efforts to arrest the P.C., the PSB would employ the use of these coercive instruments to carry out their intention to arrest the claimants, rather than employ the use of an investigative instrument.\n[27] The panel finds that the claimants' allegations and the P.C.'s testimony are inconsistent with the objective evidence in the record with regard to the provisions of the PSB. The panel finds, on the basis of the foregoing analysis and the totality of adverse credibility findings, little weight can be given to this summons in establishing that the claimants are being pursued by the PSB.\nClaimants' ability to leave China while being pursued by the PSB\n[28] The panel finds it not credible that the claimants could go through China's strict exit controls if they were truly wanted for arrest by the PSB. The panel is aware that the claimants alleged to have hired a smuggler to assist them with their international travel. In consideration of the totality of the evidence, however, the panel finds the claimants not credible in that they are wanted by the PSB for arrest as alleged. In this context, and in consideration of the totality of the documentary evidence in this case, the panel is not persuaded by the claimants' argument that the smuggler made all the arrangements, including their evasion of security checks upon existing China.\n[29] The claimants travelled from mainland China to Hong Kong, and then from Hong Kong to San Francisco. The national documentation sources report that the Chinese authorities consider travel from mainland China to Hong Kong as international travel, and that they apply the same level of security and immigration screening for exits from mainland China for travel to Hong Kong as they do for all international travel departing mainland China.17 The panel notes that the claimants exited China using their own genuine passports. The panel notes the country documentation, which indicates that the Chinese government had established a national computer network which included information concerning people wanted by the PSB in 2012.18\n[30] It is clear that that system called the Golden Shield Project may not have been fully operational at that time, in particular in regard to rural areas and small villages. However, the claimants departed China from an international airport, and the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants' names would have been entered into the system and they would not have been allowed to leave, given the alleged pursuit by the PSB, particularly when sixteen villagers had been detained, at least six of whom had been sentenced, although the exact date of detention of the six is unknown.\nArrest of co-practitioners\n[31] The P.C. testified that six villagers were detained for three years. In the panel's opinion, this further suggests that if the PSB had arrested and detained these people, and to have simply visited the claimant's home with no further action on the PSB is simply not plausible.\n[32] Moreover, the panel notes contradictory evidence with respect to the detention of these villagers. Initially, the P.C. testified that he learned of their arrest after his arrival in Canada, but later he stated that they were detained prior to his departure. When asked to explain the contradiction, he stated that he thought the panel was referring to their sentencing which he had gleaned from his sister-in-law. The panel rejects this explanation, as the P.C. was cautioned on a number of occasions that if he did not understand the question, he should ask the panel to rephrase or repeat. Although, this P.C. is not university educated, he has completed high school, had a successful business in China, and this is not his first time before the Board.\n[33] The P.C. provided one jail visiting card, which was not an original, and therefore, cannot be assigned much weight. He also provided a letter from his sister-in-law attesting to the three-year sentences.\n[34] The panel concludes, on a balance of probabilities, that if individuals were, in fact, detained, they were those who clashed with the PSB in the altercation, and not those who escaped, like the claimants.\nFamily members\n[35] The P.C. was asked if anything untoward had happened to his family, given the pursuit by the PSB on his behalf. He responded in the negative.\n[36] The panel draws an adverse credibility finding based on the ability of the claimants' family in China to carry on with their lives without facing serious consequences at the hands of the PSB, given their alleged interest in pursuing them, their failure to surrender, and the passage of time.\nNotices of Dismissal From school on behalf of son and daughter\n[37] In response to counsel, the P.C. testified that his children received the notices of dismissal at home.19 However, he was unaware of when this had occurred. Later, however, he contradicted his previous testimony when he stated that he did not know if the children were at home when the PSB were coming to the house, yet, according to later testimony, the children stated that they were in fact at home. The P.C. was asked if the children had attempted to register at alternative schools, to which he responded in the negative. The panel finds that this portion of the P.C.'s testimony is called into question, and casts doubts on the veracity of the documents submitted in support of the alleged school dismissals on behalf of the P.C.'s son and daughter.\n[38] More importantly, however, the panel notes that the face of these documents indicate that ink is written over the seal, and not under. (emphasis added) Furthermore, the alleged notice from XXXX XXXX XXXX school is not identified by address. Later when questioning the P.C.'s son, he stated that the PSB had threatened to arrest him, something which is not contained in the BOC. Furthermore, he stated that he had returned home on November 20, 2011, when the notice of suspension was dated December 20, 2011. The panel rejects this claimant's explanation that he misspoke.\n[39] In totality, the foregoing is fraught with inconsistencies, such that the panel cannot assign any weight to the foregoing testimony.\nConclusion\n[40] The panel concludes that the P.C.'s testimony was replete with contradictions or inconsistencies, which were not satisfactorily explained to the panel. For the following reasons, the panel concludes that the claimants were and are not wanted by the PSB for protesting against the government or for any other reason.\n* The panel concludes that the PSB did not visit the P.C.'s home;\n* The panel concludes that the summons is not genuine, or in the alternative, cannot be given any weight, because if the PSB were continuously in pursuit of the P.C., a coercive summons would have been issued;\n* The family did not suffer any consequences as a result of the alleged actions of the P.C.;\n* The issue of school dismissal must be discounted in light of the analysis of the face of the documents, along with conflicting testimony;\n* The ability of the claimants to exit China if allegedly wanted by the PSB, given that 16 individuals were allegedly detained, and the alleged continuous visits by the PSB; and\n* Although the P.C.'s sister-in-law has sent a letter indicating the sentencing of fellow villagers, in light of all of the other credibility concerns, and the self-serving nature of this letter, it cannot be assigned much, if any, weight.\nPersecution vs. prosecution\n[41] In the alternative, if the panel were to find that the P.C.'s allegation of PSB pursuit is credible, the panel finds that the P.C. would face prosecution based on the fact that he has broken a law of generalized application by his actions against government officials in carrying out their duty, and he is not facing persecution. What concerned the P.C. was the lack of what he considered to be reasonable compensation. Counsel submits that by virtue of the treatment by the PSB, this would translate into at least perceived political opinion. The panel disagrees, and finds that the basis for his complaint about government actions was not political opposition to the government's expropriation policy, but the amount of money he would receive.\n[42] The panel finds that, even if the P.C. is being pursued for his participation in these confrontations, as noted above, he has broken a law of generalized application, one that applies to the whole population without differentiation. The RPD notes that the Federal Court of Appeal, in Zolfagharkhani, states that:\n...some general propositions relating to the status of an ordinary law of general application in determining the question of persecution:\n... The statutory definition of Convention refugee makes the intent (or any principal effect) of an ordinary law of general application, rather than the motivation of the claimant, relevant to the existence of persecution.\n... an ordinary law of general application, even in non-democratic societies, should... be given a presumption of validity and neutrality, and the onus should be on the claimant, as is generally the case in refugee cases, to show that the law was inherently or for some other reason persecutory.20\n[43] Notwithstanding the foregoing, the panel does acknowledge that lawful sanctions cannot be imposed in disregard for accepted international standards.\n[44] The panel has considered section 33(f) of the IRPA, which directs that the IRPA be construed and applied in a manner that complies with international human rights instruments to which Canada is a signatory.21 The test that is used is whether the punishment that the claimant may reasonably face in China would shock the conscience of Canadians.\n[45] The panel also notes that the evidence of human rights abuses, in general, in a country is not in itself sufficient to show that the claimant is personally at risk of harm. Chinese laws may be harsher than Canadian laws or the prisons may not be the same standard as Canadian prisons. However, this is not sufficient ground to grant a claim under section 97(1) of the IRPA.\n[46] In this case, counsel did point to Chinese law and argued that the claimants' punishment would likely be three years' incarceration.\n[47] The panel believes that while the maximum term of imprisonment of three years may be greater than what a similar situated offender in Canada would have obtained, it would still not offend international standards.\n[48] Assuming that the claimants would be incarcerated on conviction, the panel has considered what prison conditions they would face. The panel has reviewed the documentary evidence on Chinese prison conditions. The panel notes that the conditions in many penal institutions are harsh and degrading, however it does find that the conditions are generally such that the prisoners' basic needs and rights are accommodated.\n[49] The panel notes that in this case the P.C.'s charge is not political and will, therefore, not be treated accordingly. Therefore, on the panel's examination of the gravity of the offence, the legal processes in China, and the proposed method of punishment, the panel does not find that subsection 97(1) applies to the claimant.\n[50] Counsel submits that according to the NDP, \"individuals who have protested land expropriation have been arrested and placed in Re-education Through Labour (RTL) Centres..., a form of 'imprisonment lasting up to 3 years that does not require any legal proceedings.'\"22\n[51] The panel notes in Ni, Justice Elizabeth Walker found reasonable the RPD's decision that being involved in a protest to demand fair compensation did not amount to persecution on a Convention ground.23 Further, shouting anti-government slogans does not necessarily mean that there is a nexus to a Convention ground.24\n[52] Even if the panel had accepted that the claimants were wanted, they have not established that they would be persecuted; they have only established that they would be prosecuted for contravening a law of general application. Mr. XXXX testified that he did not want to return to China because he would be arrested and put in jail, not that he would personally be subjected to a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture.\n[53] While it is true that the claimants specifically pointed to objective country evidence documenting certain cases of abuse of individuals who protest against land expropriation, the panel found there was insufficient evidence that the claimants themselves would be subjected to treatment amounting to persecution. The panel finds this conclusion to be reasonable. In other words, there is no evidence that persons who have opposed land expropriation are systematically subjected to treatment amounting to persecution, such that it renders unreasonable the panel's conclusion that the claimants will not be subjected to persecution. I also note that the government has already expropriated the claimants' land and would have only a limited, if any, interest in the P.C. other than to prosecute him for having participated in an illegal gathering.\n[54] The panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, and based on the totality of evidence tendered, the P.C. at most, would be prosecuted for obstructing government officials and not for holding a particular political opinion. In the context of the analysis above concerning the claimant's likely jeopardy if he was convicted for this crime, the panel further finds that section 97(1) does not apply to the claimant with respect to this issue.\nPractice of Christianity\n[55] The panel has considered the baptism certificate and letter provided by XXXX XXXX XXXX and accepts that this event occurred.25 However, proof of a baptism alone is not sufficient to establish that an individual is a genuine Christian practitioner, when that individual has demonstrated a serious lack of credibility with respect to his subjective fear and his knowledge of Christianity. Documents are insufficient to overcome the above credibility concerns. The panel, therefore, attributes minimal weight to the letter and certificate.\n[56] The panel also notes the photographs of the claimants in a church setting.26 However, given the fact that they are undated, and the venue is not identified, the panel cannot assign much weight to them.\n[57] The panel asked when the claimants' children began to attend church. The P.C.'s wife stated July, when the letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX states that they were active members since May. In response, the P.C.'s wife stated that she joined the church in May or June, but the children joined in July. When confronted with the discrepancy, she was unable to proffer a reasonable explanation. The panel finds that this portion of her testimony undermines her credibility.\n[58] Moreover, the P.C.'s wife was asked how she was baptized so soon after beginning her attendance at the church. She responded that it was because her father-in-law was very ill and her praying had helped him.\n[59] The threshold for assessing one's religion, is not based on knowledge, but rather beliefs. Counsel conducted a vigorous line of questioning of all claimants, but in particular, the P.C.'s wife. She testified that friends had told her, when her father-in-law was ill, that she should attend church, and she believed that this contributed to improvement in his health, although unfortunately, he has since passed away. She hesitated on almost all of the questions, and in some cases, simply said that she could not remember, as her memory is not as good now that she is 52 years old. When asked if Jesus was baptized, she responded that she did not know. She did not respond to the question of what, in particular, she had read in the Bible that she enjoys. She was asked about the sermon that the Minister had preached as recently as last week. Initially, she took out a piece of paper until the panel cautioned her, and then she said she could not remember.\n[60] Having said this, the children responded in a more forthright manner. Nevertheless, they spoke of spreading the gospel, for example, in the case of the daughter to 30 individuals, and to 12 or 13 people in the case of the son. In fact, the son was very precise in providing this information. The daughter testified that having attended church, she is kinder, less irritable, life is smoother; and her brother views things in a more positive manner.\n[61] The P.C. was also questioned, as he had attended church since the first sitting. However, to his credit, he expressed his point of view that he does not attend on a regular basis, and he has not decided as to whether or not he wishes to make this commitment. He described it as being a 50\/50 chance that he will join his family in practicing Christianity.\n[62] The panel recognizes that the threshold for assessing one's religion is low. However, in the particular circumstances of this case, although the panel accepts that the P.C.'s wife and children attend church and were baptized, it finds that there was insufficient credible evidence of any substantive nature to persuade the panel that they are genuine Christians.\n[63] Even if the panel accepts that the P.C.'s wife and children are genuine Christian practitioners, which it does not, the following documentation leads the panel to conclude that the claimants' fears are not well-founded.\n[64] The panel notes the National Documentation Package (NDP) states that:\n...[b]oth Guangdong and Fujian were much more \"liberal\" in the 2000s and even some of the churches not registered with the state operated quite openly. However, the panel notes that in the last 2 years or so, unregistered churches have been closed down by the authorities in places such as Xiamen [Fujian Province] (Christians probably continue to meet together but will be less open than before)...27 [footnotes omitted]\n[65] Country documentation evidence states that:\nAccording to the Bertelsmann Stiftung Transformation Index (BTI), which analyzes the quality of democracy and political management in 128 countries... there are an estimated 80 million Christians in China, \"many of whom congregate in illegal house churches\"... The Wall Street Journal reports that house church members could number between 30 and 60 million... Voice of America (VOA) notes that the exact number of Christians is difficult to estimate because many worship at underground house churches...28 [footnotes omitted]\n[66] A United Kingdom (UK) Home Office report states that, \"in general, the risk of persecution for Christians expressing and living their faith in China is very low, indeed statistically virtually negligible.\"29 The Chinese constitution specifically protects religious freedom, and the Regulations on Religious Affairs 2005 \"set out the conditions under which Christian churches and leaders may operate within China.\"30 The document further notes that:\n... there has been a rapid growth in numbers of Christians in China, both in the three state-registered churches and the unregistered or 'house' churches. Individuals move freely between state-registered churches and the unregistered churches, according to their preferences as to worship.31\n[67] In general, the evidence is that the many millions of Christians worshipping within unregistered churches are able to meet and express their faith as they wish to do.\n[68] The panel finds that the evidence does not support a finding that there is a consistent pattern of persecution, serious harm, or other breach of fundamental human rights for unregistered churches or their worshippers. The evidence is that:\nin general, any adverse treatment of Christian communities by the Chinese authorities is confined to closing down church buildings where planning permission has not been obtained for use as a church, and\/or preventing or interrupting unauthorised public worship or demonstrations...\nThere may be a risk of persecution, serious harm, or ill-treatment engaging international protection for certain individual Christians who choose to worship in unregistered churches, and who conduct themselves in such a way as to attract the local authorities' attention to them or their political, social or cultural views...32 [footnotes omitted]\n[69] It is noted in the documentation that:\n...religious groups belonging to one of the five state-sanctioned \"patriotic religious associations\" (Buddhist, Taoist, Muslim, Catholic and Protestant) are permitted to register with the government and officially permitted to hold worship services.33\n[70] Although there is information that authorities in Guangdong Province targeted unofficial house churches not regulated by the state, this does not appear to be the situation for state-sanctioned churches.\n[71] The panel has further considered that the claimants chose to attend a Protestant church in Canada, and that there are between 50 and 90 million Protestants in China who practice their religion in both registered and unregistered churches.34 There are over 50,000 registered protestant churches in China. Being registered means that there are no restrictions on the size of congregations, and numbers of 1,000 to 2,000 are not uncommon. It also means that registered churches can take active roles in society, and churches do indeed carry out philanthropic projects.\n[72] Unregistered groups are not equated with groups that have been declared evil cults.35 Individuals belonging to cults are ruthlessly pursued. In parts of the country, unregistered groups have grown rapidly, and the authorities do not pressure them to register. There are tens of thousands of unregistered churches in China, most of which carry out their business with little, if any, trouble from the local authorities. In some parts of the country, authorities tacitly approve the activities of unregistered church groups and do not interfere with them. The panel finds that the preponderance of evidence indicates that Christians can practise their faith in a lawful church, and that authorities generally do not concern themselves with house church gatherings.\n[73] The documentary evidence indicates there is uneven monitoring of unregistered churches, with some churches meeting openly and regularly with large memberships. The panel finds that the documentary evidence confirms that the government is generally tolerant of groups that meet in homes or in small groups, and is suspicious of religious organisations with foreign ties, memberships that grow quickly, or whose leadership becomes too popular. Documentary evidence states that:\n'All religious organizations are required to register with SARA [the State Administration for Religious Affairs] or its provincial and local offices. Registered religious organizations are allowed to possess property, publish approved materials, train staff, and collect donations. According to regulations, religious organizations must submit information about the organization's historical background, doctrines, key publications, minimum funding requirements, and a government sponsor. Due to the difficulty of fulfilling these requirements, many religious organizations either remain unregistered or register as commercial enterprises.\n...\n'SARA has stated through a policy posted on its website that family and friends have the right to meet at home for worship, including prayer and Bible study, without registering with the government.36\n[74] The panel notes that members of unregistered Protestant groups that the government identifies as 'evil cults' appear to be the most vulnerable to detention, arrest and harassment.37 A World Watch Monitor report of September 22, 2015, speaks about the demolition of crosses in Zhejiang province, but it notes that there is no evidence that points to an increase in discrimination of Christians on a national level.\n[75] The panel has considered the documents submitted by counsel, as well as his submissions, and the panel concurs that that there have been instances of persecution relating to the practice of Christianity.38 However, in many of these cases, the profile of the worshipper within the church has been a factor, and the numbers do not reflect a systemic attack on an ordinary worshipper. The panel finds that the preponderance of reliable evidence does not support the claimants' alleged fears.\n[76] The panel finds that the claimants, as regular Protestants, could, on a balance of probabilities, worship Christianity upon return to China, as there are many congregations they could attend without attracting the interest of authorities.\nCONCLUSION\n[77] Firstly, with respect to the allegations based on land expropriation, the panel finds that the claimants are not wanted by the PSB for this reason, or for any other reason.\n[78] Secondly, with regard to the issue of Christianity, which is a sur place allegation, the panel finds that the P.C. is not a Christian, and his wife and children are not genuine worshipper. In the alternative, should they continue with their beliefs and faith upon return to China, on a balance of probabilities, their fears are not well-founded based on the preponderance of the documentary evidence.\n[79] Accordingly, the panel finds that the claimants are not Convention refugees, nor persons in need of protection. Therefore, all claims are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Roslyn Ahara\"\nROSLYN AHARA\nAugust 21, 2019\nDate\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, as amended [IRPA], sections 96 and 97(1).\n2 Exhibit 2, Personal Information Form (PIF) - TB2-04124.\n3 Exhibit 8, PIF Addendum.\n4 Exhibit 9, Personal Disclosure received April 15, 2019.\n5 Exhibit 1, Federal Court Record, at pp. 122-131, 146-154, 169-174, 190-197, 701-708.\n6 Maldonado, Pedro Enrique Juarez v.

They were given notice to evacuate their homes on or before June 27, 2012, and they were offered a compensation of 100,000 renminbi (RMB).\n[4] On or about March 1, 2012, the claimant went to a real estate company to obtain an evaluation of his property, and a day later, he was provided with a calculation of 250,000 RMB. On March 20, 2012, all the house owners obtained estimate reports and they agreed to negotiate with the government officers. On April 10, 2012, eight individuals including the claimant met with the head of their town, but were told to discuss the matter with the individuals who had made the decision. On April 20, 2012, they returned to the office of the head of their town government and were told that there was no change in the decision. The claimant and his neighbors then decided to discuss the matter with the upper government in May, 2012. However, on June 20, 2012, they were told that the compensation offered would not be changed.\n[5] On June 27, 2012, the claimant and his neighbors decided to prevent the government from entering their village, confronting the town head and officers who arrived with trucks and bulldozers. This resulted in a two hour confrontation. The following day, the village and town head came with village security guards and armed police, and a standoff ensued for about two hours. The villagers shouted out slogans, for example, \"down with corruption\", whereupon the police started to use their clubs to beat them. During the chaos, the claimant was arrested with five other representatives. The claimant alleges that they were detained, interrogated, beaten and sometimes tortured. However, on June 30, 2012 they escaped through the window and the claimant went into hiding at his cousin's house.\n[6] On July 1, 2012, the claimant's wife informed his cousin that the Public Security Bureau (PSB) had been to his wife's parents' house to look for the claimant, and they had left a summons, accusing the claimant of taking the lead in the anti-government action, slandering the government officers and escaping from detention. With the help of a smuggler, the claimant left China on XXXX XXXX, 2012. After his arrival in Canada, the claimant called his cousin and learned that the PSB continues to go to his wife's parents' house and his parents' house, and they have posted a wanted circular for his arrest in bus and train stations.\nDETERMINATION\n[7] The panel determines that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee, nor a person in need of protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\nIDENTITY\n[8] Based on certified true copies of the claimant's Chinese passport3 and his Resident Identity Card (RIC),4 the panel accepts that the claimant is a citizen of China.\nISSUES\n[9] The determinative issue in this claim are credibility, and persecution versus prosecution.\nCredibility\n[10] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are indeed true unless there is valid reason to doubt their veracity.5 The panel is aware that the real test of the truth of a story of a witness is that it be in \"harmony with the preponderance of probabilities which a practical and informed person would readily recognize as reasonable in that place and in those conditions.\"6 Furthermore, the panel cannot be satisfied that, \"the evidence is credible or trustworthy, unless satisfied that it is probably so, not just possibly so.\"7 The determination, as to whether a claimant's evidence is credible, is made on a balance of probabilities.\n[11] In assessing credibility, the panel is cognizant of the many difficulties faced by the refugee claimant in establishing a claim, including cultural factors, the milieu of the hearing room, and the stress inherent in responding to oral questions through an interpreter. We have also considered the claimant's level of education, namely completion of middle school, but more importantly the passage of time, namely seven years since he left China. In this regard, the panel did not expect precise details of what occurred sometime in the past.\nFailure to claim in the United States (US)\n[12] The claimant spent 23 days in the US, having travelled on a properly-obtained US visa, with the assistance of a smuggler. According to the claimant, it was always his intention to come to Canada, and he did not realize that he would be spending 23 days in the US. The panel further notes that the claimant was risking being turned back when he entered Canada illegally.\n[13] Although this is not determinative, the panel finds that the claimant's behaviour in not seeking refugee protection as soon as it is practicable, is inconsistent with his subjective fears, and undermines his credibility.\nClaimant's detention\n[14] The claimant testified that he fears returning to China because he ran away from his detention on June 30, 2012. He further testified that he and five other individuals had been arrested. According to the claimant, he was able to escape through a window, which he broke. When asked if bars covered the window, the claimant responded that previously there was a wooden bar, which he broke with stones that were on the floor. The claimant indicated that he was the only one who escaped, however given that his PIF indicates \"we escaped,\"8 the claimant was confronted with this discrepancy. His explanation that he and the others had discussed the escape, but he was unaware if the others were successful, is rejected by this panel. He further testified that to this day, he has no knowledge of what happened to the other villagers who were detained.\n[15] In response to counsel, the claimant testified that he had been detained in an administrative office, as opposed to a detention centre or a jail. He mentioned an iron bar on the window, from which he escaped. When confronted with the contradiction of his previous testimony, namely that there was a wooden bar, the claimant explained that he was confused, and that there was no iron bar.\n[16] Given the contradictions, and the lack of corroborative evidence, the panel finds that the claimant has not established that he was, in fact, detained as a result of the alleged confrontation with the local officials.\nPSB visits\n[17] The claimant testified that his wife told his cousin that the PSB had left a summons on or about July 1, 2012. The claimant was asked if the PSB had returned, to which he responded on February 5, 2019, they had, in fact, returned during the Spring Festival. The panel asked the claimant if this was in fact the case; namely that there had been a gap of seven years in the pursuit by the PSB. The claimant then stated that he thought the panel asked the last time the PSB had visited, and went on to state that the PSB had been pursuing him on approximately 100 occasions since the initial visit and to date. The panel finds this portion of the claimant's testimony to be an attempt on his part to embellish the merits of his claim. This is particularly noteworthy, in the panel's opinion, when one examines this in conjunction with the finding with respect to the non-coercive summons allegedly issued (analysis follows).\nLack of corroborative evidence\n[18] At the hearing, the panel pointed out to the claimant that although there was a notice of expropriation, there was no corroborative evidence of his home, the demolition, or the replacement shopping mall allegedly built in its place. There was no evidence with respect to the arrests and detention of the claimant and his fellow villagers. Furthermore, there were no photographs of the wanted posters that were allegedly placed in public places.\n[19] The panel recognizes that corroborating evidence is not always required to establish a credible claim to persecution. However, when credibility is an issue, as it is in this claim, credible corroborating evidence regarding the totality of the claim would have been helpful. The following Federal Court case in Bhagat, states the following:\nCorroborating evidence is not always necessary to establish the applicant's subjective fear. The Board, however, determined that in the particular circumstances of this case, corroborating evidence of persecution was expected. An absence of corroborating evidence, then, permitted it to make a negative inference against credibility of the applicant. The respondent relies on Sheik...for its argument that the Board did not err in law when making that conclusion:\nThe concept of \"credible evidence\" is not, of course, the same as that of the credibility of the applicant, but it is obvious that where the only evidence before a tribunal linking the applicant to his claim is that of the applicant himself (in addition, perhaps, to \"country reports\" from which nothing about the applicant's claim can be directly deduced), a tribunal's perception that he is not a credible witness effectively amounts to a finding that there is no credible evidence on which the second-level tribunal could allow his claim.9 [footnotes omitted]\nSummons\n[20] The panel notes that the summons tendered by the claimant is a non-coercive investigative summons issued under the authority of the Article 82 of the Public Security Administrative Punishment Law of the People's Republic of China (PSAPL), which requires the claimant to appear for interrogation.10 The panel notes that the objective evidence confirms that a coercive summons can be issued in cases of non-compliance.11 However, the panel notes that the claimant has not tendered a coercive summons. The panel finds that the absence of a compulsory summons, when it reasonable to expect that the claimant would have been issued one, undermines the genuineness of the summons she did tender.\n[21] The panel finds this significant given the alleged pursuit by the PSB, namely 100 times, and the claimant's alleged detention. It is reasonable to expect that this continued pursuit would result in an arrest warrant.\n[22] Furthermore, the panel notes that the documentary evidence states that summons can be oral or written, and that regarding written summons more specifically:\n[they] can be issued only after a case has been filed for investigation and when suspects or defendants are not subject to certain conditions, such as preparing to commit or committing a crime, being found in possession of criminal evidence, or of tampering with evidence, refusing to identify oneself, or being suspected of committing crimes in different places.12\n[23] The documentary evidence goes on to state that, \"regardless of the form they take, public security summonses cannot last more than twelve hours, or twenty-four hours if the person is suspected of administrative violations punishable by [detention].\"13 However, the claimant has alleged that the PSB attended his family's home on multiple occasions in an effort to arrest him. The panel finds that the alleged numerous alleged visits of the PSB is inconsistent with the use a public security summons. Documentary evidence states that coercive summons and arrest warrants are instruments that can be used by the PSB.14 As such, the panel finds that it is reasonable to expect that, given the allegations of the PSB's efforts to arrest the claimant, the PSB would employ the use of these coercive instruments to carry out their intention to arrest the claimant, rather than employ the use of an investigative instrument.\n[24] The panel finds that the claimant's allegations and testimony are inconsistent with the objective evidence on the record with regard to the provisions of the PSB. On the basis of the foregoing analysis and the totality of adverse credibility findings, the panel finds that little weight can be given to this summons in establishing that the claimant is being pursued by the PSB.\nFamily members\n[25] The claimant was asked if the PSB ever threatened his wife. He responded in the affirmative, but then explained that she and his child believed that they were being followed. However, he acknowledged that they had not suffered any harm as a result of his alleged behaviour.\nLeaving the People's Republic of China on claimant's genuine passport\n[26] The claimant was asked about how he was able to pass through two international airports given the problems he had with the PSB. This is particularly noteworthy given the fact that other villagers had allegedly been arrested, and a summons had already been issued prior to his departure.\n[27] The panel notes that the claimant exited China using his own genuine passport. Furthermore, country documentation refers to a national Golden Shield surveillance network at exit points, dating back to 2010.15\n[28] It is clear that the Golden Shield Project may not have been fully operational at that time in particular, in regard to rural areas and small villages. However, the claimant departed China from Guangzhou and Hong Kong, both international airports. As such, the panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant's name would have been entered into the system as he had allegedly been on the PSB's radar while he was in hiding. The claimant was asked by his counsel to speculate on what the smuggler did to facilitate his journey from China to Canada. His response was that he did not know, he just listened to what he said.\n[29] The panel concludes that the claimant is not wanted by the PSB, given the credibility concerns cited above, namely, the testimony surrounding the visits by the PSB, the lack of a coercive summons, the lack of reprisals against the claimant's family, the evidence surrounding the claimant's alleged detention deemed not to be credible, and the claimant's ability to exit China. On a cumulative basis, these factors lead the panel to conclude that the claimant was not wanted by the PSB for his opposition to the government and for escaping detention.\nPersecution v. prosecution\nPursuit by the PSB for persons who participated in anti-government demonstrations\n[30] Even if the panel were to believe that the PSB is looking for this claimant due to his participation in anti-government demonstration, the panel finds there is insufficient reliable, satisfactory, and probative evidence to find that this claimant would be subject to persecution by the PSB or any other state authority in China for his alleged participation in anti-government demonstration.\n[31] The documentary evidence reports:\n'The constitution states citizens \"enjoy freedom of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of procession and of demonstration,\" although authorities generally limited and did not respect these rights, especially when they conflicted with CCP interests.\n'While the constitution provides for freedom of peaceful assembly, the government severely restricted this right. The law stipulates that such activities may not challenge \"party leadership\" or infringe upon the \"interests of the state.\" Protests against the political system or national leaders were prohibited. Authorities denied permits and quickly suppressed demonstrations involving expression of dissenting political views...'16 [footnotes omitted]\n[32] In the alternative, if the panel were to find that the claimant's allegation of the PSB pursuit is credible, then the panel find that the claimant would face prosecution, rather than persecution, based on the fact that he has broken a law of generalized application by his actions against government officials in carrying out their duty. Initially, what concerned the claimant was the lack of what he considered to be reasonable compensation. The panel finds the basis for his complaint about government actions was not political opposition to the government's expropriation policy, but the amount of money he would receive.\n[33] The panel finds that, even if the claimant is being pursued for his participation in these confrontations, as noted above, he has broken a law of generalized application - one that applies to the whole population without differentiation. The panel notes that the Federal Court of Appeal in Zolfagharkhani, states that:\n...some general propositions relating to the status of an ordinary law of general application in determining the question of persecution:\n(1) The statutory definition of Convention refugee makes the intent (or any principal effect) of an ordinary law of general application, rather than the motivation of the claimant, relevant to the existence of persecution.\n...an ordinary law of general application, even in non-democratic societies, should be given a presumption of validity and neutrality, and the onus should be on the claimant, as is generally the case in refugee cases, to show that the law was inherently, or for some other reason, persecutory.17\n[34] Based on the evidence tendered by the claimant, the panel finds that if he is wanted by the PSB, he is wanted for an unlawful act rather than for holding a particular political opinion. The panel further finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant would be, at most, prosecuted in China for participation in a confrontation against the authorities. He spoke out against the government, specifically its corruption. Counsel submits that this was in effect suggesting that officials were pocketing money, due to the low compensation to the claimant, the higher sale price, thus allowing local officials to pocket the money, commonly known as kickbacks. With due respect, the panel finds that counsel was putting words into his client's mouth in this regard. The evidence from the claimant himself in his PIF and in response to the panel was that he disagreed with the low compensation.\n[35] The panel notes, as indicated above, that the claimant was one of the representatives of the concerned families in the village, and he was among the representatives demanding more compensation and confronting officials as a result.\n[36] The panel further notes the recent Federal Court's finding in Huang, in which the learned Judge stated the following:\nHowever, I note that in Ni... Justice Elizabeth Walker found reasonable the RPD's decision that being involved in a protest to demand fair compensation did not amount to persecution on a Convention ground. Further, shouting anti-government slogans does not necessarily mean that there is a nexus to a Convention ground...\nEven if I had accepted that the Applicants were wanted, they have not established that they would be persecuted; they have only established that they would be prosecuted for contravening a law of general application. Mr. Huang testified that he did not want to return to China because he would be arrested and put in jail, not that he would personally be subjected to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture.\nWhile it is true that the Applicants specifically pointed to objective country evidence documenting certain cases of abuse of individuals who protest against land expropriation, the RPD found there was insufficient evidence that the Applicants themselves would be subjected to treatment amounting to persecution.\nI find this conclusion to be reasonable. In other words, there is no evidence that persons who have opposed land expropriation are systematically subjected to treatment amounting to persecution, such that it renders unreasonable the RPD's conclusion that the Applicants will not be subjected to persecution. I also note that the government has already expropriated the Applicants' land and would have only a limited, if any, interest in the principal Applicant other than to prosecute him for having participated in an illegal gathering. Lastly, the fact that the sentence for unlawfully opposing an expropriation is harsher in China than in Canada does not amount to persecution.18 [footnotes omitted]\n[37] In the circumstances of this case, the panel finds that any interest the PSB may have in this claimant, which the panel does not believe that they do, would be to prosecute him for breaking laws by participating in anti-government demonstration.\n[38] Based on the foregoing analysis, the panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant is not being sought for arrest by the authorities in China as alleged.\n[39] Based on the totality of the evidence submitted and adduced in this case, the panel finds that the claimant has not satisfied his burden of establishing a serious possibility that he would be persecuted, or, that he would, on a balance of probabilities, be personally subjected to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture upon return to China today.\nCONCLUSION\n[40] Pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the IRPA, the panel finds that the claimants is neither a Convention refugee, nor a person in need of protection.\n[41] The claim is rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Roslyn Ahara\"\nRoslyn Ahara\nJune 12, 2019\nDate\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n2 Exhibit 2, Personal Information Form (PIF).\n3 Exhibit 1, Package of Information from the Referring CBSA\/CIC.\n4 Exhibit 5, Personal Documents, at pp. 1-2.\n5 Maldonado, Pedro Enrique Juarez v.

He claims protection in Canada pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act).1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claim is based on the claimant's political opinion. He alleges a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of agents of the ruling Parti Ha\u00eftien T\u00e8t Kale (PHTK) party. The claimant has set out his allegations fully in the narrative portion of his Basis of Claim Form (BOC).2 His political activity includes:\n* Membership in the student group, Operation pour Haiti (OPHA). The claimant joined the group in his last year of high school. The group discussed the socio-political situation in Haiti, and the claimant was an active and outspoken member.\n* In September 2016, the claimant joined the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\" (KOPA). As a member of the KOPA, the claimant had responsibility for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX His role was to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\n* Attending and speaking at a KOPA meeting in Girardo, Petion-Ville, on October 15, 2016.\n* Organising a group, the INUKA Operation pour Haiti, at his university, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (INUKA).\n* Encouraging citizens to participate in three non-violent protests to force the government to change the September 2017 budget. The protests took place in front of the Haitian National Palace in Port-au-Prince.\n* Participating in a protest on October 12, 2017, in Delmas, Haiti.\n[3] The claimant alleged that his political activities brought him to the attention of the PHTK. After he became involved with the KOPA, he began to receive regular threats from a member of the PHTK, XXXX, who lived in his neighbourhood. At the October 2016 KOPA meeting, XXXX and another man, XXXX, opened fire at the attendees. The claimant knew both XXXX and XXXX, because XXXX lived in his neighbourhood and XXXX was one of his companions. The two harangued him for taking part in the meeting and threatened him with death.\n[4] In September 2017, XXXX warned the claimant to stop protesting against the September 2017 budget. XXXX warned that should he persist, the claimant's situation would worsen. The claimant received a second threatening telephone call from a caller who identified himself as XXXX from the PHTK. XXXX threatened the claimant. He told him that he should disappear or he would kill him. Before XXXX call, the claimant received two anonymous telephone calls; however, the caller hung up both times when the claimant answered the telephone.\n[5] Many groups were present at the October 12, 2017, protest in Delmas; among them was the Platfom Pitit Desalin. The claimant alleged that this group was using the protest to further its own end of overthrowing the PHTK government by force. This meeting descended into violence as clashes broke out between members of the PHTK and the Platfom Pitit Desalin. During the melee, a member of the KOPA was killed. After the October 12, 2017, protest, the claimant learned from the president of the OPHA that he had been offered 2000 gourdes (approximately US$ 30) to disrupt peaceful protests.\n[6] On October 4, 2017, XXXX, XXXX, and two others attacked the claimant as he was making his way home. The claimant was saved from a severe beating by other students. He was attacked again on October 10, 2017. Shots were fired at him while he was in his car, and stones were thrown at his rear window. As well, a brown car followed him, causing him to abandon his car and flee on foot. Instead of going to his own home, the claimant went to his grandmother's. He telephoned his parents, and his father sent someone to retrieve his car. The claimant remained at his grandmother's until he left Haiti onXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017. The claimant went to the United States (US) but did not make an asylum claim in the country, because he was deterred by the change in US government policy toward Haitians.\nThe issues\n[7] Credibility is the determinative issue in the claim. The claimant must also establish his identity and his political profile.\nIdentity\n[8] The claimant's personal identity and his identity as a citizen of Haiti are satisfactorily established by his testimony, fixing him in that country, and by the identity documents included in Exhibit 1,3 as well as by the Board's Special Information Research Unit's (SIRU) documentation regarding biometric information received from the US authorities.4\nANALYSIS\nCredibility\n[9] The claimant testified in a seemingly straightforward manner. He answered questions directly. However, there were aspects of his testimony that the panel did not find credible, because it found them not to be plausible in the circumstances described.\nWhat the panel found credible\n[10] The panel found that the claimant had satisfactorily established his political profile as a student member of the political organisation, KOPA. He disclosed a number of documents, including an original of his KOPA identification card5 and a letter attesting to his membership in the organisation.6 More importantly, when he was asked, he was able to describe in detail the origin, structure, and political platform of the organisation. He was also able to describe his role as \"responsable for Bloc 1\" and what Bloc 1 refers to. The panel found the claimant credible in regard to his political affiliation with the KOPA and, therefore, it accepts that he had the political profile he claimed.\nIs the claimant at risk in Haiti because of his political profile and activity?\n[11] The claimant stated that he was afraid of members of the ruling PHTK party because of his political activities. He testified that he was active in Bloc 1, Petion-Ville. He spoke at political rallies and worked to educate the populace in that area respecting the political climate, their voting rights, and their choices regarding political candidates.\n[12] The claimant alleges two major incidents, both of which occurred in October 2017. First, he alleges that on October 4, 2017, he was waylaid by members of the PHTK as he left INUKA University. On that occasion, he was dragged from his vehicle and beaten. He was saved by students from the university who saw what was taking place. His mother and grandmother treated his injuries at home.\n[13] The second major incident occurred about a week later on October 10, 2017, at about 6:00 p.m. in the evening. The claimant described the incident in detail. He said that he had attended an OPHA meeting where they discussed the socio-economic situation in Haiti and the disparity between the rich and the poor. He stayed to play soccer. He was about to leave the school premises when he noticed some 20 to 30 people congregated outside of the school. Referring to him, they said, \"Here he is, the bad guy.\" The claimant understood from that statement that the group intended to kill him. He started to move his car. As he drove off, the group threw stones and fired at his car. He continued to drive but was followed by persons in a brown SUV, who continued to shoot at his car. The claimant abandoned his car in a dead-end. He did not return home immediately but hid out in a garbage dump. At about 8:00 p.m. that evening, he went to his grandmother's house where he hid under the bed. The claimant remained at his grandmother's until he left Haiti four days later.\n[14] Claimants for refugee protection benefit from the presumption of truthfulness that is attached to their sworn testimony.7 In considering the claimant's accounts of these two incidents, the panel finds that the presumption is rebutted, because the incidents are not credible because they were not plausible in the circumstances described by the claimant.\nThe incident of October 4, 2017\n[15] The claimant testified that on October 4, 2017, he was leaving school when XXXX XXXX XXXX, and two others stopped his car, dragged him from it, and beat him. His assailants asked him to leave the KOPA. He was rescued by other students who came to his aid. When he arrived home, his mother and grandmother treated his injuries. They did not take him to see a doctor.\n[16] The panel asked the claimant how the stop was effected. He replied that his assailants had erected a barricade constructed of blocks, wood, and rubber tyres outside the school's gate. He testified that he was not the only person who was leaving the school at that time; however, he was the only one driving. The other students left on foot, and the other cars were in the parking lot.\n[17] The panel finds that this explanation is not plausible, because it does not explain how the assailants would know when the claimant would leave the school and, therefore, how they would be able to erect a barricade to stop him. Neither does it explain how the barricade could be erected without alerting the school community, members of which, he testified, were leaving and entering the campus. Furthermore, as the claimant was not the only person who used a car to go to the school, it is not plausible that the alleged assailants would erect a barricade in front of the gates to prevent him from leaving the premises.\n[18] Counsel for the claimant submitted that the issue of the barricade is peripheral to the claimant's credibility. The panel does not agree. It is central to the claimant's allegation of being attacked on October 4, 2017. The barricade was the instrument by which his assailants sought to entrap him. The panel finds that the claimant's description of the circumstances does not accord with common sense and is not plausible and, therefore, it finds that the claimant's allegation that he was attacked on October 4, 2017, is also not credible.\nThe incident of October 10, 2017\n[19] The panel also finds that the claimant's account of the alleged incident of October 10, 2017, is not credible. The claimant alleged that he was followed by a brown SUV and that he drove into a dead-end (cul-de-sac) where he abandoned his damaged vehicle and fled on foot, eventually hiding in a garbage dump. The panel finds that this version of events is not plausible, because the claimant would have had to exit his vehicle, giving his assailants, who were armed, ample opportunity to have the dead-end live up to its name.\n[20] Furthermore, as the claimant testified that XXXX lived in his neighbourhood and that the incident occurred in his neighbourhood, the panel finds that it is reasonable to assume that XXXX was familiar with the neighbourhood and would have known about the garbage dump. In the panel's view, it is reasonable to find that XXXX and the other assailants would have followed the claimant and searched the dump for him. Accordingly, the panel finds that there is valid reason to doubt and to reject the claimant's allegations of an attack on him on October 10, 2017.\n[21] The claimant tendered photographs of his damaged vehicle.8 The panel accepts that the claimant's vehicle was damaged; however, given its credibility findings respecting the October 10, 2017, incident, the panel cannot be certain that the damage was sustained as claimed.\n[22] As well, the claimant testified that when he arrived at his grandmother's house, she hid him under the bed to prevent him being found. The panel is of the view that this testimony is not plausible, as this would likely be one of the first places where a determined attacker would look.\n[23] The claimant also testified that while he was at his grandmother's house, he learnt that a fellow organiser had died. This death, coupled with XXXX threat uttered to the claimant's parents that he would kill him, prompted the claimant's father to purchase an airline ticket for the claimant. The panel is not satisfied that such a threat was made, because it was not mentioned in the claimant's narrative and when asked, the claimant's only response was that his narrative was a \"resume\" of his experiences. As the threat was allegedly made on the very night of October 10, 2017, and as the claimant's narrative is five pages long, the panel does not find his explanation to be satisfactory. The panel notes that his father's letter,9 written a year later, does mention the threat; however, the panel is of the view that the threat is an event of such significance that it is hardly likely that the claimant would omit it from his five-page narrative. Therefore, the panel rejects his explanation.\nThe documentary evidence\n[24] The objective documentation states that political violence has abated in recent years and that there appears to be no suppression of political opponents.10 However, territorialism was observed such that expressing a political opinion that does not accord with the majority in the \"territory\" can be dangerous:11\nLa tendance \u00e0 la violence \u00e9manant des autorit\u00e9s \u00e9tatiques a fortement diminu\u00e9 au cours des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es. Il n'y a actuellement pas de r\u00e9pression syst\u00e9matique des opposants politiques ni des d\u00e9fenseurs des droits humains, qui jouissent librement de leurs droits civils et politiques. La libert\u00e9 d'expression et les libert\u00e9s publiques sont globalement respect\u00e9es, et peu d'exemples r\u00e9cents de journalistes menac\u00e9s pour s'\u00eatre exprim\u00e9s publiquement dans les m\u00e9dias ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rapport\u00e9s. Il existe n\u00e9anmoins des cas isol\u00e9s d'atteintes aux droits humains et de violences \u00e0 caract\u00e8re politique.\nLes partis politiques ont territorialis\u00e9 leur influence, et les citoyens se doivent de soutenir les personnalit\u00e9s du parti contr\u00f4lant leur zone de r\u00e9sidence. La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 est particuli\u00e8rement polaris\u00e9e dans les territoires o\u00f9 les rivalit\u00e9s entre des figures locales sont importantes, notamment dans les quartiers populaires de l'agglom\u00e9ration de Port-au-Prince, comme Cit\u00e9 Soleil et Martissant par exemple, et ponctuellement dans d'autres r\u00e9gions du pays, comme dans la municipalit\u00e9 de Petit- Go\u00e2ve et dans le d\u00e9partement du Centre, lors des p\u00e9riodes \u00e9lectorales. Dans ces endroits, exprimer son opposition \u00e0 la tendance politique locale est dangereux et peut exposer \u00e0 des menaces. [footnotes omitted]\n[25] Based on the objective evidence, the panel finds that violence and the targeting of particular individuals and their families for political reasons occur in Haiti, including acts perpetrated by the PHTK. However, in light of its credibility assessment, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has not been targeted in such a manner.\nCONCLUSION\n[26] Having considered the totality of the evidence, including the claimant's testimony and the documentary evidence, the panel concludes that the claimant has not discharged his onus to establish, by means of sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence, that he has a well-founded fear of persecution, or that there is a risk to his life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment and punishment in Haiti because of his political profile and activity.\n[27] Accordingly, the panel finds that the claimant is not a Convention refugee nor is he a person in need of protection.\n[28] The claim is rejected.\n(signed)\n\"H.

Pursuant to Rule 21 of the RPD Rules, the Parents' Claims, which included the RPD decision (the \"Parents' Decision\") and the Basis of Claim forms\/narrative (the \"Parents' BOC\") (collectively, the \"Parents' Materials\") were disclosed to the claimants in early November 2018. These materials are found at Exhibit 6.\n[4] The claimants' claims were heard before the present panel on February 22, 2019. No issues were raised by claimants' counsel at the hearing with regard to the previously disclosed Parents' Materials.\nALLEGATIONS\n[5] The claimants are a family from Bogota, Colombia. The minor claimant is five years old.\n[6] The claimants' allegations can be found in their BOC and amended BOC, which can be found at Exhibits two and eight. In summary, the claimants allege that they were shot at and targeted for extortion by the National Liberation Army (\"ELN\") in multiple locations within Colombia because the PC's father had failed to pay the demanded extortion amounts.\n[7] The details of the alleged issues faced by the PC's father can be found in the Parents' BOC as the claimants do not go into great detail about the origins of the threats against them in their own BOC and Amended BOC. In summary, the PC's father alleges that he owned a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX within Valle del Cauca, Cauca and Narino XXXX in 2016. He was approached by ELN members on several occasions (in person and over the phone) and at different locations, who threatened him and his family with death if he did not pay the extortion demands. When the threats reached a certain level, he told his family, including the PC and sought to have them leave the country with him. It was alleged that the PC did not leave the country because at that time the PC was separated from the AC and the AC had refused to grant the PC and the minor claimant consent to leave the country.\n[8] The claimants left for the United States of America on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017 as they had valid American visas since February 10, 2017. The claimants entered Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017 and made their claims at the port of entry.\nDETERMINATION\n[9] I find that the claimants are not Convention Refugees as they do not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Colombia. Further, I find that they are not people in need of protection as their removal to Colombia would not subject them personally to a risk to life, to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or to a danger of torture.\nNexus\n[10] The claimants' have allegedly been targeted on account of the failure of the PC's father to pay demanded extortion amounts. The panel finds that the basis of the claimants' alleged risk is on account of criminality and not due to political opinion. The Federal Court has held that victims of crime, corruption or vendettas generally fail to establish a link between their fear of persecution and one of the Convention grounds in the definition of Convention Refugee.4 The panel therefore finds that there is no nexus to s.96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act as the threats and demands made to the PC's father are on account of extortion demands. The claim will be assessed solely under s.97 to determine if the claimants are persons in need of protection.\nIdentity\n[11] The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimants have established their identities as citizens of Colombia by virtue of their testimony and certified true copies of their passports, seized by CBSA.5\nCredibility\n[12] Evidence given under oath or affirmation is presumed to be true, unless there is valid reason to find otherwise.6 The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimants' evidence, in conjunction with the findings made in the Parents' Claim and Parents' Decision, is not credible.\n[13] The claimants received the Parents' Materials in November 2018 and provided an amended BOC on or about February 12, 2019 (despite the Amended BOC itself being dated January 31, 2018).7 The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the Amended BOC was dated in error and in fact signed on January 31, 2019 (rather than 2018), given the timing of the submission to the Board and because the Translator's declaration for the materials at Exhibit 7 (which includes the Amended BOC) is dated February 8, 2019. The panel therefore finds that the claimants had notice of the allegations in the Parents' Claims and negative RPD Decision prior to submitting their Amended BOC.\n[14] The panel takes note of the Parents' Decision in which the Member found the Parents' Claim, on a balance of probabilities, to be not credible. The Member who decided the Parents' Claim, makes a number of credibility findings with respect to the PC's father, which undermined the entire basis of the Parents' Claim. As these claimants' claims are founded on what transpired in the Parents' Claim and the Parents' Claim has been found to be not credible, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities, that the credibility of the Claimants' allegations has been undermined. The panel is well aware that the decision of one RPD Member is not binding upon another, even where the allegations are based on the same factual matrix and that a decision maker must make a decision based on the facts of each individual claim, as presented. The panel asked the PC if she had any explanation for why her father had made the errors noted in the Parents' Decision, to which she responded that she knows that he was scared and in shock when he came to Canada and didn't have time to process everything he went through. While the panel has no doubt that refugee claimants are under a great deal of stress, the panel finds that the PC's explanation for her father's errors (as found by the Member in the Parents' Decision) are vague and unsubstantiated as she confirmed in testimony that she had not in fact talked to him about it, but rather heard about it through other family members. The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the PC did not have a reasonable and substantiated explanation for the credibility issues noted in the Parents' Decision.\n[15] The panel has assessed the Parents' BOC and Parents' Decision as evidence to be considered and weighed along with all the evidence directly advanced by the claimants in this claim. The panel notes that it is for the claimants to discharge the burden of providing the panel with evidence that addresses the many issues raised in the Parents' Decision. The panel asked the PC why the claimants' Amended BOC didn't address the omissions between the claimants' BOC and the Parents' BOC as well as the issues raised in the Parents' Decision, to which she testified that she didn't think she would have to talk about it. The panel finds this to be an unreasonable response. The claimants' entire claim is based on the foundation that her father was a target of the ELN for having failed to pay extortion amounts. Given that the claimants had notice that the very foundation of their claim had been found to be not credible, the panel finds that their failure to provide any evidence to address those issues and further testifying that she didn't think she would have to talk about it, undermines their credibility. The panel further finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the findings in the Parents' Decision have therefore not been challenged or addressed, such that the panel must take those findings of fact at face value.\n[16] The panel asked the PC to explain why she omitted from both her BOC and Amended BOC, that she had considered leaving Colombia, due to the concerns raised by her father, almost one year prior to when the claimants actually left. The PC testified that at that moment, she did not consider it relevant to mention. The panel asked the PC to explain why she would think that not mentioning her knowledge of the previous threats to her family\/father's difficulties were not relevant to her own claim, to which she testified that it was not a question posed to her so she didn't give any answers about that. The panel finds the PC's explanation to be non-responsive and that failing to mention her personal knowledge and consideration of leaving the country earlier with her parents to be a material omission. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the PC's omission undermines her credibility and the credibility of her allegations.\n[17] The panel finds that the Maldonado8 presumption has been discharged as a result of the credibility issues noted above.\n[18] Further supporting the panel's finding regarding the above noted omission, is the PC's responses to the Police after the alleged shooting incident in May 20179. The PC was asked by the Police if she had any reason why someone would want to attack her and she responded \"I do not fear reasons\". The PC was then asked if she had any recognized enemy that has threatened her and she responded \"Not having a known enemy\". The panel asked the PC how she could have responded in the negative to those questions given the discussions she had with her father about leaving the country and the discussions she had with her husband (the AC) about taking the minor claimant out of the country. The PC explained that at that moment she was in shock and thought it was a robbery attempt. The panel does not accept the PC's explanation as reasonable given that there was allegedly such a clear danger to her family, such that her father was so scared that he left the country and tried to get her and the minor claimant to come with them. The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the PC's explanation for failing to mention the previous ELN threat to the Police to be unreasonable and undermines the credibility of the foundational allegations that the ELN had threatened her family in the past.\n[19] Further, the claimants allege that when the ELN contacted them, they were asked to pay the extortion debt left by the PC's father. The panel finds it implausible that the ELN, if their stated purpose was to recover extortion monies from the claimants, that they would have shot at the claimants first (as described in the alleged May 2017 incident), before communicating the debt they were seeking from the claimants. Although not determinative, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that this implausibility finding undermines the narrative advanced by the claimants.\n[20] The panel notes that there were no witnesses to the alleged May 2017 shooting incident and there is nothing beyond the claimants' evidence and self-report to the police to corroborate this event. Further, all threat calls allegedly received by the claimants came from private numbers and, as well, the November 2017 incident had no witnesses. Given the issues with the credibility of the foundation of the claim and the PC's credibility issues, the panel finds that it must give the Police reports reduced weight as far as establishing that the events described, occurred as alleged. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities that the claimants went to the police and ombudsmen's office in Bogota and Villavencio (which cities are not particularly far from each other), but the panel finds that it cannot accept, on a balance of probabilities that the events noted in the police reports and letter to the Ombudsman, in fact occurred as alleged.\n[21] Further, the claimants allege that the PC and her son first travelled to Bucaramanga after the XXXX 2017 shooting incident and then to Cartagena on XXXX XXXX, 2017, to escape from the ELN, but that they were ultimately found at each location, as communicated via phone calls. The PC and her son allegedly left Cartagena on XXXX XXXX, 2017. The claimants provided no independent corroborative evidence to show that the PC and minor claimant had spent any time in Bucaramanga or Cartagena. The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the PC and minor claimant have not established with sufficient credible or corroborative evidence that they fled to Bucaramanga or Cartagena. The panel therefore finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimants have embellished their claims to try and show that the ELN could find them across country.\nCONCLUSION\n[22] Having considered the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimants are neither Convention Refugees nor persons in need of protection, pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, as the claimants do not face a serious possibility of persecution upon a return to Colombia, and because their respective removals to Colombia would not subject them personally, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to their lives, or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or to a danger of torture. Their claims are therefore rejected.\n(signed)\n\"D. Marcovitch\"\nD.

They are citizens of Venezuela, who allege that they are Convention refugees or a persons in need of protection pursuant to the provisions of section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nPRELIMINARY MATTERS\n[2] The hearing proceeded after the adult claimant had been appointed as the Designated Representative of her minor son and he left the hearing room.\nMinister's Intervention\n[3] On February 2, 2018, the Minister, through his counsel, filed a notice pursuant to the provisions of subsection 170(e) of the IRPA that the Minister intended to intervene in this matter by way of documents only on the grounds of credibility.\n[4] The Minister's Notice of Intent to Intervene may be found in the paper record of this matter. Citing discrepancies between the claimant's representation of herself as married and as divorced with respect to information supplied by her to U.S. and Canadian officials, the Minister intervened on the grounds of the claimant's credibility.\n[5] The Minister submitted that the claimant explain why she represented herself as a divorced, single parent. The Minister also submitted that the claimant provide copies of her divorce papers, the court documents which granted her custody of her son, and a notarized document signed by her son's father that allowed her to travel and to remain in Canada with her son.\n[6] In response to the Minister's concerns, as noted above, the claimants' counsel prepared and served on July 5, 2019, a packet of documents as requested by the Minister.2\n[7] This document packet, which included certified translations from Spanish into English, includes, among other things, the following documents:\n* The birth certificate of the adult claimant;3\n* The birth certificate of the claimant's son;4\n* The authorization by the claimant's former spouse that authorized her to take the minor claimant to Canada, which is dated January 17, 2018;5 and,\n* Excerpts from the Divorce certificate between the claimant and her former husband, which is dated October 2nd, 2013.6\n[8] It is my view that, on the balance of probabilities, the claimant is divorced from her spouse and she has his permission to bring the minor claimant permanently to Canada and I do so find.\n[9] The question now is why, if the couple's divorce was finalized in 2013, why did the claimant still represent herself as married at a later date? Her response was that she and her former husband were making efforts over the years to reconcile and get back together. She also opined that because of the excessive bureaucracy and red tape in the Venezuelan justice system, she and her former spouse did not become aware that their marriage had been legally dissolved for some years after the fact.\n[10] In these circumstances, I am willing to accept the explanation of the claimant as reasonable, and I am of the view that the Minister's concerns about the claimant's credibility have been sufficiently answered.\nALLEGATIONS\n[11] The claimants allege that should they return to Venezuela, they would face persecution by the Venezuelan government and its supporters because of the political opinion of the adult claimant.\nAllegations of Material Fact\n[12] The claimant was a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of Carabobo, having worked for the XXXX XXXX for 22 years. She worked in the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[13] Although not a member of the party, the claimant was a supporter of Proyecto Venezuela (Project Venezuela) party, which was in power in the regional government of Carabobo.\n[14] In the elections of 2012, the Partido Socialisto Unido de Venezuela \/ United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) came to power, not only nationally, but in the region of Carabobo as well.\n[15] The PSUV is the party of Hugo Chavez and Nicholas Maduro.\n[16] The claimant started to attend rallies and demonstrations against the PSUV in 2012.\n[17] Despite the change in government, not much changed at first as the management of the claimant's department remained apolitical. However, all of that changed in November 2016 when a new XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was appointed. This individual was an avid supporter of the PSUV and he began to pressure the regional government's departments to attend political rallies in support of the PSUV. The claimant refused to attend such rallies, as they were contrary to her personal political views.\n[18] As a result of her refusal to express support for the PSUV, the claimant alleges that she was criticized by her managers and was given a number of tasks to perform at work, which were outside of her designated employment responsibilities. For example, the claimant alleges that she had to attend police stations in other towns and interact with the employees there. She also heard about human rights abuses in the jails.\n[19] The claimant continued to be sent to various locals to do tasks which she claims did not correspond to her job as an XXXX. The claimant was very upset by this change to her job description.\n[20] On March 22, 2017, the claimant joined the PSUV party although she was totally against its aims. In spite of her joining the PSUV, the claimant was still pressured to attend pro-government rallies. She made various excuses to avoid attending such rallies.\n[21] By July 2017, the claimant's superiors at work made it clear to all of the employees that an eye would be kept on them and their entitlements to various benefits, such as paid leave and pensions, might be adversely affected by their perceived support or lack thereof for the PSUV government.\n[22] The claimant lived in a part of town where most residents supported the opposition. Often these demonstrations prevented the claimant from arriving at work on time and she was reprimanded for her tardiness.\n[23] In August 2017, the claimant, her son, and her cleaner were at home when her son's cell phone rang. He did not recognize the voice on the other end of the call, so his mother told him to hang up, which he did. A short time later, the phone rang again and a male voice said words to the minor claimant to the effect that his mother should be careful to avoid getting involved in things that are not her business and not to become a snitch. The minor claimant hung up. The phone rang a third time, the claimant answered and told the caller to stop bothering them and hung up. On the third call, the caller said nothing.\n[24] After that time, neither the claimant nor her son received any further calls. She testified that it was this that made her decide to quit her job.\n[25] By the end of October, the claimant stated that she had completed all of the necessary arrangements to leave Venezuela. She resigned from her job on October 30, 2017, and she and her son flew to Miami, Florida, on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017.\n[26] The claimant and her son made their way to the Canadian border, where they claimed refugee protection. Because the claimant has a niece in Canada, she and her son were exempted from the Safe Third Country Agreement.7\n[27] The claimant alleges that should she return to Venezuela, she and her son would be in danger because of her political opinion and because she is a former civil servant.\nDETERMINATION\n[28] The panel accepts the certified copies of the Venezuelan passports tendered into evidence8 and it finds that the claimant are who they claim to be and they are citizens of Venezuela.\n[29] The panel further finds that the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection for the reasons set forth below.\nANALYSIS\n[30] By alleging that she and her son would face a danger in Venezuela because of her political beliefs, the claimant has established a connection to one of the grounds, which describe a Convention refugee.\n[31] Although I accept the claimant's testimony as truthful, I am unable to find that the problems that the claimant encountered in her home country amount to persecution.\n[32] The fact that the claimant was given various tasks outside of her usual work responsibilities by her government employer and was chided for being late to work are regrettable but they certainly do not amount to persecution.\n[33] The fact that the claimant felt that she was forced to join the PSUV party and was pressured to attend partisan government rallies is certainly not good, but in my view these issues do not engage her core human rights. The claimant refused to attend these rallies and as far as I can see she was no worse off for having done so.\n[34] The claimant alleges in her Narrative9 that she and her son received a death threat. Although it is certainly open to interpret the call of August 2017 in that way, there was nothing in the call that was an overt death threat. The fact that after the call in August neither the claimant nor her son received any further calls in the three months that elapsed before they left Venezuela suggests that the call was an intimidation tactic, rather than a serious threat.\n[35] Should the claimant and her son return to Venezuela, it is difficult to see how she and her son would be at any particular or special risk of harm. I pointed out to the claimant that at present Juan Guaido claims to be the interim president of Venezuela. He holds mass demonstrations in the streets and appears to be safe.\n[36] The claimant replied that Mr. Guaido is surrounded by bodyguards and is protected by his high status and international notoriety. That is a fair comment and one that I accept. That said, however, Mr. Guaido is also surrounded by tens of thousands of ordinary Venezuelans, who support him in the streets. Although the police and security forces have been accused of dealing harshly with such demonstrators, and such accusations are justified, the fact is that there are many thousands of people in Venezuela, who loudly oppose the \"Chavista\" regime of Nicholas Maduro. This gives truth to the fact that it is possible to oppose the regime in Venezuela.\n[37] The claimant also said that she would be at risk as a former civil servant. Counsel has not brought forward any source material that would confirm that claim. Indeed, I have conducted an extensive search in the country documents or anything that would confirm this point of view and I have unfortunately been unsuccessful.\n[38] I would also point out that the claimant is no longer a government employee and I cannot see how she would be subject to any particular or special treatment by the regime. It may be argued that since the claimant has seen inhumane prison conditions, she may be a danger to the regime. The problem with this line of argument is that this was not mentioned by the claimant, instead her main complaint was that she was forced to perform tasks which were outside of her scheduled duties and responsibilities. Moreover, I have been unable to find anything in the country condition documents that confirms this point of view.\n[39] Indeed, it would appear that many of the problems encountered by the claimant at her work may have been designed to encourage her to quit. Now that she has done just that, I do not see how the claimant would have a problem from her former government employer.\n[40] Besides, notwithstanding the miserable state of Venezuelan prisons, this is hardly a state secret given that this is widely known.\n[41] In the circumstances of this case, notwithstanding the fact that Venezuela is spiraling downward into chaos under an increasingly obdurate and oppressive regime, not all persons in Venezuela who oppose the current regime are necessarily Convention refugees.\n[42] Although I have the greatest sympathy for this claimant and have accepted her testimony as factual, I am afraid that her allegations show discrimination only and they do not rise to the level of persecution. In the event that the claimants were to return to Venezuela, they would not, in my view, face a serious possibility of persecution and accordingly they do not have a well-founded fear of persecution in Venezuela.\n[43] Applying the higher balance of probability standard of subsection 97(1), I find that the claimants, should they return to Venezuela, would not face a danger on substantial grounds to exist of torture, or to a risk to their lives, or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nCONCLUSION\n[44] I have found that both claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection and their claims are accordingly rejected.\n(signed)\n\"William T.

The principal claimant was appointed as the Designated Representative for the minor claimants.\n[3] The panel has taken into consideration the Chairperson's Guidelines on gender-related claims.2\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The claimants' allegations are set out fully in their respective Basis of Claim forms3 and in a narrative attached to the principal claimant's BOC.4\n[5] In summary, the claimants are stateless Palestinians who were born in Saudi Arabia. They fear persecution in Saudi Arabia and Jordan on the basis of their Palestinian nationality. The female claimants also fear persecution on the basis of their gender.\nDECISION\n[6] The panel finds that the claimants have not established that they face a serious possibility of persecution based on a Convention ground, nor have they established, on a balance of probabilities, that they would be personally subject to a danger of torture, a risk to life, or to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, were they to return to their country of former habitual residence.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[7] The panel is satisfied as to the personal identity of each of the claimants, based on their respective Jordanian travel documents.5 The panel is further satisfied, based on these documents and based on the testimony provided at the hearing, that the claimants are each stateless Palestinians.\nCountry of Former Habitual Residence\n[8] Not having a country of nationality, the panel is required to determine the claimants' country - or countries - of former habitual residence. Having considered all of the evidence, the panel finds that Saudi Arabia is the only CFHR.\n[9] The panel considered whether Jordan could be considered a CFHR for the claimants. The evidence before the panel is that the principal claimant attended university in Jordan between 1997 and 2001 and that he visited Jordan on three occasion thereafter, in 2010, 2015 and 2016. He testified that these trips were taken for touristic purposes and that the longest he stayed on any one trip was 20 days. He further testified that the associate claimant and the minor claimants travelled with him on these trips. The associate claimant agreed with her husband's testimony and testified that she herself had not been to Jordan at any other time. The panel finds that the principal claimant lived in Jordan for a temporary purpose, i.e. attending university, and that his time there does not constitute a significant period of de facto residence. The panel is of the view that the principal claimant's subsequent visiting of Jordan for short pleasure trips with his family does not detract from this finding. Accordingly, the panel also finds that short vacation trips taken by the associate claimant and the minor claimants do not constitute significant periods of de facto residence in Jordan. The panel therefore finds that Jordan is not a CFHR for the claimants.\nDiscrimination vs. Persecution\n[10] The principal claimant declared in his BOC narrative that Saudi Arabia is very oppressive and systematically discriminatory and persecutory when it comes to the treatment of foreign nationals, and particularly toward stateless Palestinians. He further declared that he and his family have been unable to become citizens or permanent residents of Saudi Arabia; that he was unable to attend university there; that he had to live under the sponsorship system with a sponsor who controlled every aspect of his life and took advantage of him because of his Palestinian ethnicity; and that he and his family did not have access to Saudi public health and education. The principal claimant further declared in his BOC narrative that his sponsor verbally and sexually harassed the associate claimant over the telephone, that she and her 10-year old daughter were frequently harassed by members of the so-called \"religious police\" for not dressing properly, and that the minor claimants experienced beatings and bullying by fellow classmates at school.\n[11] The panel has considered the claimants' allegations with respect to discrimination based on Saudi Arabia's laws governing citizenship and residency, employment, and who is entitled to attend a government university or hospital, and has assessed whether these laws constitute discrimination that rises to the level of persecution.\n[12] Persecution is not a defined term in the Act. However, the question has been addressed by the courts in Canada. In Ward, the Supreme Court of Canada stated that for treatment to amount to persecution, it must be a \"sustained or systemic violation of basic human rights demonstrative of a failure of state protection\".6 In Sefa,7 the Federal Court of Canada found the following synopsis of the Board to be a clear and correct statement of the law regarding discrimination versus persecution:\nTo be considered persecution, mistreatment suffered must be serious and the inflicting harm occurs with repetition or persistence, or in a systematic way. To determine what qualifies as serious one must examine the harmed interest of the claimant and to what extent the interest might be compromised. The courts equate seriousness with a key denial of a core human right. It is the requirement that the harm be serious that has led to a distinction between persecution and harassment. Persecution is characterized by the greater seriousness of the mistreatment involved. The courts have also distinguished between persecution and mere unfairness. At paragraph 54 of the UNHCR Handbook it is stated persons who receive less favourable treatment as a result of differences are not necessarily victims of persecution. It is only in certain circumstances that discrimination will amount to persecution, such as serious restrictions on one's right to earn a livelihood, right to practise religion or access to normally available educational facilities. Mistreatment may constitute discrimination or harassment and not be serious enough to be regarded as persecution. A finding of discrimination not persecution is within the jurisdiction of the RPD. Acts of harassment, none amounting to persecution individually, may cumulatively constitute persecution. The repeated instances of harassment in the past may lead to a serious possibility of persecution in the future. Whether or not measures of discrimination amount to persecution must be determined in consideration of all the circumstances.\n[13] The Federal Court of Appeal in Sagharichi stated:\nIt is true the dividing line between persecution and discrimination or harassment is difficult to establish, the more so since, in refugee law context, it has been found that discrimination may very well be seen as amounting to persecution. It is for the Board to draw the conclusion in a practical, factual context by proceeding with a careful analysis of the evidence adduced and a proper balancing of the various elements contained therein. 8\n[14] According to the objective documentary evidence, Palestinians are subject to the same regulations as other foreigners in Saudi Arabia and do not receive treatment different from that of other foreigners.9 Non-Saudis must have sponsorship to obtain work permits and residence permits; the sponsor can be a Saudi citizen or a company.10 Companies, establishments and individuals must obtain residence and work permits for their employees. It is illegal to employ an alien who does not possess a residence or work permit. Employing individuals who are sponsored by others is a violation of the system.11\n[15] The resident permit, or iqama, entitles legal residents to some state benefits, but not all of the benefits accorded to Saudi nationals.12 Access to services such as health and education depends on provisions contained in the work contract.13 Naturalization or access to social privileges guaranteed to citizens cannot be acquired through birth in Saudi territory and access to social benefits (public education, scholarships, government jobs, some professions, access to property, etc.) are restricted for all foreigners.14 The US Department of State's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2013 notes that in Saudi Arabia, only citizens have access to \"education, health care, public housing, courts and judicial procedures, legal services, and other social services\".15\n[16] With respect to access to health care, it is reported in the objective documentary evidence that non-citizens do not have free health care privileges; they have to pay for medical care through their own medical insurance coverage.16 With respect to education, the objective documentary evidence is somewhat mixed. One source indicates that non-citizens have to pay for their elementary and high school education, even though they are public schools,17 while another source reports that they do not.18 Sources agree, however, that after the age of 18, non-citizens are not permitted to attend schooling in Saudi Arabia beyond the high school level, including college or university.19 With respect to employment, it is reported that obtaining a work permit has become increasingly difficult, as a number of positions and employment sectors are closed to foreigners, and as the government is trying to replace foreigners with locals, what is commonly referred to as \"Saudization\" laws.20\n[17] Having considered the evidence, the panel finds that Saudi Arabia is a sovereign nation and, as such, has the right and ability to enact laws and regulations governing who may enter and remain within its borders, and on what terms, and who is or may become a citizen. Likewise, the panel finds that the Saudi government has the prerogative to establish laws and regulations that it deems beneficial to its citizens in the areas of education, employment and social services. In the panel's view, these are laws of general application.\n[18] In Zolfagharkhani,21 the Federal Court of Appeal (FCA) stated that the claimant bears the onus of showing that a law of general application is inherently persecutory in relation to a Convention ground. In this regard, the FCA set out a number of general propositions relating to the status of an ordinary law of general application in determining the question of persecution:\n* The statutory definition of Convention refugee makes the intent (or any principal effect) of an ordinary law of general application, rather than the motivation of the claimant, relevant to the existence of persecution.\n* But the neutrality of an ordinary law of general application, vis-\u00e0-vis the five grounds for refugee status, must be judged objectively by Canadian tribunals and courts when required.\n* In such consideration, an ordinary law of general application, even in non-democratic societies, should be given a presumption of validity and neutrality, and the onus should be on a claimant to show that the laws are either inherently or for some other reason persecutory.\n* It will not be enough for a claimant to show that a particular regime is generally oppressive but rather that the law in question is persecutory in relation to a Convention ground.\nThe panel finds that the claimants have not met their onus in establishing that the laws on residency and citizenship in Saudi Arabia, and those with respect to education, healthcare, employment and social services, are inherently persecutory in relation to a Convention ground. The panel finds that these are neutral laws of general application, in that they pertain to all non-Saudis, not just to Palestinians living in the country. The panel finds that the claimants do not face discrimination amounting to persecution due to Saudi Arabia's residency laws, or for lack of access to free education, health care or other social services, or as a result of employment laws implemented to benefit Saudi nationals.\n[19] In making this finding, the panel notes from the evidence that neither the principal claimant nor the associate claimant were denied receiving an education at the primary or secondary level in Saudi Arabia. They both declared having attended school for 12 years in Saudi Arabia.22 Likewise, the evidence before the panel is that the minor claimants who were old enough to attend school were doing so, at a private school paid for by the principal claimant. With respect to healthcare, there is no evidence before the panel that the claimants were ever denied medical treatment on a private basis while living in Saudi Arabia. The principal claimant testified that he had health coverage through his employer, but that sometimes he had to pay a certain portion of an expense.\n[20] With respect to employment, the panel notes that the principal claimant worked for the same company from 2014 until he left Saudi Arabia. The panel accepts that that his employer was not at all times fair towards him but finds that the treatment he declared receiving does not singularly or cumulatively rise to the level of persecution.\n[21] The panel accepts that the claimants experienced incidents of racial discrimination while living in Saudi Arabia, based on what is reported in the objective documentary evidence about the treatment of minorities in Saudi Arabia. The evidence makes clear that there is racial discrimination and \"substantial prejudice\" in Saudi Arabia against ethnic and national minorities.23 Saudi Arabia is noted to be a \"race-conscious society\" where \"colour is a factor in social standing\".24 However, the panel finds that the experiences alleged by the claimants, including minor claimants' being subjected to fights and bullying at school, does not rise to the level of persecution.\n[22] The objective evidence also indicates that violence and official gender discrimination against women are among the country's most significant human rights issues.25 Women are reported to be excluded from many aspects of public life and face significant discrimination under law and custom.26 They have fewer political and social rights than men and are treated by society as un-equals in political and social spheres.27 Their ability to move freely within the country is noted to be severely restricted, owing to the guardianship system.28\n[23] Regarding the associate claimant's claim and that of the female minor claimants, the panel accepts that the associate claimant has in the past been spoken to by the religious police about her non-compliance with the dress code and that the older of the female minor claimants has begun to experience this, too. However, the panel is of the view that foreigners and citizens alike are expected to follow prevailing cultural norms in Saudi Arabia and that the female claimants' personal experiences in this regard did not constitute persecution. The panel notes that with respect to the religious authorities, or the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (CPVPV) as they are known, that they are no longer empowered with the functions they once had. In April 2016, the Saudi government issued regulations severely curtailing the CPVPV's enforcement powers.29 As a result, CPVPV officers can no longer investigate, detain or arrest anyone30 and have been reportedly less visibly present and active following implementation of the new rules.31\n[24] Having considered all of the evidence in this case, the panel finds that the claimants' respective experiences of living in Saudi Arabia are not so serious as to rise to the level of persecution, either singularly or cumulatively.\nCONCLUSION\n[25] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimants have not established that they face a serious possibility of persecution based on a Convention ground, nor have they established, on a balance of probabilities, that they would be personally subject to a danger of torture, a risk to life, or to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, were they to return to their CFHR, specifically Saudi Arabia.\n[26] Accordingly, their claims are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"K.

In short, the PC alleges that she and her husband, who are residents of Lagos, are being compelled by the elders and extended family members from her husband's home community in Ogun state, to send the two minor female claimants (ages 9 and 13) to undertake female genital mutilation (FGM). The perpetrators are headed by an elder who is a police officer in Lagos, along with other relatives who live in Abuja and Ibadan. The PC's husband, who is the father of the three minor claimants stayed behind in Nigeria because they could not afford for him to come to Canada at this time. The PC and her husband were threatened and attacked because they refuse to succumb to the demands to have their daughters subjected to FGM. The minor male claimant is also at risk due to his close family relationship with his parents and sisters who are being targeted. The PC's husband went to the police on several occasions, and the police said that this is a domestic matter, to be settled without police assistance. The family went into hiding in Lagos for approximately two months, but the agents of harm were able to track them down and attacked them for a second time. The claimants went to the U.S. in XXXX 2018, to escape Nigeria, and arrived in Canada shortly thereafter to seek protection. The agents of persecution have continued to pursue the PC's husband in Nigeria, and beat him up in Abuja. The PC was in touch with her husband the day before the hearing on June 5, 2019, and he told her to return to Nigeria with the children. He said that the family pressure has increased and they will not let him have any peace until the ritual is done. The principal claimant fears that her husband is willing to succumb to the threats.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] I find that the claimants have not satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, or that, on a balance of probabilities, they would personally be subjected to a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture upon return to Nigeria. My reasons are as follows.\nANALYSIS\nInternal Flight Alternative - Jurisprudential Guideline not adopted and Credibility is the Determinative Issue\n[6] There exists a Jurisprudential Guide on Nigeria, TB7-19851 (The JG). The JG states that based on the documentary evidence contained in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Nigeria, that internal relocation in Nigeria is generally considered to be viable for refugee claimants fearing non-state actors.\n[7] I find that the facts in this case are different from those in the JG and I have, therefore, decided to distinguish this case and not to employ the reasoning in the JG. While the alleged agents of persecution are non-state actors, the profiles of the claimants in this case are different from the profile of the 20 year old, unmarried, childless female claimant in the case that is analysed in the JG. Also, the agents of persecution were allegedly able to find the claimants while they were in hiding, which suggests that an IFA may not be viable.\n[8] I find that the determinative issue in these claims is credibility.\nIdentity\n[9] I find that the claimants' identities as nationals of Nigeria are established by the PC's testimony, and the supporting identity documentation filed, including certified copies of the claimants' passports.1\nCredibility\n[10] I considered the PC's oral testimony, BOC form and narrative, and all the documentary evidence, and I find that there is insufficient credible evidence for me to accept the allegations that the perpetrators are threatening to kill or trying to physically harm the claimants in Nigeria for refusing to perform FGM on their daughters. My reasons are as follows.\nCredibility Concerns Regarding Going into Hiding\n[11] I do not find credible the PC's allegation that the family went into hiding in Lagos for approximately two months, and the agents of persecution found them in hiding, for the following reasons. I asked the claimant if she was going to work at the bank while in hiding in Lagos in July 2018, when the agents of persecution found her in hiding. She said that she went to work as usual during the period they were in hiding, at the same job she has had for a number of years. I find, that if the claimant was truly afraid of the alleged agents of persecution and genuinely \"in hiding,\" that it does not make sense that she would continue to go to work every day, as usual, because that is an obvious place where the agents of harm could find her.\n[12] Further, when I asked the PC the address of the place where she hid, she provided it. When I asked her why she did not list that address in her BOC form, she said that she was there for such a short period, she did not find it necessary. I do not accept this explanation for the omission from the BOC form, as the claimant affirmed at the beginning of the hearing that all the information in her BOC was complete, true, and correct, and this is the sort of information that one would reasonably expect to be included in the BOC form, under the circumstances.\nRecent Targeting by the Agents of Persecution not Credible\n[13] With regards to the agents of persecution beating up the PC's husband in Abuja in February 2019 after the claimants came to Canada, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that this did not happen, for the following reasons. The PC submitted a photo of her husband dated February 10, 2019, after the alleged beating which shows an injured man, with bandages, and his bloodied arm in a sling.2 However, the police report dated February 12, 2019,3 two days after the alleged attack, does not make any mention of a beating. Instead, the police report goes into detail about past attacks, why the agents of persecution are after the PC's husband. For example, it states the following:\nHe reminisced that the said people keep telling him to produce his daughters for the family ritual and rites or face the consequence which they claim is death. He stressed further that same people claim his wife and mother are responsible for the defiance and they would pay for it with their lives whenever or wherever they are found or located. He concluded that he had reported the incidence to the police authority and these erring relatives of his are still threatening him and hereby subdue him to unbearable intimidation. As a result he is now living in perpetual fear, hence the report.\n[14] I give minimal weight to the February 2019 police report because it does not make any mention of the claimant's spouse being beaten up a few days earlier, as alleged. I find, if the PC's husband was actually beaten up, then it is reasonable, on a balance of probabilities, that the beating would be mentioned in the police report. For the same reasons, I give minimal weight to the photo as it is undated and could be a depiction of the PC's husband after any injury, at any time, and does not provide concrete evidence that the PC's husband was beaten up at the time alleged by the alleged perpetrators.\nParents in Nigeria Can Refuse FGM\n[15] In contrast to the claimant's allegations, the objective documentary evidence does not indicate a practice of taking children by force to perform FGM in Nigeria over the objections of their parents, nor does it indicate that parents would be killed for refusing. I note that the recent documentary evidence cites a number of reliable sources that conclude that it is the parents' decision to have FGM performed, or not, and therefore parents can refuse to have FGM performed as follows:\nSources report that the decision to subject a girl to FGM in Nigeria is up to the girl's parents. The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) of the European Union (EU) indicates that there is considerable variation, among both individuals and ethnic groups, regarding whether it is the father or the mother who makes the final decision. According to sources, in some cases the decision depends on a consensus of both parents. .... A child protection specialist from UNICEF and a representative of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) in Nigeria, interviewed by the French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons (Office fran\u00e7ais de protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9set apatrides, OFPRA) during a mission to Nigeria in 2016, responded that parents who refuse to let their daughter be mutilated do not face any consequences, that is, neither retaliation nor threats. The anthropologist and the CWSI representative also stated that parents in Nigeria can refuse to have their daughter undergo FGM. According to the CWSI representative, even in communities where FGM is prevalent, some parents refuse to have their daughter undergo FGM, especially educated parents...The same source added that more educated, more informed, and more economically independent women have better means of refusing FGM whereas a non-educated woman or one who lives in the rural area is more susceptible to cultural pressure.4 [footnotes omitted]\n[16] According to the objective documentary evidence, it is common for educated parents to disallow the procedure on their daughters. In this case, the PC is a university graduate with an XXXX XXXX. In 2012, she obtained a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and was employed by XXXX XXXXfor approximately 14 years. When she left the XXXX in 2018, she was a XXXX XXXX XXXX. In other words, the PC is a very well educated, sophisticated, relatively economically well-off member of Nigerian society who, according to the documentary evidence, would typically refuse FGM, with impunity.\n[17] The documentary evidence goes on to state the following:\n... it is a choice that depends on a voluntary acceptance of the cultural practices of the ethnic group: parents who subject their daughter to this practice do so more from a sense of cultural belonging and fear of alienation or denial of communal benefits than through coercion. The CWSI representative indicated that parents who refuse FGM may suffer some form of social exclusion. In a second correspondence with the Research Directorate, the anthropologist also indicated, when speaking about rural areas, that \"threat[s]\" against parents who refuse FGM are limited to being \"ostracized for a time\" or \"publicly criticized\".5\n[18] I accept that refusal to perform FGM may result in ostracism and criticism. In fact, the claimant's own documentary evidence corroborates this claim. The claimants' Police Report pertaining to a police complaint made on December 16, 2017,6 states that the claimants made a report that family members want to perform FGM on their two daughters and they are against it, and the perpetrators are threatening to not give him his father's share of their late grandfather's property. The perpetrators are also \"threatening to ostracize him from the community if he fails to circumcise his daughters\". [emphasis added]\n[19] The police complaint does not mention that the claimants were threatened with any harm. It states that family members were threatening to ostracize the claimants, which is typical according to the objective documentary evidence. I find the Police Report made in December 2017 is likely genuine, and that the elders expressed that they believe the parents should circumcise their daughters. I accept that the claimants are under pressure from family members to perform FGM on their daughters. However, I find that being pressured, ostracized, and criticized does not rise to the level of being persecuted.\n[20] Further documentary evidence indicates the following:\nThe Project Coordinator stated that she \"hear[s] that if the woman refuses [to undergo FGM] her husband may reject her\". The lecturer stated that \"definitely if husbands support their wives there is little or nothing the society can do\" with regards to forcing a woman to undergo FGM.7 [footnotes omitted]\n[21] With regards to who decides who gets circumcised, the preponderance of objective documentary evidence, including that which is cited above, overwhelmingly indicates that the decision to perform FGM rests with the parents.\n[22] For all the reasons discussed above, I find the PC to be an unreliable witness, and I do not accept the central claim that the claimants are being pursued by violent family members. I find that the documentary evidence cited above is drawn from various reputable, independent sources that have no interest in the outcome of these proceedings. Since I do not find the PC credible, I find the objective documentary evidence to be a more reliable source of information than the PC, and prefer the objective documentary evidence over the testimony of the PC. Accordingly, I give the objective evidence regarding who decides if FGM is performed more weight than the claimant's allegation that they will be killed if they refuse FGM, and find, on a balance of probabilities that the claimants are not being threatened as alleged.\nPsychological Report\n[23] The PC provided a psychological assessment dated May 24, 2019, written by a registered Psychotherapist. The assessment includes a synopsis of the information in the PC's BOC, as well as an assessment of her mental health, based solely on the background information provided by her in a single visit. Based on the PC's account of her case, the psychotherapist concludes that in her opinion the PC is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and would benefit from counselling.\n[24] As stated in Rokni,8 a psychiatric report submitted as evidence \"cannot possibly serve as a cure-all for any and all deficiencies in a claimant's testimony.\" The court reiterated its position in Danailov,9 with respect to the assessment of a physician's evidence and the question of the assessment of credibility; it was stated, \"that opinion evidence is only as valid as the truth of the facts on which it is based.\" I find that, although the PC may be suffering from PTSD and depression, this may or may not be related to the causes described by the PC in her evidence. Accordingly, I find that the psychological report has minimal probative value and assign it minimal weight in assessing this case.\nPersonal Supporting Documents\n[25] The PC submitted a hospital report with regards to the alleged attack in July, 2018.10 It states that, \"the patient was conscious and alert, he was said to be assaulted by some hoodlums in the area.\" I find that the report clearly states that the injuries sustained were the result of a random attack, and fails to point to the alleged pattern of abuse alleged by the claimants. I, therefore, give it minimal weight.\n[26] In an attempt to identify the head agent of harm as a police officer, the PC submitted a photo of the PC's husband beside a police officer, and another male.11 I give the photo minimal weight because the photo could be of any man in a uniform, anywhere, and displays no identifying features.\n[27] The claimants submitted a police complaint dated May 6, 2018, to corroborate their allegation that unknown strangers forcefully entered the claimants' home and told them they were sent by the elders to bring the PC's husband and two daughters, for circumcision, as custom demands. It states that, \"out of fear and confusion his wife and family screamed as they pleaded with the men to allow them to go freely. However, their plea fell on deaf ears, as the strangers insisted they must leave with their daughters.\" The perpetrators left when the claimants began shouting and the neighbours arrived. I find that if, as the report states, \"the strangers out of fear quickly fled away on seeing people trooping in,\" then the following sentence does not make sense that, \"his relatives and kinsmen are bent on taking his daughters for some kind of fetish circumcision ritual forcefully, not minding whether or not him or his wife approves of such barbaric traditional act.\"\n[28] I find, if the elders were \"bent on taking the family members\" as the report states, then it stands to reason, on a balance of probabilities, that they would have taken them right then and there, and not left because some neighbours came by. I further find that the report includes numerous editorial comments and opinions about FGM that would not reasonably form part of a police report. For example, it states, \"He said he is not party to such barbaric custom, and will never want to be associated with such satanic rituals called \"tradition.\" As a result, I find the report was fraudulently created in an attempt to bolster this claim.\n[29] With regards to the seven supporting affidavits from neighbours, friends, and family members corroborating the alleged threats to life of the claimants,12 the contents are assessed below. I find that the content of the seven affidavits I have assessed below cumulatively add to the significant credibility concerns I have already outlined above.\n[30] I give minimal weight to the Affidavit of support from a neighbour who claims to have witnessed the first attack in May 2018.13 For the same reasons mentioned above, I find that if there were \"5 strange, scary men\" (as alleged in the BOC narrative) then it stands to reason, on a balance of probabilities, that the perpetrators would have taken the minor claimants as is the central fear, and not left because a neighbour came by and they \"sensed more neighbours trooping into the compound.\"\n[31] I also give minimal weight to the Affidavit of support from a neighbor who claims to be a witness to the alleged second attack on July 2018 at the claimants' hiding place.14 For the same reasons mentioned above, I find that if there were \"more than 5 in number and aggressive\" (as alleged in the BOC narrative) then it stands to reason, on a balance of probabilities, that the perpetrators would have taken the minor claimants, and not left because a neighbour came by and \"immediately and unconsciously alerted neighbours and the vigilante of the neighborhood.\" I therefore find that the Affidavit supports a claim I do not believe and has minimal probative value.\n[32] With regards to the Affidavit from the PC's husband's friend,15 I give the Affidavit minimal weight because it is not a first-hand account made by a witness, but a re-telling of what the deponent was told by the PC's husband, which I have found not to be credible.\n[33] With regards to the second Affidavit from a friend of the PC's husband,16 for the same reasons as above I give it minimal weight, because it is based on facts re-told to the deponent by the PC's husband, which I do not believe.\n[34] With regards to the Affidavit from the PC's husband's brother,17 I have already accepted that the PC's husband's family members want the minor claimants to be circumcised, as laid out in the Affidavit. I accept that the deponent was with his brother at the family meeting in 2017 when circumcision of the minor claimants was discussed. However, the section of the Affidavit where it says that \"they mobilized and hired thugs to trail the family,\" and that his brother \"went into hiding\" I do not accept because, again, the deponent was not a witness to these events, but is re-telling what was told to him by others.\n[35] With regards to the Affidavit from the PC's brother,18 he reports that the alleged perpetrators traced him to his apartment and asked him if he knew the whereabouts of the PC. The Affidavit goes on to say that \"these people appear desperate to carry out their family rites or tradition, and are willing to go to any lengths in achieving their aim, even at the expense of someone's life.\" I find this is speculation on the part of the deponent and give this Affidavit minimal weight.\n[36] With regards to the PC's husband's affidavit,19 I find that it is vague in that it does not describe any of the alleged threats, attacks, and phone calls made against the deponent in any helpful detail. The affidavit was sworn on February 12, 2019, which is the same day that the PC's husband made a police report, as discussed above, which I found to be non-genuine, because it does not mention the alleged February 10th attack in Abuja. Further, the February 12th Affidavit is sworn in Lagos and the February 12, 2019 Police report is made in Abuja. I find it is unlikely, on a balance of probabilities, that the deponent would swear an Affidavit in one city and make a police report in another city, on the same day.\n[37] The claimants disclosed two on-line newspaper articles that discuss circumstances similar to the allegations in this claim, that is, Nigerian families being pursued by violent family members that are determined to track them down and subject their children to FGM.20 I find that there may be cases where this has happened in Nigeria. However, I prefer the documentary evidence discussed above because it explicitly addresses the situation for both educated Nigerians, like the claimants, and less sophisticated Nigerians, and how they typically deal with familial pressure to perform FGM. The two articles disclosed by the claimants describe two isolated cases, which I consider minor in a country of over 200 million people. I accept that families are pressured to perform FGM in Nigeria, by their traditionalist extended family members. In one of the two articles the relatives threatened the following: \"If you refuse to heed our demand ...we will initiate the family rituals and invoke the spirit of our ancestors against you, your wife and daughter, and you know the repercussions.\"21\n[38] Notwithstanding these two articles, I continue to find on a balance of probabilities that educated Christian parents who live in a city, can refuse the practice without being harmed by their relatives. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that an educated Christian family would likely view \"invoking the spirit of the ancestors\" as an empty threat because the repercussions are based on the belief system of the victim, and not on actual physical death threats.\nChildren's Father is not an Agent of Persecution\n[39] Finally, the PC claims that she recently spoke to her husband and he said he is succumbing to the threats being waged by the agents of persecution and he can't stand it anymore. He is, therefore, urging the PC to come home to Nigeria with the children. Counsel, in his submissions, stated that by taking this position, the father in Nigeria has effectively become one of the agents of persecution.\n[40] I find it is unlikely, on a balance of probabilities, that the PC's husband would change his position about his daughters being circumcised, days before the hearing of his family's refugee claim in Canada, and advise the family to return to Nigeria, in order to relieve the alleged pressure he is suffering. Given the description of the father's stance against FGM, as described in the graphic police reports mentioned above, it would be more likely that the father would tell the claimants to remain in Canada, if the threats and danger were increasing.\n[41] Further, since I do not accept the central allegation that the claimants are being violently pursued by family members, it stands to reason that I do not find this allegation credible. That is, I do not accept that the PC's husband is being violently pursued on an ongoing basis. I find that the assertion that the PC's husband, who is the father of the minor claimants, has become an agent of persecution, is an attempt to bolster the claim.\nCONCLUSION\n[42] Based on the analysis above, I conclude that the claimants are not Convention refugees under section 96 of IRPA or persons in need of protection within the meaning of section 97 (1) (a) or (b) of IRPA. Accordingly, I reject their claims.\n(signed)\n\"M. Hayes\"\nM.

I recognize the difficulties faced by the claimant in establishing her claim in this regard. Being aware of the environment of the hearing room, I questioned the claimant with heightened sensitivity and avoided asking for unnecessary detail about the attempted sexual assault. In fact, I did not ask the claimant any direct questions about this allegation.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimant is an 18 year old woman from Saba, Colon, Honduras who alleges that MS-13 wishes for her to become a \"jaina del la mara\" which she alleges means that she will have to engage in sexual activities with all MS-13 members.\n[4] She claims that, in 2016, when she walked by members of MS-13, she would overhear them speaking about her beauty.\n[5] The claimant alleges that on December 31, 2017, she was kidnapped and put in a room with a pad lock overnight. She claims that the members of MS-13 grabbed at her but, when she cried, they were told to stop by their leader.\n[6] The next day, on January 1, 2018, a member of MS-13 let her escape because they had gone to school together. She claims that she ran away and went to stay with her cousin, who also lives in Saba.\n[7] The claimant alleges that, about a week after her kidnapping, she went to live with her aunt in La Ceiba, Atl\u00e1ntida.\n[8] The claimant left Honduras on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018 and took a small bus which went through Guatemala, Mexico and eventually arrived in the United States of America on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018. The claimant alleges that she lived in the United States of America for six months and then entered Canada, making a claim for protection at the port of entry.\nDETERMINATION\n[9] I find that the claimant is not a Convention Refugee as she does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Honduras. Further, I find that she is not a person in need of protection as her removal to Honduras would not subject her, personally, to a risk to life, to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or to a danger of torture.\nISSUES\n[10] There are three issues in this claim:\na. Has the claimant established her identity?\nb. Is there a nexus to the Convention?\nc. Is the claimant a credible witness?\nANALYSIS\nHas the claimant established her identity?\n[11] To establish her identity, the claimant has provided a certified true copy of her Birth Certificate to Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)3 and her Student ID Card4 for one of the schools she went to while she lived, with her aunt, in La Ceiba. The claimant did not provide a Honduran passport because, as she explained, she never had one in the first place and made no efforts to get one from the Honduran Embassy in Ottawa.\n[12] Counsel submitted that the claimant was unable to get a Honduran passport because she did not have a Honduran ID Card5 and, in turn, she was unable to get a Honduran ID Card outside of Honduras.6 I accept this explanation for why the claimant does not have either a Honduran passport or a Honduran ID Card.\n[13] Therefore, I am left with the Honduran Birth Certificate and the claimant's testimony about her identity. I asked the claimant a number of questions about her background. She was consistent with respect to the spelling of her full name, her birth date, her age, where she was born, the spelling of her mother's full name, when her mother passed away, how her mother died, the spelling of her father's full name and his birth date. As Honduran citizenship is acquired by birth,7 and the claimant was born in Honduras and her testimony about her identity was consistent, I find, more likely than not, she is a Honduran citizen.\nIs there a nexus to the Convention?\n[14] The claimant fears MS-13, an international criminal gang that originated in the United States of America and became present in Honduras as a result of deportations. The claimant specifically fears becoming a \"jaina del la mara,\" which, according to the objective documentary evidence, means \"girlfriend.\"8 Therefore, the claimant's fear is based on her gender. I find that the claimant's fear is as a result of being a member of a particular social group based on her gender.\nIs the claimant a credible witness?\n[15] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true, unless there is valid reason to doubt their truthfulness.9 I find that, in this case, the claimant has not provided sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to support her fear of returning to Honduras. I make this finding because: (1) the evidence with respect to the treatment she received from MS-13 prior to her alleged kidnapping was inconsistent; (2) her allegations with respect to her escape were vague, implausible and inconsistent; and (3) I do not find it credible that she would reside in the same small town she was kidnapped from, for about a week after her kidnapping when she had somewhere else to live.\nTreatment from MS-13\n[16] The claimant alleges, in her Narrative, that, when she walked home from school, members of MS-13 would comment about how beautiful she was.10 Likewise, in her testimony she stated that members of the MS-13 would tell her that she looked \"pretty\" and \"hot.\" I asked the claimant whether the MS-13 ever did anything else other than shout out these compliments. The claimant testified that they did not. I asked the claimant to give me examples of things they would say to her. The claimant testified that MS-13 said \"Mommy, how hot you look,\" \"you're so hot\" and \"you're so fine.\" I asked the claimant whether they ever said anything else. The claimant testified they only said things of a sexual nature.\n[17] However, according to her father's notarized letter, he states that, on several occasions, they tried to force her to leave with them, threatening her that, if she did not go with them, they would kill anyone who opposed them.11\n[18] I asked the claimant why her father would write that MS-13 threatened her with death on several occasions when she alleges that they merely catcalled at her. The claimant testified that she did not know why her father would do that but maybe MS-13 told him these things. I do not accept this explanation as there had been no allegation, prior to the claimant's attempt to explain this inconsistency, that anyone in her family had been approached by MS-13, prior to her alleged kidnapping. I find that the claimant presented evidence, from her father, that was intended to embellish her claim. I give this letter no weight to establish the allegations the claimant has made.\nEscape from MS-13\n[19] First of all, the claimant's testimony with respect to her kidnapping was largely a regurgitation of her Narrative. For example, when I asked her, open-endedly, to tell me about her kidnapping, she recited her Narrative, providing little, if any, additional detail. She even continued to deliver her Narrative, after answering my question, reciting things that happened that I did not ask her about. Another example is that when I asked the claimant what the milkman, the man who allegedly picked her up off the side of the road, looked like, she provided a vague description and then continued to regurgitate her Narrative. The claimant's testimony seemed rehearsed and unnatural.\n[20] The claimant alleges that, when she was kidnapped, she was taken to a warehouse and put in a room with no windows and an aluminum door, with a padlock that locked from the outside. She testified that the only thing in the room was a mattress. The claimant alleges that, in the morning, all of the MS-13 members left the warehouse, except for a boy she happened to go to school with, who was in her exact grade. However, she was not friends with this boy, did not have any classes with him, could not tell me who his friends were in school despite the fact that I asked her twice, could not remember when he dropped out of school and testified that she did not know much about him. She claims that she begged this boy to help her and he eventually agreed. The claimant alleges that the boy gave her a wooden chair from the other room, told her to hit him with it and then run away. She claims that this is what she did to escape.\n[21] I asked the claimant how she got the wooden chair. She testified that it was in the living room. I asked her how she would have gotten the wooden chair. She testified that, without help, she would not have been able to. I asked the claimant, given that the wooden chair was in the other room, would it not have been obvious, to the other members of MS-13, that he had helped her escape. The claimant reiterated that she could not have gotten out of there if he had not helped her.\n[22] I find that, because it was both obvious to me and obvious to the claimant that she would have needed help to escape the way she says she did, that it would have been obvious to the members of MS-13 as well.\n[23] Gangs, like MS-13, are reported to usually pursue and kill their own 'traitors,' including those that seriously breach the rules of the gang.12 The family members of these 'traitors' are reportedly sometimes also the object of reprisals.13 The lengths to which gangs are reported to go to pursue perceived traitors is illustrated by the fact that nationals from Honduras who fled abroad because they were perceived as traitors by gangs in Honduras were reportedly killed within days of their repatriation to Honduras.14 Traitorous actions are a death sentence.15\n[24] Given this context, I find it implausible that this boy, who barely knew the claimant, would risk his own death and revenge against his own family, to help her in such a way that would be obvious to anyone that he assisted in her escape.\n[25] Further, the claimant could not really describe her escape from the warehouse. I asked her how she got out of the building. She reiterated that this boy helped her. I asked her how she physically got out. She testified that she hit him with the chair, he stayed and she started running. I asked her where she ran to. She testified that she went out the door. I asked her where the door was. She testified that she was right next to the living room, and then the door was in the living room. I had earlier asked the claimant whether she was taken to a house or a warehouse. She testified that it was a warehouse. So, I asked the claimant about the inconsistency between being held in a warehouse and getting the wooden chair from living room and running through the living room. She explained that it was a warehouse that was like a house.\n[26] I asked the claimant what she saw while she was running away. She testified that she ran and ran. I asked her to describe her surroundings. She testified that there were trees and hills. I asked her how she got to the road. She testified that she ran and ran and ran.\n[27] I find that the claimant's testimony about her escape was vague and it evolved when the inconsistency about being held in a warehouse versus a house was put to her.\n[28] I asked the claimant what she did once she got to the road. The claimant testified that she hid so that, if MS-13 drove by, they would not see her. I asked the claimant whether there were other vehicles driving along the road. She testified that there were a lot of vehicles but they would not stop for her. I asked the claimant whether she tried to get these other vehicles to stop for her. She demonstrated, in the hearing room, that she held out her hand. I asked about this inconsistency, specifically how she was able flag down these vehicles when she was hiding in the bushes. The claimant explained that, when a car came close, she would flag it down. I do not accept this explanation as it does not make practical sense that she would hide in the bushes when there were no vehicles and then go out to the road when one drove by, given that she was afraid of MS-13 driving by her and seeing her.\n[29] To illustrate this, I asked the claimant how she would have known that the particular car she was attempting to flag down did not contain members of MS-13. The claimant explained that she had already seen that they drove a white van as that was the vehicle she was kidnapped in. I asked the claimant what she would have done if they happened to be driving something different. The claimant admitted that she would not have known the vehicle contained members of MS-13. I do not accept that the claimant, or anyone, would think all the members MS-13 drive the particular white van that she was allegedly kidnapped in.\nContinued to Reside in Saba\n[30] Lastly, after her escape, she allegedly remained in Saba for about a week, although she stayed with her cousin. Given that Saba is a fairly small municipality, I asked the claimant why she would continue to live in the same town she was recently kidnapped from. The claimant explained that her cousin had a room she could stay in. I do not accept this explanation because the claimant had previously lived with her aunt in La Ceiba, Atl\u00e1ntida. She lived there from approximately XXXX of 2014 (when her mother passed away) to mid-2016. Therefore, when this kidnapping allegedly occurred, in December of 2016, she had returned to Saba somewhat recently. If the claimant had truly been kidnapped as she alleged, I am not persuaded that she would continue to live in Saba rather than go back to her aunt's home in La Ceiba, immediately. The fact that she claims she remained in Saba after allegedly being kidnapped diminishes the credibility that she was kidnapped at all.\n[31] I find that the claimant's testimony with respect to her escape was vague, inconsistent and implausible. I also find it not to be credible that she would remain living in the same small municipality she was kidnapped from, when she had family, and had recently lived, in the third largest city in Honduras.16 I am not persuaded that she was ever kidnapped. I find that the claimant embellished her claim. And, while I accept that the claimant was likely catcalled by members of MS-13 as she walked home from school, I do not find that this rises to the level of persecution.\n[32] I acknowledge that the claimant's three neighbours have written letters detailing how they assisted the claimant's father in looking for the claimant during her alleged kidnapping.17 Only one of these letters is notarized.18 While I have considered these letters, I find that their weight is diminished by the fact that the claimant's father already provided an embellished letter. Further, I note that the notarized letter from the neighbour was notarized by the exact same notary public as the one who notarized the father's letter and they were done within one day of each other. I give these letters limited weight and find that they do not overcome my credibility concerns detailed above.\n[33] Further the claimant has provided a letter from a counsellor dated March 22, 2019, three days before the first sitting of this hearing.19 This letter states that the claimant is exhibiting symptoms of anxiety and depression. While I have considered this letter, there are a number of problems with it. First of all the claimant testified, on March 25, 2019, that she had seen this counsellor approximately six times; however, the letter states that the counsellor has only seen her once. I asked the claimant about this inconsistency and she did not know the reason for it. The letter also states twice that the claimant is from El Salvador; however, she is from Honduras. I asked the claimant about this inconsistency and she did not know the reason for it. Due to these two inconsistencies, I give this letter no weight. In any event, the letter does not describe any difficulties the claimant may have in testifying before the Refugee Protection Division nor does it explain why the claimant's testimony was vague, inconsistent and implausible.\n[34] I have also considered the fact that the claimant would have been 15 years old, about to turn 16 approximately one month later, when the kidnapping allegedly occurred. I have considered that, in general, children are not able to present evidence with the same degree of precision as adults with respect to context, timing, importance and details.20 However, the claimant was not a young child when this occurred, she was a teenager and she is now an adult. While the claimant may still have been maturing at the time this incident occurred, I find that her age would not have severely impacted her story to the extent of making it inconsistent and implausible.\n[35] Given that (1) the evidence with respect to the treatment the claimant received from MS-13 prior to her alleged kidnapping was inconsistent; (2) her allegations with respect to her escape was vague, implausible and inconsistent; and (3) I do not find it credible that the claimant continue to reside in the same small town she was kidnapped from, I find that the kidnapping did not occur. Therefore, I find that she has not provided sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to support her fear of returning to Honduras.\nCONCLUSION\n[36] I find there is not a serious possibility that the claimant will be persecuted in Honduras, or that, on a balance or probabilities, she will be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if returned to Honduras. Accordingly, her claim for refugee protection is rejected.\n(signed)\n\"M. A. McColl\"\nM. A.

Counsel submitted that natural justice therefore required an adjournment in order for the claimants to be given a fair hearing. In written submissions, counsel also argues that because the most recent NDP for Colombia was incorporated after the claimant's disclosure was received May 13, 2019, it post-dated claimant's disclosure and was therefore only determined that Colombia was an issue after claimant's disclosure was received. Counsel submits that the claimants were taken by surprise and were not given the opportunity to obtain evidence on this issue prior to the hearing.\n[3] The panel declined to grant an adjournment of proceedings in this particular case, even though the NDP was not disclosed prior to the hearing. Although counsel stated in her application that she was unaware that Colombia would be an issue, counsel did refer in her CDT application at the hearing to the relevant NDP documents dealing with Colombian citizenship, which she had printed out in advance of the hearing. It is clear that counsel therefore was aware that Colombian citizenship was a relevant issue for the claim, but takes issue with the fact that the NDP was not disclosed ahead of time.\n[4] Notably, there is a document in the NDP for Venezuela which addresses the issue of Venezuelan nationals obtaining Colombian citizenship in great detail. Indeed, in written submissions counsel primarily refers to the document in the Venezuelan package as it appears more helpful to the claimants' case. Further, the claimants listed their parents' Colombian citizenship on both their BOC and Schedule A forms.3 The claimants' testimony also revealed that they have previously made inquiries into Colombian citizenship. They were represented by counsel and therefore had ample opportunity to prepare for the hearing, including whether they have access to citizenship in Colombia. However, I did allow an extended break during the hearing for counsel to further canvass the issue with the claimants. The claimants were also given the opportunity to provide post-hearing evidence and submissions. Overall, given that the claimants and their counsel were aware that Colombian citizenship could be an issue, and that the Venezuelan NDP already contained the pertinent information with respect to the citizenship issue, I did not grant an adjournment in this case. The claimants were given ample opportunity during the hearing to testify about their fear of returning to Colombia, and counsel submitted a multitude of documents into post-hearing evidence, including an application for voluminous disclosure, which was accepted.4\n[5] The Consolidated List of Documents lists Exhibit 6 as the NDP package for Colombia, dated March 29, 2019. This is incorrect as the version as of the date of the hearing was dated April 30, 2019. The most recent update is from May 31, 2019 and was relied upon by the panel in rendering a decision. In any event, the items in the NDP with respect to Colombian citizenship are identical in all three versions.\nALLEGATIONS\n[6] The following is a brief synopsis of the allegations put forward by the claimants in their Basis of Claim forms (BOC).5 The claimants fear returning to Venezuela because of the political activities of the principal and associate claimants, namely, their membership in the Democratic Action party. They have attended several anti-government demonstrations in Venezuela. After attending a demonstration in July 2017, the claimants were threatened by members of the collectivos. The threats continued for several months until the claimants fled the country to come to Canada in XXXX 2018.\nDETERMINATION\n[7] I find that the claimants are not Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the Act. I also find that they are not persons in need of protection under section 97 of the Act due to a risk to life, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[8] The claimants' identities as nationals of Venezuela have been established through certified copies of their passports on file.6\nCountry of Reference - Colombia\n[9] At the hearing I accepted that the claimants face a forward looking risk in Venezuela based on the documents provided. The determinative issue in this case is therefore whether the claimants have access to citizenship in Colombia, and if so, whether they can safely live in that country. On their immigration forms, the principal claimant stated that her mother was a dual citizen of Colombia and Venezuela, and the associate claimant stated that his father was a citizen of Colombia.\n[10] The relevant citizenship legislation in this case is the Colombian Constitution of 1991, which states the following:\nColombian nationals are:\n1. By birth:\na. The natives [naturales] of Colombia, with one of two conditions: that the father or the mother have been natives or Colombian nationals or that, being children of aliens, any of their parents should have been domiciled in the Republic at the moment of birth.\nb. The children of a Colombian father or mother who have born in a foreign land and later domiciled in Colombian territory or registered in a consular office of the Republic.7\n[11] In Williams,8 the Federal Court stated that a claim for refugee status must be denied if it is within the control of the applicant to acquire citizenship in a country where he or she has no well-founded fear of persecution. Where citizenship in another country is available, a claimant is expected to make attempts to acquire it. The mere unwillingness of a claimant to take the steps necessary to acquire the citizenship is insufficient. In written submissions, counsel correctly notes that a person who is able to obtain citizenship in another country through mere formalities is not entitled to protection in Canada.9 However, contrary to counsel's submissions, in this case, acquiring Colombian citizenship is not something that is out of the claimants' control. There is no evidence that the Colombian government has the discretion to refuse the application for citizenship. The legislation is clear that the principal and associate claimants have acquired citizenship by birth. The minor claimants can access citizenship through their parents.\n[12] The evidence before me states that foreign nationals with a Colombian parent can become a Colombian citizen if the person first obtains a Colombian birth certificate by submitting the relevant paperwork. Once the person has the citizenship card, he or she can start the process to obtain Colombian birth certificates for their foreign born children, who can then also be issued Colombian passports. I therefore find that the process of applying for citizenship involves mere formalities, and the claimants therefore have access to Colombian citizenship that is not out of their control per s.1(a) of the Colombian Constitution.10\n[13] In Tretsetang11, the court further elaborated that if a claimant alleges significant impediments to obtaining citizenship, the claimant must establish on a balance of probabilities that a) there is a significant impediment that prevents a claimant from exercising their citizenship rights, and b) the claimant has made reasonable efforts to overcome such impediments. In this case, the claimants submit that there are significant impediments to them obtaining citizenship.\n[14] The relevant document with respect to Venezuelan Nationals states the following:\n2.1 Exceptions for Venezuelan Nationals Born to a Colombian Parent\nSources indicate that, in order for a Venezuelan national born to a Colombian parent to apply for a Colombian civil birth registration, he or she requires their Venezuelan civil birth registration, which must be legalized (Colombia 16 May 2018a; Senior Attorney 11 May 2018; Lawyer 11 May 2018) in Venezuela (Senior Attorney 11 May 2018; Lawyer 11 May 2018). The website of Venezuela's embassy in Colombia indicates that Venezuelan civil birth registrations, along with marriage, death, and single status certificates, can only be requested from within Venezuela in person or through a representative with a power-of-attorney (Venezuela n.d.). The same source also indicates that Venezuelan documents cannot be legalized in a consulate; they must be legalized in Venezuela by the Ministry of People's Power for Foreign Affairs.12\n[15] Counsel submits that the Colombian authorities can refuse foreign birth registrations if they do not show that a parent is a Colombian national, which is the case for the principal claimant. However, the evidence indicates that the applicant could correct her Venezuelan birth certificate through the use of a power of attorney. The claimants can then obtain a Colombian civil birth registration at offices throughout Colombia; they do not have to return to Venezuela. People who live abroad can apply by mail. Colombian civil registries have indicated that they are overwhelmed by the number of Venezuelans applying for Colombian citizenship, however there is no indication that they have stopped processing applications.\n[16] Both claimants testified that they did some research on attaining Colombian citizenship, but did not take any concrete steps.\nPrincipal Claimant\n[17] The principal claimant's mother has passed away. The claimant testified that she might be able to obtain Colombian citizenship, however it would be a lengthy process as her birth certificate states that the claimant's mother is Venezuelan. She testified that she would have to go back to Venezuela in order to have her own birth certificate altered to reflect that her mother is Colombian. The claimant believes that the Venezuelan government would require her to attend to this personally, and that appointing a representative or power of attorney in Venezuela would not be possible. However, this contradicts the objective evidence noted above, which indicates that the entire process can be done by a legal representative in Venezuela.\n[18] The claimant also raises the fact that she only has a copy of her mother's Colombian ID card. She submits that she does not have \"easy access\" to her mother's original Colombian identity card or passport. However, the claimant has not submitted that this document does not exist, only that it is not in her possession.\n[19] I accept that the principal claimant could face an impediment to obtaining Colombian citizenship if she is unable to obtain the required documents. However, in my view she has made no reasonable efforts to overcome these impediments. She has not enquired at a Colombian consulate in Canada, nor has she made any inquiries into obtaining her mother's original documents. She has not applied to correct her Venezuelan birth certificate. She has not provided a satisfactory explanation as to why she cannot attain her mother's national ID card, particularly as she testified that she has seen the original. Counsel submits that the Colombian authorities will not accept a copy of the card unless it is certified, although provides no support for that allegation. Finally, although the claimant's brother has not acquired Colombian citizenship I have no evidence before me to indicate what steps he has taken to do so. The claimant states that her brother has had problems due to spelling errors on her mother's documentation, however I have no evidence that the claimant herself has made any efforts to overcome this obstacle. Nor has she applied to the Colombian authorities with a copy of her mother's ID and been rejected. Based on the evidence before me, the principal claimant has not demonstrated with sufficient reliable evidence that she has taken reasonable steps to overcome the potential impediments to her application for Colombian citizenship.\nAssociate Claimant\n[20] In terms of the associate claimant, his father is also a Colombian citizen and a resident in Venezuela. The claimant believes that it would also be a difficult process to obtain Colombian citizenship because his father would have to travel to Colombia to do the paperwork, as the Colombian consulate in Venezuela is closed. The claimant then testified that they did research the possibility of obtaining Colombian citizenship, however due to his father's health, he cannot travel into Colombia. The claimant testified that it was his sister who learned that his father would have to travel to Colombia personally.\n[21] The claimant's testimony likewise contradicts the objective evidence, as there is no indication that the Colombian parent has to be physically present in Colombia, particularly if the process can be done by mail or at a consulate abroad. Further, the associate claimant's birth certificate lists his father as Colombian, and so he would not have the additional step of correcting his birth certificate, if that were indeed required. In terms of accessing his father's identification documents, counsel for the claimants states in written submissions that this is out of the claimant's control, because his father is in possession of the documents. According to counsel, it is the claimant's father who controls these documents and there is no evidence that the father consents to the use of his personal information. His father is not likely to assist the claimant in providing those documents for the purposes of obtaining Colombian citizenship because he himself has chosen to remain in Venezuela and therefore would not provide his private documents to the claimant. In counsel's view, because the claimant does not currently have physical \"control\" over the documents, obtaining citizenship in Colombia is therefore out of his control.\n[22] This is an incorrect interpretation of the principles outlined in Williams. Further, the fact that the claimant's father currently has the documents in his possession is not the type of \"significant impediment\" anticipated in Tretsetang. Moreover, the claimant provided no testimony on this point during the hearing, and therefore counsel is providing submissions on evidence which was not before the panel. I therefore find that there are no significant impediments to the associate claimant obtaining Colombian citizenship.\n[23] Overall, the claimants have not taken any steps to overcome the impediments that they allege. Other than speaking to siblings, they have not attempted to attain the correct paperwork. They have not submitted an application for citizenship and had it rejected. At no point has anyone told them that they cannot acquire citizenship, rather, the claimants appear to be simply unwilling to go through the process of obtaining it.\nMinor Claimants\n[24] The claimants also submit that obtaining Colombian citizenship for their children is out of the control of the minor claimants. However, as per s.1(b) of the Colombian Constitution, the minor claimants acquire citizenship once their parents do. I reiterate the evidence above, which states that once the principal or associate claimant has his or her citizenship card, he or she can start the process to obtain Colombian birth certificates for their foreign born children, who can then also be issued Colombian passports. I have already found that the parents in this case have access to Colombian citizenship, and therefore the acquisition of citizenship for the children is a mere formality. Counsel states that because the citizenship of the children is dependent upon the actions of their parents, it is out of their control, however, this is again a misinterpretation of the 'control' test. The adult claimants in this case have an obligation to apply for Colombian citizenship before applying for refugee protection elsewhere. The Colombian government cannot refuse that application, and by law, cannot then refuse the application of the children.\n[25] The evidence before me confirms that Colombian nationality is automatically granted at birth to foreign born children of Colombian parents.13 I find that the principal and associate claimant are Colombian citizens by birth, and that the minor claimants have access to citizenship in Colombia through their parents.\n[26] I therefore find that all claimants in this case have access to Colombian citizenship. I now turn to the claimants' allegations regarding the forward looking risk in Colombia.\nCredibility and Forward looking Risk in Colombia\n[27] The claimants have never lived in Colombia. They assert that they are at risk in that country because Colombian guerrillas are in close contact with the agents of harm in Venezuela. They testified that they would be persecuted in Colombia due to their political activities in Venezuela. When I asked them to elaborate on that allegation, they testified that they signed a document in 2003 or 2004 that was leaked to the Venezuelan government, and that everyone on that list was persecuted. When I asked how this related to their fear in Colombia, they testified that the Venezuelan government would share this information with Colombian guerrillas. They then testified about a Venezuelan opposition leader who went to Colombia, applied for asylum and was deported back to Venezuela. The associate claimant also testified that the Colombian government is a supporter of President Maduro, which would put the claimant at risk. Finally, they testified that one of the principal claimant's relatives was shot and killed in Colombia.\n[28] I find that the claimants are largely speculating with regard to the risk they would face in Colombia. First, the claimants would not be seeking asylum in Colombia, and there would therefore be no risk of them being returned to Venezuela. Second, the claimants were unable to confirm that they had experienced any persecution in Venezuela because of the list they signed. Their answers on this point were vague, evasive, and ultimately revealed that although some people who had signed this list experienced discrimination, for example in not being able to apply for credit, nothing had ever happened personally to them. Third, there is insufficient credible evidence to establish that the resources of the Venezuelan government extend into Colombia, or that Venezuelan authorities have the capacity to harm a person once they have left the country. In fact, the objective evidence states quite the opposite. Colombia was one of many countries, along with the United States, to recognize and support the presidency of opposition leader Juan Guaido and denounce the leadership of President Maduro.14 I give more weight to the objective evidence before me, which contradicts the claimant's allegations with respect to the relationship between the two countries.\n[29] Finally, the principal claimant admitted that she did not know anything about the circumstances of the relative's death, and I therefore have no evidence that this person's death was a targeted killing. I acknowledge that drug trafficking remains a problem in Colombia, and that there may be some collusion between armed groups along the border. Overall the claimants have not provided sufficient credible evidence to establish that the Venezuelan government has a presence in or an influence over the Colombian government, police, or armed groups in Colombia.\n[30] The associate claimant also testified that he speaks with a specific type of accent which would make him stand out in Colombia and put him at risk. The claimants are concerned about the xenophobic attitudes towards Venezuelans in Colombia. Counsel has submitted a document which indicates that there have been discriminatory verbal attacks against Venezuelans in the bigger cities. In particular, Colombians who were born in that country and are returning after having lived in Venezuela are referred to by the derogatory term 'venecos.' The remaining documents submitted by counsel on this point deal with the problems of people born in Colombia returning from Venezuela after a number of years, who are not considered 'original Colombians.' This is not the case of the claimants. I accept that isolated attacks do occur and that there might be some xenophobic attitudes among some members of Colombian society, however, there is insufficient evidence to establish that Venezuelans face repeated discrimination that amounts to persecution on the basis of their nationality.\n[31] The objective evidence before me also contradicts the claimants' allegations. According to the evidence before me, Venezuelans represented approximately 95% of asylum applications in Colombia last year.15 Over 1 million Venezuelans have moved to Colombia over 2017 and 2018. Columbian authorities generally treated Venezuelans arriving in the country with respect, particularly for those who also have Colombian citizenship. In terms of treatment by society, many Colombians are concerned that refugees are taking away jobs.16 There is guerrilla activity along the border, with the ELN in particular involved in drug trafficking to Venezuela, how the motives of this group are not to target Venezuelans coming into the country.17 Counsel submits that the arbitrary nature in which Colombian authorities deported a Venezuelan opposition leader \"demonstrates that there is no rule of law in Colombia.\" However, aside from counsel's bold statement there is no evidence that the Colombian government supports President Maduro or shares information with the Venezuelan government. As the claimants can access citizenship in Colombia they will not be at risk of deportation.\n[32] Overall the claimants' allegations about their fears in Colombia are speculative and amount to fear of risks that are faced generally by all Colombians. The claimants have not established with credible evidence that they would be targeted due to their Venezuelan nationality or the political opinion that put them at risk in Venezuela. Based on the evidence before me, the claimants have not successfully established that they face a serious possibility of persecution in Colombia on the basis of a Convention Ground.\n[33] Similarly, the claimants have not established a claim under section 97 of the Act, that on a balance of probabilities they face a forward looking risk to his life, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture. I accept that there is some guerrilla related violence and instability in many regions of the country, but Section 97(1)(b) requires that a claimant face a personal risk, and not a risk that is faced generally by others in that country. In other words, a claimant must establish that they have been personally targeted in a manner that separates them from the rest of the population. In this case I find that the claimants have not established that they face a personal risk that differs from other citizens in Colombia.\nCONCLUSION\n[34] I find that the claimants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection pursuant to the Act, and the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada therefore rejects their claims.\n(signed)\n\"Kari Schroeder\"\nKari Schroeder\nJune 25, 2019\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibit 6, National Documentation Package (NDP), Colombia, May 31, 2019.\n3 Exhibit 1, Exhibits 2.1-2.4.\n4 Exhibit 8.\n5 Exhibits 2.1-2.4\n6 Exhibit 1.\n7 Exhibit 3, NDP, Venezuela, March 29, 2019, Item 3.7 Response to Information Request (RIR) ZZZ106114.E.\n8 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Williams, 2005 FCA 126.\n9 Exhibit 8.\n10 Exhibit 6, NDP, Item 3.3 RIR COL104814.E.\n11 Tretsetsang v.

The claimants alleged that they were differentially treated, harassed, and discriminated in all aspects of their lives. They were discriminated by the police and did not receive protection.\n[7] The claimant alleged that in 2007, a racist group, \"Gaurda,\" created by the Jobbik party, established their headquarters in their neighbourhood. The claimant alleged that he and his sons were attacked by group of racist men on several occasions. They sustained physical injuries. The claimants alleged that their lives were threatened by the extremist Hungarians.\n[8] The claimants alleged that as Roma, they fear discrimination if they were to return to Hungary. They alleged that their lives would be in danger by the nationalist groups if they were to return.\nNEXUS\n[9] The nexus in these claims is ethnicity, namely, Roma.\nDETERMINATION\n[10] After considering the totality of the evidence and counsel's representations, the panel finds that the claimants are not Convention refugees, as their fear of persecution is not well-founded based on their ethnicity or any Convention grounds in Hungary. As well, they are not in need of protection at the time of the hearing.\nISSUES\n[11] The central issues in these claims is state protection as the original decision of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada was set aside by the Federal Court based on state protection in Hungary. Therefore, the panel will address state protection in Hungary as of 2019.\nIdentity\n[12] Based on the certified true copies of the claimants' Hungarian passports,4 and absent any evidence that the passports are fraudulent or were obtained fraudulently, the panel finds the claimants, on a balance of probabilities, have established their personal identity.\nRoma identity\n[13] The female claimant testified that she is half Roma, as her father was Roma. The claimant declared in his PIF that he is Roma; which he affirmed was true and accurate.5 The panel accepts that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimants are Roma.\nCitizenship of Hungary\n[14] Based on the certified true copies of the claimants' Hungarian passports,6 the panel finds that the claimants, on a balance of probabilities, have established their citizenship of Hungary.\nDoes the female claimant have dual citizenship?\n[15] The female claimant was born in Romania. Her evidence indicates that she fled to Hungary in 1988 during Nicolae Ceausescu's regime and was granted refugee status.7 She testified that she obtained Hungarian citizenship after the Hungarian authorities inquired if she would \"give up\" her Romanian citizenship, which she did.\n[16] The documentary evidence indicates that under Romanian law, Romanian citizens have the right to hold dual nationality.8 At the hearing, the female claimant was unable to provide any documents establishing that she has renounced her Romanian citizenship.\n[17] However, post-hearing, the panel considered Hungarian citizenship law and notes that Hungary has permitted dual citizenship since January 1, 2011. There was no evidence before the panel that the claimant had taken any steps to reclaim her Romanian citizenship. Therefore, the panel concludes that the claimant, at the time of the hearing, had no other citizenship aside from Hungarian citizenship.\n[18] Therefore, the female claimant's claim will be assessed against Hungary, although evidence and representations were made at the hearing regarding Romania.\nCredibility\n[19] The determination, as to whether a claimant's evidence is credible, is made on a balance of probabilities.9 Although statements given under oath are presumed to be true, that presumption can be rebutted by contradictions or inconsistencies in the evidence.10\n[20] The panel took into consideration the various factors that could affect the claimants' oral testimonies, including the setting of the hearing room, the claimants' anxiety, age, cultural differences, the number of years the claimants have been living in Canada, education, the use of an interpreter, and the fact that this case is a legacy case. While not every piece of evidence will be referred to in these reasons, the panel carefully considered the entirety of the evidence in reaching its decision.11\n[21] The panel has reviewed the claimants' evidence with respect to the discrimination they suffered and finds that it is generally internally consistent and inherently plausible with the documentary evidence regarding the country conditions in Hungary, when the claimants left Hungary in 2011. The panel finds the claimants' allegations in relation to harm suffered are credible.\nHistory of past incidents and police protection\n[22] In the circumstances of this case, the claimant alleged the following incidents:\n[23] The claimant alleged that in 2007, he had a lot of problems, verbal and physical, with people of the Hungarian Garda, because he lived approximately 100 metres from their headquarters and it was unavoidable to run into them. On one occasion, he was kicked and beaten by two young men dressed in black. However, he did not report it to the police. He explained he did not do so \"because Roma has no business with the police they don't protect Roma.\" The panel does not find the claimant's explanation as reasonable. It is reasonable for the claimant to have approached the state for protection even if he believed that police did not protect Roma, he needs to demonstrate in the circumstances of his case the police failed to protect him because he was a Roma.\n[24] The claimant alleged that on XXXX XXXX, 2008, at night, he was driving home. As he got out of his car, he was beaten and kicked by four or five members of the Hungarian Garda. He testified that he could not identify them. He did not report it to the police because the police does not protect Roma.\n[25] The claimant testified that on XXXX XXXX, 2008, as he got out of his car upon returning home, he was verbally attacked by the Hungarian Garda saying, \"Death on the Roma people.\"12 He testified that his car was vandalised and the tires were deflated. A neighbour told him that she saw four members of the Hungarian Garda \"look around the car.\"13 However, he did not report the vandalism to the police, though he did so to the insurance company. To recover damages, a police report was not required by the insurance company.14\n[26] On XXXX XXXX, 2008, the claimant's son, XXXX, was attacked because he was Roma by four or five men dressed in black. He sustained injuries and ambulance transported him to the hospital; which, in turn, the police were notified. XXXX was hospitalized for seven or eight days. He was unable to identify his attackers, as he did not know them. The claimant, in his PIF narrative stated that, \"The police department of the 3rd division (in Budapest) worked on his case, but before the closing appointment they cancelled the process against an unknown offender.\"15\n[27] The claimant testified that XXXX travelled to Canada approximately a month after the incident. However, after three months in Canada, he had to return to Hungary because his mother had a heart attack. He has remained in Hungary since. The claimant alleged that XXXX, because he is Roma, has experienced fights and verbal abuse. He is followed when he goes into a shop and he is not allowed in entertainment venues. However, no evidence was provided that XXXX had made any reports or complaints to the police.\n[28] The claimant alleged that on XXXX XXXX, 2011, his son, XXXX, and his friend, XXXX, were attacked in the subway by three men dressed in black. XXXX was held down and stabbed in the leg. XXXX was able to flee and get home. The claimant testified that the incident was not reported to the police, because nothing had been done by the police regarding his son XXXX incident in 2008, and because XXXX was not seriously injured. However, his testimony was inconsistent with his PIF narrative stating that, \"...the mother asked us not to go to the police because, they threatened the two children life-threatening 'if we meet you once again we will kill you!'\"16 When he was asked to explain the inconsistency, the claimant stated that it was not a serious injury and his mother said that she would take him home. The panel finds in the circumstance of this incident the claimant chose not to report the incident to the police based on the nature of the injury to his son's friend.\n[29] The claimant was asked why he did not move from the area, given its close proximity to the Hungarian Garda headquarters and that he could not avoid them. He explained it was difficult to find a rental accommodations for Roma. The panel finds that his explanation is not persuasive. It is not reasonable for the claimant to live in an environment for years that puts him and his family at risk of attack by the Garda. It is reasonable to expect the claimants to take some responsibility to remove themselves from such an environment, by making serious efforts to find alternative housing in Budapest, or elsewhere, despite the difficulty in finding rental accommodations.\n[30] With respect to the incidents the claimants experienced prior to seeking asylum in Canada, the panel notes that the claimants did not seek state protection, explaining that the police did not protect the Roma and that on the one occasion that a report was made to the police, they did not conduct an investigation as the culprits were unknown.\n[31] No state is expected to guarantee perfect protection to all of its citizens at all times, and the fact that the state is not always successful in protecting its citizens is not enough to justify a claim, especially where a state is in effective control of its territory, has military, police and civil authorities in place, and is making serious efforts to protect its citizens. That the state's efforts are not always successful will not rebut the presumption of state protection.17 It should be noted that less-than-perfect protection is not a basis to determine that a state is either unwilling or unable to offer reasonable protection.18\n[32] In this case, the claimants did not report the incidents to the police. Moreover, local failures by authorities to provide protection do not mean that the state as a whole fails to protect its citizens, unless the failures form part of a broader pattern of the state's inability or refusal to provide protection.19 In this case, the claimants were unable to identify the perpetrators. Indeed, if a claimant believes the actions of some police officers are racially motivated, the onus is on them to approach other members of the security forces or authorities, which in this case the claimants did not.\nState protection\n[33] The panel is mindful that the claimants arrived in Canada in 2011, thus, the panel must assess the claim based on the objective evidence before it at the time of the hearing, in this case, in 2019. The panel is mindful of the decision of the Federal Court in Kotai:20\nThe country conditions do not suggest that the situation is so bleak that all Roma, regardless of their particular circumstances, should not be expected to make reasonable efforts to seek state protection before seeking refugee protection in another country.\n[34] Refugee protection is meant to be a form of surrogate protection to be invoked only in those situations where the refugee claimant has unsuccessfully sought the protection of their home state. The onus is on the refugee claimant to approach the state for protection, in situations where state protection might be reasonably forthcoming.21 In the absence of a compelling explanation, a failure to pursue state protection opportunities within the home state will usually be fatal to a refugee claim, at least, where the state is a functioning democracy with a willingness and the apparatus necessary to provide a measure of protection to its citizens.\n[35] The panel acknowledges that anti-Roma violence and harassment are an everyday occurrence for many Roma. However, it is presumed that a state is able and willing to afford protection to its citizens unless it is in a state of complete breakdown.22 This is not the case, as Hungary is a democracy. Though Hungary may have shifted to the right, it still holds free and fair elections, and as a member state of the EU, has accountability beyond its own borders. At times it may not be successful, the protection offered by the state need not be perfect, but it must be adequate.23 Claimants have an even heavier burden, in cases where they come from a 'democratic country.'24\n[36] Where the protective services of the home state has gaps or deficiencies, the fact that the state is not always successful in protecting its citizens is not enough to justify a claim. This is particularly true when the state is in effective control of its territory and has military, police, and civil authorities in place, and is making serious attempts to protect its citizens.25 The panel acknowledges that there are problems with the interaction between police and the Roma community. While some Roma had trouble with police, overall, the objective country evidence indicates that there were no reports of impunity in involving Hungarian security forces.26 There is evidence that Hungary enforces the law against corrupt police. The government took some steps to prosecute and punish officials who committed abuses. Impunity for human rights abuses was not widespread.27\n[37] The panel acknowledges that,\nThe European Roma Rights Centre (ERRC) indicates, in a submission prepared for three Hungarian cases before the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), that it \"survey[ed] recent evidence that the national bodies in Hungary responsible for protecting Roma against violence suffer institutional racism, particularly institutional anti-Gypsyism\".28 [footnotes omitted]\n[38] However, the panel also notes that,29\n[T]he Hungarian Supreme Court established, in a February 2017 judgment, that the local police in Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6spata failed to protect Roma against harassment by extremist groups \"that organized illegal patrols, marching through the Roma rows of the village for several weeks, intimidating local residents\" in the spring of 2011. According to the HCLU, in its February 2017 judgment, the Supreme Court of Hungary \"ruled that the failure to protect the Roma from racist harassment amounted to harassment under the [Equal Treatment Act]. [footnotes omitted]\n[39] The panel finds this demonstrates the government's actions of operational improvement. Furthermore, the government has implemented programs that provide hate crime training for \"police, courts and prosecutors\" and also provide legal assistance and support to victims of hate crime,30 as well as to involve Roma in the state's security apparatus and to encourage young Roma to join their ranks.31 The panel also notes the authorities had some success in curtailing abuse by the police by increasing the recruitment of Roma police officers, providing training in human rights, and filling complaints against misbehaviour of the police.\nAn April, 2014 article posted by the US Department of State reports that the Fraternal Association of European Roma Law Enforcement Officers (FAERLEO) was co-founded in 2006 by Gy\u00f6rgy Makula, a police major and Deputy Head of the Communication Service of the Hungarian National Police Headquarters. Quoting Makula, the article states that\n\"FAERLEO aims to promote equal opportunities in the law enforcement agencies of Hungary and other EU member states, reduce mutual prejudices between law enforcement agencies and Roma communities, increase the number of Roma staff at law enforcement agencies, and improve the lives and service conditions of current Roma staff members. To achieve these goals, FAERLEO has international, national and regional initiatives.\" For example, FAERLEO is implementing a project titled the \"Roma Law Enforcement Community Tour,\" which is supported by the U.S. Embassy, as well as the British and Norwegian Embassies and the Hungarian police.32 [footnotes omitted]\n[40] The panel acknowledges that according to documentary evidence noted above, anti-Roma prejudice is present among police officers in Hungary, and Roma are subject to ethnic profiling by the police. Roma were disproportionately penalised by the police for petty offences.\n[41] The panel also notes that Hungary has taken serious steps to improve the Roma situation. According to the Council of Europe report, Hungary has continued its vigorous efforts to develop policies designed to protect national minorities.33 The new Fundamental Law (Constitution) adopted in 2011 enumerates a broad catalogue of rights of persons belonging to national minorities (in Hungarian terminology: \"nationalities\"). Detailed provisions defining the rights of national minorities are contained in ordinary legislation, such as the Cardinal Act on the Rights of Nationalities, the Act on the Election of Members of Parliament and the Act on Electoral Procedure, the Act on National Public Education and the Act on National Tertiary Education, adopted in 2011-2013. In spite of the good intentions, these rapid changes have resulted in some minority organisations experiencing insecurities with their implementation.\n[42] According to the 2014 article written by Gy\u00f6rgy Makula,34\n[he served as a] Roma liaison officer to act as a point of contact between the police and the Roma [c]ommunity. Sometimes Roma fear speaking to the police or distrust them, because of previous ill treatment or discrimination, so having someone who understands their background and identity can help them to feel more comfortable. In addition, for other Hungarians, they can use our liaison officers to better understand Roma and acknowledge why certain problems may be occurring. (Open Society Foundations 3 June 2014)\n[43] However, the situation has improved for Roma individuals since 2013.35 Since that time, important changes have been made with respect to state protection for Roma individuals:36\nA specialised unit was set up by the police on hate crime, which provides support and legal assistance. In addition, one officer in every county (there are 20 including Budapest) is now specialised in hate-motivated crime. Training sessions have been organised with the help of NGOs, focusing on the identification of evidence, awareness raising, and support to victims. Police now monitor files in cases of violence, and can re-qualify an offence if any hate motivation is suspected. Officers have good contacts with civil society, including Roma organisations. This is seen as a very positive development, and the police have been commended by numerous NGOs. Furthermore, since the Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6spata incident (where the Supreme Court ruled that local police in Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6spata had discriminated against the local Romani community in 2011 by failing to protect them against harassment by extremist groups), the police constantly monitor areas at risk of conflict. Anti-terrorism authorities also monitor the communications and activities of paramilitary groups.\n[44] In Mudrak,37 Mr. Justice Annis states that:\nMore substantively, suggesting that police oversight agencies have no role in demonstrating adequate state protection is like saying senior policing management has no role in policing due to their oversight function, or saying that policing is a short-term operational exercise. Similarly, denying oversight agencies an important role in police protection would suggest that the police complaints process, and thereafter the courts in Canada, have no responsibility in ensuring adequate policing. This is surely an unsustainable proposition. It is no counter-argument that Canadian police are more responsive to complaints about their conduct, which in some recent instances at least, might be challenged. The point is that the evidence in the Hungarian Roma persecution claims indicates that the oversight agencies are diligent in their investigations and in reporting their findings to the police. The transparency and accompanying public criticism of the state protection apparatus is an important ingredient to reforms and improvement in protection services accorded to Roma citizens.\nThe requirement to access police oversight agencies is particularly important where the persecution is in the form of random incidents, such as is normally the case for members of the Roma community. Adequate state protection against random crime must operate at a community level over a longer time frame, because responding to any particular victim cannot assure that future random attacks from other assailants will not occur. To the extent that random criminal conduct can be prevented by means other than increased patrols, effective policing can have a deterrent effect by arresting and successfully prosecuting wrongdoers accompanied by the declaratory publicity attached to successful convictions.\nThus, looking ahead, no crime prevention process can be effective if victims of crime do not report incidents to the police and proactively cooperate in their investigations, including complaining if not satisfied with the efforts of the police. If the rhetorical question is whether all members of the Roma community will be better protected from a rule requiring they follow up instances of inadequate policing with oversight agencies, I would argue, yes it would.\n[45] The panel finds that the protection afforded to the claimants prior to coming to Canada, in the circumstances of their case, was adequate, although it did not meet the claimants' expectations. On the occasion the claimant approached the police, reports were taken. However, the police were unable to carry on an investigation due to the fact that the culprits were unknown. The panel finds that the protection offered by the state, in these circumstances, may not have been perfect, however, absent sufficient evidence to carry out an investigation, it was adequate and operationally effective.38\n[46] In the case at hand, the state is not the agent of persecution. There are no allegations of police brutality or impunity before the panel. However, the claimants were not satisfied with the responses they received from the police. In addition, the state has acknowledged the mandate of the police is to provide protection by also providing a means through which to address breaches on the part of the police. Complaints against police may also be brought through the Prosecutorial Investigation Office, which meets the threshold for criminal liability.39\n[47] In Jarada,40 Justice Yves de Montigny held that,\n[T]he assessment of the applicant's potential risk of being persecuted if he were sent back to his country must be individualized. The fact that the documentary evidence shows that the human rights situation in a country is problematic does not necessarily mean there is a risk to a given individual.\n[48] In Jean,41 Justice Shore also addressed the need for personalized risk, stating at paragraph 33:\nAn applicant must establish that there is a personalized risk based on his or her personal circumstances, which was not done in this case: the applicants did not show that their particular situation would cause a personalized risk, and the documentary evidence does not support their allegations.\n[49] The panel concludes that should the claimants face any violence on return, the documentary evidence noted below indicates programs that came into effect after the claimants left Hungary. It indicates that police arrest and prosecute the perpetrators of crimes, including crimes committed against Roma and other ethnic minorities and their property. In fact, the courts have become involved in cases where the police have failed to exercise their discretion. In this case, the panel finds, the government's efforts to have \"actually translated into adequate state protection\" at the operational level.42\n[50] In January, the ECHR ruled that police failed to provide adequate protection to two Romani individuals who were attacked with stones and bottles during a demonstration by Jobbik and paramilitary groups in Devecser in 2012, or to conduct a proper investigation of the incident.\n[51] In February, the Supreme Court ruled that local police in Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6spata had discriminated against the local Romani community in 2011, by failing to protect them against harassment by extremist groups.43\n[52] If the claimants were ever dissatisfied with the response of the authorities to any complaint, there is recourse through the Independent Police Complaints Board (IPCB), which investigates violations and omissions by the police.44\n[53] Sources also confirm that \"there are legal aid services available in Hungary to 'indigent persons with legal problems, which may also include the violation of the right of equal treatment'.\"45 These services can also be of use in the police complaints process.\nCONCLUSION\n[54] The panel finds that there is less than a mere possibility that the claimants will be persecuted, if they were to return to Hungary, pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA,46 on a Convention ground, ethnicity.\n[55] No evidence was presented that the claimants face a particularized risk of harm in accordance with section 97(1) of the IRPA. Further, on a balance of probabilities, their removal to Hungary will not subject them to a risk to life, to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or to a danger of torture pursuant to section 97(1) of the IRPA.47\nDECISION\n[56] For these reasons, the panel finds the claimants, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.\n[57] Their claims are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Fahimeh Mortazavi\"\nFahimeh Mortazavi\nSeptember 5, 2019\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), S.C. 2001, c.27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1)\n2 Refugee Protection Division Rules, SOR\/2012-256.\n3 Exhibit 2, Personal Information Form (PIF) - TB1-04879, received April 26, 2011; Exhibit 3, PIF - TB1-04880, received April 26, 2011.\n4 Exhibit 1, Package of information from the referring CBSA\/CIC.\n5 Exhibit 2, PIF - TB1-04879, at q. 1(g).\n6 Exhibit 1, Package of information from the referring CBSA\/CIC.\n7 Exhibit 1, Package of information from the referring CBSA\/CIC, Claim for Refugee Protection in Canada - 64444856, q.33.\n8 Exhibit 12, XXXX XXXX\/Dual Citizenship.\n9 Orelien, Joseph v.

Although initially the P.C.'s husband paid the war tax, when the amount increased, he could no longer afford to pay. On XXXX XXXX, 1999, he was brutally killed by the FARC.\n[4] Following her husband's death, the P.C. alleges that the FARC went after her to pay the tax by the end of March 2000, failing which she would lose another member of her family.\n[5] As a result, the claimants went to the United States (US), from 2000 until 2012, during which time, they had no status.\nAddendum\n[6] The P.C. states that she and her husband moved to XXXX, but the FARC located him at his new business location within a few weeks, and continued to demand payment from them.3 They then moved back to XXXX at the end of XXXX 1999, and her husband returned to the same XXXX where he had begun his career. After her husband was killed by FARC, she learned that her brother, XXXX, had become a target of the FARC.\n[7] The P.C. indicates that approximately four days after her husband was murdered, she was told that she was now responsible for paying the vacuna. The P.C. arranged to leave Colombia and go to the US via Mexico on XXXX XXXX, 2000. She settled with her family in Los Angeles, and began working as a XXXX. According to the P.C., it never occurred to her to attempt to obtain legal status in there. The P.C.'s brother, XXXX, joined them, and she later learned that the FARC had killed their cousin, XXXX, on XXXX XXXX, 2011. In May 2012, the P.C.'s brother, XXXX, filed a successful refuge claim in Canada.\nIDENTITY\n[8] The claimants' identities as citizens of Colombia have been established by their testimony and the personal documents filed, including their passports.4\nDETERMINATIVE ISSUES\n[9] The determinative issues are credibility, subjective fear (failure to claim in the US), change of circumstances, and internal flight alternative (IFA).\nMINISTERIAL INTERVENTION\n[10] The Minister intervened pursuant to Article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention, for having committed a serious non-political crime in the US before being admitted to Canada.5 Article 1F(b) reads as follows:\nThe provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:\n...\n(b) [s]he has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his (her) admission to that country as a refugee...6\n[11] The Minister submits the following. The claimants entered Canada sometime on XXXX XXXX 2012. The P.C., XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, is wanted in the US. On XXXX XXXX, 2001, the P.C. was arrested under the alias XXXX XXXX. She was charged with shoplifting $XXXX XXXX XXXX from the XXXX XXXX XXXX. On that day, XXXX XXXX, 2001, $XXXX XXXX XXXX US was worth $XXXX XXXX XXXX Canadian. Therefore, if the P.C. committed a similar offence in Canada, she would be in contravention of section 334(a) of the Criminal Code (theft over $5,000), and be liable to up to ten years imprisonment.7\n[12] The claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, was arrested and convicted in 2010 for burglary and petty theft. Further, in 2011, the claimant was convicted of similar offences. While these convictions do not meet the bar for exclusion, it is the Minister's submission that someone in genuine fear of return to their country of citizenship, would not engage in such recidivist criminal behaviour in his country of potential refuge.\n[13] Furthermore, the Minister submits that all three claimants lived in the US for 12 years, without status, and at no time sought legal protection from authorities in the country.\n[14] The burden is on the Minister to establish that there are serious reasons to believe that the appellant has committed a serious non-political crime before he entered Canada. A serious reason is less than a balance of probabilities, but more than a mere suspicion.8 Under this standard, there must be an objective basis for findings, one that rests on credible and compelling information. The standard of proof for establishing serious reasons for considering that the claimant has committed a serious non-political crime in the US, prior to her admission to Canada, is more than a mere suspicion but less than a balance of probabilities.\n[15] The Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) stated that the standard of proof is above mere suspicion and is akin to believing, and the outcome of any one particular case will depend on the facts of the case.9 Moreover, the exclusion clause does not depend on whether a claimant has been charged or convicted of the acts set out in the Convention.10\n[16] According to the FCA in Chan, \"a serious non-political crime is to be equated with one in which a maximum sentence of ten years or more could have been imposed had the crime been committed in Canada.\"11\n[17] The Minister submits that the P.C. committed the crime of grand theft (California Penal Code 487), and burglary (California Penal Code 459) in the US,12 prior to coming to Canada. Had the P.C. committed a similar act in Canada, it would be contrary to section 334(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada. In Jayasekara the Court of Appeal articulated factors for the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) to consider in determining whether a crime is serious: \"the elements of the crime, the mode of prosecution, the penalty prescribed, the facts and the mitigating and aggravating circumstances underlying the conviction.\"13\nElements of the crime\n[18] According to the Minister, the P.C. is wanted by the police in the US. She was arrested under an alias, XXXX XXXX, on XXXX XXXX, 2001, and she was charged with grand theft and burglary for stealing clothing from a store worth $XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX US. The value in Canadian dollars on the date she was charged was $XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\nModes of prosecution and penalty prescribed\n[19] The equivalent sections of the Canadian criminal Code are:\nTheft\n322(1) Every one commits theft who fraudulently and without colour of right takes, or fraudulently and without colour of right converts to his use or to the use of another person, anything, whether animate or inanimate, with intent\n(a) to deprive, temporarily or absolutely, the owner of it, or a person who has a special property or interest in it, of the thing or of his property or interest in it;14\n[20] The punishment for theft according to the Canadian criminal Code is:\n334 Except where otherwise provided by law, every one who commits theft\n(a) is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, where the property stolen is a testamentary instrument or the value of threat is stolen exceeds five thousand dollars;15\n[21] It is further submitted by the Minister that there remains an outstanding, active, statewide warrant from the XXXX California Police in the amount of $XXXX XXXX XXXX for the claimant.16 The P.C.'s failure to comply with her sentence is comparable to a contravention of section 145 of the Canadian Criminal Code, which deals with persons who have escaped, or are at large without an excuse:\n145 (1) Every person is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than two years or is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction who\n(a) escapes from lawful custody, or\n(b) is, before the expiration of a term of imprisonment to which he was sentenced, at large in or out of Canada without lawful excuse.17\nCONCLUSION\n[22] The panel finds that while not condoning the behaviour of the P.C. and her son, it has considered the facts of this case, along with the factors considered in both Ezekola and Febles.\n[23] At the outset of the hearing, the panel stated that it would not be excluding the P.C. pursuant to Article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention. After careful consideration, it finds that the P.C. has not committed a sufficiently serious crime to exclude her from putting forth her claim, based on the merits of this claim.\n[24] The panel finds that it is an error to consider exclusion based on the currency exchange, which then makes it a theft over 5,000, when in fact it was theft under, in that the value of the goods was less then $5,000. In other words, the panel finds that a straight currency exchange would not provide an adequate comparison. The Canadian Criminal Code reads:\n334 Except where otherwise provided by law, every one who commits theft\n(a) is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, where the property stolen is a testamentary instrument or the value of what is stolen exceeds five thousand dollars; or\n(b) is guilty\n(i) of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or\n(ii) of an offence punishable on summary conviction,\nwhere the value of what is stolen does not exceed five thousand dollars.18 [emphasis added]\n[25] The panel finds that the foregoing section of the criminal code would be more appropriately applied, thus finding that it does not meet the criteria of Article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention.\n[26] Having said this, the panel has examined the credibility of the P.C. while she was residing in the US, and the circumstances of her criminality, as if affects her credibility.\nDETERMINATIVE ISSUES\n[27] The remaining issues are credibility, the claimant's residency in the US for a period of 12 years, change of circumstances in Colombia, along with the availability of an IFA, and counsel's submissions with respect to the Board's delay in conducting the hearing and compelling reasons pursuant to section 108(4) of the IRPA.\nDelay in claiming\n[28] The claimants arrived in the US illegally in 2000 and remained there until 2012, without status. Moreover, at no time did they inquire as to how to normalize their status. More importantly, they did not make a refugee claim or make inquiries if that was a possibility given their fears of returning to Colombia.\n[29] When asked why she would risk deportation to the very country from which she had fled, the P.C.'s response was that she did this out of fear. Counsel submits that fear is a valid reason, as well as the proximity of California to Mexico, where so many illegal migrants have been residing. With respect, the panel disagrees.\nEgregious delay\n[30] The panel finds that this aspect of the P.C.'s conduct is inconsistent with a person living in fear of persecution in their country. It is to be expected that genuine Convention refugees would seek protection as soon as is practical, once out of reach of their oppressors. The panel is mindful, then, that one of the significant factors which speaks to subjective fear and credibility is the element of delay. Delay, in and of itself, is not normally a decisive factor in refugee determination.19 However, it can be relevant and a potentially important consideration to the panel, where the claimant has delayed in making a claim and failed to offer a reasonable explanation for the delay.20 In certain circumstances, however, delay can be a determinative and decisive factor.21 In the case at hand, given the egregious nature of the delay, the panel draws an adverse inference, and finds, as a result of that delay, that the P.C.'s credibility is seriously undermined. This is particularly significant, given the length of time these claimants were out of status and risking deportation. Moreover, to have not even made inquiries, and then be involved in criminal activity (both the P.C. and her son), further damages the claimants' credibility.\nCredibility\n[31] In considering credibility, the panel is aware of the difficulties that may be faced by the P.C. in establishing her claim, namely, the setting of the hearing room, and the stress inherent in responding to questions.\n[32] In deciding the claim, the panel has considered the Chairperson's Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution,22 and Guideline 3: Child Refugee Claimants: Procedural and Evidentiary Issues.23 In rendering the decision, the panel has carefully reviewed the considerations in the frameworks of analysis as set forth in these guidelines, as they relate to matters of weight and credibility of their evidence.\n[33] In Maldonado, it was held that \"[w]hen a claimant swears to the truth of his or her allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there be reason to doubt their truthfulness.\"24 While statements given under oath are presumed to be true, that presumption can be rebutted by contradictions or inconsistencies in the evidence.25 In reviewing the evidence, the panel \"may also conclude that a claimant's evidence is implausible, or improbable, or dubious, or untenable, or unreliable, or absurd, or unconvincing.\"26 The panel \"also is entitled, in assessing credibility, to rely on criteria such as rationality and common sense.\"27 The determination as to whether a claimant's evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities.28\n[34] The P.C. testified that she was unable to provide any original documents, as she lost them. However, in response to her counsel, she said that she does not remember how she obtained the originals. Although the panel has accepted that the P.C.'s husband was murdered, it is difficult to assess all of the evidence in the absence of original documents. In considering the P.C.'s credibility, the panel notes that she has completed high school. In response to the panel, she acknowledged that both she and her children worked illegally in the US; the P.C. doing XXXX, and the children working for friends.\n[35] There was much questioning surrounding the P.C.'s criminality, as stated above, not for the purpose of exclusion, but rather for the purpose of credibility. The panel found the P.C.'s testimony surrounding her court appearance after being caught stealing clothes, to be vague and implausible, given that she provided an alias and was allegedly released after sentencing, without being asked to provide any identification. Counsel submits that given the number of illegal migrants in California, it is plausible that the authorities would not have checked the P.C.'s immigration status. While this is possible, the panel finds that it is implausible that the courts would not have asked for proof of her identity, given that she was asked to appear on a certain date, which she failed to do. She testified that they didn't ask anything, including her contact information. Moreover, she believed that the value of goods stolen was around six or seven hundred dollars when, in fact, it was slightly less than $5,000. Moreover, she was unsure if she was sentenced to one, two, or three months.\n[36] After much questioning, it was determined that it was not the P.C. who had placed the stolen items in a bag, but that she was being paid a mere $50.00 to hold the bag for a co-accused. The panel finds that this contradicts the testimony from the initial hearing, but more importantly, begs the question as to why the P.C. would risk deportation over a mere $50. In fact, in response to the panel, the P.C. acknowledged that she received an order to be deported, but she had also lost this documentation.\n[37] There was also contradictory evidence with respect to who had apprehended the P.C. Initially she stated that the police came to the woman's car, but when confronted with previous evidence that it was a security guard, she acknowledged that she had forgotten this. Further, there was contradictory evidence with respect to whether or not the P.C. was aware of the identity of the co-accused, and whether or not she was apprehended.\n[38] The P.C. was asked why she came to Canada. She responded that it was on the advice of her brother, who told her that she could obtain refugee status here. Yet, she maintained that she had never inquired as to the possibility of making a refugee claim in the US.\n[39] Although not determinative, the panel found the P.C.'s testimony to be vague and sufficiently lacking in credibility, to doubt some of her assertions. Nevertheless, the panel is required to examine and make a determination on the merits of this claim.\nChange of circumstances\n[40] The panel finds that one determinative issue is the change of circumstances in Colombia insofar as FARC and the signing of the Colombian Peace Process is concerned. The question raised by this claim is not whether the P.C. had reasons to fear persecution from FARC in the past, which the panel accepts she did given that her husband was brutally murdered for not acceding to the FARC's demands, and following his death, she became a target. Rather, the question is whether she now, at the time the claim is being decided, has good grounds to fear persecution in the future.29 That same test is applied in cases where there have been changes in country conditions: the onus does not shift in such cases, nor does the standard of proof which the claimant is required to meet differ.30 As in all other refugee claims heard by the RPD, the test of well-foundedness in Adjei31 applies to claims involving an assessment of changed or changing country conditions.32\n[41] In Yusuf, the Court explicitly rejected the notion that there is a separate legal test by which the changed circumstances must be measured. Justice Hugessen stated for the Court:\n... the issue of so-called \"changed circumstances\" seems to be in danger of being elevated, wrongly in our view, into a question of law when it is, at bottom, simply one of fact. A change in the political situation in a claimant's country of origin is only relevant if it may help in determining whether or not there is, at the date of the hearing, a reasonable and objectively foreseeable possibility that the claimant will be persecuted in the event of return there. That is an issue for factual determination and there is no separate legal \"test\" by which any alleged change in circumstances must be measured. The use of words such as \"meaningful\", \"effective\" or \"durable\" is only helpful if one keeps clearly in mind that the only question, and therefore the only test, is that derived from the definition of Convention Refugee in s. 2 of the [Immigration] Act: does the claimant now have a well-founded fear of persecution?33\n[42] In the subsequent decision of the Court of Appeal in Rahman, Justice Robertson:\nThis Court has previously held in Yusuf ... that the issue of \"changed circumstances\" is essentially one of fact. Indeed, what is important is not so much the change as the actual circumstances existing in the claimant's country of origin. The question is whether those circumstances support the claimant's alleged well-founded fear of persecution.34\n[43] The panel reviewed the information contained in the National Documentation Package (NDP) on Colombia regarding the most significant developments surrounding the conclusion of a peace deal.35 The facts of this deal are not in dispute. The restoration of peace between the Government of Colombia and FARC began in 2012, and a final agreement was reached in August 2016 - more than three-and-a-half years after the claimant arrived in Canada. The October 2016 referendum to ratify the deal was unsuccessful, but the Government and FARC signed a revised peace deal in November and sent it to Congress for ratification instead of conducting a second referendum. Both houses of Congress ratified the revised peace accord on November 29-30, 2016, marking an end to the conflict. The US Department of State report for Colombia for 2016 addresses the recent, but not the most current and up-to-date situation of FARC:\nColombia is a constitutional, multiparty republic. In June 2014 voters re-elected Juan Manuel Santos president in elections that observers considered free and fair. On August 24, the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the country's largest guerrilla insurgency group, reached agreement on a final peace accord covering rural reform; political participation; illicit drugs; victims (including transitional justice); end of conflict; and implementation, verification, and public approval. The parties signed the accord September 26. In an October 2 plebiscite, however, the public narrowly rejected the agreement, resulting in the initiation of an inclusive national dialogue aimed at reaching a revised accord. The government and the FARC announced November 12 a revised peace accord, which drew from a national dialogue convoked by President Juan Manuel Santos following the October 2 vote. The Colombian congress approved the revised peace accord November 30.36\n[44] The report also states that \"[c]ivilian authorities generally maintained effective control over security forces.\"37 The panel is also aware that, at the time of the peace negotiations with the FARC, \"...illegal armed groups - including the National Liberation Army (ELN), as well as organized crime groups... continued to commit numerous human rights abuses...\"38 However, the panel understood plainly from the P.C.'s written evidence and her oral testimony that her fear is of unknown members of FARC, and not of other groups.\n[45] The panel has considered the documentation from counsel from the internet and various news articles.39 While these articles indicate that the peace agreement may not be holding as it should, the panel finds that the reliable evidence from the Board's NDP, nevertheless, does not indicate that the Peace Agreement has fallen apart.\n[46] The panel has reviewed the information before it and finds that the change of circumstances is durable and has led to substantive and measurable changes in the nature of Colombian politics, and by extension, a way forward for the country after decades of conflict.\nDelay in processing the claims\n[47] Counsel argues that the Board's delay has contributed to the foregoing change of circumstances, and that had the claims been determined in a more timely fashion, the outcome would have been different.\n[48] In Bernataviciute, the Federal Court dealt with arguments that legacy backlog delays either infringed the claimant's s. 7 Charter rights, or constituted an abuse of process, such that the claim should be granted. The relevant paragraphs follow:\nFinally, with respect to refugee claims specifically, the Federal Court of Appeal warned in Akthar that unreasonable delay will \"rarely, if ever, be successfully accepted as a ground of review\". It has also explained that a claim that delay has resulted in a Charter breach must \"be supported either by evidence or at the very least by some inference from the surrounding circumstances that the claimant has in fact suffered prejudice or unfairness because of the delay.\" A claimant must produce actual proof, and not simply rely on assertions...\nAbuse of process is a common law principle typically invoked to stay proceedings. As the Supreme Court in Blencoe noted, an abuse of process has been characterized as \"a process tainted to such a degree that it amounts to one of the clearest of cases\" and cases of this nature will be \"extremely rare\". The Court further found that there must be more than merely a lengthy delay to establish an abuse of process; \"the delay must have caused actual prejudice of such magnitude that the public's sense of decency and fairness is affected\"...\n...\nIn the case at bar to support her claim, the Applicant had the onus of demonstrating with persuasive evidence that the delay resulted in a Charter breach, or at the very least by some inference from the surrounding circumstances that she in fact suffered prejudice or unfairness because of the delay... The Applicant has not provided any evidence of prejudice caused to her by the delay.\nWhile a six-year delay may appear significant, I have no evidence that the delay in this case is \"inordinate\" in the sense of offending the community's sense of fairness... Indeed, this Court has deemed much more significant delays, including a delay of eleven years as not reaching the threshold of abuse of process because the applicant failed to provide sufficient proof of significant prejudice resulting directly from the delay... The Applicant having failed to demonstrate that she has suffered a prejudice from this delay, it is not for the Court to speculate on the prejudice to the Applicant...\n...\nI think that allegations of prejudice caused by delay in determining refugee status to obtain permanent Canadian residency status are somewhat hypocritical. It is generally recognized that the longer a failed refugee claimant can reside in Canada, the better the chances for successful recourse to some collateral means to obtain permanent residency, particularly based on a humanitarian and compassionate application.40 [footnotes omitted]\n[49] Given the foregoing Federal Court jurisprudence, the panel finds that allegations of prejudice do not apply to these claimants.\nInternal flight alternative (IFA)\nThe claimant has a viable IFA\n[50] While assessing a claim for refugee status, the panel must consider the viability of an IFA. After assessing the P.C.'s particular circumstances, the panel concludes that she has a viable IFA in the city of Cartagena or Medellin. The legal test for establishing the viability of an IFA requires a two-fold analysis.\nNo persecution or harm in the proposed IFA - Cartagena or Medellin.\n[51] For the first prong of the IFA test, the claimants must demonstrate that they have a well-founded fear of persecution or, on the balance of probabilities, that they face harm in the proposed IFA.41 In the present case, the panel finds that the P.C. has not established that she faces a serious possibility of persecution, or a likelihood of harm upon relocation to either the cities of Cartagena or Medellin.\n[52] The claimant has been absent from Colombia for eighteen years following her last alleged interaction with the FARC. The agents of persecution are unknown individuals, purportedly members of the FARC. The P.C.'s allegations do not mention any further efforts by the FARC to threaten her during this time. In the panel's view, the P.C. has not established, on a balance of probabilities, that the FARC have maintained sufficient interest to pursue her and her children in either of the named IFAs.\n[53] The P.C. testified that she remains fearful of the FARC. When asked if she was aware of the 2016 Peace Agreement, the P.C. responded that the FARC will always be there.\n[54] The panel concludes that there is insufficient evidence to persuade this panel that there is a serious risk that the P.C. and her children would be targeted in either of the named IFA's.\nRelocation to the proposed IFAs is reasonable\n[55] For the second prong of the IFA test, claimants must establish that relocation to the proposed IFA would be unreasonable such that their life and safety would be jeopardized.42 According to case law, the threshold is high for determining whether an IFA is unreasonable,43 and the particular situation of a claimant must be considered according to an objective test.44 In the present case, the panel finds that relocation to Cartagena or Medellin would not be unreasonable for the claimants\n[56] The P.C. testified that she would not be able to obtain employment, given her age, which is 52. The panel finds that there was insufficient evidence to persuade it that at age 52, with a high school education, this would preclude obtaining employment. The P.C. and her children were able to find and maintain employment for most of their lengthy stay in the US. In the panel's view, the claimants would not have difficulty meeting their basic needs upon relocation to either Cartagena or Medellin.\n[57] The children who are now mature adults both testified. The daughter has completed three years of college in XXXX XXXX XXXX worked as a XXXX XXXX in the US, and is currently working for the XXXX XXXX XXXX in the area of XXXX. Her brother is apprenticing to be an XXXX. They maintain that they cannot return to Colombia as they left there at a young age. They pleaded with the panel that they would be considered old to begin a career in Colombia and that with their credentials, they would have no potential in Colombia. The panel finds that no corroborative evidence was submitted to support this assertion. However, they do speak Spanish, and do so on a daily basis, as their mother does not speak English. The P.C. also testified that her children are too old to obtain employment. Again, the panel has insufficient evidence before it to support the children's submissions.\n[58] The panel has carefully considered the foregoing, but does not find, given the high threshold, that returning to Colombia would present an undue hardship such that it would be unreasonable for them to relocate in either Cartagena or Medellin.\nCompelling reasons)\n[59] Section 108(1) of the IRPA reads:\n(1) A claim for refugee protection shall be rejected, and a person is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, in any of the following circumstances:\n...\n(4) Paragraph (1)(e) does not apply to a person who establishes that there are compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution, torture, treatment or punishment for refusing to avail themselves of the protection of the country which they left, or outside of which they remained, due to such previous persecution, torture, treatment or punishment.45\n[60] The Federal Court has established the following:\nFor the board to embark on a compelling reasons analysis, it must first find that there was a valid refugee (or protected Person) claim and that the reasons for the claim have ceased to exist (due to changed country conditions). It is only then that the Board should consider whether the nature of the claimant's experiences in the former country were so appalling that he or she should not be expected to return and put himself or herself under the protection of that state.46\n[61] The panel has considered the compelling reasons test given by Justice Martineau in Suleiman, wherein Justice Martineau adopts James Hathaway's description of the humanitarian rationale behind the compelling reasons exception.47 It can be argued that Justice Martineau recognizes the deep and lasting impact that persecution can have on a refugee claimant, and it allows asylum to those who would be re-traumatized upon return. It is argued that the focus on subjective trauma is consistent with the compelling reasons exception, which affords asylum even where there is no longer any objective risk upon return. Justice Martineau goes on to say that \"[i]ndeed, a variety of circumstances may trigger the application of the 'compelling reasons' exception,\"48 and \"it does not require a determination that such acts or situation be 'atrocious' and 'appalling.'\"49\n[62] The panel is also mindful of the Federal Court decision in Hassan, where it was stated that \"the nature of all persecution, by definition involves death, physical harm or other penalties\" so that compelling reasons applies to \"extraordinary cases in which the persecution is relatively so exceptional, that even in the wake of changed circumstances, it would be wrong to return refugee claimants.\"50 The task for the panel is to establish whether the claimant's particular case can be distinguished from cases of persecution that do not fall under section 108(4). This is a question of fact, and not an assessment of humanitarian and compassionate grounds for a stay of removal, which is considered by the Minister.51\n[63] Shahid held that the Board had to consider the level of atrocity of the acts inflicted upon a claimant to decide whether compelling reasons apply.52 The terms \"atrocious\" and \"appalling\" have been cited in various Federal Court decisions such as Arguello-Garcia,53 Nwaozor,54 Isacko,55 and Hassan.56 The panel does not find that this was so in the case at hand.\n[64] The panel acknowledges that the P.C.'s husband was murdered and without a doubt, this would be traumatic for the members of the family. However, the P.C. did not elicit any evidence to persuade this panel that she has sustained the kind of trauma that the cases from the Federal Court suggest. Moreover, although not mandatory, no psychological evidence was submitted to corroborate any after effects from the P.C.'s husband's murder, or any consequences to her as a result. In Obstoj, the Federal Court held that this exception applies to \"a tiny minority of present day claimants.\"57 Similarly, Isacko refers to \"the very limited class of refugee claimants.\"58 This underscores the notion that the circumstances must be truly exceptional. In Lawani, the claimant was brutalized while in detention, assaulted, hung upside down for extended periods, burned with hot irons and cigarettes, whipped on the back, and had needles inserted into his penis.59 Such atrocities are not within the public consciousness; they are not incidents one might occasionally hear about in the news.\n[65] The panel is guided by the reasoning in the following Federal Court decisions. In Oprysk, it was held that the \"Board's conclusion that the treatment of the Applicants was 'abhorrent' does not equate to a finding that their treatment was 'atrocious and appalling,'\" and its reasons were not \"patently unreasonable.\"60\n[66] In Lici, the Federal Court held that the RPD was entitled to weigh the evidence and determine that the applicants' past persecution did not reach the atrocious and appalling threshold necessary to make a finding that compelling reasons existed.61\n[67] In Kostrzewa, it was held that the Board must consider if \"there is prima facie evidence of past persecution that is so exceptional in its severity that it rises to the level of being 'appalling' or 'atrocious'...\"62\n[68] The panel finds that there is insufficient persuasive evidence to lead it to conclude that the P.C. has met the high threshold for compelling reasons adopted by the Courts. In reaching its conclusion, the panel has considered the credibility findings, and finds that compelling reasons are not applicable in the case at hand. The panel concludes that notwithstanding the trauma of the P.C.'s husband's murder, which led to her departure from Colombia, it does not rise to the level that would be considered compelling reasons.\nCONCLUSION\n[69] The panel concludes that the P.C. and her two children are not Convention refugees, nor persons in need of protection.\n[70] In reaching its conclusion, the panel has considered the P.C.'s credibility, (the children's allegations are based on hers), the claimants' lengthy undocumented status in the US, compelling reasons, change in circumstances and a viable IFA.\n[71] It concludes that the determinative issues are change of circumstances and IFA, and given its findings in this regard, these claims are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Roslyn Ahara\"\nROSLYN AHARA\nSeptember 18, 2019\nDate\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, as amended [IRPA], sections 96 and 97(1).\n2 Exhibit 2.1, Personal Information Form (PIF) - TB2-07572.\n3 Exhibit 5, Previous Record, Disclosure received March 19, 2018, at pp. 1-5.\n4 Exhibit 1, Package of Information from the Referring CBSA\/CIC, Copies of Passports.\n5 Exhibit 5, Previous Record, Minster's Intent to Intervene and Minister's Evidence.\n6 UN General Assembly, Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, 28 July 1951, United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 189, p. 137, available at: https:\/\/www.refworld.org\/docid\/3be01b964.html, Article 1F(b).\n7 Criminal Code (R.S.C., 1985, c.

Bond (documents only)\nConseil du (de la) ministre\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] This is the decision in the claims of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, (the principal claimant); and XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, (the minor claimants). The claimants are making claims against Pakistan, seeking Canada's protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1 The claimants appeared at the land border between Canada and the United States, (US), on July 17, 2016 and made refugee claims as exceptions to the Safe Third Country Agreement between the two countries as the principal claimant's husband - the minor claimants' father - is a Canadian citizen.\n[2] The Minster of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) intervened in the claim on September 9, 2016 on the basis of concerns about the identities of the two older minor claimants and credibility of the principal claimant. Specifically, the Minister's Representative alleges that the principal claimant has, at different times, presented different names and dates of birth for the male minor claimants. The principal claimant was initially appointed Designated Representative for the minor claimants, but due to concerns regarding the potential for a conflict of interest between the principal claimant and the two male minor claimants arising from the allegations contained in the Minister's intervention, an outside Designated Representative was appointed for the minor claimants.\n[3] The claimants' allegations are contained in the narrative to the principal claimant's Basis of Claim form, (BOC),2 narrative. In it she alleges that after her brother-in-law was killed in a \"fake encounter\" with police, her family tried to publicize the matter and were threatened by unknown persons. Later, her father's house was raided by Rangers who also threatened the family. Fearing targeting by state agents in Pakistan, the principal claimant obtained visas for herself and her children to the US, where her husband was then working, and travelled there on XXXX, 2016. While they were in the US, the principal claimant's husband applied for Temporary Resident Visas for his wife and children. The application was refused. They entered Canada two months later, making refugee claims at the border as stated above.\n[4] The other issue mentioned briefly in the principal claimant's BOC is the matter of the various names and dates of birth for the male minor claimants. She lists them as XXXX, date of birth XXXX XXXX XXXX 2004 and XXXX, date of birth XXXX XXXX, 2006 in question 5. In her narrative she states that XXXX is also known as XXXX and XXXX is also known as XXXX. The explanation given in the narrative is also brief and can be summarized as follows: the principal claimant's husband left her and their older son off his application for landing to avoid delay and therefore the misrepresentation was unintentional, (i.e. \"This was not meant to misrepresent...\"); and while there were \"other errors that were made by him afterwards\"3 her husband had submitted another sponsorship application on November 11, 2015, which is still outstanding. The principal claimant also writes in her narrative of the hardship of raising her children alone in Pakistan.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] The panel finds that the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor are they persons in need of protection. The determinative issues are identity and credibility.\nIdentity\n[6] Identity has been described by the Federal Court as follows:\n\"Identity is a virtual sine qua non of immigration law. Identity is the springboard for such issues as admissibility, eligibility for refugee status and determination of the need for protection. It is also critical to an assessment of potential danger to the public, threat to security and flight risk, to name but a few of the issues for which identity is an essential component.\"4\n[7] This is also a reflection of the importance of identity in refugee assessment as set out in s. 106 of the IRPA which also expressly ties the claimant's evidence on identity to the assessment of the claimant's credibility. This is stated in s. 106 as arising when the claimant does not have acceptable documentation establishing identity and taking into account their explanation for the lack of acceptable documentation. In these claims, the claimants presented passports when they first made their claims, but differences in the names, and dates of birth for the two male minor claimants, as presented in their passports and other identity documents, raise questions as to the acceptability of those documents.\n[8] While the principal claimant's statements in her BOC appear to minimise the importance of the conflicting evidence regarding the male minor claimant's identity, as stated in paragraph 4 above, these statements actually further impugn the principal claimant's credibility by their disingenuousness. Misrepresenting marital status and family composition to avoid a possible delay in processing an immigration application is not unintentional. It is deliberate misrepresentation for expediency. Further, a sponsorship application in 2006 which also misrepresented the male minor claimant's names and dates of birth, and was supported by passports, which the principal claimant testified were obtained by paying bribes, is far from adequately explained by a vague reference in the narrative to \"other errors that were made by him afterwards\" as the principal claimant stated in her narrative. The panel notes that the BOC was signed two months before the Minister intervened and provided to the Refugee Protection Division the information regarding the 2006 sponsorship application. The claimant's explanation, in the hearing room when asked by the panel, that all this was done by a consultant in Pakistan5, falls far short of reasonable in light of the extensiveness of the misrepresentation. The panel further notes that the information contained in the 2015 sponsorship application, which matches the information on the male minor's passports, i.e. that XXXX was born XXXX XXXX, 2006 and XXXX was born XXXX XXXX, 2007, is inconsistent with the information in her BOC, i.e. that XXXX, also known as XXXX, was born XXXX XXXX, 2004 and XXXX, also known as XXXX, was born date of birth XXXX XXXX, 2006. These are the passports the principal claimant presented when they entered the US and when they entered Canada.\n[9] Counsel, in his submissions, suggested that the principal claimant had explained the discrepancies among the identity documents and the panel should find that the male minor claimants' identities are as stated in the BOC. The panel does not find the principal claimant's explanations reasonable. They are disingenuous and evasive. Taking into account the onus in refugee claims, the panel finds that, in light of the varying evidence regarding the male minor claimants' identity, their identity has not been established. The evidence on this issue severely impugns the principal claimant's personal credibility.\n[10] Regarding the identity of the principal claimant and the female minor claimants, while the evidence regarding the two male minor claimants causes the panel to have doubts about relying on the passports presented to establish their identities and nationality6, in the absence of specific concerns with these documents, the panel will give those claimants the benefit of the doubt and accept the passports as sufficient to establish their identities and nationality.\nCredibility\n[11] The onus is on the person making a refugee claim to present evidence that is credible, on a balance of probabilities, to support the allegations which form the basis of their claim. In this case the panel finds that the claimant has not met that onus.\n[12] While statements given under oath are presumed to be true, that presumption can be rebutted by contradictions or inconsistencies in the evidence.7 In reviewing the evidence, the panel \"may also conclude that a claimant's evidence is implausible, or improbable, or dubious, or untenable, or unreliable, or absurd, or unconvincing.\"8 The panel \"also is entitled, in assessing credibility, to rely on criteria such as rationality and common sense.\"9 The panel must also consider the requirement of Refugee Protection Division Rule 11, for the claimant to provide acceptable documentation in assessing the credibility of the claimant's evidence.10 As the decision on a refugee claim is made after an oral hearing, the panel's assessment of the credibility of the claimant's evidence includes a consideration of how the claimant testified at the hearing.\n[13] The panel's main concerns regarding credibility arose from the contradictions regarding the identity of the male minor claimants and the principal claimant's testimony regarding this issue as set out above. On the specific allegations regarding the risk to the claimants in Pakistan, the omission of any reference to the threats set out in the narrative in her port of entry interview; the discrepancies among the documents regarding her brother-in-law; and the absence of corroborating documentation regarding this allegation, which would reasonably be available if the allegation were true, as set out in the narrative, (i.e. that the family had gone public regarding their beliefs regarding what had happened to the brother-in-law), lead the panel to conclude that the allegation is not true, at least not in the key element of how it puts the claimants at risk.\nPort of Entry Interview\n[14] At the port of entry interview, the principal claimant initially gave family re-unification as the reason why the family was making refugee claims. She does also mention that her brother-in-law was killed, but made no reference to threats to her or her children or involvement of state authorities, only that, being on her own, she feared the same thing could happen to her.\n[15] At the hearing, in answer to questions from counsel, the principal claimant testified that she had been afraid to tell about the involvement of the state in Pakistan because they might find out. The panel does not accept this explanation as reasonable. The principal claimant was making a refugee claim against Pakistan, therefore, if the state were involved, this would have been a key element of her story. The panel also notes that while there is no record of counsel at the interview, the family had previously been represented by a lawyer in Canada11 and, if she had concerns about the confidentiality of the interview, she could have sought legal advice. Also, the claimants were two months removed from the alleged threats, having been living in the US with the principal claimant's husband, the minor claimants' father, until moving a refugee centre - XXXX XXXX before reporting to the Canadian border. The panel finds that the addition of threats to the claimants and the involvement of state authorities in the narrative was likely an embellishment to bolster the claim.\nDocuments regarding the Principal Claimant's Brother-in law\n[16] The principal claimant presented several documents regarding her brother-in-law. There were inconsistencies among them. A copy of a marriage document12states that he was 40 at the time of his marriage, six years before his death. The death certificate 13 states his age as just short of 44 and also states that he had died of natural causes at home. A funeral document14 puts his age at 42. Before pointing out these discrepancies to the principal claimant, the panel asked her how old her brother-in-law had been at the time of his death and she replied that he was 38 or 40. She testified that she did not recall much about his date of birth; that someone else had filled out the form; that she had no knowledge; and that they could not get a death certificate which gave his true cause and location of death. While these are not major inconsistencies, they do show the unreliability of the claimants' supporting documents, particularly in light of the facially official, but not true in content, documents presented regarding the male minor claimants' identity as discussed above.\n[17] While the principal claimant, in her narrative, alleged that the family's concerns about the death of her brother-in-law had been reported in media and had been brought to the attention of Non-governmental Organizations, (NGO), the claimants presented no corroborating documents. When asked by the panel, the claimant pointed to online comments regarding another suspicious death of a relative, not the principal claimant's brother-in-law. Regarding the lack of any report from the NGO, the principal claimant's explanation is that they had only made verbal reports and did not receive written reports because they had not paid. These explanations are insufficient. The principal claimant, and her family, in their supporting statements, allege that it was the public nature of the family's inquiries which caused them to receive threats from state authorities in Pakistan. The lack of documents leads the panel to find that, even if the principal claimant's brother-in-law had died, the allegation of her family's public inquiries and resulting threats is not credible. As stated previously in these reasons, it is the second part of this allegation - inquiries resulting in threats - that is the key element of the claim.\nCONCLUSION\n[18] The panel finds that due to the credibility deficiencies in the evidence as set out above, the claimants have failed to meet the onus on them to present credible evidence to support their claims. The credibility findings undermine any claims under s. 96 or s. 97(1) of the IRPA. The claims are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"D. Young\"\nD.

The claimant's counsel submitted post-hearing submissions2 which have been reviewed and considered before the panel reached any decision.\nPreliminary matters\n[3] The original Basis of Claim [BOC] form3 was provided with the assistance of the claimant's previous counsel, Mr. Smedley Prescod, a former member of the Immigration Consultants of Canada Regulatory Council. The claimant alleged, in her oral testimony, that he asked her to sign the blank BOC form which he subsequently completed on her behalf.\n[4] Furthermore, the panel noted that the original BOC, which was stamped \"Received\" by the IRB in Toronto on August 8, 2016, contains a blank Interpreter's Declaration, even though the claimant has limited knowledge of English, and even though the claimant signed Declaration B in the form to the effect that the entire contents of the form had been interpreted to her.\n[5] The following allegations are therefore those contained in the revised BOC Form narrative, as signed by the claimant on March 24, 20194. At the first sitting of the oral hearing for this matter on April 3, 2019 the panel noted to present counsel that even the revised BOC Form narrative lacked an interpreter's declaration; Mr. De Narvaez Martinez provided this to the panel at the start of the June 10, 2019 hearing.5 He is listed and has signed as the interpreter in that Declaration.\nAllegations\n[6] The claimant ran her own business in El Salvador. Initially she had a XXXX and XXXX boutique, then ran a XXXX XXXX for about eight years until 2000. From 2000 to 2003 she travelled to Canada.\n[7] After she returned to El Salvador she ran various other small retail stores, most recently a variety store.\n[8] On Tuesday, XXXX XXXX, 2012, a man came to the store and called her by name. He said that he was a local leader of the Maras, and warned that nothing would happen to the claimant or her employee, who was present at the time, if they cooperated. He pushed the claimant while he drew a gun and pointed it at the employee, XXXX. The man demanded that the claimant give him all the money from the cash register, so she had to give him the $XXXX which included her store rent for the month. The man warned the claimant that if she kept her mouth shut and continued cooperating then nothing would happen to her or her employee. He left saying that there would be another visit.\n[9] The claimant noticed that the doors of the store had been painted with gang graffiti. She was fearful to return to the shop and did not reopen for just over two months. However, the store was her only income source so she decided to return and continue working in order to raise enough funds to move the business elsewhere.\n[10] She became even more frightened when she learned that another business owner in the neighbourhood had been killed for refusing to pay the \"rent\" that the gang demanded. The claimant began to close her store earlier, around 5 p.m. instead of the previous closing time of 7 or 8 p.m.\n[11] On Saturday, XXXX XXXX, 2012 the claimant was closing her shop when the door was pushed open throwing her onto the floor. It was the same man as before, together with a second man. Both were armed with guns. The first man hit the claimant in the face and told her to be quiet. He warned her that she could not hide and said that \"they\" would find her no matter where she went, and they knew where she lived. The man kicked her and asked \"where is the money?\" The claimant was forced to pay him due to her fear, and because he pointed the gun at her head. He warned her not to hide or go to the police. The men left, shooting once in the air.\n[12] After that, members of the gang came every week to demand money. The claimant was unable to cover her business expenses, and became fearful and depressed. She closed the store permanently on XXXX XXXX, 2012, and moved to another district. From her new home she started planning her departure from El Salvador, and with the assistance of her children she went to the USA on XXXX XXXX, 2013. She wanted to come to Canada to apply for protection.\n[13] However, she was delayed in the USA because her daughter, XXXX, who had been living there since August 2006 was experiencing domestic violence. The claimant could not leave XXXX by herself in those circumstances. Even though her daughter obtained a protective order in XXXX 2013, the claimant stayed in the USA to be there for her and her children. The claimant was threatened by her ex-son-in-law and his family.\nDETERMINATION\n[14] The panel finds that the claimant has not satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground or that she would be personally subjected, on a balance of probabilities, to a danger of torture, or a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment upon return to El Salvador. Therefore, the panel finds that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\n[15] The determinative issue in this case is credibility.\nIdentity\n[16] The panel finds that the claimant's identity as a national of El Salvador is established by her testimony and the supporting documentation filed including her passport as found in Exhibit 1.\nCredibility\n[17] The panel finds the claimant not to be a credible witness and therefore does not believe what she alleged in support of her claim.\n[18] In assessing credibility, the panel is mindful of the many difficulties faced by the claimants in establishing a claim, including nervousness, the difficulties of testifying through an interpreter, and the challenges faced by claimants in establishing their claims, The panel has taken into account the claimant's background, as alleged at the Port of Entry, specifically that she is a 55-year-old self-employed variety store owner from El Salvador who has three years of secondary education. She has been married three times, and her current marital status is divorced.\n[19] Her mother, two sons, three sisters, and two brothers live in Canada. All but the son, XXXX, are Canadian citizens; he is a landed immigrant in Canada despite the rejection of his Canadian refugee claim in 20116. She also has a daughter who lives in XXXX, Texas and is seeking permanent residence in the USA. The claimant has no immediate family left in El Salvador, according to her BOC.7\nThe Intervention by the Minister\n[20] The Minister filed a Notice of Intent to Intervene dated September 2, 2016 regarding credibility8. The Minister did not attend the hearing in person or file any post-hearing written submissions.\n[21] The Minister noted that the claimant was in the USA from XXXX 2013 until she entered Canada in XXXX 2016. The Minister reviewed the contents of the Canada Border Services Agency [CBSA] statutory declaration regarding an interview of the claimant by an officer on July 22, 2016, as referred to by the Minister from Exhibit M-2.9\n[22] The Minister specifically cited a passage from the interview notes in which the CBSA Officer asked the claimant why she had given documentation relating to a family member being in hospital in Toronto, and a request for a visitor visa made on XXXX XXXX, 2016. The Officer questioned the claimant, \"You are submitting paperwork as a visitor yet you're coming here asking to reside permanently?\" The claimant replied in the affirmative. The Officer asked the claimant what her intentions were, and the claimant replied, \"Whatever you ask me to do, I will do it\".\n[23] The Officer repeated, \"Why are you asking as to live here permanently, yet were asking for a visitor visa\" [two weeks previously]? The claimant replied, \"My mother is sick in the hospital. Whatever you ask me to do, I will do it.\" Then the Officer asked the claimant, \"Why are you asking to live here permanently two weeks later?\", and the claimant replied, \"Because of my problems in El Salvador\".\n[24] The Minister also noted that the claimant provided the CBSA Officer with documentation from XXXX XXXX XXXX Hospital in Toronto regarding her mother's hospitalization10, and recommending that the claimant be given a visitor's visa to allow her to provide her mother with care and support.\n[25] The Minister submitted that the claimant had resided in the USA for over three years without making any asylum claim there. Furthermore, the Minister submitted that the claimant had now expressed an interest in coming to Canada due to her mother's illness, which does not make the claimant a refugee, even though it may be understandable.\n[26] The Minister finally submitted that the claimant's initial plan was merely to obtain a visitor visa, but then \"at some point [she] realized this would not be possible or simply changed her plan\".11 Thus, the Minister submits in conclusion the claimant does not have a subjective fear of persecution in El Salvador, and should be determined to be neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nNexus\n[27] For the claimant to be a Convention refugee, her fear of persecution must be \"by reason of\" one of the five grounds enumerated in the Convention refugee definition. The panel finds that the claimant's fear of persecution is not linked to any of the five grounds.\n[28] Counsel argued at the start of the oral hearing, that the claimant was a member of the particular social group as an \"entrepreneur\". However, the jurisprudence indicates that a distinction must be drawn between a claimant who fears persecution because of what he or she does as an individual and a claimant who fears persecution because of his or her membership in a particular social group. It is the membership in the group which must be the cause of the persecution and not the individual activities of the claimant.12This is sometimes referred to as the \"is versus does\" distinction.\n[29] In Ward,13 the Supreme Court identified three possible categories of particular social groups that emerge from tests in earlier decisions:\n* Groups defined by an innate or unchangeable characteristic;\n* groups whose members voluntarily associate for reasons so fundamental to their human dignity that they should not be forced to forsake the association; and\n* groups associated by a former voluntary status, unalterable due to its historical permanence.\n[30] The panel finds that none of the three possible categories are applicable to the claimant's circumstances as a woman who ran small variety stores or businesses in El Salvador. The panel has considered the testimony by the claimant, as well as counsel's submissions and finds that there is no established link to any Convention ground, as the claimant fears crime or a vendetta, and the threats from persons who may be members of a criminal gang, the Maras.\n[31] The panel is guided here by Federal Court cases which have held that victims of crime, corruption or vendettas generally fail to establish any link between their fear of persecution and any one of the Convention grounds, which stand for the definition of Convention refugee. The Board has been upheld in its finding of a lack nexus where the claimant was the target of a personal vendetta,14 or victim of a crime.15\nThe Claimant's Previous Immigration History in Canada\n[32] In her BOC Narrative, the claimant acknowledges that \"From 2000 to 2003 I travelled to Canada\".16 She did not give further details.\n[33] However, the CBSA Examining Officer's Notes17 state that when the claimant arrived at the XXXX XXXX Refugee Processing Unit to make her claim on July 22, 2016, her son XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX attended; he acted as the \"Anchor Person\" under the US-Canada Safe Third Country Agreement to allow the claimant to enter Canada as a refugee claimant at Fort Erie.\n[34] The Officer's Notes go on to state18:\nProgram integrity concerns have been demonstrated in the Statutory Declaration. Ms. XXXX XXXX XXXX was excluded from Canada after being refused permanent residency in 2003. Subsequently, she obtained a Canadian visa in 2007, yet was refused in 2012. She is seeking protection into Canada after residing in the United States for over three years without legal status. When asked why neither a Canadian nor American sponsorship was undertaken, no credible reason could be provided. Furthermore, Ms. XXXX XXXX XXXX is seeking protection into Canada approximately two weeks after requesting documentation from the hospital in Canada requesting a visitor visa on her behalf in order to visit an ill family member. Ms. XXXX XXXX XXXX states that she is in need of protection since 2012, yet did not seek refugee protection from the United States when she entered in 2013....\n[35] When the claimant entered Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2016 she was questioned about her lengthy stay in the USA. She admitted to entering the USA on a tourist visa in XXXX 2013, and then she stayed with her daughter in XXXX, Texas for the entire period following19. The claimant asserted that she had not made any US asylum claim because, \"I didn't know how to do [it]\". She was asked why she overstayed her initial six-month permit to visit the USA, and responded \"Because I could not return to El Salvador\".\n[36] The Officer asked her why she was asking for Canada's protection, and the claimant replied \"Because I could not return back to El Salvador, and I need to see my mother. Because I could not continue to pay the money to the [Maras], the delinquents in El Salvador. Everyone has some business that they demand money [from]. I have been paying them for one year since XXXX 2012 until XXXX 2013\".20\n[37] In her oral testimony, the claimant conceded that she had been refused Permanent Resident status in Canada in 2002 after a failed marriage sponsorship, and ordered to leave Canada in 2003.\n[38] Aside from any previous visits to Canada, the US Biometrics Report21 indicates that the claimant was fingerprinted upon arrival in the USA on: XXXX XXXX, 2013; XXXX XXXX, 2011; XXXX XXXX, 2010; XXXX XXXX, 2009; XXXX XXXX, 2008; XXXX XXXX, 2007; XXXX XXXX, 2005; XXXX XXXX, 2004; and on XXXX XXXX, 2004. She returned to El Salvador following each of these visits, except for the most recent.\n[39] The panel notes that while the claimant alleges that she failed to make any US asylum claim due to ignorance, as she advised the CBSA Officer, she also told the Officer that while she was in the USA she spoke by telephone two or three times every week with her son, XXXX, who had previously made an unsuccessful refugee claim in Canada in 2011.\n[40] The claimant was questioned by the panel about her lengthy stay in the USA from XXXX 2013 until XXXX 2016. The claimant acknowledged that she feared being deported from USA as she had overstayed her US visitor visa. In addition, the claimant alleged that she had always intended to come to Canada to seek refuge, and further that she was preparing to come to Canada to request asylum when her mother fell ill in Toronto.\nThe claimant's evidence about her initial problem in El Salvador\n[41] At the first hearing date of the claimant's case on April 3, 2019 , the claimant acknowledged that she was the last person in her immediate family to leave El Salvador . She testified that her daughter had lived in the USA illegally for 11 years, before seeking to legalize her status. She testified that her mother and five siblings had made refugee claims in Canada; the first family member to arrive here was a brother who came in 1978, before the Maras existed.\n[42] The panel asked the claimant to give details regarding the start of her personal problems in El Salvador. In the panel's view, her oral evidence lacked the ring of truth. She was given repeated chances to expand upon her testimony but failed to do so. Instead, her oral evidence did little more than repeat the content of her March 24, 2019 BOC Narrative.\n[43] She said in her oral testimony that she was the victim of the gangs operating in El Salvador, specifically the MS 13 and no other.\n[44] She testified at the hearing that her problems started on Tuesday, XXXX XXXX, 2012 when \"A man showed up at my business about 6 o'clock in the evening. He showed up to the business claiming he was the head of the Maras operating in that area. He shoved me. He took out a gun and he pointed that gun at my employee, XXXX XXXX, demanding I hand over the money that I had in the cash register. Quite nervous I took the money out and I handed it over to him. He told us that we could continue operating, that nothing was going to happen to us. He left but not without, but not before saying, that he would return.\"\n[45] The panel asked her if she could mention anything else about the incident. She said, \"When he left we were afraid, and when we stepped out we noticed the gates had graffiti related to the gangs\". The panel asked her what kind of graffiti, and she replied that these were words that only they can understand, and use amongst themselves.\n[46] Again, the panel asked if the claimant could give any more details about this first incident when the man first came to the store. She replied, \"No, everything was quite spontaneous, - and he left.\" The panel asked her if she could recall any further details. She said, \"At this moment, at this time, I can't recall\".\n[47] The panel asked the claimant whether anything further happened to her. The claimant testified that after this incident she was quite distraught and decided to go home. She added that after this one incident she did not open the business for about two months.\n[48] In the BOC narrative, 22 the claimant states:\n\"On XXXX, XXXX XXXX, 2012 around 6 p.m., a man with a dark tanned skin, in his thirties came to the store and called me by my name. He said that he was the one who called the shots for the \"Mara\" in that area, meaning that he was the head of the gang in that area, and that nothing would happen to us if we cooperated. He pushed me while he drew a gun and pointed it at my employee, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\nThe man demanded that I gave him the money that we had in the cash register. I obeyed fearfully, giving him approximately $XXXX dollars, which included money that I had to pay the rent of the store for that month. The man said if I kept my mouth shut and continued cooperating, nothing would happen to us. He left saying that \"they\" would come back.\nWe noticed that the doors of the store had been painted with marks used by the gangs. I was fearful to go back to the shop and I didn't open it for a little over two months.\"\n[49] While the panel has made allowances for the lapse of time since the alleged incident, it is nevertheless apparent that the claimant was able to do no more than repeat much of the wording, but not all, from her written BOC Narrative. If these events had actually taken place, it is reasonable to expect that the claimant's oral evidence would have displayed at least a modicum of spontaneity regarding additional details, especially considering that this was the seminal event which led to any further problems as alleged.\n[50] The panel therefore draws an adverse credibility inference regarding the claimant's testimony for the event of XXXX XXXX, 2012.\nOral Testimony by Teleconference with the Witness\n[51] During the hearing of June 10, 2019 telephone testimony was given by a witness who identified herself as XXXX XXXX, the same person who had worked as an employee in the claimant's store until 2012 and who is mentioned in the BOC Narrative.\n[52] Before the witness testified, the panel asked the claimant a number of questions about XXXX personal background and her work in the claimant's store. Subsequently, when the witness testified a few minutes later the panel was able to compare her answers. On this basis, the panel noted that the claimant and the witness were consistent, in broad terms as to the length of time that the witness had worked for the claimant. In addition, the claimant and the witness give consistent evidence regarding XXXX family, the ages of her children and their gender, the name of her spouse, her age, and date of birth.\n[53] Furthermore, XXXX telephone evidence was consistent with the basic elements of the claimant's written narrative regarding the incident of XXXX XXXX, 2012.\n[54] However, the claimant testified that XXXX had worked in the store until XXXX XXXX, 2012, - the date when the gang member allegedly came in to the store demanding money, and pointed a gun directly at XXXX. The panel asked the claimant if XXXX XXXX was the employee's last day of work, and she confirmed that it was. Why was this not in the BOC Narrative? The claimant responded \"I only thought about me; she's just my employee\". The claimant testified that XXXX never returned to the store after XXXX XXXX because of the fright she suffered when the gun was pointed at her.\n[55] The panel asked the claimant if she remembered whether she had paid the employee until XXXX XXXX, but the claimant replied that neither she nor the employee thought that it was worth paying for the three days in XXXX. The claimant repeated that after XXXX XXXX, 2012 \"I didn't see her again\". The claimant said she only paid the employee, XXXX, until December 31, 2011.\n[56] According to the claimant's oral evidence, she and XXXX lost contact until \"She contacted me through my daughter in XXXX on Facebook\". When was this Facebook contact? The claimant said that she thought it was in 2014.\n[57] The claimant confirmed that she had not seen XXXX in person since XXXX XXXX, 2012.\n[58] The panel notes that the witness gave radically different evidence about the aftermath of the XXXX XXXX, 2012 gun incident.\n[59] The witness initially testified that her last work date with the claimant was on XXXX XXXX, 2012, but then when the panel tried to confirm that moments later she said \"I made a mistake; I kept working for a week after that date\". Then she changed her evidence again and said, \"I was no longer working with her but I would just arrive. I kept going there because she still asked me\". \"I kept going there for just one week.\"\n[60] The panel asked the witness if the claimant continued paying her, and the witness replied that she had and she, the witness, had been paid for the last time on XXXX XXXX, 2012.\n[61] The panel noted on the record, at this point in oral evidence, that the claimant gasped audibly twice during the above testimony by the witness. It was apparent to the panel that the claimant was displeased with the inconsistent evidence. Moreover, it must have been apparent to the witness also that the claimant was concerned about the oral testimony. The panel had to warn the claimant to be silent as it may be perceived that she was trying to guide the witness.\n[62] Then when the panel tried to confirm the witness's evidence about her last pay date, the witness backtracked and said she could not remember exactly when that was but \"It was something like that\". The panel notes that the witness appeared to have changed her oral evidence in response to the claimant's audible gasp.\n[63] There were other significant differences between the testimony of the claimant and that of the witness.\n[64] The witness also testified that she thought the claimant had closed her store up for good, about two weeks after the gun incident, by the end of XXXX 2012. By comparison, as noted above regarding the claimant's oral evidence, the claimant testified that immediately after the XXXX XXXX incident she kept the store closed for two months. This is also repeated in the second sentence of paragraph 6 of the BOC Narrative. Furthermore, the claimant testified at the oral hearing that after about two months she reopened and kept the store open until November 2012.\n[65] The witness said that she kept going back to the store for the week after the XXXX XXXX, 2012 gun incident, but by comparison the claimant testified that the witness never went back.\n[66] Furthermore, the witness testified that there was a long gap from 2012 until she had contact with the claimant once again in December 2018. She testified that the claimant's daughter contacted her by Facebook.\n[67] By comparison, the claimant testified that the witness contacted her through the claimant's daughter, while the claimant was in Texas, in 2014.\n[68] The panel noted to the witness that her evidence differed from the claimant's because the witness said she had returned to the store after the gun incident, but the claimant said she had not. In response, the witness said she only went back twice after the incident.\n[69] Regarding the discrepancy about the Facebook contact, when the panel pointed this out to the witness she changed her oral evidence and said that there was earlier contact, but only with her daughter, and then contact was lost again until 2018. Then the witness said that one time when she was communicating with the claimant's daughter she also had contact with the claimant.\n[70] The panel asked the witness why her testimony kept changing [1] regarding the frequency and nature of her return to the store, after XXXX XXXX, 2012, and [2] regarding how and when she regained contact with the claimant. The witness tried to restate her evidence that the Facebook contact was not with the claimant but with the daughter, then said it was only briefly with the claimant as well. Then the witness said she could not remember; she would go to the store after XXXX XXXX, 2012 but not every day.\n[71] In redirect testimony, the witness said that after XXXX XXXX, 2012 she never worked again.\n[72] The witness said that she had to pass right in front of the store because it was in her neighbourhood, but then she changed that testimony and said it was in the next neighbourhood.\n[73] The panel notes that the telephone witness was able to give oral testimony which was consistent with parts of the limited information found in the March 24, 2019 BOC Narrative about the alleged XXXX XXXX, 2012 incident, but regarding events which were not found in the BOC narrative there were serious credibility concerns, specifically regarding\n* whether the witness went back to the store after the alleged gun incident, to work or not, how often, and whether she was paid to do so;\n* whether the claimant's store closed after XXXX XXXX, 2012 or not,\n* when and how the witness and the claimant regained contact, and,\n* the evolving nature of the evidence given by the witness, which appear to change to address inconsistency or credibility concerns, for example after the claimant gasped on the record.\n[74] The unfortunate reality of a telephone witness is that the panel has no way of seeing whether the witness is looking at any written notes, or even the BOC narrative, as they testify. The panel accepts that the claimant appeared to know the witness's family and personal details, so they appear to have some basic acquaintance.\n[75] The panel finds and determines, on a balance of probabilities, that the witness may have worked in the claimant store, as alleged. However, it is most remarkable that the claimant and the witness were unable to give clear, consistent, and credible evidence regarding the events following the alleged XXXX XXXX, 2012 gun incident at the store. Although the panel notes the passage of seven years since that incident, the claimant and the witness did not remember the subsequent events in the same way.\n[76] What was the claimant's explanation about discrepancies between the witness's evidence and her own? She replied, \"Knowing her she's nervous, she's confused, she trying to tell you how it was as far as I understand\".\n[77] The claimant specifically testified that her employee was so profoundly afraid after a gun was pointed at her at the store in XXXX XXXX, 2012, that she (XXXX) never came back to the store. The witness-employee gave substantially different testimony, and for that matter oral evidence that repeatedly evolved in real time, - first saying one thing, then another.\n[78] The claimant testified initially that she was so traumatized that she closed her store for two months immediately following the XXXX XXXX, 2012 incident, but the oral evidence from the witness indicated that both she and the claimant continued working on some basis.\n[79] The panel determines that the lack of congruence between the evidence of the claimant and the witness is sufficiently important that a major negative credibility inference is warranted. The panel finds that these above-noted matters undermine the credibility of the assertion that there was any gun incident involving any Mara member at the claimant's store on XXXX XXXX, 2012 or otherwise at any time. The claimant's testimony was that the employee was so traumatized when a gun was pointed at her on XXXX XXXX that she did not return.\n[80] In summary, the panel is not convinced on a balance of probabilities that there was any gun incident involving a member of any gang who threatened the claimant and her employee in XXXX 2012. The panel finds that the claimant has failed to adduce sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to persuade, on a balance of probabilities, that this event took place.\nThe Claimant's Supporting Documents\n[81] In the claimant's BOC Narrative, all the subsequent problems flow from this initial encounter of XXXX XXXX, 2012. The claimant alleges that the problems escalated when the same man returned in XXXX 2012.\n[82] The claimant argues and alleges that the Maras increased their interest in her and became more aggressive and threatening when they returned in XXXX 2012. However, given the above noted negative inferences however, the panel simply does not believe that the XXXX XXXX, 2012 incident took place. Thus, the further incidents which follow from the genesis of the claimant's problems are also determined not to be believed.\n[83] The panel gives no weight to any photograph of gang graffiti23 provided as the claimant has failed to adduce sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence that she was personally approached by the gang members. Such graffiti is often a random occurrence, and the panel also finds in this instance.\n[84] Furthermore, the panel notes that the claimant's personal disclosure includes a Sworn Declaration from the employee, XXXX, 24 in which she stated \"One day a gang member came to the business to threaten, attacking us, he marked the doors of Mrs. XXXX business with letters suggestive of the gangs.\"\n[85] As the panel has concluded, above, that XXXX was not a credible witness and that the specified incident did not, on a balance of probabilities, take place, it follows then that the claimant has procured this fraudulent document from the employee or other persons unknown in order to further a fraudulent refugee protection claim. The panel notes also that the employee's declaration did not mention any date, nor that a gun was pointed at herself, as one might reasonably expect had this incident occurred as described in the claimant's narrative.\n[86] Furthermore, it was the claimant's own evidence that after XXXX XXXX, 2012 she lost contact with the employee. Therefore the account given in the employee's declaration is derived only from what the claimant may later told her.\n[87] The claimant's tendering of this non-genuine document affects the panel's assessment of both of this and the other documents procured by the claimant to corroborate that she ever had any problems from the gangs in El Salvador. The panel notes a second affidavit procured or completed by the offices of the same advocate.25 As the claimant has submitted a non-genuine Declaration, the genuine nature of the claimant's other personal supporting documents regarding her problems in El Salvador has been called into question. Indeed, the panel takes guidance from the Federal Court, which has written26, \"Was the next set of documents that are fakes? The Board should not be treated as a training school in which counterfeiters can practice their craft.\" The panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities that even the signed Sworn Declarations are not genuine documents.\n[88] The claimant's submission of fraudulent documents is relevant in two important ways. Firstly, the general credibility of the claimant is eroded as she has shown that she is willing and able to use non-genuine documents and to proffer them as genuine, even after she has already secured safe passage to Canada. Secondly, the specific allegations that the documents purport to corroborate, - namely that the claimant was personally targeted by the Maras in El Salvador, - becomes doubtful. The panel draws substantial negative inferences for both of these reasons.\n[89] In addition, as the Federal Court has often found, a general lack of credibility can extend to supporting evidence, trickling down to other elements of the claim. It is open to the RPD not to give evidentiary weight to assessments or reports if underlying elements are found not credible, and the panel so finds.27\nA Decision by another RPD Member\n[90] The panel notes that in the January 26, 2011 decision by another RPD Member 28 the claimant's son, XXXX XXXX XXXX, was found not to be a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection because the nature of the risk was determined to be one that was faced generally by others in the country.\n[91] The son alleged in his RPD claim that he had been a victim of extortion by gang members while his mother was paying them money also from her business. Eventually he left El Salvador after a further warning by gang members in which gun shots were fired at him from a passing vehicle. He unsuccessfully applied for a Canadian visitor visa in December 2004\/2005, but used his pre-existing US visa to travel to the USA in January 2005.\n[92] After a brief sojourn there he came to Canada in XXXX 2005 but delayed making his claim for protection until December 2008, almost 4 years later. The RPD Member \"... Accepted that the claimant was personally subjected to extortion demands, death threats, and physical violence at the hands of members of the MS criminal gang\".29 Furthermore, the Member made no further comment about the delay in making a claim in Canada and thus drew no adverse inference regarding that matter .\n[93] It is trite to suggest that each claim is and must be decided upon its merits. The RPD member clearly found the claimant's son, in the other case, to be credible regarding his testimony; however, the present panel does not find the present claimant to be credible in her allegations, and thus rejects her claim in its entirety.\n[94] The panel has reviewed the disclosed decision but note that it is settled law that refugee claims are to be considered on their own merits, and the fact that similar claims with other Members have been accepted as credible is not binding on the RPD as it must assess each claim individually.30\n[95] The panel also notes, as an aside, that the present claimant made no reference to her son's problems in her written narrative. When the panel questioned her about the omission she said, \"I didn't have it in my mind.\"\nThe Failure to Claim in the USA\n[96] The failure of someone seeking refugee protection in Canada to claim refugee status in the US if they lived there first \"can be fatal to the applicant's claim,\" \"absent a satisfactory explanation for the delay.\"31 Given the length of time that elapsed and Ms. XXXX XXXX XXXX inaction, it is appropriate to consider her reasons for not claiming asylum.\n[97] She alleges that she always wanted to come to Canada, yet she sojourned in the USA for over three years, from XXXX 2013 until XXXX 2016. She overstayed her US visitor visa by two years and nine months. And she only came to Canada when her 88-year-old mother was sick in a Toronto hospital and when the claimant obtained, just two weeks previously, a letter from hospital staff recommending that the claimant be given favourable treatment in granting a Canadian visitor visa to visit her mother.\n[98] The claimant testified that she had been preparing to come to Canada to request asylum when her mother fell ill in Toronto. She also testified that she remained in the USA because her daughter, XXXX, was having problems with her former spouse who was abusive. The claimant presented a copy of a State of Texas protective order regarding the daughter's complaint about her ex-spouse; that document is dated XXXX XXXX, 2013.32\n[99] Given that the US authorities have issued a protective order for the daughter, the panel finds that the claimant has failed to explain why there was any urgent need for her to remain in the USA after XXXX XXXX, 2013. The panel therefore determines that the claimant's prolonged stay in the USA, after her visitor status had expired in or about XXXX 2013, and for almost 3 years until she entered Canada, undermines her credibility regarding the assertions of problems in El Salvador.\n[100] The claimant had ample time to consider and make an asylum claim in the USA where she has a daughter and various grandchildren. She made no effort to do so. It is not credible that she was ignorant of the process, as she alleges, given she was residing with a daughter who was herself seeking permanent residence in the USA. 33 In addition, the claimant was in frequent telephone contact two or three times a week with her son in Canada who had made the unsuccessful refugee claim here, so he must surely have advised her about making a refugee claim in general terms.\n[101] Canada is not obliged to find in favour of a claimant, if that claimant has failed, before coming to Canada, to take advantage of the opportunity to seek protection in other Convention signatory nations, especially in cases where there is a prolonged delay before arriving in Canada.34 The panel finds that the length of time the claimant remained illegally in the United States before coming to Canada to make her refugee claims is significant.\n[102] The panel takes a negative inference from this. The panel finds that the actions of this particular claimant; i.e., living illegally in a country for so long and therefore, risking deportation, demonstrates a lack of subjective fear, which undermines the credibility and well foundedness of the claimant's fear. The Federal Court has observed35:\nAlthough refugee claimants are not obliged to seek asylum in the first country they enter after flight, the failure to claim is considered a relevant consideration to impugn the credibility of a claimant, provided it is not the sole basis of the credibility finding (Gavryushenko v Canada (MCI), [2000] FCJ No 1209, at para 11). It should also be noted that the United States is a designated country under section 101(1)(e) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 (see Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, SOR\/2002-227, s 159.3), and therefore claimants arriving through the US are not normally eligible for referral to the Board. In the circumstances, the Board did in fact consider the Applicant's explanation that he thought refugees were ill-treated in the US, but did not accept it, and considered it to be one element amongst many that impugned the Applicant's credibility. On this point alone, I do not think the Board's reasoning was unreasonable.\n[103] The panel finds therefore that the claimant's extended stay in the USA, and failure to claim asylum while there during a period of over three years, undermines the credibility of her assertions about the alleged problems in El Salvador.\nSummary\n[104] It is abundantly clear to the panel that the claimant has endeavoured to join her family members in Canada for many years. She was excluded from Canada after being refused permanent residency in 2003 regarding the failed spousal sponsorship.36 She was forced to return to El Salvador, and could only visit her family in Canada on an occasional basis, even when her elderly mother, now aged 92, was ailing.\n[105] The panel agrees with the Minister's submissions that the claimant's initial plan in the summer of 2016 was merely to obtain a visitor visa, but then \"at some point [she] realized this would not be possible or simply changed her plan\".37 The panel also agrees with the Minister that the claimant does not have a subjective fear of persecution in El Salvador, and should be determined to be neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. Given that this claim has been analysed and found to have no nexus, the panel finds that this is further reason to make a strong negative credibility inference.\n[106] The panel concludes and finds that the claimant has failed to adduce sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence that any of the alleged problems with the Maras in El Salvador ever took place.\n[107] The panel is mindful of the decision of Mr. Justice Hugessen of the Federal Court of Appeal in Urbanek,38 wherein he states:\nThe appellant's position is based on a fundamental misconception of Canada's refugee system; the purpose of the system is to provide safe haven to those who genuinely need it and not to give a quick and convenient route to landed status for immigrants who cannot or will not obtain it in the usual way.\n[108] The panel is of the view that the claimant is in a similar situation as the appellant in Urbanek.\nCONCLUSION\n[109] For the reasons above, the panel concludes that the claimant is not a Convention refugee under section 96 of IRPA or a person in need of protection within the meaning of section 97 (1)(a) or (b) of IRPA. Accordingly, the panel rejects her claim.\n(signed)\n\"John Kivlichan\"\nJohn Kivlichan\nSeptember 4, 2019\nDate\n1 Exhibit 6\n2 Exhibit 12, Submissions of June 17, 2019.\n3 Exhibit 2\n4 Exhibit 4\n5 Exhibit 11, dated June 6, 2019.\n6 Exhibit 8.

Clark\nConseil du (de la) ministre\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] This is the decision as it relates to XXXX XXXX XXXX (the claimant) born XXXX 10, 1970 is a citizen of Pakistan, 1 who seeks refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).2\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] Details of his allegations can be found in his basis of claim (boc) form.3 The claimant refers to a lengthy narrative and an amendment to the narrative.4 To summarize the claimant faces persecution from unknown individuals he believes may either be extremists or criminals. The threats arise due to his employment as a XXXX, his building a Shia shrine and he is being sought by Government internal security due to his seeking refugee protection in Canada.\nANALYSIS\n[3] The determinative issues are credibility and internal flight alternative.\nCredibility\n[4] Credibility is an issue to be considered in all claims before the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (\"the Board\"). In order to determine whether the claim is well-founded, the panel must find, on a balance of probabilities, that the evidence is credible and trustworthy. A claimant's testimony is presumed to be true unless there are valid reasons to doubt its truthfulness.5\n[5] An important indicator of credibility is the consistency with which a witness has told a particular story. The existence of contradictions or inconsistencies in the evidence can be a valid basis for a finding of lack of credibility.6 This also applies to omissions in the BOC, port of entry (POE) or interview notes, and at the hearing of the claim.7 Overall I found the claimant to be a difficult witness, often having to be asked to answer questions as he failed to provide information, I find that in this case there were issues that undermined the claimant's credibility. The claimant's behaviour is not consistent with there being a credible threat against him in Pakistan. There were some discrepancies in the evidence that were not reasonably explained that also affected the claimant's credibility.\nShrine\n[6] As it relates to his fear due his uncle's conversion to Shia from Sunni religion, and the claimant's building of a Shia shrine on behalf of the uncle, I find I am in agreement with the Minister, the claimant's testimony about who was threatening him lacked clarity. I find that his testimony that it was Laskar Tayyba or Jama-ud-dawa to be speculative at best. The claimant linked the threats via a local madrassa run by XXXX XXXX XXXX.8 His responses to the questions posed by the Minister and his own Counsel lacked an explanation of how he came to this conclusion. As a man of law, one would expect the claimant to provide something more than he had heard about the link or that everyone in the area knew of the link between the two groups.\n[7] I note the claimant has provide a statement signed by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX9 in regards to the building of the shrine. Further, he provided a statement from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX confirming that the claimant received \"many times these people try to kill Mr. XXXX XXXX.\"10 This appeared to be different from the claimant's testimony of what occurred as it relates to the building of the uncle's Shrine. He had allegedly received threats from extremists were based on the building of the shrine in 2014 and occurred sometime in XXXX or XXXX after the construction of the shrine began.\n[8] The claimant received threats in regards to the construction in person he was stopped and threatened by militants. The claimant complained to the police and the police did nothing. The claimant testified he received more verbal threats, but the militants left after the threats were delivered.\n[9] The threats only occurred in XXXX where the Shia shrine was to be built. I asked if the claimant if he was approached after the threats of XXXX\/XXXX 2014, he testified he was not contacted. I asked if anyone else in his family had been contacted or threatened as it relates to the shrine, the claimant testified in XXXX or XXXX 2014, his cousin was threatened. The claimant testified the cousin was threatened when he attended the construction area of the Shrine that was the last threats received. The claimant testified the shrine was incomplete as the building stopped due to financial reasons. The construction stopped sometime in 2015.\n[10] I note that during this time the claimant stated due to the stress of the threats and mental health issues, he travelled to the United Kingdom. However, the claimant returned to Pakistan, despite his testimony that his wife and son were threatened robbed in XXXX 2014, and he was mentioned by the perpetrators. His wife had telephoned him while he was in the United Kingdom and advised him of the incident at the market, where her purse and cellular phone were stolen and threats were made against him. I asked why he returned to Pakistan given he was safe in the United Kingdom, he testified that he had to find out who the people were and inform his department of the incident. I reject this explanation, he had stated he received threats, his wife had been threatened as had his children, and he was safe in the United Kingdom if he believed the threats to be true his return from the United Kingdom lacked credibility. This is not an uneducated individual, he is highly educated and travelled yet when he was threatened despite being safe in the United Kingdom he elected to return to Pakistan, to the same job, same area, as to where the threats occurred.\n[11] I, also, do not find that the claimant is still at risk due to the building of this shrine, the claimant testified all the threats arose while the building was under construction, and this had stopped. The threats are limited to one area of XXXX and for one reason which appear to be localized to a certain time of 2014.\n[12] On a forward-looking assessment I do not find the claimant would be at serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, and that, on a balance of probabilities, he would not personally be subjected to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture upon return to Pakistan as it relates to the building of the shrine.\nSur Place claim\n[13] On the claimant's personal profile as a XXXX XXXX in Pakistan who faces persecution or a risk to his life due to this profile and his seeking refugee protection in Canada, I find that again I am in agreement with the Minister that the claimant's personal profile is not one that would cause him to be targeted upon his return to Pakistan.\n[14] The claimant testified to his being fired as a XXXX in XXXX 2018, however the claimant filed an amendment to his narrative, indicating that Pakistan internal state security are actively seeking his return due to his having sought refugee protection in Canada.11\nStatements of Wife\n[15] I find the wife's various statements submitted to the Board in support of her husband's claim, or the police seemed to contradict themselves. The wife provides a letter dated February 15, 2018.12 She states an incident that occurred on XXXX XXXX, 2017, while on her way to celebrate a birthday party at her sister-in-law's house, the car driven by her brother, XXXX XXXX, and with her children was pulled over by unknown men who threatened the family with a gun, identifying her husband and demanding to know where he lived. The men were chased off by nearby drivers who stopped to see what had occurred. In an application to the police,13 the wife identified this incident but put the date as XXXX XXXX, 2014, same time, same participants, and the same outcome I note she filed an \"Application seeking to register a case and provision of security\"14 in this application she cites the incident as occurring on XXXX XXXX XXXX\/17 at approximately XXXX p.m. The wife identifies that a request was made to the local police by way of written application, it appears there were two applications filed, one for each identical incident. I find the wife not credible as it relates to either the 2014 or 2017 incident(s). I find the incident or incidents were created to support this claim.\nXXXX 2019\n[16] The claimant testified that his wife was taken by members of the Pakistan's internal security, questioned about the claimant, was allowed to leave but threats were uttered as it relates to the claimant seeking protection in Canada. The claimant testified that the wife was taken to an army encampment and that is when she realized the men were from the security. I noted to the claimant that his wife's affidavit does not indicates she was taken and questioned at an army15 encampment. The wife provided her statement that indicates while at home she was approached, asked the whereabouts of the claimant and asked to go with them, she refused to go with them, and the men were rude to her. The wife states, \"It appeared from their very descriptions that they were members of the undercover agency.\"16 She and her son were then taken to an interrogation center, where two officers questioned her, asking why her husband was in Canada and why he was not returning home. She was told there was a complaint from the higher authority, the men did not appear to identify themselves to her as members of the ISI but it was due to their discussions, she became aware of who the men were . In support of the incident, a local neighbour of the wife's mother provided a support letter. I find I am in agreement with the Minister about this incident, how would the affiant know by looking at them they were internal security, I find that much like the XXXX 2014 or 2017, the alleged threats by unknown security men in XXXX 2019 incident was created to show the claimant could not return to Pakistan and be safe anywhere. I find that the claimant was embellishing his evidence in order to create the impression that he had attract negative attention at the hands the internal security of Pakistan.\n[17] I find that the claimant has not established that he would face persecution upon his return as being seen as a returnee to Pakistan. I do not find the wife's allegations of threats from the internal security of Pakistan to be credible. I find that nothing in the claimant's personal profile while in Canada to be an indication that he has been outspoken against the authorities in Pakistan. His firing from his employment, is due to his not returning to work. There were appeals he could have file, and he sought to have his leave extended which was denied, this is why he was fired.17\n[18] I note the evidence does identify the person who travel in violation Pakistan law can be held upon their return to Pakistan.18 This claimant left the country with a valid passport and had a valid visa for travelling. The evidence provides that not all returnees are held or questioned upon return to Pakistan, only if they are being deported, had criminal charges or convictions in another jurisdiction, as relates to failed claimants,\nNo punitive measure is taken against failed refugee claimant[s] unless FIA official[s] [are] able to find some lapse or default on the part of [the] returning national['s] ... documentation. The life of an individual deportee, and certainly that of a person guilty of [a] crime overseas, however, is made horrible by FIA\/other agencies. Criminal cases are instituted again[st] them which linger on for years without any progress or decision, evidence is not brought to Court by prosecution and sometimes even the investigation officer does not appear in Court in spite of summons by [the] Court, causing adjournments and harassment. At times [the] Court has to issue bailable warrants to arrest the investigation officers and bring [them] to Court, but this is rare (12 June 2003).19\nProfile\n[19] I find that the claimant has established his profile as a former XXXX. So that leads me ask in a forward looking manner would the claimant face a personalized risk due to his profile. I find that as a former XXXX, that the claimant would not be a target. I note that documentary evidence states that, security for XXXX, XXXX, prosecutors and witnesses is a major issue. People belonging to all four categories have been executed in Pakistan for taking up a certain case. Even the police themselves come under attack by rogue elements, the very provider of security for said individuals.20\nCivil society organizations reported judges were reluctant to exonerate individuals accused of blasphemy, fearing vigilante violence. The media and the public generally considered the high courts and the Supreme Court credible.21\nMany lower courts are reportedly affected by corruption and their judges are said to be subjected to intimidation by local officials, powerful individuals and extremists.22\nJudges and lawyers involved in the prosecution of religiously-motivated crimes are reportedly prevented from operating effectively due to the absence of or the inadequateness of protection of their individual safety. 85 Members of extremist groups are reported to frequently use threats and intimidation against judges and other court officials involved in first instance court proceedings in blasphemy cases, resulting in trials being delayed and drawn-out, with the accused often subjected to long periods in pre-trial detention.23\nIn April 2013, the UN Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers reported that the climate of fear in which the judiciary operates in Pakistan negatively affects the delivery of justice because judges are reluctant to condemn suspected religious extremists for fear of reprisals. UN Human Rights Council, Report of the Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers, Addendum: Mission to Pakistan.24\nThe IHRC\/AHRC fact-finding report stated 'Judges have been physically attacked and threatened even during court hearings, particularly by members of their own profession who are supported by religious organisations such as Khatme Nabuwat. In this climate, understandably, they are afraid to hear cases for fear of reprisal.25\nChristian Solidarity Worldwide (CSW) published a written statement on the situation of human rights, judges and human rights defenders in Pakistan in September 2015. While mainly referring to lawyers dealing with blasphemy cases, the statement also notes that the harassment of lawyers in Pakistan appears to be \"systematic\" and therefore is likely to extend to most lawyers involved with sensitive cases:\n\"According to CSW's partners in Pakistan, the situation for lawyers and judges has worsened in recent years. The volatile security situation, growing religious fundamentalism, and complex political circumstances in Pakistan make their work very dangerous. Activists, lawyers and, district level judiciary have been threatened and killed throughout Pakistan, and those responsible for these violations continue to enjoy widespread impunity. Threats to HRDs [Human Rights Defenders] stem from multiple quarters, including state and non-state actors and religious and political groups, and in some cases the local community, district administration and police. [...]26\nThe CSW continues to describe the current situation of judges as follows:\n\"Judges also face significant challenges, which can undermine their independence and that of the legal system. Several judges have been physically attacked and threatened with torture even during the court hearings. Many judges are afraid to hear prominent minority cases for fear of reprisal, making progress in these cases painfully slow. In 2011 Pervez Ali Shah, the judge who sentenced Governor Salman Taseer's murderer to death, had to leave Pakistan following harassment and death threats. In August 2015, district and sessions judge Tahir Khan Niazi was shot and later died after an attack by Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP) in Rawalpindi. [...] The government of Pakistan fails to provide protection for and guarantee the human rights of lawyers, judges and human rights defenders operating in the country. The harassment of lawyers and judges violates fundamental human rights and undermines the rule of law and the independence and integrity of the courts, as well as the democratic development of Pakistani society.27\"\n[20] However, this is not the situation of the claimant, his cases were civil, he did not identify any blasphemy cases, as the Minister points out he had one criminal case and he is no longer a XXXX. So if he were pursued due XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, he has been outside of Pakistan for a number of years, and even if one were to accept that unknown criminals or persons seeking revenge XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 2016,28 there is little evidence of ongoing threats from unknown criminals. I do not find the claimant has established that these unknown criminals have the means to locate him outside of his area where he sat XXXX.\n[21] I have considered Counsel's submissions that he would have to seek employment upon return, and due to his lengthy XXXX career he would most probably seek a position as a XXXX. However, the evidence does not support all XXXX are subjected to threats and violence. The evidence, including the claimant's documentary evidence, support the Minister's submissions that the claimant as a XXXXor former XXXX XXXX would not be a target as the XXXX that were targeted were outside of the area in which the claimant resided or held XXXX. I note the evidence identifies human rights XXXX, XXXX who hear cases of terrorism, or high-profile cases are targets or XXXX and XXXX in high risk areas, such as Christian areas or dispute territories in Pakistan.29\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[22] The question of whether an internal flight alternative exists is an integral part of the Convention refugee definition.30 I must apply the two-prong test established by Thirunavukkarasu.31\n(1) The panel must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an Internal Flight Alternative exists.\n(2) Moreover, conditions in the part of the country considered to be an Internal Flight Alternative must be such that it would not be unreasonable, in all circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for him to seek refuge there.32\n[23] Once the issue of an internal flight alternative is raised, the onus is on the refugee claimant to show that the option does not exist, by establishing that either of the two Thirunavukkarasu criteria is not met. The Federal Court of Appeal in Thirunavukkarasu stated that an applicant only needs to show that there is a serious possibility of being persecuted in the new location.\n[24] The claimant testified that he cannot live in either IFA location of Islamabad or Karachi due to his profile as a XXXX and due to the building of the shrine and threats from the militants this appears to be solely in the area of XXXX, which is quite distant from Islamabad and\/or Karachi. I have discussed the credibility problems as it relates to the shrine, and the claimant as mentioned is no longer a XXXX. I do not find him credible as it relates to being pursued by Pakistan's internal security, so I find that his objection based on his past actions are not applicable to either IFA location. The claimant did raise the obstacle to his capacity to work and earn a living in Pakistan, in that he would have to find employment as a XXXX, and then he would be targeted due to his profession. I disagree. The claimant's evidence does not indicate that every XXXX in Pakistan is a target, there is nothing before me to suggest that his work as a XXXX would bring him to the attention of the militants or other terrorist groups, any more so than XXXX currently living and working in Pakistan.\n[25] I have considered the claimant's mental state, he experienced depression and post-traumatic stress due to the situation in Pakistan.33 He sought treatment in Canada but there is evidence he also was seeking and obtaining treatment in Pakistan. Nothing before me suggests he would not obtain the necessary treatment or that he would be denied treatment if needed.\n[26] As mentioned, there is little evidence that the individuals in XXXX or the unknown criminals have the means, or willingness to locate the claimant in either IFA location.\n[27] As to the second prong of the test, the population of Pakistan is over 207 million. Ninety-five percent of the population are Sunni Muslims, which is the religion of the claimant. The proposed IFA is the largest cities in Pakistan with a population of over a million people (Karachi is much larger with a population of over 14 million). All of this provides a significant degree of anonymity for the claimant and significantly reduces the likelihood of the claimant being located in the proposed IFA.\n[28] There is no evidence to establish that the claimant and his family who are presently in XXXX, in Punjab state would not be able to physically travel to the proposed IFA. The l claimant has previously travelled within Pakistan and has travelled into and out of the country on multiple trips. The claimant, his wife and children are all citizens of Pakistan. The available evidence reveals that the claimant and his family have freedom of internal movement in Pakistan as well as the freedom to travel internationally and return to Pakistan. The claimant is an educated individual.34 The claimant has demonstrated an ability to undertake significant travel in relocating great distances as he has relocated to Canada. The claimant speaks Urdu, the official language of Pakistan, and English.35 The claimant has many years of work experience, including experience in Canada. The evidence before the panel does not establish that the claimant is financially unable to relocate within Pakistan. The claimant also has some supportive family members in Pakistan such as father, siblings, and in-laws. The claimant has not presented evidence that he would be unable to locate housing or address other needs in either of the IFA locations.\n[29] I have considered the claimant's personal situation and the objective documentary evidence at this hearing. Based on all of the above, I find that the claimant has failed to establish on a balance of probabilities that it would be unreasonable, or result in undue hardship, for the claimant to relocate to the proposed internal flight alternative in Karachi or Islamabad.\nCONCLUSION\n[30] For all of the reasons outlined herein, and based on the totality of the evidence, I find that the claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, and that, on a balance of probabilities, he would not personally be subjected to a danger of torture or, to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or, punishment upon return to Pakistan.\n[31] Therefore this claim is rejected.\n(signed)\n\"B.

Her father came to Canada in 2003 seeking refugee status. After obtaining status in Canada, XXXX became part of a family sponsorship by her father initiated in 2012 and approved in XXXX 2017.\n[5] XXXX started university in XXXX in 2012 and in 2014 she became politically active. She joined the XXXX XXXX in 2014 and the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX party in 2015. She participated in student marches and in 2017 began broadcasting through her program on a XXXX radio station as well as joining the student XXXX party. On XXXX XXXX, 2017, XXXX was involved in a student march and she was injured by a tear gas can that had been fired at the crowd during the demonstration. On XXXX XXXX, 2017, she received a threatening note delivered to her in the school cafeteria.\n[6] On XXXX XXXX, 2017 XXXX received a second threatening note and on XXXX XXXX, 2017 she was assaulted by two police officers while exiting the XXXX party building. She was treated for a broken XXXX in the hospital.\n[7] In XXXX 2017, the claimant's sponsorship was completed and her visa was issued on XXXX XXXX, 2017. XXXX married her boyfriend on XXXX XXXX, 2017 after her visa to Canada was issued. She alleges that she was unaware of the effect that this would have on her eligibility to be sponsored to Canada and engaged in the marriage without consulting her father or legal counsel, although her mother knew about the marriage.\n[8] XXXX and her mother left Colombia and arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2017. On arrival, the claimant learned that she was no longer eligible for permanent residency under the family class sponsorship, so after entry she filed for refugee protection. She fears that due to her political opinion and her desire to participate in student marches demanding change in Venezuela, she will face persecution on return.\n[9] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the joined claimant, was a student at the university with XXXX, and they met on XXXX XXXX, 2016. He joined the XXXX party in XXXX 2015 and participated in student protests. He was involved with organizing demonstrations and logistics for assisting other student members, according to the claimant. He was a coordinator with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX from 2014 onwards as well. He was present on XXXX XXXX, 2017 when a tear gas canister injured XXXX and also present on XXXX XXXX, 2017 when she was assaulted by the police.\n[10] On XXXX XXXX, 2017, after XXXX had left and encountered problems entering Canada, the claimant participated in a protest. Following the protest the claimant was followed by two collectivos who assaulted him on entry to his building. He suffered a fracture XXXX, injuries to his face and a dislocated XXXX. He was fired from his XXXX position on XXXX XXXX, 2017. On XXXX XXXX, 2017, collectivos came to the claimant's home and seized his laptop and XXXX papers. The claimant and his family left their home and went to live with his godfather on October 14, 2017. When his location was learned and threatening graffiti appeared on the house, the claimant relocated to his grandmother's home.\n[11] On XXXX XXXX, 2017, the claimant fled from Venezuela and came to Canada via the United States. He fears returning to Venezuela as he believes that he has been targeted by the Madura government due to his political activities.\nDETERMINATION\n[12] I find that the claimants are neither Convention refugee nor persons in need of protection.\nAnalysis\n[13] The determinative issues in this claim are credibility, identity and the well-foundedness of the claim.\nIdentity\n[14] The claimant's national identities are established by their Venezuelan passports5 and supported by their marriage certificate,6 and XXXX original student card,7 and the panel finds that they are citizens of Colombia.\n[15] The claimants' political identities and profiles are analysed below.\nCredibility\n[16] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are indeed true unless there is valid reason to doubt their veracity.8 The determination as to whether a claimant's evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities.9\n[17] Overall, significant credibility issues arose with the evidence in support of the political profiles of the claimants, and with the evidence on the events as relayed. The panel believes that the claimants have embellished and fabricated evidence to bolster their claim.\n[18] Counsel provided lengthy post hearing submissions,10 which address some of the areas of embellished testimony, and these have been carefully considered. Counsel reminds the panel of the obligation to consider any remaining credible evidence, after dismissing evidence that appears embellished, in rendering a decision. Counsel submits that the remaining evidence is sufficient to establish the well foundedness of the claim.\n[19] The panel does not find that the claimants have established a well-founded fear based on their political identities or any profile, after consideration of the totality of the evidence for the following reasons.\nFailure to establish their political identities with reliable evidence:\n[20] Both claimants testified that they were members of the XXXX party, which they both coincidentally joined in XXXX 2015, prior to their meeting in 2016. Both claimants alleged that due to their activities and roles with the organization of demonstrations on behalf of their party, they have a risk profile upon return.\n[21] Both of the claimants provided laminated membership cards in support of this membership. Copies of the cards are contained in documentary evidence11 and the original cards were available at the hearing. The panel noticed some irregularities between the original cards that were provided, which gave rise to concerns about their reliability.\n[22] The two membership cards had distinct differences. XXXX card had different corner edges than XXXX, under the laminated cover, suggesting a different form of cutting was used, yet they were issued in the same month at the same location.\n[23] XXXX testified that they make the card while you wait, on a machine in the back of the waiting room. She stated that she provided a photograph and information and then they laminate it and handed it back to her.\n[24] The panel also noted that XXXX membership card had a stamp on the back of it and XXXX did not. The inkjet colour differed on each of the emblems at the top left corner of each of the membership cards, and the size of the photograph used on the membership cards differed.\n[25] As both cards were made and issued in XXXX 2015, at the same location according to the claimants, the claimants were unable to provide a reasonable explanation for the notable differences between the cards.\n[26] Furthermore, while XXXX testified that the procedure for obtaining the card is instantaneous, and stated that she provided the photograph and then the card is created and laminated while you wait; the joined claimant testified that he took his membership card to be laminated himself.\n[27] When asked by counsel why she happened to have a photo in her wallet when she went to the office to apply to be an XXXX member, the claimant testified that she always carries one around with her.\n[28] In explanation for the numerous differences in the membership cards issued contemporaneously, XXXX testified that the XXXX party administrators are unsophisticated and that everyone's card is different. The panel does not find it reasonable that a political opposition group, allegedly under attack by collectivos and government officials, would not take some care in creating membership cards and researching individuals who apply for these cards to ensure that they are not being infiltrated by government and police. The panel draws an adverse finding on the credibility of these cards as establishing that the claimants had a profile as members of the XXXX party, and was not convinced that they were legitimately issued cards at all.\n[29] It was also notable that XXXX could not remember the address of the XXXX party yet testified to going there two-three times per week. She knew which neighbourhood it was located in, describing it as XXXX XXXX XXXX. It would be reasonable for her to know the address of a place that she frequented over 150 times before coming to Canada; however, that was not determinative.\n[30] XXXX further testified that all of the students are members of the XXXX party and confirmed that she did not hold any position in the party, as she just volunteered. She testified that in her volunteer activities she assisted in getting people to certain locations, and made sure that the placards were available as needed. Her group of approximately 20 students, used social media and flyers to inform groups of details of the demonstrations. There were thousands involved in volunteer activities amongst the student body according to her evidence. XXXX contends that the Maduro government tracks social media and therefore would have known of her activities and seek her out.\n[31] Overall, the panel does not find that XXXX established that she has a political profile that would create a heightened risk for her in Venezuela beyond the risk faced by all protesters, demonstrators, and students involved in anti-Maduro activities, who may be randomly affected by the government response to these anti-government protests. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions have participated in protests against Maduro over the past years, and continue to do so. While there have been some deaths and injuries from engaging in these demonstrations, XXXX has not demonstrated that her involvement as a student volunteer in these protests organized by the XXXX party has put her at any greater risk than any other member, if indeed she is even a genuine member of the party.\n[32] XXXX last attended school in 2013 and has been working for a XXXX as a XXXX from 2013-2017. As already discussed he alleges to have joined the XXXX party in XXXX 2015 and his membership card was distinctly different from XXXX.\n[33] Although the claimant had not been a student for many years, he also alleged that he was an active member of the XXXX XXXX XXXX since 2014, as he wanted to advocate for student rights. After several questions from counsel he remembered that these positions overlapped.\n[34] XXXX alleges that he was assaulted on XXXX XXXX, 2017 due to his participation in a demonstration as a \"volunteer coordinator\" with the XXXX party for these demonstrations. When asked to provide details of what the claimant actually co-ordinated and for whom, he became vague, repetitive, and was clearly embellishing his position.\n[35] He started with a role that involved arranging access for protesters and ambulances for demonstration locations, with the guidance from the XXXX party leaders. The panel noted that there was no letter from any party leader indicating that he had a particular role in co-ordinating, and the claimant himself had trouble spontaneously naming the secretary of the party to whom he allegedly reported his assault, and hesitated when providing the names of two of his colleagues. Later in questioning the claimant remembered the name of the general secretary.\n[36] XXXX was specifically asked about the chain of communication from which he received his orders as a volunteer coordinator, and he could not specifically answer. He provided evasive answers like \"I get instructions from the top down,\" and while asked for specifics of the chain of command, the claimant repeated that a political leader would point out the meeting point.\n[37] Counsel tried to clarify his testimony around his role with the demonstrations and the XXXX party and more evasive evidence emerged. While he claimed to be integrally involved in coordinating, and communicating by text with the organizers, he had no idea of how locations for demonstrations were selected and he was vague on the exchanges in these texts. At one point he testified that anyone who joins the XXXX party becomes a coordinating member, so he had effectively been one since XXXX 2015 when he joined.\n[38] His evidence undermines the allegation that he had a heightened risk due to these coordinating activities, and further undermined the risk and profile of the joined claimant. If everyone who joins the party is a coordinating member, then, even if the claimant was genuinely a member, he had no greater risk profile than every other member, and according to XXXX, every student is a member.\n[39] Overall, the joined claimant offered poor evidence on his political identity, and a claim may be rejected as lacking in credibility if the claimant's testimony is found to be incoherent or vague,12 or lacking in sufficient knowledge or detail reasonably expected of a person in the claimant's situation. XXXX did not establish with consistent and convincing evidence that he had any particular coordinating role in the demonstrations, and if he even attended, he certainly did not establish any particular profile that puts him at risk on return.\n[40] XXXX also alleged that his family home was raided on XXXX XXXX, 2017 by armed collectivos, after him for his political activities. In oral testimony the claimant stated that only his laptop was taken from the home. He was asked twice. This gave rise to an inconsistency with his narrative where he stated that his laptop and papers from the XXXX had been taken.\n[41] The claimant seemed to remember, only when prompted, that he had things other than his laptop taken as set out in the narrative. The claimant was not convincing with his evidence in this area of questioning either.\n[42] While counsel refers to a newspaper article where the claimant is pictured with a bleeding XXXX,13 the panel notes that the original of this was never produced and the copies that have been provided in evidence do not contain a photograph of the claimant.14\n[43] It is also noted that neither claimant had any problems leaving Venezuela on their own validly issued passports, another indicator that the government of Venezuela is not seeking them out. They have family members in Venezuela who have had no problems since they left Venezuela either. No evidence was offered on any follow-up on XXXX after the alleged confiscation of his laptop, or the graffiti at his godfather's home. The evidence in its totality around profile does not establish that these claimants have a heightened risk profile if returned to Venezuela, or held any position of profile in the XXXX party, if they were members at all.\n[44] Neither claimant was in a particular rush to leave Venezuela either. XXXX had a visa issued for entry to Canada in early XXXX 2017, and left in XXXX 2017. XXXX held a valid visa to the United States and did not leave until the end of XXXX 2017. He claimed that finances prevented his departure; however, he was financed by his wife's family in November, and if his life was truly in danger in September, the panel would have expected evidence about how the financial capability of his wife's family changed so drastically in six weeks.\nFailure to establish pivotal events in Venezuela occurred as relayed:\nXXXX XXXX, 2017 demonstration\n[45] The XXXX XXXX, 2017 canister injury. Both claimants alleged that XXXX was injured at a demonstration when a tear gas canister was fired into a crowd of demonstrators and it exploded near XXXX injuring her XXXX. No medical treatment was required. While XXXX indicated in her narrative that she had been beaten by police prior to this incident,15 XXXX testified when asked, that she had not been beaten by the police prior to this incident, raising internal inconsistency on police interactions. He also testified that they were not separated when the tear gas was fired and when he was asked to explain his wife's narrative that indicates that they were separated, the claimant had no reasonable explanation for the disparity. The panel finds that XXXX evidence of police beating prior to the tear gas was fabricated to bolster her claim. She did not spontaneously mention this event in her testimony, and the joined claimant testified that there was no police beating prior to the canister incident.\n[46] The panel has given the claimants the benefit of the doubt that during a demonstration a tear gas canister was fired randomly into the crowd; however, the panel draws an adverse finding on the other details of the event including police interaction and believes it to be fabricated to bolster the claim.\nXXXX XXXX,, 2017 assault of XXXX\n[47] XXXX testified that she was assaulted on XXXX XXXX, 2017 while exiting the XXXX party house with her husband and a friend. She alleges that she received two threatening notes prior to the assault as a result of her political activities. They were destroyed and not reported to the school.\n[48] She writes in her narrative that on XXXX XXXX, 2017 the two advancing police officers started beating up \"some of the people,\" and that the female officer beat her injuring her XXXX.16 XXXX has provided a medical report in support of her XXXX injury.17\n[49] A photograph is provided18 taken in the hospital by XXXX mother. XXXX was asked if he knew why the joined claimant's mother did not provide any witness testimony on the event. Given that XXXX mother was present in Venezuela when all of these events occurred and was at the hospital taking pictures, her absence was notable. Her testimony was a critical piece of corroborating evidence, and as the hearing took place over three sessions, there was ample opportunity for her to attend and clarify. It would be reasonable that XXXX parents would be interested in securing her safety in Canada if she is genuinely at risk on return. XXXX did not know why she did not testify in support.\n[50] Counsel suggests in her submissions that there could be many reasons why counsel may chose not to call a witness, she may be nervous or babble, she writes.19 Given the inconsistencies that arose early on in the hearing, a reliable corroboration of events was essential for establishing the events as relayed, given the challenges that the claimants faced in so doing. In addition, the issue of nervousness or babbling can be alleviated by at least providing a sworn Affidavit, which was also notably absent in support. Where a claimant's story has been found to be implausible or otherwise lacking in credibility,20 a lack of documentary corroboration, or a lack of effort to obtain the documentation,21 can be a valid consideration for purposes of assessing credibility.\n[51] XXXX, who stated to have been present at the XXXX XXXX assault, was asked several questions around the events which gave rise to internally inconsistent evidence between the two joined claimants. He did however state that the attacker yelled nothing personal to his wife, just general statements like \"opposition scum.\"\n[52] When asked, XXXX testified that his wife was the only one assaulted in this incident. This raised an internal inconsistency with XXXX sworn narrative, where at paragraph 17 XXXX states otherwise. When the narrative was read to XXXX he changed his testimony and stated that actually two people were assaulted.\n[53] Given the use by XXXX of the term \"some people\" were attacked, even the amended testimony to \"two\" people did not have the ring of consistency to it. The claimant's inability to spontaneously recall the pivotal event for XXXX, undermined the genuineness of the event.\n[54] In addition, the claimant did not spontaneously recall how long his wife was hospitalized for (she was released the same day according to the report date);22 nor this assault on his wife at all, in his interview with Officer XXXX XXXX on December 8, 2017.23 XXXX was asked by the Immigration Officer to describe other incidents that occurred prior to his problem on XXXX XXXX, 2017, and he spontaneously referred to the XXXX XXXX, 2017 rally with the tear gas thrown into the crowd, and made no mention of the more recent event, and violent assault on XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2017.24\n[55] The claimant explained his forgetfulness with the Officer as nervousness. The panel does not accept it as reasonable that the claimant would forget a pivotal event, a violent assault on his wife by police officers, due to nervousness and then remember a less significant event, which occurred two months prior to the pivotal event, with clarity.\n[56] The panel finds, overall, that the claimants have fabricated the XXXX XXXX, 2017 assault on XXXX to support their refugee claims. If the medical note25 provided in support of this event is not fraudulent, it is insufficient to establish the events as relayed by the claimants. It merely establishes that XXXX injured her XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2017 and needed plastic surgery for repair. There is no mention to the injury being caused by an assault and no other reliable corroborating evidence of an assault by officers has been provided to rescue the poor oral testimony around the events.\nXXXX XXXX assault of XXXX and subsequent break-in\n[57] XXXX claims to have been assaulted on XXXX XXXX, 2017, one month to the day, after XXXX was assaulted. He claims that after participating in a protest with hundreds of thousands of protestors in attendance, he was attacked upon arriving to his home. He alleges that he was attacked because he is volunteer coordinator. As discussed above, the panel does not find that the claimant established any profile with the party with clear and convincing evidence.\n[58] XXXX has provided photographs26 taken by his mother at the hospital which show a bandage on his XXXX and his left XXXX in a sling. The purpose of the photographs, according to the claimant was to report to the police however, no report was filed. The panel observed that the photographs did not capture all of the injuries stated in XXXX amended narrative.27\n[59] The claimant has not provided any hospital intake or release form but has provided a doctor's letter28 that he states is provided by the emergency room when asked on discharge upon request.\n[60] The medical report provided indicates that the claimant was treated for wounds and bruises in emergency and details the presenting trauma issues. The report does not mention that the claimant suffered these injuries from an assault by \"collectivos\" as relayed by the claimant.\n[61] The claimant was asked if he had to get any medication as a result of his injuries and initially he responded \"no.\" When the question was repeated he stated that they did not give him anything, but he had to buy ibuprofen. When it was put to the claimant that his medical report indicated that he was prescribed antibiotics, XXXX paused and responded that \"you cannot get those in Venezuela.\" The panel observed the claimant to be making up an explanation for his lack of memory of the prescription, and the panel does not believe that the hospital would prescribe an unavailable medication, as opposed to an alternative. The panel believes that the claimant was making up answers as he went along to cover up his error on the content of the medical report.\n[62] In oral testimony, the claimant stated that he was treated for bruising on his forehead with ice, and his nose was straightened and gauze applied. When asked if he was treated for cuts he stated that he only had bruising. This raised an internal inconsistency, as the claimant's amended narrative indicates:29 \"I had a fractured nose and some cuts to my forehead.\"\n[63] The claimant was asked why the photographs do not display any cuts on his forehead and why he did not mention them in oral testimony. He had no explanation.\n[64] The claimant testified that he did not report the assault to any leaders that he worked with in the XXXX party out of fear. Also, he did not ask for a statement from any of his colleagues or leaders out of fear. When asked to explain the fear, the claimant testified that he did not want to the police to know.\n[65] The panel does not find that the claimant's explanation of fear of police adequately explains a failure to ask his colleagues or leaders to provide a supporting statement on the events, for his hearing. They are not the police.\n[66] In light of the fact that the claimant provided late evidence at the third sitting of his hearing,30 in the form of a statement from his godfather on alleged events when he relocated to his home, it appears that statements can be obtained from Venezuela in support of allegations if requested.\n[67] Given the credibility issues with the claimant in establishing a profile, the panel finds his lack of effort to provide reliable statements from the party leaders who knew of the assault, or his colleagues, undermined the genuineness of the assault on XXXX XXXX, 2017. Where a claimant's story has been found to be implausible or otherwise lacking in credibility,31 a lack of documentary corroboration, or a lack of effort to obtain the documentation,32 can be a valid consideration for purposes of assessing credibility.\n[68] An adverse finding is drawn on the credibility of the events as relayed, and the panel does not find that XXXX has provided credible evidence on events in XXXX 2017 and thereafter. Even without disbelieving every part of a claimant's testimony, a panel may find the claimant so lacking in credibility that it concludes there is no credible evidence relevant to his claim.33 In addition, a claimant's contradictory testimony can cast doubt upon the totality of his oral evidence.34\n[69] The panel finds that this witness has fabricated his evidence and this extends to all of the allegations post XXXX XXXX, 2017 as well, as these flow from his alleged problems and political profile which has not been credibly established with his evidence\nResidual elements of profile and well foundedness:\n[70] XXXX testified that she was involved in the XXXX XXXX XXXX with other students. She has provided a letter confirming that she volunteered on projects.35 She also did some volunteer work with the radio station XXXX XXXX XXXX, in XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX, as set out in a reference letter provided in March 2017 for the claimant.36 This work is consistent with her university XXXX program and does not give rise to a heightened risk profile.\n[71] The claimant did not broadcast her name on the radio. She was an XXXX and as such her participation in the radio station related to her study program and is not found to give rise to a heightened profile. In addition, there is no evidence before the panel that the content of these broadcasts gave rise to a problem for any of the other workers who were more visible at the radio station.\n[72] XXXX has also provided photographs of student demonstrations where she is captured, and XXXX has not.37 The panel accepts that XXXX was involved in demonstrations and as the photographs reveal there are numerous other protestors involved also. These protests involved students and citizens from all over the country, involving millions of people. XXXX appears to have taken an active interest in student organizations involved in the community.\n[73] That being said, the panel does not find that either of the claimants have a profile that makes them a target of the government on return to Venezuela. The evidence on past persecution was not credible and the only credible event that is accepted by the panel is the possibility that XXXX was slightly injured by the random firing of tear gas to disperse a crowd.\n[74] As identified by the objective evidence, the National Documentation Package states that, human rights workers38 fall into a high risk category. The panel does not find that either claimant falls under that category for risk.\n[75] The violence that has plagued Venezuela recently has led to international concern. The Report of the Secretary General on the United Nations Verification Mission in Colombia39 speaks to the difficult conditions facing social leaders and human rights defenders.\n[76] Counsel refers in her submissions40 at paragraph 32 to the most current Department of State Report where it is noted that the small scale protests that occurred throughout the year were generally not met with the same widespread, violent and sometimes fatal response that the government had given in 2017. While counsel points out that the author qualifies the analysis with \"not generally,\" in the panel's view, the tone of the analysis indicates that a more measured response to dissent is being implemented.\n[77] The panel has considered that amongst the millions of protesters, there have been some innocent deaths and many wounded.41 Counsel's documentary evidence speaks to 43 deaths and hundreds of wounded in one year in 2015, and 1500 detentions.42\n[78] However, in the absence of a credibly established profile, the panel does not agree with counsel's contention that the claimants are Convention refugees by virtue of having just participated in demonstrations against the regime. They simply fall under the same risk as all do who participate in demonstrations, and that is said to be millions of people.\n[79] While the panel is sympathetic to the situation of these claimants and their desire to be reunited with the family in Canada after a failed sponsorship, the panel believes that the claimants have fabricated many aspects of their evidence in an effort to rectify the failed family class sponsorship of XXXX by her parents in 2017. It is noted that the purpose of the refugee system is to provide safe haven to those who genuinely need it, and not to facilitate a quick and convenient route to landed status in Canada for other reasons.43\nCONCLUSION\n[80] The panel has considered all of the evidence, including the written submissions from counsel,44 and finds that the claimants have not established, on a balance of probabilities, their profile as anti-Maduro activists who have been targeted by pro-government actors, including members of armed groups known as colectivos, because of their political opinion in Venezuela.\n[81] The claimants have not established that they have a well-founded fear of persecution on a Convention ground, under s. 96 of IRPA, or that they are persons in need of protection as their removal to Venezuela would not subject them personally to a risk to life, to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or to a danger of torture under s. 97(1) of IRPA.\n[82] Therefore the claims are denied.\n(signed)\n\"Elana Rose\"\nElana Rose\nJune 7, 2019\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n2 Rule 55, Immigration and Refugee Board, Refugee Protection Division Rules, SOR\/2012-256.\n3 Exhibit 2-3, Basis of Claim (BOC) Forms, received October 27, 2017, TB7-20375, TB7-24198\n4 Exhibit 13, Claimant's Amended Narrative, received May 22, 2019.\n5 Exhibit 1, Package of information from the referring CBSA\/CIC.\n6 Exhibit 9, Claimants' Certificate of Marriage.\n7 Exhibit 6, Claimant's Personal Documents, at pp. 1-2.\n8 Maldonado, Pedro Enrique Juarez v.

Each claim was decided on its own merits. However, the claimants were advised that their individual testimony might affect the other claimants. Decisions were made for each claimant.\nAppointment of a Designated Representative\n[3] The IRPA requires the designation of a representative for all claimants less than 18 years of age. In accordance with subsection 167(2) of the IRPA,3 and rule 20 of the RPD Rules,4 the panel designated XXXX XXXX to be the representative for the minor claimants for the purposes of this claim for refugee protection.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The complete story alleging the basis of the claimants' fear is captured in their Basis of Claim Forms (BOCs),5 and can be summarized as follows. The panel notes that the associate claimants are relying on the PC's BOC narrative.6 The claimants fear returning to Pakistan because of their religious identity as Ahmadi Muslims.\n[5] The claimants allege that they were raised in a devout Ahmadi family, and they continue to be devout Ahmadi Muslims. Because of their beliefs, the claimants allege that they face persecution from Orthodox Muslims, who believe Ahmadi Muslims are infidels and blasphemers, and as such, should not be permitted to practice their faith. They allege that they have faced harassment, discrimination, and physical assaults during their education, employment and activities of daily life in Pakistan because of their religious beliefs.\n[6] As a result of a series of insults, assaults, harassment, and demands that the claimants change their faith, with the help of an agent who arranged for false Pakistani passports containing Canadian Visas, the claimants left Pakistan and arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2017. They made their applications for refugee protection on January 11, 2018.\nDETERMINATION\n[7] For the reasons that follow, the panel finds that the claimants have failed to establish their identity as citizens of Pakistan. Therefore, they have not established that they have a well-founded fear of persecution, or that they will be facing a risk to their life, if they were to return to Pakistan.\nANALYSIS\n[8] In assessing this claim, the panel focused on the credibility of the claimants' allegations of the risk of persecution or harm they might face upon their return to Pakistan, because of their Ahmadi Muslim identity.\n[9] The panel is cognizant of the difficulties faced by the claimants in establishing their claims. These include cultural factors, the environment of the hearing room, and the stress inherent in responding to oral questions through an interpreter. The panel also notes that the claimants allege that they are not well acquainted with travel, as the have never traveled outside of Pakistan prior to coming to Canada. The panel has taken these considerations into account in arriving at its determination.\nIdentity\n[10] The panel finds that the determinative issue in this claim is the national identity of the claimants. For the following reasons, the panel finds that the claimants have not satisfied their burden of providing acceptable documentation to establish their Pakistani citizenship.\n[11] Section 106 of the IRPA reads:\nThe Refugee Protection Division must take into account, with respect to the credibility of a claimant, whether the claimant possesses acceptable documentation establishing identity, and if not, whether they have provided a reasonable explanation for the lack of documentation or have taken reasonable steps to obtain the documentation.7\n[12] The Rule 11 of the RPD Rules stipulates:\nThe claimant must provide acceptable documents establishing identity and other elements of the claim. A claimant who does not provide acceptable documents must explain why they were not provided and what steps were taken to provide them.8\n[13] In this instance there is cause to doubt the credibility, genuineness, or trustworthiness of the evidence provided by the claimants in support of their identity. In Su it was held that, \"[t]he onus is on the claimant to produce acceptable documentation to establish her identity\"9 and they must \"make a genuine, substantive effort to do so.\"10\n[14] In assessing the authenticity of the claimant's documents the panel is guided by the Federal Court decision in Sertkaya, which asserts that it is \"open for the board to consider the authenticity of documentary evidence... [and] the ability of the family to obtain and use fraudulent documents.11 The panel is also mindful of the Federal Court decision in Rasheed, which asserts that:\n... the basic rule in Canadian law is that foreign documents (whether they establish the identity or not of a claimant) purporting to be issued by a competent foreign public official should be accepted as evidence of their content unless the Board has some valid reason to doubt their authenticity.12\n[15] For the following reasons, the panel finds that the claimants have not provided sufficient credible or trustworthy documentary evidence in support of their national identity.\n[16] The claimants provided copies of photo copies of their Birth Certificates to establish their national identity. The photocopies of the minor claimants Birth Certificates were seized by Citizenship and Immigration Canada on February 16, 2018.13 The adult claimants Birth Certificates were provided to the panel at the hearing.14 The panel finds that these documents contain no security features to substantiate their authenticity.\n[17] The claimant indicated in his BOC narrative that he traveled to Canada on a false Pakistani Passport, which contained a Canadian Visa. The female claimant testified that she and the minor claimants traveled to Canada on a similar document. These fraudulent passports contained their photographs, but are not in their names. The claimants testified that the agent who traveled with them from Pakistan to Canada took the passports back when the claimants arrived in Canada.\n[18] The claimants testified that as they had never traveled, they had never obtained genuine passports, and for his $4,000,000 rupee fee (approximately $40,000 CDN), he entrusted that the agent would provide all the necessary documents.\n[19] Documentary evidence indicates that, \"[t]he website of the US embassy in Islamabad indicates that the availability of fraudulent documents in Pakistan is 'widespread,'\" and that \"it is 'very easy' to obtain fraudulent documents in Pakistan.\"15 The \"issuing of fake birth certificates in exchange for 'handsome graft'\" is common.16 The Express Tribune reported that \"100,000 bogus birth certificates were issued...\" in exchange for bribes.17 The panel finds that the claimant use of such documents to establish their Pakistani citizenship undermines their identity as citizens of Pakistan.\n[20] The panel asked when the adult claimants were married and if they had a marriage certificate. The claimant testified that they were married in XXXX 1996, and they had a marriage certificate that was in Pakistan. They did not bring it with them because they left Pakistan in such a hurry. At the outset of the hearing, the panel asked the claimants if there were any documents they would have liked to provide the panel but were unable to obtain. The principle claimant indicated that there were none. The panel finds that it is reasonable to expect that the claimants would bring such an important document with them, and draws a negative inference from its absence.\n[21] The claimant did provide a copy of a drivers license from Pakistan.18\n[22] According to the documentary evidence, the website of the National Highways and Motorway Police indicates that in order to apply for a driver's license, among the documents required, applicants must submit a valid copy of the Computerized National Identity Card (CNIC).19 The program of CNIC was introduced in 2012.20 The claimant did not provide a CNIC, and the panel finds this problematic. Although he provided a copy of a driver's license, the claimant did not provide the CNIC, which according to the documentary evidence is among the documents required to obtain a driver's license. The panel also finds that a CNIC could have potentially served as a source of identification as a Pakistani National.\n[23] As a driver's license is not evidence of citizenship, the panel gives this document no weight in establishing the principle claimant's citizenship.\n[24] The claimants were asked by counsel if the children had attended school, and if they had any school records or documents. They testified that they did not have any.\nCONCLUSION\n[25] Owing to concerns regarding the insufficiency of trustworthy and reliable evidence of the claimant's identity as citizens of Pakistan, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants have failed to establish their identity as citizens of Pakistan. Therefore, the claimants have not satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground under section 96, or that, on a balance of probabilities, they would be personally subjected to a danger of torture, or to a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\n[26] The panel finds that the documents submitted by the claimants have less probative value since they lack any security features. In the context of the above findings and case law, the panel gives little weight to these documents in terms of establishing that the claimant's identity.\n[27] In summary, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants have failed to provide sufficient reliable documents and credible evidence, to establish their identity as citizens of Pakistan as required by section 106 of IRPA and Rule 11 of the RPD Rules.\n[28] The burden of establishing identity must be satisfied before the panel goes on to consider the merits of the claim, and whether the claimants in this case face a serious possibility of being persecuted, or are persons in need of protection. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, and on the basis of the totality of documentary evidence disclosed, as well the findings and negative inferences noted above, that the claimants have not established their identity as citizens of Pakistan.\n[29] The panel has chosen to rely on the documentary evidence of the Pakistan National Documentation Packages (NDP) as this information, because it originates from a variety of reputable independent sources.21 The documentary evidence is seen as reliable, probative, detailed information, so as to provide the panel with a thorough understanding of the situation Ahmadi Muslims in Pakistan.\n[30] On the basis of the totality of the evidence, the case law and the cumulative findings noted above, in the specific instances of this case, the panel finds that the claimants have not satisfied their burden of establishing a serious possibility that they would be persecuted, or that they would be personally subjected to a risk to their lives, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture by any authority in Pakistan.\n[31] Section 107(2) of the IRPA reads as follows:\n[i]f the Refugee Protection Division is of the opinion, in rejecting a claim, that there was no credible or trustworthy evidence on which it could have made a favourable decision, it shall state in its reasons for the decision that there is no credible basis for the claim.22\n[32] For the foregoing reasons, the panel finds that there is no credible basis for their claims.\n[33] Therefore, the panel finds that claimants are not Convention refugees, nor persons in need of protection. The panel rejects their claims.\n(signed)\n\"Stephen Rudin\"\nSTEPHEN RUDIN\nOctober 8, 2019\nDate\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, as amended [IRPA], sections 96 and 97(1).\n2 Refugee Protection Division (RPD) Rules SOR\/2012-256 [RPD Rules], Rule 55.\n3 IRPA, supra, footnote 1, section 167(2).\n4 RPD Rules, supra, footnote 2, Rule 20.\n5 Exhibit 2-7, Basis of Claim Forms (BOCs).\n6 Exhibit 2, BOC - TB8-04145.\n7 IRPA, supra, footnote 1, section 106.\n8 RPD Rules, supra, footnote 2, Rule 11.\n9 Su, Sai v.

All four claimants rely on the allegations as stated in the claimant's Basis of Claim, RPD file number TB8-29231.\nEXPEDITED DETERMINATION\n[3] Paragraph 170(f) of IRPA3 provides that the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) may allow a claim for refugee protection without a hearing, unless the Minister has notified the RPD of the Minister's intention to intervene within the time limit set out in the Refugee Protection Division Rules.4 Further, subsection 162(2) of IRPA5 directs each Division to deal with all proceedings before it as informally and quickly as the circumstances and the considerations of fairness and natural justice permit.\n[4] The claimant's case was identified as one that could be processed through the RPD's expedited process for Egyptian claims. Security screening results for the claimant were received by the RPD on December 18, 2018, and for the female claimant on March 13, 2019.\n[5] The RPD received the claimant's signed Certificate of Readiness6 for the expedited process on April 12, 2019. Having carefully considered the evidence in this case, the panel finds that it meets the criteria for expedited determination. This case has therefore been decided without a hearing, according to the Instructions governing the streaming of less complex claims at the Refugee Protection Division.7\nALLEGATIONS\n[6] According to the allegations outlined in the narrative to the Basis of Claim (BOC),8 the claimants are Coptic Christian residents of XXXX who fear harm at the hands of Muslim extremists in Egypt. While the family had in the past experienced discrimination on the basis of religious identity in Egypt, their circumstances changed for the worse following the events of the 2011 revolution. The same year, the claimant and his spouse applied for permanent residence in Canada, hoping to leave Egypt with their newborn son. While they never received a formal rejection, their consultant informed them that the application was unsuccessful. After their second son was born, the claimant opened his own XXXX XXXX while his spouse worked as a XXXX at a XXXX XXXX. She faced verbal and physical assaults at work and on her way to church.\n[7] In XXXX 2017, while leaving church with fellow worshippers, the claimant was attacked by a group of extremists who fled when the police were called. In XXXX 2018, four Muslim men came to the claimant's XXXX XXXX and ordered him to close it. When he refused, he was assaulted and threatened with further harm. Following another assault outside their church, the claimants fled Egypt for Canada, filing their claims for refugee protection inland on November 14, 2018.\n[8] The claimants fear persecution and harm at the hands of radical Islamists and other extremists on the basis of religion in Egypt. They also allege that the Egyptian authorities are unable or unwilling to protect them as Coptic Christians.\nDETERMINATION\n[9] The panel finds that the claimants are Convention refugees under section 96 of IRPA for the following reasons.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity-personal and national\n[10] The claimants' identities as nationals of Egypt have been established, on a balance of probabilities, by their Arab Republic of Egypt passports9 that were seized by the referring IRCC office.\nIdentity-religious\n[11] The claimants have also established their identities as Coptic Christians by way of their personal documentation, including the following: national identity cards; birth, marriage, and baptism certificates; letters from churches in Egypt and Canada; and photographs depicting the claimants engaged in religious ceremonies and church activities.10\nCredibility\n[12] The panel has reviewed the claimant's Basis of Claim (BOC),11 intake forms,12 and personal documentation disclosed,13 and has found the claimants to be credible regarding the central elements in this case - namely that they are Christian Copts and have previously been targeted and assaulted14 on the basis of their religious identity in Egypt.\n[13] In reviewing the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Egypt,15 the panel has found the claimants' personal evidence to be consistent with the objective country conditions documents before it. As such, the panel finds that the claimants have established, on a balance of probabilities, their profile as Christian Egyptian citizens who have been targeted by Muslim extremists because of their religion.\n[14] As religion forms a basis for refugee claims, as per section 96 of IRPA, the test is whether there is a serious possibility of persecution should the claimants return to Egypt. The panel finds, based on the evidence before it, that the claimants have met that test.\nState protection\n[15] In order to establish a claim pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, the claimant must rebut the presumption of state protection. The claimants had in the past observed that the police were not willing to act in matters of religious disputes, and came to believe that the police would not protect them, as Christians, in any matters arising from a sectarian conflict between Christian and Muslim residents in Egypt.\n[16] The panel has before it country conditions documentation indicating that Copts have complained of ongoing sectarian violence, including targeted kidnappings, armed robberies, and assault since the ousting of former President Morsi.16 There are longstanding allegations that the authorities have failed to provide sufficient protection for the Coptic community, and that inadequate police response has created a climate of impunity:\nSocietal violence connected with religion, including terrorist attacks, continued. ... ISIS claimed responsibility for multiple attacks, including suicide bombings at two churches during Palm Sunday services that killed 45 people, the killing of 28 passengers on a bus carrying Christian pilgrims to a desert monastery, and numerous killings of Christians in northern Sinai and elsewhere. Muslims opposed to church construction or renovation, even when legally authorized, continued to commit violence against churches and Christian-owned properties in various locales. Victims of sectarian violence continued to be pressured to drop charges in the spirit of \"reconciliation\" - a practice which human rights groups and Christians said regularly failed to hold the perpetrators accountable or provide justice to victims and their families. Muslims who openly left Islam were subjected to violence, threats, and abuse. Christians continued to face societal discrimination in their daily lives.17\n[17] Country documentation confirms that Christians continue to be targeted by Islamic militants, attacks against Copts take place throughout Egypt, and state authorities are slow to act: \"Amnesty International reports that religious minorities, 'including Coptic Christians..., continued to face discriminatory restrictions in law and practice and inadequate protection from violence'.\"18\n[18] The panel finds that the objective documentary evidence before it supports the claimants' allegations, and that they have provided clear and convincing evidence of the state's inability to protect them as Coptic Christians should they return to Egypt.\n[19] Given the documentary evidence before the panel, both personal and objective, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility that the claimants could face persecution and harm at the hands of Muslim extremists and radical Islamists should they return to Egypt, and that state protection would not reasonably be forthcoming to them as Christians anywhere in the country.\nCONCLUSION\n[20] Based on the foregoing analysis, the panel has determined that the claimants have established that there is a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground as per section 96 of IRPA if they were to return to Egypt.\n[21] The panel therefore finds that the claimants are Convention refugees and accepts the claims.\n(signed)\n\"M.

I find that the claimants have established a serious possibility of persecution because of their Uyghur religion and ethnicity.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] I am satisfied that the claimants are citizens of China based on certified true copies of the claimants' passports.5\nCredibility\n[6] The claimants' evidence is not internally inconsistent, inherently implausible or contradicted by documentary evidence on country conditions in China. Furthermore, the claimants' religious and ethnic identity is corroborated by personal documents6 that I do not have sufficient reason to discount, which includes the claimants' Chinese Resident Identity Cards and their Chinese passports. I therefore find this evidence credible and that the allegations in this case are probably true.\n[7] At the initial file screening stage, the principal claimant was asked to provide a letter of consent from her husband granting permission to take her two minor children to Canada. Counsel for the claimants, Aparna Das, wrote a letter to the Board dated October 15, 2019. In this letter, counsel indicated that the contact between the principal claimant and her husband was sporadic at best and non-existent at worst. Counsel explained that the reason for this is that the principal claimant fears that her husband could be arrested and detained if he were to try to send a letter of consent through WeChat, which is an online communication application, because it could be intercepted by Chinese authorities.\n[8] The United States Department of State Report on China for 20187 indicates the following regarding the ability to communicate information freely either through the internet or other types of electronic applications:\nAuthorities monitored telephone calls, text messages, faxes, email, instant\nmessaging, and other digital communications intended to remain private.\nAuthorities also opened and censored domestic and international mail. Security\nservices routinely monitored and entered residences and offices to gain access to computers, telephones, and fax machines.\n....\nHuman rights groups stated authorities increasingly relied on the cameras and other\nforms of surveillance to monitor and intimidate political dissidents, religious\nleaders and adherents, Tibetans, and Uighurs. These included facial recognition\nand \"gait recognition\" video surveillance, allowing police not only to monitor a\nsituation but also to quickly identify individuals in crowds. The monitoring and\ndisruption of telephone and internet communications were particularly widespread\nin Xinjiang and Tibetan areas.\n[9] Accordingly, I find that the principal claimant, through her counsel, has provided a reasonable explanation for her inability to provide a letter of consent from her husband. Therefore, I am not drawing a negative inference on the basis of the failure of the principal claimant to obtain and provide a letter of consent from her husband.\n[10] Alternatively, I have examined the complete contents of the claimants' Canadian temporary resident visa file (TRV). It contains a letter signed by the principal claimant's husband, XXXX XXXX, dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018, indicating that he was acting as the sponsor for his two minor children and that he was aware the minors were going to be accompanied to Canada by his wife, who is the principal claimant. I find that this letter from the principal claimant's husband in fact constitutes sufficient consent or permission allowing the principal claimant to bring her two minor children to Canada.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[11] As it relates to the well-foundedness of the claimants' fear of persecution, I find that the claimants' subjective fear has an objective basis based on the objective documentary evidence before me.\n[12] The Department of State report indicates that Chinese authorities have intensified their campaign of persecution against the Uighur population in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR). That document states:\nDuring the year the government significantly intensified its campaign of mass detention of members of Muslim minority groups in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang). Authorities were reported to have arbitrarily detained 800,000 to possibly more than two million Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, and other Muslims in internment camps designed to erase religious and ethnic identities. Government officials claimed the camps were needed to combat terrorism, separatism, and extremism. International media, human rights organizations, and former detainees reported security officials in the camps abused, tortured, and killed some detainees.\nOfficial repression of the freedoms of speech, religion, movement, association, and assembly of Tibetans in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) and other Tibetan areas and of Uighurs and other ethnic and religious minorities in Xinjiang worsened and was more severe than in other areas of the country.\nThe government conducted mass arbitrary detention of Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, and other Muslims in Xinjiang. China Human Rights Defenders reported these detentions amounted to enforced disappearance, as families were not given information about the length or location of the detention.\nHuman rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng, who went missing in 2017, remained missing throughout 2018. In September 2017 Radio Free Asia reported Gao's family said they were told he was in police custody at an undisclosed location, although authorities did not release any details surrounding his detention.\nIn November award-winning Chinese documentary photographer Lu Guang disappeared after traveling to Xinjiang to lead a photography workshop. Authorities did not respond to requests by Lu's wife and international advocacy organizations to account for Lu's status and whereabouts.\nLawyer Wang Quanzhang was reported alive in the Tianjin Detention Center in July after being held in incommunicado detention for more than three years. Wang had a closed court hearing on the charges against him on December 26. Authorities detained Wang in the July 2015 \"709\" roundup of more than 300 human rights lawyers and legal associates.\nIn Xinjiang authorities constructed new internment camps for Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, and other Muslims. In some cases authorities used repurposed schools, factories, and prisons. According to Human Rights Watch, these camps focused on \"military-style discipline and pervasive political indoctrination of the detainees.\" Available information was limited, but some reports described the withholding of food as punishment for those who could not learn Chinese phrases and songs.\nMihrigul Tursun, a Uighur woman from Xinjiang, recounted to media in October how Chinese authorities arbitrarily detained her multiple times after she returned to Xinjiang in 2015. Tursun reported nine deaths in her cell, an underground, windowless room that held 68 women, occurred during her detention in 2018.\nAccording to media reports, the Ministry of Public Security used tens of millions of surveillance cameras throughout the country to monitor the general public. Human rights groups stated authorities increasingly relied on the cameras and other forms of surveillance to monitor and intimidate political dissidents, religious leaders and adherents, Tibetans, and Uighurs.\nAccording to media reports, the Ministry of Public Security used tens of millions of surveillance cameras throughout the country to monitor the general public. Human rights groups stated authorities increasingly relied on the cameras and other forms of surveillance to monitor and intimidate political dissidents, religious leaders and adherents, Tibetans, and Uighurs.\nUighurs, particularly those residing in Xinjiang, reported great difficulty in getting passport applications approved at the local level. They were frequently denied passports to travel abroad, particularly to Saudi Arabia for the Hajj, to other Muslim countries, or to Western countries for academic purposes. Since 2016 authorities ordered Xinjiang residents to turn in their passports or told residents no new passports were available. The passport recall, however, was not limited to Uighur areas. Foreign national family members of Uighur activists living overseas were also denied visas to enter the country. During the year the government continued its concerted efforts to compel Uighurs studying abroad to return to China, often pressuring relatives in Xinjiang to ask their overseas relatives to return. Authorities also refused to renew passports for Uighurs living abroad, leading them to either go home or pursue ways to maintain legal status in those countries. Upon return, many of these Uighurs, or persons connected with the Xinjiang residents, were detained or disappeared.\nUighurs and other religious minorities continued to be sentenced to long prison terms and in some cases executed without due process on charges of separatism and endangering state security. The government constructed new prisons in Xinjiang to alleviate the overcapacity of existing facilities, according to credible sources. In 2016 and 2017, the Xinjiang regional government posted advertisements to recruit nearly 100,000 security personnel, international media reported. Economist Ilham Tohti remained in prison, where he was serving a life sentence after his conviction on separatism-related charges in 2014.8\n[13] Therefore, based on this country documentary evidence and the credible allegations, I find that the claimants have a well-founded fear of persecution in China by reason of the claimants' Uighur religion and ethnicity.\nState Protection\n[14] As the agent of persecution is the government of China, I find that it would be objectively unreasonable for the claimants to seek the protection of the Chinese government in light of these claimants' particular circumstances.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[15] I also find that the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution throughout China, especially given the objective documentary evidence that the authorities operate similarly throughout China. Therefore, viable internal flight alternatives are not available to these claimants.\nCONCLUSION\n[16] Based on the foregoing analysis, I conclude that the claimants are Convention refugees and I therefore accept their claims.\n(signed)\nR.

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX are citizens of the United States of America (U. S. A. or United States). The claimants are claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The facts and events alleged in support of their claims are set out in the respective Basis of Claim (BOC) forms. In summary, the associate claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, alleges persecution in Colombia on the basis of domestic violence from her former partner. The claimants also fear the Autodefensas Gaitanistas of Colombia (\"AGC\") (also known as Los Urabenos, Clan de Golfo, and Clan Usuga), due to membership of the former partner in the AGC. The principal and minor claimants make the same allegations as the associate claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] The panel finds that the claimants are neither Convention refugees within the meaning of section 96 of the IRPA, nor are the claimants in need of protection within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\nUSA BORN CLAIMANTS\n[5] The panel notes the principal claimant was appointed to be the designated representative for the three minor claimants. The panel notes that the claimants, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, were all born in the United States. Their identities as citizens of the United States were established through their passports and documents which were seized1 by CBSA and the panel is satisfied as to their identities. The panel notes that these claimants have not established that there is a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, or that, on a balance of probabilities, they would personally be subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment upon return to their country of citizenship, the United States of America.\nDETERMINATIVE ISSUES\n[6] The determinative issue is the existence of a viable internal flight alternative (\"IFA\") in the city of Tunja, Boyaca, Colombia.\nANALYSIS\n[7] In making this assessment, the panel considered all of the evidence including the oral testimony, the documentary evidence, and counsel submissions.\nCHAIRPERSON'S GUIDELINES\n[8] In making the determination in this case, the panel considered all of the evidence in the context of the Chairperson's Gender Guidelines2 and accepts that the circumstances which rise to women's fear of persecution are often unique to women.\nIDENTITY\n[9] The identities of the claimants XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX, were established as citizens of Colombia through their passports and documents which were seized3 by CBSA and therefore, the RPD is satisfied that the claimants have met their burden and established their identities.\nCREDIBILITY\n[10] Only the principal claimant and the associate claimant testified at the hearing. Their children did not testify. The principal claimant was appointed as the designated representative for the minor claimants. The panel finds that the claimants were generally credible except as noted in the particulars of the analysis below.\n[11] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are indeed true unless there is a valid reason to doubt their veracity. The determination as to whether a claimant's evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities. In assessing credibility, the panel was mindful of the length of time between their arrival and this hearing but also of their background including education. The panel is cognizant of the many difficulties faced by the claimants in establishing a claim including cultural factors, the milieu of the hearing room or environment, the stress inherent in responding to oral questions through an interpreter and nervousness.\nNOTIFICATION OF MINISTER - EXCLUSION\n[12] The issues of exclusion under Article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention was raised and the Minister was notified. The Minister responded in a letter dated May 16, 2019 and stated in part the following:\nThe Minister submits, that criminality in USA, if committed in Canada would only net her 5 years. The Minister has reviewed the file and submits, the Member is well placed to consider the Claimants statements and credibility. The Minister will not be intervening at this time.4\n[13] As the Minister did not appear at the hearing, the panel has therefore made a determination on Article 1F(b) based on all the information, testimony, and evidence before it.\nArticle 1F(b)\n[14] The issue of exclusion was raised for the associate claimant and the panel has assessed whether the claimant is excluded pursuant to Article 1F(b). The following criminality issues were raised:\n1. Burglary and Theft in United States 2003;\n2. Theft in United States in 2004;\n3. Theft in United States in 2016.\n[15] In determining whether the crime is serious, the panel has taken into consideration the factors identified in Jayasekara5 relating to the commission of the offence. The panel has taken into consideration factors including the elements of the crime, facts surrounding the crime, mode or persecution both in the foreign jurisdiction and in Canada, penalty prescribed both in the foreign jurisdiction and in Canada, mitigating circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime, aggravating circumstances underlying the conviction, and other crimes committed directly related to the crime in question. The panel has also taken into consideration the decision of Febles,6 which also outlines how a crime's seriousness should be assessed.\n[16] The associate claimant provided documents from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the United States Department of Justice7 indicating the claimant's residence and criminal record history in the United States. The associate claimant has entered and exited United States a few times over the years. The claimant was arrested and charged with felony grand theft of property over $400 and felony burglary around February 2003 in the United States.8 According to the documentation, the associate claimant was convicted of theft and the felony burglary dismissed.9 The associate claimant testified that she had stolen clothes from a store in a mall, but could not recall the total cost of the clothes that were stolen. The claimant testified that there were no injuries to bystanders and no weapons were used. The associate claimant indicated that she did not serve any jail time but had to pay a fine.\n[17] The panel notes that the claimant was also arrested for misdemeanour theft in the United States around July 2004 and fined.10 Deportation proceedings were also started around the same time.11 The claimant was also arrested in 2016 for theft under $1000.12 The associate claimant indicated the most recent arrest was for stealing something at a Sephora store. The claimant testified that she never served any jail time in the United States for her crimes other than paying a fine.\n[18] The panel found the associate claimant's testimony was corroborated by the documentation from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the United States Department of Justice.13 The panel does not find that the associate claimant committed any violent crimes, nor did the claimant appear to have been prosecuted or sentenced to jail other than being fined or detained and later deported out of the United States. The panel also finds that the sentencing was on the lower end of the sentencing spectrum. The panel does not find these constituted serious crimes based on the factors outlined in crime under Jayasekara14 and Febles.15\n[19] The panel has considered the principal claimant's crimes and evidence before it and finds that the claimant has not committed any serious non-political crime and is not excluded under Article 1F(b) of the Convention.\nTarget of Former Common-Law Partner\n[20] The associate claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, testified that she and her family cannot return to Colombia due to being targeted by her former common-law partner, \"XXXX XXXX XXXX.\" (ex-partner). The panel notes that the principal claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, have based their claims on the associate claimant's claim and narrative. The claimants allege that the associate claimant's ex-partner is after them all and has threatened to kill them, as the ex-partner does not want the associate claimant being together with a new partner and having a new family. The panel heard the claims jointly, pursuant to Refugee Protection Division Rule 55.16 The panel has also considered the claims jointly in its assessment and analysis below.\n[21] The associate claimant testified that she first started a relationship with her ex-partner in August 1998. She was with him for around 5 years. The claimant testified that they were never married and were in a common-law relationship.\n[22] The claimant testified that her ex-partner was physically, verbally, and sexually abusive towards her when they were together. The claimant provided a clinical assessment report from a psychotherapist in Canada dated May 18, 2018.17 The summary of the report includes the following:\nMs. XXXX XXXX had been exposed to traumatizing events that placed her at risk of developing post-traumatic adjustment or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)...\nAccording to Mr. XXXX XXXX disclosure, my behavioural observations, and clinical experience, Mr. XXXX XXXX has been struggling with symptoms associated with Post-Traumatic Disorder (PTSD) and depression...\nMs. XXXX XXXX fits the criteria for the victim of domestic violence, and an individual who had been exposed to negligent and abandonment as a child. She demonstrated residual symptoms of PTSD.18\n[23] A follow-up report dated July 18, 2019 indicate that the associate claimant has continued to receive counselling at a health centre and has also been practicing relaxation exercises and yoga.19 The panel accepts that the associate claimant was a victim of domestic violence by her ex-partner and that the claimant has residual symptoms of PTSD. The panel accepts that the claimant receives counselling and continues to practice relaxation exercises.\n[24] The claimant testified about moving to the United States with her ex-partner in the year 2000. The claimant has three children with her ex-partner, two of whom were born in the United States. The panel notes that the associate claimant and her family members have travelled back and forth between the United States and Colombia and that her children were born in Colombia and the United States. Based on the associate claimant's testimony and the basis of claim forms and narratives, the panel has summarized the approximate timelines (month and\/or year) and the associate claimant's travel and residence with her family members in various countries below:\n1998 - Associate claimant begins relationship with ex-partner\n1999 - First child, \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX with ex-partner born in Colombia\n2000 - Associate claimant travels to United States with ex-partner, leaves XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\" in Colombia\nOctober 2001 - Second child with ex-partner born in the United States (claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX)\nJuly 2002 - Third child with ex-partner born in the United States (claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX)\n2003 - Associate claimant returns to Colombia, retrieves \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and goes back to the United States together the same year\nJanuary 2005 - Associate claimant deported to Colombia from United States; children remain in United States with ex-partner for about 2 months; ex-partner then sends XXXX and XXXX back to Colombia to be with associate claimant; \"XXXX XXXX XXXX.\" remains in the United States\n2007 - Associate claimant meets principal claimant (XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX) in Colombia\n2008 - Associate claimant moves in with principal claimant in Colombia with her children (XXXX XXXX XXXX)\n2010 - Associate claimant's fourth child, the first with the principal claimant, born in Colombia (claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX)\n2014 - Associate claimant travels with principal claimant and children (XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX) back to the United States\n2016 - Associate claimant's fifth child, the second with the principal claimant, born in United States (claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX)\nFebruary 2017 - Associate claimant deported from the United States to Colombia; principal claimant and children remain in the United States\nJuly 2017 - Associate claimant travels to Mexico\nDecember 2017 - Associate claimant arrives in Canada from Mexico, later reunites with principal claimant and children who also come to Canada from the United States\n[25] The panel notes that the associate claimant indicated that her oldest child with her ex-partner, \"XXXX XXXX XXXX.\" was eventually adopted by a family in the United States and has since obtained citizenship in the United States.\n[26] The associate claimant testified that after she was deported from the United States and returned to Colombia around 2005, she did not have contact with her ex-partner again until around November 2009 when her ex-partner started calling and threatening her on the phone. The associate claimant testified that her ex-partner found out about her new common-law partner, the principal claimant, and demanded she leave him and also return his children to him. The claimant testified she was living in Roma neighbourhood of Bogota, Colombia with the principal claimant and their children at the time. The claimant indicated in an amended narrative that her ex-partner had found her and kidnapped and raped her around January 3, 2010 before she was released.20 The claimant made a denunciation about the kidnapping on February 18, 2010. When asked how her ex-partner was able to locate her, the associate claimant testified that her ex-partner has many informants and obtained information through them, including her cell phone number. The associate claimant indicated that her ex-partner had told her that he would be able to find her in anyplace she was living.\n[27] The associate claimant testified that after this attack, she moved around with her family to the principal claimant's mother and sister's house in Bogota and eventually to the city of Cali in Colombia. The claimant testified that in November 2014, her ex-partner called her again and told her he knew she was living in Cali and threatened to kill her. The claimant was asked how her ex-partner would know she was living in Cali and the associate claimant testified that she does not know how he found out she was in Cali. The associate claimant testified that he has many people that can supply such information to him.\n[28] The claimant testified that she and the principal claimant and her children decided to move to the United States and left Colombia in XXXX 2014. The associate claimant was later arrested in 2016 for theft in the United States and deported back to Colombia around XXXX 2017. The associate claimant indicated she was hiding from her ex-partner in Colombia until she managed to obtain fake documents to travel to Mexico. The claimant indicated she remained in Mexico from around July 2017 to XXXX 2017 until she made her way to Canada.\n[29] The panel accepts that the principal claimant was attacked by her ex-partner around the beginning of January 2010, and that she made a denunciation about the incident to the police. The panel notes that the claimant provided a copy of the denunciation report to the police.21 The claimant also provided a copy of the protection order from the Fiscalia office dated March 21, 2018 indicating for the police to \"attend and protect the victims, especially to guarantee their personal and family safety.\"22 The associate claimant noted in an amended narrative that dates of the incident in the denunciation report were wrong23 and that the actual incident took place on January 3, 2010 (not in November 2010 as stated in the denunciation) and that the associate claimant started receiving threats since November 2009 (not February 2010 as indicated in the denunciation).24 The claimant indicated in her narrative amendment that she did not catch these errors at the police station at the time due to her fear and psychological state at the time.25 The panel accepts that there is discrepancy between the dates in the denunciation and the claimant's testimony. However, the panel finds the claimant's testimony regarding the discrepancy as credible and accepts her explanations. The panel finds that the claimant encountered her ex-partner around the beginning of January 2010 after receiving phone calls from him around November 2009. Based on the claimant's testimony and evidence, the panel finds that the last time the associate claimant saw her ex-partner was in January 2010.\n[30] The panel does not find the claimant's testimony credible as it relates to the phone call she received in 2014 from her ex-partner. The claimant testified that she did not contact police or the Fiscalia office again after she received phone calls in 2014. The claimant testified that after her denunciation in February 2010, she had tried to go back to the police for follow-up and the police did not assist her or allow her to make another report. The claimant testified that she never went to the police after November 2014 it was because she did not think that the police would help. The panel does not find it reasonable that if the claimants were found again by her ex-partner after several years, the claimant would not have tried to contact police or the Fiscalia office again for assistance or follow-up prior to making a decision to leave the country entirely. Furthermore, the claimants did not make a refugee claim in the United States after they arrived there in XXXX 2014. The claimant indicated that she did not seek asylum in the United States due to her past history with deportation. The panel accepts that the associate claimant may have been reluctant to file a refugee claim in the United States due to her deportation history. However, the panel finds that if all the claimants were targeted by the associate claimant's ex-partner as alleged and fleeing Colombia due to his threats in 2014, including death threats, the principal claimant and their Colombian born child could have sought asylum or refugee protection in the United States. The panel did not see evidence that would have prevented the other claimants in making a refugee claim in the United States. The panel finds the lack of seeking any status or refugee protection in the United States undermines the claimants' allegations that they received the phone calls and death threats prior to fleeing the country. As such, the panel does not find that the claimant received the threatening calls from her ex-partner in November 2014 before they left for the United States.\nProfile of Ex-Partner\n[31] The panel also has concerns regarding the credibility of the profile of the associate claimant's ex-partner as alleged in the narrative and testimony. The associate claimant alleges that her ex-partner joined the Mara 18 gang (also known as Barrio 18) in the United States and is also part of the Sinaloa Cartel and is a member of the Autodefensas Gaitanistas of Colombia (\"AGC\"). The associate claimant also alleges that her ex-partner, \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is in fact also a man known as \"XXXX XXXX XXXX.\"\nEx-Partner as \"XXXX XXXX XXXX\"\n[32] The associate claimant provided one newspaper article that she found online from a site titled \"Clarin Policiales\" talking about a criminal named \"XXXX XXXX XXXX.\"26 The article indicates that XXXX is Mexican, born in Mexico, and went to the United States as an illegal immigrant when he was 21 years old. The article indicates that XXXX belongs to Mara 18 gang (also known as Barrio 18) and also XXXX XXXX for the Sinaloa Cartel.27 The article indicates XXXX arrived in Argentina in 2013. The article states that XXXX has five children with two different women in Acapulco and that all his family live in Mexico. The article mentions that he has a girlfriend of Colombian origin and they have been a couple a year and a half ago. The article mentions that his girlfriend lives in Congress and visits him every weekend in jail.28 The article indicates that XXXX was first arrested in Argentina in August 2013, and again in June 2014 and most recently in March.29 The panel notes that the article has a time stamp dated June 14, 2015.30 The panel notes that based on the information in the article, XXXX was still in jail at the time of the article.31\n[33] The article contains two screenshots of XXXX picture, one of his face and upper shoulders and another picture of the side of his face and upper shoulders, both without a shirt. The associate claimant provided two original photographs that she alleges are of her ex-partner \"XXXX XXXX XXXX.\" and that match the pictures of XXXX in the article. Photocopies of the photographs are provided in the claimant's disclosure package.32 The panel notes that in one photograph, a shirtless man whose upper body is covered in tattoos, is standing by himself in front of a wall covered in graffiti art.33 The second photograph includes this same man, surrounded by four other shirtless men with tattoos, with a city landscape behind them.34 The associate claimant identified this man in the photographs as her ex-partner.\n[34] The panel finds that the man identified by the associate claimant in the photographs bears a resemblance to the pictures of XXXX in the article. The panel is willing to find that the man in the photographs is the same man as XXXX in the article. However, the panel does not find that the man in the photographs and XXXX is the associate claimant's ex-partner, \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX The panel has no evidence linking the man in the photographs or XXXX to the associate claimant or her family members. The claimant previously testified her family members, including her mother and siblings had met her ex-partner, and she had also met his family members, including his parents. They have also attended family gatherings together. The panel asked why there were no pictures of her ex-partner with herself of their children after all their years together. The claimant testified that her ex-partner was a \"sicario,\" or hired hitman, from a family of sicarios and that sicarios were not allowed to take pictures of themselves or their families. When asked how she was able to obtain two photographs of her ex-partner if he never took pictures, the claimant then amended her testimony. She indicated that when her ex-partner joined the gangs in the United States, he was required to take pictures with the other gang members and the two photographs she had were of him and the other gang members. The claimant testified that the photographs were given to her by accident when her ex-partner left them in their children's suitcases when he sent their children back to her in Colombia from the United States. The claimant indicated her ex-partner had told her to destroy the photographs when he found out she had them but she never destroyed them.\n[35] The panel does not find the associate claimant's testimony credible in regards to her ex-partner being XXXX XXXX XXXX. The panel finds that the associate claimant's testimony also evolved as contradictory evidence was presented to her regarding her ex-partner's photographs. The panel does not find it reasonable that the claimant would not have any evidence to show her being together with her ex-partner, or of him with any of their children, despite them being together for five years, living in Colombia and the United States, and having three children together. The associate claimant testified that the tattoos on the man she identified as her ex-partner in the photographs have the names of their children, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, across his chest around the clavicle. The panel notes that the photographs, even the original copies that the panel examined, are not very clear. The panel is unable to establish that the names of the children are written on the man's chest.\n[36] The panel notes that the article regarding XXXX XXXX XXXX contains numerous contradictions and discrepancies to the associate claimant's narrative and testimony regarding her ex-partner. The claimant provided a birth certificate for her ex-partner that indicates he was born in Colombia.35 The claimant also testified that as far as she knew, her ex-partner's family members were still in Bogota, Colombia. The claimant was asked why the article indicates that XXXX, whom she is alleging to be her ex-partner, was born in Mexico and that his family members are in Mexico. The claimant indicated that her ex-partner must have been lying. When asked about why the article mentions XXXX relationships and children with other women but nothing about her and their children together, the claimant also testified that her ex-partner must have lied. The date and age in the article of when XXXX first left for the United States and when the claimant indicated she left to the United States with her ex-partner are also different. The claimant testified that her ex-partner must have lied about all these facts. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the website or news agency from which the article came from would have sought some corroborating evidence for the content of the article. There is no indication that the article depended entirely upon statements from XXXX XXXX XXXX. The panel finds the claimants explanations not credible or reasonable.\n[37] The panel finds that the inclusion of the article on XXXX XXXX XXXX and the photographs were included for the purposes of establishing a more dangerous profile of the associate claimant's ex-partner and his criminal activities. Based on the testimony and evidence, the panel does not accept that XXXX XXXX XXXX is the associate claimant's ex-partner, \"XXXX. XXXX.\"\nEx-Partner as Member of Mara 18 and Sinaloa Cartel\n[38] The panel is willing to accept that the associate claimant's ex-partner may have been involved in gangs in the United States, including being affiliated with Mara 18 and the Sinaloa Cartel. The panel notes that Mara 18 does not have a significant presence in Colombia based on the objective evidence for the country.36\n[39] Regarding the Sinaloa Cartel's presence in Colombia, the panel notes that the Sinaloa Cartel is a Mexican cartel that has some presence along the borders of Colombia, particularly along the borders with Ecuador and Venezuela:\nAccording to a 2016 article published in Jane's Intelligence Review and written by Annette Idler [8], borderlands are \"attractive spaces for violent non-state groups including right-wing groups and criminals\" (Jane's Intelligence Review 7 Oct. 2016). According to the same source, [v]iolent non-state groups collaborate with each other in Colombia's borderlands, especially along the borders with Ecuador and Venezuela. These groups include the two remaining leftist groups - [ELN] and a small remaining faction of the [EPL] - as well as right-wing groups that emerged after the 2006 demobilisation of the paramilitary umbrella group [AUC], and criminal groups including the Mexican Sinaloa Cartel. (Jane's Intelligence Review 7 Oct. 2016) Idler further indicates that \"in regions such as Colombia's southern department of Putumayo new groups such as Mexican cartels have arrived to fill power vacuums\"37\n[40] Even if the panel was to find that the associate claimant's ex-partner was part of Mara 18 gang and the Sinaloa Cartel, the panel notes that these criminal organizations are not known to have significant presence in Colombia and groups such as the Sinaloa Cartel are predominantly located along the borderlands.38 The panel finds the influence and reach of being a member of such organizations to be limited in Colombia.\nEx-Partner as Member of the Autodefensas Gaitanistas of Colombia (\"AGC\")\n[41] The associate claimant also testified that her ex-partner is a member of the AGC. The claimant testified that since arriving in Canada, her ex-partner visited her sister in Bogota Colombia six times between XXXX 2018 to XXXX 2019 asking for the claimant's whereabouts and threatening to kill the associate claimant. The associate claimant testified that her sister would call her each time her ex-partner came to her sister's apartment, but the claimant does not recall the exact dates, except his first visit on XXXX XXXX, 2018.\n[42] During his last visit in XXXX 2019, the claimant indicated her ex-partner came with two other armed men and told her sister he was part of the AGC and that the claimant and her family were military targets. Nothing was given to the claimant's sister indicating the ex-partner was part of the AGC, or that claimants were military targets, other than the ex-partner telling her sister this information. The panel notes that the claimant's sister provided a letter attesting to the visits by the claimant's ex-partner and his threats.39\n[43] The claimant testified that her sister lives in an apartment in Bogota. The claimant testified that her sister has not tried to move as she has five children and does not have another place to live. There is no indication that the claimant's sister or her family have been harmed by the claimant's ex-partner or anyone else despite the threats over the past year.\n[44] The panel finds that the associate claimant's ex-partner may have tried to locate the claimant again through the claimant's sister who still lives in Bogota. However, the panel does not find that the ex-partner is part of the AGC. There is no indication that the claimant's ex-partner was involved, or planning to be involved, with the AGC in all the previous interactions with the associate claimant over the years that he was allegedly continuing to find or threaten her. The panel finds the timing of the disclosure of the claimant's ex-partner declaring himself to be part of the AGC to be suspect, given that he had visited the claimant's sister six times and only revealed his membership during the last visit, which is about a month prior to the claimant's refugee hearing in Canada. Based on the evidence and testimony, the panel does not find that the associate claimant's ex-partner is part of the AGC.\n[45] Even if the panel finds that the claimant's ex-partner is still interested in pursuing the claimants and that he is a member of the AGC or Mara 18 and Sinaloa Cartel, the panel finds that there is the existence of a viable IFA.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[46] The panel finds that there is a viable internal flight alternative (\"IFA\") in the city of Tunja, Boyaca, Colombia.\nThe Two-Pronged Test\n[47] The test to be applied in determining whether there is a viable internal flight alternative is two-pronged.40 Firstly, the panel must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no serious possibility that the claimants would be persecuted in the proposed internal flight alternative location. Secondly, the conditions in the proposed internal flight alternative location must be such that it would not be objectively unreasonable under the circumstances, including those particular to the claimants, for them to seek refuge there. Both of these prongs must be satisfied for a finding that the claimants have an internal flight alternative.\nThe First Prong of the Test - No Risk of Persecution or Risk to Life or Cruel and Unusual Treatment or Punishment or Torture\n[48] The associate testified that her ex-partner identified himself as being a member of the AGC. The panel asked the associate claimant if she and her family would be able to move to Tunja. The claimant testified that her ex-partner would be able to find her in any part of Colombia and that if he was able to locate her in Bogota and Cali, cities with much larger populations, he would be able to locate her in Tunja. The panel notes in its above analysis that it does not find the associate claimant's ex-partner threatened her in Cali in 2014. Regarding the attack against the claimant in 2010, the panel notes that the claimant was living in a neighbourhood in Bogota at the time. The associate claimant's family members live in Bogota and as far as the associate claimant knows, her ex-partners family members also lived in Bogota. The panel is willing to accept that the claimant's ex-partner may have had additional resources available to him in Bogota that he was able to find the claimant in that city. However, the panel does not find that the ex-partner's profile is as such that he would be able to locate her in a city such as Tunja, where the AGC, Mara 18, and Sinaloa Cartel are not known to have a presence.\n[49] As a member of the AGC, the panel notes that NDP Item 7.2 reveals that the AGC do not have a presence in Tunja (rather, it notes that the ELN has been responsible for two incidents in Boyaca in 2016\/17 and that there were no reported incidents occurring in Tunja).41 The panel finds that the NDP does not contain significant objective documentation that confirms that the AGC are active in Boyaca department generally, or Tunja in particular.\n[50] In post-hearing disclosure, which the panel ultimately accepted and marked as Exhibit 19 and Exhibit 20, counsel provided articles and submissions regarding the suitability of Tunja as an IFA.42 Counsel has attempted to link violence in Boyaca, as potentially being caused by the AGC. Counsel references an article, dated May 3, 2017, indicating that paramilitarism against social leaders and human rights activist have expanded in Colombia, including in Boyaca.43 Another article dated March 17, 2018 indicated that there was evidence of risk against human rights defenders in 10 municipalities in Boyaca, including Tunja.44 The panel notes that the article focuses on armed group ELN in the area.45 A third article was also provided about paramilitary organizations in specific locations around Boyaca, including the Front Heroes of Boyaca, the Lanceros de Velez, Peasant Self-Defense Forces of Casanare, and Heroes de Malaga.46\n[51] The panel finds that these articles do not assist the claimants as Boyaca department was not an area that the FARC has vacated as historically it appears to have been predominantly an area of ELN influence.47 The panel also notes that the claimants are not social leaders or human rights activists. Rather, the objective documentation suggests that the ELN had skirmishes with one police department in the Playa municipality within Boyaca.48 As such, the panel finds that it has not been established, on a balance of probabilities, that the AGC have targeted Tunja in Boyaca department. The panel does not see evidence provided that establishes, on a balance of probabilities, that the AGC has in fact established themselves in Tunja, Boyaca department.\n[52] Further, the objective documentation contained in the NDP at items 7.24,49 7.2,50 7.1551 7.2352 and 7.2453 suggests, on a balance of probabilities, that the AGC do not have a presence in Boyaca department in general or Tunja in particular. The panel therefore finds that in the absence of sufficient credible or corroborative evidence from the claimants that Tunja is unsafe for them, that the previously cited objective documentation outweighs the claimants' testimonies and counsel's articles on this point. Therefore, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the potential threat from the ex-partner being a member of the AGC, or other members of the AGC, do not extend to Tunja and there is therefore no serious possibility of persecution of the claimant's or a risk to their lives or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Tunja.\n[53] Based on the above considerations, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants do not face a serious possibility of persecution or face a danger of torture, a risk to their lives, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, should they relocate to the city of Tunja, Colombia.\nSecond Prong - Reasonableness\n[54] Regarding the reasonableness of the proposed IFAs, the panel finds that it is not unreasonable in all of the particular circumstances of the claimants' situation, that in returning to Colombia, they could relocate to the city of Tunja. The panel is mindful that the test to establish whether the proposed IFA is unreasonable has a very high threshold. Indeed, \"it requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant.\"54 The question to be answered on the second prong of the test is whether expecting the claimant to relocate to the proposed IFA locations would be \"unduly harsh.\"55 Further, actual and concrete evidence of such conditions must be presented.56\n[55] The Court has been clear that \"the hardship associated with relocation is not the kind that renders an IFA unreasonable.\"57 The Federal Court of Appeal has been clear that \"undue hardship resulting from loss of employment, loss of status, reduction in quality of life, loss of aspirations, loss of beloved ones and frustration of one's wishes and expectations\"58 does not meet the threshold required under the second prong of the test.\n[56] The associate claimant was asked if they are not under threat by her ex-partner, if there are any other reasons why they could not move to Tunja. The associate claimant responded, \"No, there would be no other reason.\" The panel did not see evidence from the claimants indicating problems moving to the IFA locations other than thinking they could be found by the ex-partner.\n[57] The panel notes that the onus is on the claimants to establish whether it is unduly harsh to relocate to the proposed IFA locations. The panel finds that the claimants have failed to meet this onus and has, in fact, indicated that the IFA location is reasonable. The panel therefore finds it would not be unduly harsh for the claimants to move to the proposed IFA location.\n[58] The panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimants have a viable internal flight alternative in the city of Tunja. Internal flight alternative is determinative to claims assessed under both section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nOther Claimants\n[59] The panel has considered the claims of the principal claimant and minor claimant in light of them basing their claims on the associate claimant, and the overall testimony, evidence, and submissions presented. The panel finds the associate claimant does not face a serious possibility of risk on forward looking basis and that there is the existence of a viable IFA in Colombia. The panel likewise has come to the same conclusion for the other claimants for all the reasons set out above.\nCONCLUSION\n[60] With respect to the claimants, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX, and as previously noted, the panel finds that they would not face a serious possibility of persecution on any Convention ground, or that, on a balance of probabilities, he would be personally subjected to a risk to life or to a risk of cruel or unusual treatment or punishment, or to a danger of torture upon return to their country of citizenship, the United States of America.\n[61] Having considered the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimants, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, are neither Convention Refugees nor persons in need of protection, pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, as the claimants do not face a serious possibility of persecution upon a return to Colombia, and because their respective removals to Colombia would not subject them personally, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to their lives, or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or to a danger of torture.\n[62] Their claims are therefore rejected.\n(signed)\n\"S.

The claimant was married to another stateless Palestinian, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and has one child, XXXX XXXX.\n[4] The claimant described being terminated from his employment on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017 due to his ethnicity as a stateless Palestinian. The claimant testified that this left his temporary residence status in the UAE in jeopardy. He testified he could not find any other work.\n[5] The only country the claimant testified he could live in was Lebanon, which the claimant described as being unable to do so due to threats from ISIS that he received when visiting his uncle.\n[6] The claimant and his wife and child left the UAE on a valid American visa, and came to Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017. After they arrived in Canada, the claimant and his wife separated, and the matters were severed.\nDETERMINATION\n[7] Having considered the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\n[8] The determinative issue in this claim is the lack of an objective basis for a claim.\nIdentity\n[9] The panel was provided with a true copy of the claimant's passport.3\n[10] The panel finds that the claimant has established his identity and his status as a stateless Palestinian on a balance of probabilities.\nArticle 1(E) Exclusion\n[11] The claimant, while a resident in Canada, was involved in a domestic dispute with his wife, and was arrested on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2018. The panel was provided documents that indicated the claimant was \"abusive\" during the marriage while in the UAE.4\n[12] The claimant provided clear evidence that the matter in Canada was withdrawn by the Crown, without a peace bond.5\n[13] After examining the documentary evidence, noting the lack of a conviction and the lack of any accusation of violence against the claimant except for the incident for which he was arrested in his wife's affidavit, the panel finds that there is no serious possibility that the claimant committed a major offence as defined by case-law, and finds that there are no Article 1(E) exclusion issues.\nCountries of Habitual Residence\n[14] The male claimant is a stateless Palestinian. Statelessness per se does not give rise to a claim to refugee status: the claimant must demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution based on a Convention ground or that they possess a s.97(1) risk in a country of former habitual residence.\n[15] The concept of \"former habitual residence\" implies a situation where a stateless person was admitted to a country with a view to enjoying a period of continuing residence for some duration. The claimant does not have to be legally able to return to a country of former habitual residence. The claimant must have established a significant period of de facto residence in the country in question. The claimant must establish that he is persecuted in one country of former habitual residence, and are unable to safely return to any other.6\n[16] The Federal Court of Appeal established that a broad and liberal approach must be taken when assessing a proposed country of former habitual residence: there is no minimum period of residence required in that country, the analysis should not be unduly restrictive, the claimant does not need to be able to legally return; and the claimant must have established some significant period of de facto residence there.7\n[17] The claimant was born and lived for most of his life in the UAE. The panel finds that the UAE is a country of habitual residence for him.\n[18] While the claimant has documents from Lebanese authorities, is able to enter and leave Lebanon, has some familial connections, it was clear from the claimant's testimony that he had only been in Lebanon on four occasions for relatively brief periods of 1-2 weeks. While aware that the panel is to consider a broad and contextual analysis in relation to countries of habitual residence, the panel accepted the claimant's testimony that he has never resided in Lebanon with an intent to reside there permanently. The panel finds that Lebanon is not a country of habitual residence.\n[19] The panel finds that the UAE is the only country of habitual residence.\nNexus\n[20] The panel finds that through the documentary evidence provided, the claimant has established a nexus to a Convention ground, namely his ethnicity given his status as a stateless Palestinian.\nCredibility\n[21] The panel is aware of its presumption that a claimant's sworn testimony is to be presumed truthful unless cause was shown otherwise. The panel had some concerns with regard to the claimant's credibility.\nFailure to Claim in the United States (US)\n[22] The panel asked the claimant why he had not applied for refugee status while in the US. The claimant indicated he stayed with his wife's family while there on his way to Canada.\n[23] The claimant indicated that he was afraid because of Donald Trump's policies as his family were Sunni Muslims.\n[24] The panel finds it unreasonable that the claimant, who was stateless, would not apply for refugee status in the first signatory country that he arrived at, even considering Trump's language regarding Muslim claimants. The panel notes that the Palestinian Authority and the UAE were not on the list of countries subject to a travel ban.\n[25] The panel rejects the claimant's explanation, and draws a negative inference with regard to his credibility and his subjective fear.\nISIS\n[26] The claimant indicated he was in fear in Lebanon due to being approached by ISIS on two occasions.\n[27] The panel noted that, in his BOC description, he had not indicated they were ISIS members, but had used the generic \"armed members of a militant group.\".\n[28] The claimant indicated that this was his mistake.\n[29] The panel finds it unlikely that the claimant would not have named the militant group ISIS, which is also named in his BOC, if he had serious inclination that they were affiliated with ISIS.\n[30] The panel rejects the claimant's explanation and draws a negative inference with regard to his credibility.\n[31] The claimant was asked how the purported militants would be able to identify him. He stated that they knew his first name, but that they probably did not have any other information.\n[32] The panel finds it improbable that the claimant could be identified in another part of Lebanon if only his first name \"XXXX\" is known to the recruiters.\n[33] The panel rejects the claimant's explanation for the discrepancy, and draws a negative inference with regard to his credibility.\n[34] The claimant also said that he accepted their offer to work for them.\n[35] The panel pointed out that in his BOC form, he indicated he had declined.\n[36] The claimant said it \"wasn't an acceptance acceptance [sic],\" and that he had told them he wanted to work for them to get them away from him while not intending to work for them.\n[37] The panel finds that the claimant, if he did accept the offer, would have put so in his BOC.\n[38] The panel rejects the discrepancy, and draws a negative inference with regard to his credibility.\n[39] The panel finds that the claimant was not threatened by ISIS in Lebanon and does not face recruitment by ISIS if he were to be returned to Lebanon.\nOBJECTIVE BASIS\n[40] The claimant testified to being fired from his employment due to being a Stateless Palestinian, and when questioned by the panel earlier in the hearing noted that he had been given a choice between working in an inhospitable location or being terminated when he had been completing his XXXX XXXX by the employer.\n[41] The claimant described hearing from his parents that there were more people who were being terminated in the UAE, and that this was due to them being stateless Palestinians.\n[42] The claimant provided no other incidents of persecution or evidence of persecution in the UAE other than these incidents.\n[43] The panel finds that the treatment the claimant purportedly suffered at the behest of a private company, with regard to his employment, does not rise to the level of cumulative persecution.\n[44] Objective information indicates that the Palestinians are given the chance to obtain residency visas like any other nationality.8 While the claimant has provided objective evidence indicating Palestinians are being dismissed from employment in the UAE and that the UAE is moving toward a more sympathetic position with regard to Israel,9 the evidence did not offer a comparative analysis of whether the job dismissals were happening compared to any other ethnic group or expatriate population that would show a basis of discrimination, or that the UAE's relationship with Israel was directly connected with denying stateless Palestinian worker's residence permits.\n[45] The UAE is a sovereign country that has the right to determine its employment and citizenship laws. Objective information indicates that the Palestinians are given the chance to obtain residency visas like any other nationality.10 The laws that the claimant believes would result in him being rejected residence are of general application. The fact that the claimant would have to find an employer who can sponsor a new residency permit does not constitute persecution. This is a condition imposed by the UAE's government for obtaining a residency permit which does not breach any of the claimant's fundamental rights. The UAE can impose restrictions in its efforts to regulate the job market and make rules on how foreigners enter and\/or leave its territory.\n[46] The panel notes that the revocation of the claimant's residence cancellation indicates the claimant \"Must leave the country or change status up to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX2019, if the person does not comply with this, s\/he will bear all illegal procedures[sic]\". The panel asked the claimant if he were to obtain some other form of residence in the UAE. He indicated he was not able to.\n[47] The panel noted that he was able to maintain residence in the UAE from XXXX 2008 to XXXX 2009 despite being unemployed.11 The claimant responded that this was due to his a XXXX XXXX XXXX sponsorship and that he would not be able to do so again.\n[48] The panel finds it unlikely that the claimant was able to stay in the country legally under sponsorship when he was unemployed for a year and not be able to do so in the future.\n[49] The panel rejects the claimant's explanation for why he was able to stay for an extended period in 2008-09 without working or studying. Given this and his prior credibility concerns, the panel finds that the claimant has not established, on a balance of probabilities, that he would not be able to re-enter the UAE under a different form of residence.\n[50] Even if the claimant were to be denied entry to the UAE, the panel finds that this would be due to a law of general application regarding non-citizens, and not based on any nexus ground. The panel finds that the prospective denial of entry for the claimant is not persecutory. If the claimant were to be denied entry and deported, which would seem to be the probable result of his return,12 the claimant was clear that he would be permitted to enter Lebanon.\n[51] The claimant provided no evidence that he faced any other risk in the UAE related to Section 96 or 97.1 of IRPA.\n[52] The panel finds that the claimant has not established an objective basis for his claim.\nCONCLUSION\n[53] The panel finds that while the claimant has not shown that he faces a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground or that, on the balance of probabilities, he would face a risk to his life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the UAE, his only country of habitual residence.\n[54] The claim is rejected.\n(signed)\n\" T.

The claimant was introduced to a XXXX, who asked him about job opportunities. While unable to help, the claimant testified he was later asked by XXXX if the two could meet up while they were on vacation in Sri Lanka. The claimant obliged and gave XXXX his home address in Sri Lanka.\n[4] While the claimant was at his parent's house on vacation in Sri Lanka, he was visited by army officers on XXXX XXXX, 2018, who informed the claimant that XXXX was a member of the underground LTTE. The claimant testified that he was then interrogated and beaten, being held until XXXX XXXX, 2018, after his aunt paid a XXXX XXXX XXXX Rupee bribe to secure his release.\n[5] The claimant, fearful that his status in Qatar was too temporary for safety, travelled to the United States on a valid visa on XXXX XXXX, 2018, and entered Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2018 under an exception to the safe third country agreement.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] Having considered the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\n[7] The determinative issue was credibility.\nIdentity\n[8] The claimant was able to provide a true copy of a valid Sri Lankan passport.3\n[9] The panel finds that through his testimony and the documentary evidence provided,4 the claimant has established his identity on a balance of probabilities.\nCountries of Reference\n[10] The claimant had residency status in Qatar tied to his employment, which the claimant voluntarily left to travel to Canada.\n[11] The panel does not find that the status in Qatar, which the panel finds to be temporary, gave the claimant the rights and responsibilities of a citizen as the claimant did not have the right to obtain social benefits or to education. The panel finds that Sri Lanka is the only country of reference in the matter.\nCredibility\n[12] While the panel is aware of the general presumption of truth of the claimant's testimony, the panel had serious issues with the claimant's testimony regarding key matters that went to the heart of the claim.\n[13] The claimant testified that during his interrogation, he was kicked and hit with fists. The panel asked if there were any other harms that he was subject to. The claimant indicated there were not.\n[14] It was indicated to the claimant that his BOC form had indicated that he was hit with a plastic pipe.\n[15] The claimant responded that this was what he meant when he was hit with a hand.\n[16] The panel finds it unreasonable that, when it was put to the claimant specifically how he was harmed, that he would not remember the cause of that harm, especially the use of a weapon.\n[17] The panel rejects the claimant's explanation for the discrepancy with his BOC, and draws a negative inference with regard to his credibility.\n[18] The claimant, in describing his interrogation by Sri Lankan authorities, testified that he was tied up, and then shown a photo of XXXX, whom he recognized.\n[19] It was brought to the claimant's attention that in his BOC he had indicated he had been shown XXXX's picture before he was tied up.\n[20] The claimant then said that he was shown before, and that he was shown subsequently and this is what he had meant when describing the incident.\n[21] The panel finds it highly unlikely that the claimant would mistake the timing of first seeing the picture of the cause for his internment before his alleged mistreatment at the hands of Sri Lankan authorities began.\n[22] The panel rejects the claimant's explanation for the discrepancy, and draws a negative inference with regard to the claimant's credibility.\n[23] Given that the claimant incorrectly described the order of events in the interrogation, and given that the claimant did not describe being hit by a weapon despite his mentioning in his BOC that he was, the panel finds that the detention did not occur.\nXXXX\n[24] The panel asked the claimant about his interactions with XXXX. The claimant described a conversation regarding a possible job for XXXX at the claimant's workplace, and then a conversation in which XXXX asked to meet the claimant in Sri Lanka. The claimant said he had no contact with XXXX other than this.\n[25] The claimant then, despite only having two conversations of substance with XXXX, testified that XXXX wanted to travel approximately120-130 km to see the claimant in Sri Lanka.\n[26] The panel asked why the claimant had agreed to this. The claimant indicated that he was merely being polite, and that he never thought XXXX would ever come.\n[27] The claimant provided a variety of photographs of the badminton group.5 When asked if XXXX was pictured, the claimant testified that none featured XXXX.\n[28] The claimant provided two letters purporting to be from members of the badminton group.6 The claimant testified that the knowledge of these letters was primarily from him, given that they focus on events that occurred after the claimant left Qatar. Neither letter provides details relating to the relationship between the claimant and XXXX, or the reason why they would meet in Sri Lanka, despite including other details regarding the case that occurred outside of their knowledge. The panel gives the letters little weight in its analysis.\n[29] It was put to the claimant that in his interview with immigration authorities, he did not mention that XXXX planned to visit him in Sri Lanka or XXXX' sister's welding, and only mentioned that XXXX had the claimant's telephone number on his telephone.\n[30] The claimant testified that he had mentioned this at some point to immigration authorities, and may not have mentioned this to immigration authorities in the interview because they wanted him to be brief in his answer.\n[31] The panel finds it unlikely that the claimant, who is well-educated and sophisticated, would not have mentioned the reason that his contact information was in XXXX's phone to Canadian authorities, given that it was the main reason he was detained in Sri Lanka\n[32] The panel rejects the claimant's explanation, and draws a negative inference with regard to his credibility.\n[33] Given his inability to provide a clear substantiation of his relationship with XXXX, the claimant's previous issues with credibility, the panel finds that the claimant has not established, on a balance of probabilities, that XXXX had agreed to meet the claimant in Sri Lanka or that he had given XXXX his address, which was the claimant's stated cause of his detention.\nSubjective Fear\n[34] The claimant was asked why he had fled to Canada, instead of going back to Qatar, where he had a job and what he confirmed was an indeterminate status at work.\n[35] The claimant responded that he was generally unsure about future job prospects in Qatar and thought his status could be revoked at any time.\n[36] The panel finds it unlikely that the claimant, if he had a subjective fear of being persecuted in Sri Lanka, would immediately go to the expense and risk of travel to Canada when he had a job and a legal status awaiting him in Qatar.\n[37] The panel rejects the claimant's explanation, and draws a negative inference with regard to the claimants' credibility and his subjective fear.\nOther Evidence\n[38] The claimant provided an English-language affidavit from his aunt.7\n[39] The claimant was asked if his aunt was fluent in English. He responded she did not speak English, but could probably understand a little.\n[40] The affidavit read, \"The contents of the forgoing affidavit were read over and explained by me in Tamil to the affirm, who understood and placed her signature in front of me in the City of XXXX, on this day XXXX XXXX XXXX, 2019\".\n[41] The panel had a number of issues with this. The affidavit provides no indication of the lawyer's knowledge of English, or his ability to interpret. It does not state it was interpreted, and only that the claimant \"understood\" and signed the document.\n[42] The claimant did not know whether the lawyer was an interpreter or not.\n[43] To benefit from a presumption given to sworn evidence, the panel must be satisfied that the affiant understands what was put to her. The panel, given the claimant's testimony, is not satisfied that this was the case.\n[44] The panel finds that, given the above issues, the panel is unaware if the claimant's aunt knew what she was swearing. The panel gives the affidavit little weight as evidence.\nSummary\n[45] Given that the panel has found that the main incident of persecution did not occur and that XXXX's address has been found not to have been given to the claimant, elements the panel finds that go to the heart of the claimant's claim, as well as the panel's concerns regarding the other documentary evidence provided and the claimant's apparent lack of subjective fear, the panel finds that the claimant has not established that any of the events he described had occurred, given that the events were connected to the claimant's alleged detention.\nSTATUS AS A REFUGEE CLAIMANT\n[46] Objective evidence indicates that some persons, mainly Tamil males, are subject to screening and questioning at Sri Lankan airports upon return.8 Objective information indicates that screening and arrests are typically for the purposes of either establishing the former claimants' identity (to be sure there is no prior criminal involvement), and that incidents relating to torture of returning refugee claimants are typically a risk only to those suspected of membership or involvement in the LTTE.910\n[47] With regard to the claimant's profile, the panel did not accept that the claimant was detained, and thus does not find it likely that he is believed to be an LTTE supporter or member and would not face differential treatment in this regard.\n[48] The claimant would also return with a valid passport, with a valid embarkation stamp,11 having left Sri Lanka while on vacation from an indefinite contract in Qatar. The panel does not find it likely that the claimant would face issues upon arrival in Sri Lanka.\n[49] The panel thus does not find that he would face a serious possibility of persecution, or face a danger of torture or of cruel and usual treatment or punishment, based on his residual profile or as a failed refugee claimant from Sri Lankan authorities.\nCONCLUSION\n[50] The panel finds that the claimant does not face a serious possibility of persecution in Sri Lanka on the basis of a Convention ground, or that, on a balance of probabilities, he faces a risk to his life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or of torture.\n[51] The panel rejects the claim.\n(signed)\n\"T.

GUELLER\nTribunal\nCounsel for the Claimant(s)\nAmro Hayek\nConseil(s) du (de la\/des) demandeur(e)(s) d'asile\nDesignated Representative(s)\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\nRepr\u00e9sentant(e)(s) d\u00e9sign\u00e9(e)(s)\nCounsel for the Minister\nN\/A\nConseil du (de la) ministre\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The principal claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, her husband, the associate claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and their minor daughters XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, are citizens of Egypt and are seeking refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act).\n[2] Pursuant to Rule 55 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules,1 the claims for refugee protection were heard jointly. The minor claimants all relied on the Basis of Claim (BOC) narrative of the principal claimant. The principal claimant was appointed as the Designated Representative for her two children, according to subsection 167(2) of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) Rules.\n[3] In rendering my reasons, I have considered and applied the Chairperson's Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] I find, that neither the principal claimant nor the associate claimant have satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, or that, on a balance of probabilities, they would personally be subjected to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture upon return to Egypt.\n[5] I also find that the principal claimant did not establish that the two female minor claimants face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, or that, on a balance of probabilities, they would personally be subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment upon return to Egypt.\nIDENTITY\n[6] The claimants' identities as nationals of Egypt, are established through their testimony and the supporting documentation filed, namely their passports.2\n[7] The claimants stated that they do not have any permanent status in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), as they only had temporary working visas, because both worked there, but they will never be able to obtain any permanent resident status in the UAE.\n[8] The claimants also confirmed at the hearing that they have no permanent resident or citizenship status in any country other than Egypt.\nALLEGATIONS\n[9] The claimants allege that they cannot return to Egypt because they fear persecution by a family member who is threatening them because the principal claimant does not want to marry him; and they also fear the Egyptian government because of the possibility of being imputed as Muslim Brotherhood supporters.\nANALYSIS\nCredibility\n[10] When a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness. Additionally, when assessing credibility, the panel is entitled to rely on its rationality and common sense.\n[11] The determinative issue in this claim is credibility. I find the claimants testimony was inconsistent, vague, and with many inconsistences between their testimony and the Basis of Claim form (BOC).3\nThe claimants allege they cannot return to Egypt because they may be perceived to be associated with the Muslim Brotherhood group by the authorities. I find, on a balance of probabilities, the claimants failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution\nImputed Association with the Muislim Brotherhood group\n[12] The claimants' narrative is that they grew up in the city of Assiut, South of Egypt. They attended a local Islamic School belonging to the Muslim Brotherhood group. The principal claimant's XXXX was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood group and he was well known because he was a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Consequently, they allege that all these factors make them likely to be perceived as members of the Muslim Brotherhood group by the Egyptian authorities.\n[13] The principal and associate claimant's testimony was that they have never been members of the Muslim Brotherhood group, but only passive supportes. They liked the political ideology of the group, but they never participated in rallies or other activities organized by the Muslim Brotherhood group.\n[14] I asked the claimants whether they have ever experienced persecution at the hands of the Egyptian authorities, such as detention or searches, as a result of their alleged imputed association with the Muslim Brotherhood.\n[15] The claimants responded that the associate claimant was detained and questioned at the Egyptian airport once in 2019 for two or three hours probably because they were told they were on a list as a Muslim Brotherhood supporter.\n[16] I asked the claimant why he omitted to declare in his Schedule A, page 2 question J4 that he was detained.\n[17] The associate claimant responded that maybe he misunderstood the question.\n[18] I do not accept this explanation, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that someone who has been detained not long ago before leaving a country, where he alleges that he is being persecuted by the authorities, would have remembered something that important. The associate claimant was able to enter and leave on other occasions and was able to finish his affairs before coming to Canada, like banks, renewing drivers licences, donating their furniture and closing their home in Cairo, without any problems. I therefore, draw a negative inference regarding the claimant's credibility and I find that he has never been detained at the airport or anywhere else due to any suspicion about him being a Muslim Brotherhood member.\n[19] The principal claimant testified that she went back every year to Egypt for 3 or 4 weeks to visit her family and vacation time, but she never had a problem related to the authorities suspecting she is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood.\n[20] I find, on a blance of probabilities, that the claimants have been able to enter and leave Egypt freely every year between 2008 to 2018, the princial claimant was also able to move freely and stayed inside the country for 3 or 4 weeks every year. Therefore, on a balance of probabilities, I do not find that the Egyptian authorities are perceiving them as members of the Muslim Brotherhood and they are not being persecuted by the authorities.\n[21] Therefore, I find, the claimants failed to prove that they have a well-founded fear of persecution by the Egyptian authorities if they return to Egypt.\n[22] I note the information for Egypt in the National Documentation Package for Egypt states:\nAirport\n8.1.1 According to the 2017 DFAT Egypt Country Information Report: 'The Passport Control Department of the Interior Ministry is responsible for conducting exit checks, which DFAT assesses as strictly enforced. When leaving Egypt, Egyptians must present a valid passport and a valid visa for their destination country, if required. Egyptian males are required to show evidence of their military service status (including proof of exemption, if relevant). Such proof could be an exemption certificate; an expired passport noting exemption from military service; or a permission to travel issued by the Conscription Department.\n'Egypt keeps records of entries and exits from the country, and security services have the capacity to find out if an individual is in Egypt or abroad. Egyptian law prevents persons from leaving the country if they have criminal charges against their names. These names are recorded on a 'warning list', amended by judges and the Prosecutor-General, against which all travellers\nare checked prior to departing from the country. Credible human rights organisations have reported that the Interior Ministry and the Egyptian General Intelligence Service can amend this 'warning list' to include persons of interest to the security apparatus, including for political reasons [...].\n8.2.3 The same Amnesty article stated that:\n'In many of the cases documented by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, airport authorities gave no reason for stopping the person from boarding a flight abroad and have refused to provide any formal documentation of the travel ban. In some cases, officers of the Interior Ministry's National Security Agency questioned the traveller, searched their\nluggage and phones and seized their passport without justification. In others, the Office of the Public Prosecutor ordered the bans in relation to criminal investigations without informing the individual of the case or charges against them. In most cases, the people barred from travelling have not been told when or if the ban will end.\"5\n[23] I reject the claimants explanations for the following reasons:\n* The claimants have entered and exited Egypt from 2008 to 2019, at least once a year without being detained or arrested.\n* On each visit to Egypt, the claimants stayed for a period of 3 to 4 weeks, without any problem with the authorities.\n* They have never been arrested or detained and their house has never been searched.\n* The principal and associate claimant have never been members of the Muslim Brotherhood or active suporteers.\n* The claimants stated that they are afraid because anyone can be a suspect in Egypt.\n* The claimants failed to prove that they were in a governmental warning list, because they have never been detained or arrested by the government, at the airport or inside the country.\n[24] Based on the supporting NDP evidence, the Egyptian government keeps strict control of records of entries and exits from the country, including warning lists of persons of interest for political reasons.\n[25] Therefore, I find, on a balance of probabilities that if the authorities had percevied the claimants as members of the banned Muslim Brotherhood organization, the authorities would likely have detained or arrested the claimants on each time they entered or exited the country. However, that has not happened.\n[26] For the above mentioned reasons, I therefore find that on a balance of probabilities, there is less than a mere possibility that the claimants will be persecuted if they return to Egypt on the basis of an imputed political opinion.\nPersecution by her cousin - Minors risk\n[27] The principal claimant's narrative is that one of her cousins wanted to marry her. However, she married her husband in 2003, and her cousin, XXXX, has been harrasing and threatening her and her family since then. She also alleges that he was a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, around the year 2006.\n[28] The claimant's testimony is that specifically after 2015, each time she went to Cairo for the annual vacation, her cousin was able to locate her when she was in Cairo and threatened her in person and over the telephone. She testified that in XXXX 2018, her cousin attacked her in the street and he tried to kidnapp her youngest daughter. Consequently, on XXXX XXXX, 2018 she filed a report with the police against her cousin.\n[29] I asked the claimant whether she followed up with the report, or requested protection from the authorities.\n[30] The principal claimant's explanation was that she filed a report6 with the police, but they never contacted her cousin. She also stated that she never followed up because the police never called her back and that after coming to Canada, she left a lawyer in charge of the matter, but the last time she spoke with the lawyer there were no updates and that she never thought of requesting a restraining order.\n[31] I reject the principal claimant's explanantion regarding the police report. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant never intended to follow up on the police report or take any action against her alleged cousin. If she would have been really concerned about the attack or someone kidnapping her daughter, she would have taken any steps towards protecting her daughter. However, the principal claimant's explanation is vague and inconsistent about why she did not follow up with the report. Therefore, for that reason, I find neither the attack nor the kidnapping attempt happened.\n[32] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the police report is not sufficient evidence that a cousin threatened her. The police report only shows that she made a statement before a police officer stating only a name, and saying that she will come back to provide her cousin's information. However, the report does not mention anything about the alleged attack on the street, intention to kidnap her daughteer or the date that these events occurred. In addition, she never cooperated with the police to provide further details necessary to pursue the legal actions against her cousin, and she never followed up or took any further legal steps against the alleged persecutor. Therefore, on a balance of probabilities, I find that the alleged attack or kidnapping attempt did not happen as alleged by the claimant.\n[33] For all of the above mentioned reasons, I find that I will not give weight to the principal claimant's testimony regarding the police report. Therefore, on a balance of probabilities, I find that the claimant failed to prove her alleged cousin was threatening her or tried to kidnap her daughter or that she was attacked on the street by him.\n[34] Therefore I find, on a balance of probabilities, there is less than a mere possibility that the associate and minor claimants will be persecuted by the pricnipal claimant's cousin if they return to Egypt.\nSubjective fear - Delay in leaving\n[35] The claimants narrative is that the associate claimant was terminated from his job in the UAE on XXXX XXXX, 2017. He testified that the termination lettter stated that the reason for his termination was organization structure changes, however, he was told by his employer, that he was terminated because of the imputation of him being a Muslim Brotherhood supporter.\n[36] The associate claimant's testimony was that in 2014-2015, the government of Egypt agreed with the government of the UAE to consider the members of the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group in the UAE. Subsequently he was told that was the real reason of his termination.\n[37] I asked the associate claimant why he left the UAE in 2019, more than 2 years after he was terminated and more than 4 years after the agreement between the two countries.\n[38] The associate claimant's explanation was that his wife was still working and they were living a quiet life to not call the attention of the authorities. That they were afraid of going back to Egypt and not very concerned of staying in the UAE. He also testified that during those 2 years, he was applying for jobs everywhere, including the UAE and Egypt.\n[39] I cannot accept the explanation of the associate claimant for the following reasons:\n* Despite being told that he was terminated for being a Muslim Brotherhood supporter, he remained in the UAE trying to find another job there for more than two years.\n* He was afraid to go back to Egypt, but the evidence before me, is that the claimants continued travelling to Egypt for visits and vacation at least once a year for several weeks.\n* The claimants never had a problem entering and exiting Egypt or UAE airports, and were never detained or arrested.\n* The associate claimant testified that he was also looking for a job anywhere including Egypt, but he could not find one.\n[40] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants continued living in the UAE, more than 4 years after the agreement between both countries which banned the Muslim Brotherhood in the UAE. The associate claimant also continued looking for a job in the UAE and Egypt, despite their fear of retunring to Egypt. I reject the claimants allegation that they were afraid of returning to Egypt, because they went back every year since 2008 and they only stopped going to Egypt just before coming to Canada, after the principal claimant lost her job in the UAE in XXXX 2018.\n[41] Therefore, on a balance of probabilities, I find, the claimants allegations of being afraid to return to Egypt are not concurrent with their actions of continuing to travel to Egypt and their failure to seek protection for more than four years after they were allegedly put at risk in the UAE. Therefore, on a balance of probabilities, I find that the claimants allegations are not credible.\n[42] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants do not have a well-founded fear of persecution if they return to Egypt.\nCONCLUSION\n[43] Having considered all of the evidence, I find, that there is not a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground should the claimants XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and their minor daughters XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, return to Egypt, or that, on a balance of probabilities, they would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\n[44] Threfore, these claims are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"P.

The principal claimant was designated the representative for the minor claimant.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimants allege a well-founded fear of persecution in Colombia. They have set out their allegations in greater detail in the narrative portion of their Personal Information Forms (PIFs), and amendments thereto.2 In brief the claimants allege that:\n* In 2004, they incorporated and operated a business in Cali, Colombia;\n* In XXXX 2005, a man identifying himself only as XXXX XXXX telephoned the principal claimant and made a demand that he pay him \"protection money\" in the sum of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX pesos;\n* Contrary to XXXX warning that the principal claimant not go to the police, he did, but did not pay the money demanded. He also changed his cell phone number;\n* XXXX made several more demands that the claimants pay the money. Although his posture became increasingly more threatening, the claimant did not pay the money;\n* The claimants learned from other business owners in their locality that the group to which XXXX belonged operated in several cities in Colombia, and that it was futile to go to the police as they were in collusion with XXXX group;\n* On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2005, their car was vandalized and the contents stolen. The claimants reported the vandalism and theft to the police on the following day;\n* Their complaints to the police yielded no protection as the police told the claimants that they had to complete their investigations before they could offer them protection;\n* The claimants left Colombia for the US at the end of XXXX 2005, where they remained for three years;\n* After they left, XXXX called the principal claimant's mother-in-law who was running the business. He told her he belonged to Los Rastrojos and threatened her;\n* After receiving the call from XXXX, the principal claimant's mother-in-law abandoned the business and joined the family in the US;\n* The claimants spent three years in the US. They came to Canada after their application for work permits were denied; and\n* An attempt was made to kidnap one of the principal claimant's daughters in XXXX 2010, causing her mother to keep her out of school.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] The panel finds that the claimants are not Convention refugees because, in the case of the adult claimants, there is no nexus between what they fear and a Convention ground. The minor claimant was born in the US and is a citizen of that country. She has raised no claim against the US. She is not a Convention refugee.\nIdentity\n[4] Based on the identity documents that were before it,3 the panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimants have established their respective identities and citizenships.\nCredibility\n[5] The panel is prepared to accept the claimants' allegations as credible, except where specifically indicated.\nSection 96: nexus to the Convention ground\n[6] In the present case, the claimants' fear is not linked to a Convention ground, namely, race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. The panel finds that the claimants are victims of crime, in that they are victims of XXXX and his Los Rastrojos gang to whom the principal claimant refused to pay protection money. Being the victim of extortion does not provide the claimants with a link to a Convention ground.\n[7] Federal Court decisions has held that victims of crime, corruption or vendettas generally fail to establish a link between their fear of persecution and one of the Convention grounds in the definition of Convention refugee.4 The Board has been upheld in its finding of lack of nexus, where the claimant was a target of a personal vendetta,5 or where the claimant was a victim of crime.6\n[8] The panel finds that this claim has no nexus to any of the Convention grounds. Accordingly, under section 96 of the IRPA, the claims of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXand XXXX XXXX fail.\n[9] The panel will therefore assess their claims under section 97(1) of the IRPA.\nAre the claimants persons in need of protection?\n[10] Section 97 of the IRPA allows for the grant of protection to foreign nationals who are not Convention refugees in certain circumstances.7 More particularly, section 97(1)(b) of the IRPA requires that there be a \"risk to life, or of cruel and unusual treatment, or punishment if... the person is unable, or because of that risk unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country and that risk would be faced by the person in every part of the country.\"8 The subsection also requires that the risk not be a generalised risk or be inherent to lawful sanction or due to lack of medical services in the country.\n[11] Counsel for the claimants submit that the claimants have met their onus to show that, were they to be returned to Colombia, there is a risk to their lives, which they would face everywhere in Colombia. He submitted that:\n* Los Rastrojos operates widely in Colombia and that there was nowhere where the claimants could go to avoid its reach; and\n* Citing an alleged attempt to kidnap one of the principal claimant's daughter from her school, counsel for the claimants argued that Los Rastrojos and, therefore, XXXX remains interested in the claimants.\n[12] The major hurdle in the claim is that the claimant's wife and her mother have returned to live in Colombia. In the case of the claimant's wife, re-availment occurred in XXXX 2015. She returned to Colombia for medical treatment and has remained there. She and her mother live in Buga, their hometown. In response to the panel, the principal claimant explained that they are only able to live safely because:\n* His mother-in-law is retired;\n* His wife cannot work, avoids communicating, and does not have a cell phone; and\n* His daughters are registered under other names.\n[13] The principal claimant denied that his wife's inability to work is tied to her medical condition, and he claimed that there was nowhere he could go, including his mother's home in Cali, where he would not be in danger or put the other persons living with him in danger.\n[14] Post-hearing, the claimant's submitted documentation that shows that two of the principal claimant's daughters were, in fact, registered under a different name.9\n[15] For the following reasons, the panel is not persuaded by these arguments that the claimants are at risk in Colombia.\n[16] In response to the panel, the principal claimant testified that the business remained in operation for three years after he and his family left Colombia. During this three-year period, XXXX telephoned his mother-in-law only once. The panel finds that this single call is inconsistent with the determined extortioner that the principal claimant sought to portray. Furthermore, if as the principal claimant contended, police officers were involved in XXXX gang, it is more than likely they would have known that he and his family were no longer living above the business premises. Accordingly, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant's mother-in-law never received a threatening demand as contended.\n[17] When he was asked, the principal claimant testified that Buga is about two hours away from Cali. He also testified that the gang's reach has spread, and that they told him that they knew who his family members were. The Board's documentary evidence indicates that Buga is close to the area where Los Rastrojas and other criminal gangs operate.10 Thus, the panel finds that, it is more likely than not Los Rastrojos would be able to locate the principal claimant's wife and mother-in-law in Buga, despite any precaution they may take, if they wanted to do so.\n[18] Further, with respect to the alleged precautions of not working or being without a cellular telephone, the panel rejects this aspect of the testimony because it had before it a sizeable number of money transfer receipts indicating that the principal claimant makes regular remittances to his wife.11 The transfers require him to be able to communicate with his wife. The panel finds that she is, therefore, unlikely to be without some means of communication. In these circumstances, the panel concludes that the principal claimant's wife and her mother are not in hiding, which, casts doubt on his claim that he is a victim of Los Rastrojas and therefore faces a risk to his life.\n[19] The principal claimant testified that XXXX told him he knew his family. He testified that his mother lived in Cali. When he was asked, the principal claimant responded that XXXX had never contacted his mother. Given the testimony and allegations that policemen are involved in Los Rastrojos, the panel finds that an absence of a demand or inquiry to his mother casts doubt on the credibility of the claimant's allegation that he has been targeted by XXXX and Los Rastrojos.\n[20] With respect to his daughters, they are children from the claimant's first marriage. Even accepting that they were registered in school under a different family name, the panel is not persuaded that this was done to protect them from harm. The panel makes this conclusion because the principal claimant testified that his daughters did not live with him and his wife. They lived with their mother and visited on weekends. Even if true, the panel is not persuaded that this would make them a primary target for retaliation.\n[21] The panel acknowledges that a police report was filed that claimed that an attempt had been made to kidnap the claimant's daughter, XXXX XXXX XXXX.12 The report was filed several weeks after the alleged attempt, which is not in keeping with what might reasonably be expected in the circumstances. One would have expected that the report would have been made when the attempt was made. Secondly, the kidnap attempt apparently came some five years after the principal claimant left Colombia. As the principal claimant was XXXX primary target, the panel finds that it would be reasonable to expect that XXXX and Los Rastrojos would have acted sooner. Further, when asked where XXXX and his other children are at present, the principal claimant testified that all three of his older children have been able to complete their schooling and are either pursuing post-secondary education or working. He attributed the fact that they were able to do so to the fact that they lived in separate homes.\n[22] The panel finds that this is not a satisfactory explanation because, while XXXX was sent to live with her maternal grandmother, his other daughter XXXX remained with their mother, which means she could readily be found. The panel is not persuaded that separating the two girls, would make them less likely to be targets of XXXX and Los Rastrojas. Accordingly, the panel finds that the principal claimant has not established that any of his three older children were threatened because of their association with him.\n[23] The panel asked the principal claimant why, some nine years after the last alleged attempt to harm a family member, XXXX and Los Rastrojos would still be interested in him. He responded that they would remain so because he owed them a debt. When asked, the claimant responded that he had no knowledge of whether XXXX was still alive. He stated that he did know that the gang would replace gang members if one did die. The panel finds that there is nothing before it to support a finding that the principal claimant remained a target of Los Rastrojas, if he ever was.\n[24] Counsel for the claimant submitted that the documentary evidence supports the claimants' allegation of a risk to their lives. He rejected the statements in the Board's documentary evidence that Los Rastrojas had diminished both in size and influence. He argued that the gang had both the capacity and the willingness to harm the claimants. He points to item 7.24 in the Board's documentary evidence on Colombia that states that Los Rastrojas is adaptable and that it has worked with other organised crime groups.13 Counsel submitted that the gang remains motivated to harm the claimants because, in the gang's view, the principal claimant has an outstanding debt. Moreover, the gang cannot be seen to forgive or ignore this debt just because of the passage of time.\n[25] While attractive, the panel finds counsel's submissions to be speculative. The Board's documentary evidence indicates that Los Rastrojos, as a criminal enterprise, fell into disarray with the capture of its leadership in about 2012.14 Splinter groups, including local gangs, have invoked its name. The panel relies on the Board's documentary evidence which it prefers due to the fact that it is culled from a wide variety of independent sources, including Amnesty International, The BBC and the CIA. The documentary evidence notes that:\nAccording to sources, military defeats and the capture of its leadership led Los Rastrojos to split into factions... A report, based on information obtained from intelligence sources in the National Police, the Army, and the directorate of the General Attorney's Office... that investigates organized crime, produced by El Colombiano, a Medell\u00edn-based newspaper, indicates that some leaders of Los Rastrojos in Cali who evaded authorities created seven [translation] \"'debt collection agencies'\"... dedicated to contract killing, drug trafficking, threats, extortion and debt collection, often subcontracting to local gangs... The same source indicates that five of the \"agencies\" are composed of 100 members... According to FIP, other independent armed groups started to use the name \"Los Rastrojos\" to commit extortions...15 [footnotes omitted]\n[26] The panel finds that, given the documentary evidence regarding the demise of its leadership, it is equally likely that there is no one around to collect any supposed debt. In other words, counsel's position that Los Rastrojos would pursue the principal claimant if he were to return to Colombia some fourteen years later, is speculative. The panel finds that there is no credible and trustworthy evidence before it that could allow it to find that the principal claimant would be subjected personally to a risk to his life if he were to return to Columbia.\n[27] The panel finds that the principal claimant has failed to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that he would be at risk to his life, or to a risk of cruel and unusual punishment in Colombia.\nThe associate claimants\n[28] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the wife of the principal claimant and their daughter, XXXX XXXX, base their claims for protection on the allegations of the principal claimant. They are alleged to be at risk because they are his family members. They did not raise separate claims.\n[29] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX did not attend the hearing, during which it came out that she had returned to Colombia. While she did not officially withdraw her claim, no representations were put forward on her behalf. Pursuant to section 168(1) of the IRPA, the panel declares her claim to be abandoned.16XXXX XXXX was born in the US and is a citizen of that country. There was no evidence before the panel that she is a citizen of Colombia. XXXX XXXX has not raised any claim against that country. In these circumstances, the panel finds that she is neither a Convention refugee, nor a person in need of protection.\nCONCLUSION\n[30] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel concludes that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has not discharged his burden of proof of establishing that there is a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground. He has also failed to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that he would be personally subjected to a danger of torture, to a risk to his life, or to a risk of cruel and unusual punishment in Colombia.\n[31] His claim is rejected.\n(signed)\n\"H.

Outside of his XXXX career, the claimant was also involved in XXXX, beginning with local politics in 1997, and developing knowledge and further interest in later years.\n[3] In mid 2013, the claimant's brother approached the claimant for advice in advancing his XXXX interest in a XXXX position in Santa Marta for the upcoming election in XXXX 2015. Having been involved previously, he agreed to help his brother as his XXXX XXXX.\n[4] Tragically, however, the claimant learned that his brother, along with four others, had been massacred at a farm house in Masinga. The radio reported that the assailants belonged to an armed group, Los Urabe\u00f1os, a paramilitary group.\n[5] On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014, two unknown men approached the claimant when he was leaving his house. They identified themselves as Los Urabe\u00f1os and threatened the claimant to leave Santa Marta, otherwise he and his family would be killed. The claimant hid, and his lawyer filed a denunciation at the office of Bacrim, which falls under the office of the Attorney General, to open an investigation into the reasons behind the massacre, in which his brother was killed. However, on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014, the claimant received a telephone call from an unknown male, identifying himself as a member of Los Urabe\u00f1os, informing him that he was aware of the denunciation that his family had filed. In XXXX 2014, the P.C. moved to Bogota, where he remained for approximately 40 days, but returned to Santa Marta to see his family in XXXX 2014. He continued to receive threatening phone calls, and he filed a further denunciation.\n[6] On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014 the agents from Santa Marta Metropolitan Police visited the claimant and provided him with a document entitled Basic Self-Protection Measures, which outlined guidelines for self defense and precautions. The claimant, realizing that there was no police protection, sought assistance from other government bodies, including denunciations at the Human Rights District Office and the Office of the Attorney General on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014.\n[7] The claimant did not receive any feedback from these organizations, so he moved to Medellin and back to Santa Marta, and eventually, fearing for his life and that of his family, he decided to leave Colombia. He travelled via the United States (U.S.) where he stayed for 13 days, and arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015. He and his wife have since separated, and therefore, both she and their son are not part of this claim.\nIDENTITY\n[8] The panel is satisfied that the claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, his identity as per his passport.2\nDETERMINATION\n[9] The panel finds that the claimant is not a Convention refugee, nor is he a person in need of protection, in accordance with sections 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b) of the IRPA.\nISSUES\n[10] The determinative issues are credibility and internal flight alternative (IFA).\nCredibility\n[11] In terms of credibility the panel is aware of the difficulties that may be faced by claimants in establishing their claims, namely, the setting of the hearing room and the stress inherent in responding to questions. The panel also considered the passage of time since the claimant's arrival in Canada, namely four and a half years.\n[12] The panel did not find any glaring contradictions or inconsistencies in the claimant's testimony. However, what it did find was a lack of evidence with respect to what has transpired since the claimant's arrival in Canada. Given the passage of time, and the forward-looking Convention refugee definition, the panel must consider the circumstances, which are related to the claimant, at the time of the hearing.\n[13] The panel acknowledges that the corroborative evidence provided by the claimant, particularly original newspaper reports, confirms the fact that the claimant's brother was killed.3 However, there are mixed reports as to whether or not the assailant\/s were apprehended and if the claimant's brother was in fact a target. The panel also accepts the fact that the claimant filed court documents in an attempt to ascertain the cause and the identity of the perpetrators who killed his brother.4 This, according to the claimant, was what made him a target of the paramilitary group. The claimant does not believe that there has been any outcome emanating from his request for an investigation, notwithstanding the newspaper reports which suggest otherwise. Nevertheless, even if the panel finds that the claimant's testimony in this regard outweighs notable media reports, the claimant has failed to provide any further evidence with respect to an ongoing investigation. More importantly, he has not proffered evidence to persuade the panel that he has been pursued since his arrival in Canada in XXXX 2015. The claimant insists that his sister has informed him of the situation, however, he did not think of providing any corroborative evidence attesting to this fact. Moreover, later in testimony, he stated that his lawyer friends have made him aware of this. Again, however, the claimant did not see fit to provide any corroborative evidence in this regard.\n[14] Giving the benefit of the doubt to the claimant that he would continue to be at risk in Santa Marta, and there is no persuasive evidence to suggest this, the panel examined the viability of an IFA.\nInternal flight alternative\n[15] The panel finds that the determinative issue is that there is a viable IFA in the city of Tunja, Boyac\u00e1, Colombia.\n[16] The test to be applied in determining whether there is a viable IFA is two-pronged.5 Firstly, the panel must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted in the proposed IFA location.6 Secondly, the conditions in the proposed IFA location must be such that it would not be objectively unreasonable under the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for him to seek refuge there.7 Both of these prongs must be satisfied for a finding that the claimant has an IFA.\nThe first prong of the test - no risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or torture\nThe threat and identification of group\n[17] The claimant testified that individuals identified themselves to him as being members of the Urabe\u00f1os. The panel accepts, on a balance of probabilities, that the Urabe\u00f1os are the agent of persecution.\n[18] The proposed IFA, Tunja, is the capital of Boyac\u00e1 department.\n[19] The panel asked the claimant if he thought his life would be at risk from the Urabe\u00f1os in Tunja, to which he responded yes. When asked why, he said that he would not be safe anywhere in Colombia. He testified that this is a national criminal group with widespread influence, and therefore, they would have the means and contacts to track him down.\n[20] The panel notes that National Documentation Package (NDP) reveals that the Urabe\u00f1os do not have a presence in Tunja.8 Rather, it notes that the ELN has been responsible for two incidents in Boyac\u00e1 in 2016 and 2017, and that there were no reported incidents occurring in Tunja.\n[21] Further, the objective documentation contained in the NDP suggests, on a balance of probabilities, that the Urabe\u00f1os do not have a presence in Boyac\u00e1 department in general, or Tunja in particular.9 Therefore, the panel finds that in the absence of sufficient credible or corroborative evidence from the claimant that Tunja is unsafe for him, the previously cited objective documentation outweighs the claimant's testimony. This is particularly noteworthy given the comments by the claimant that he gleans this information from the news, rather than from any documented source. However, later in his testimony he indicated that he learned this from his sister and his lawyer friends, and as stated above, he provided no corroborative evidence to support this assertion. Although the panel attempted to assist this unrepresented claimant, he continued to stray from some of the questions, and he spoke to the general situation with paramilitary groups in Colombia. Nevertheless, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the potential threat from the Urabe\u00f1os does not extend to Tunja, and there is therefore no serious possibility of persecution of the claimant, or a risk to his life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Tunja.\n[22] The panel also considered whether the claimant's profile was such that the Urabe\u00f1os would be interested in following the claimant to Tunja. The panel notes that the claimant left Colombia at the end of 2014, almost five years ago, and therefore questioned the claimant as to why the Los Urabe\u00f1os would be interested in him now. He insisted that the criminal group's network would allow them to track him down, notwithstanding the lapse of time. Given the objective documentary evidence, and in the absence of any further evidence suggesting continued pursuit on the part of the perpetrators, the panel rejects the claimant's assertion in this regard.\n[23] Based on the above considerations, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant does not face a serious possibility of persecution or face a danger of torture, a risk to his life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, should he relocate to the city of Tunja, Colombia.\nSecond Prong - Reasonableness\n[24] Regarding the reasonableness of the proposed IFA, the panel finds that it is not unreasonable in all of the particular circumstances of the claimant's situation, that in returning to Colombia, he could relocate to the city of Tunja. The panel is mindful that the test to establish whether the proposed IFA is unreasonable has a very high threshold, requiring nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant in travelling or relocating to a safe area.10 Further, \"actual and concrete evidence of such conditions\" must be presented.11\n[25] The claimant testified that it would be unreasonable to move to and live in Tunja because he would be unable to practice as a lawyer, something which he worked hard to achieve through his university studies. However, he acknowledged that he cannot practice law in Canada either.\n[26] No evidence was presented to the panel that the claimant would have any difficulty accessing healthcare in Tunja. Even if he could not practice as a lawyer, the panel finds that this is a sophisticated and educated individual who ought to have the resourcefulness to support himself. The claimant's family situation has changed in that he is no longer with his wife and son.\n[27] The panel finds that the claimant has not established, on a balance of probabilities, that he would face serious social, economic, or other barriers in relocating to Tunja. The panel therefore finds that it would not be unreasonable, in all circumstances including those particular to the claimant, for him to seek refuge in Tunja.\n[28] Further, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that insufficient evidence has been tendered to establish that the Urabe\u00f1os or other hazards would make it unreasonable for the claimant to travel within Colombia to the proposed IFA. While the panel acknowledges that the claimant may have to land at an international airport within Colombia that is within Urabe\u00f1os-controlled territory, as noted above, the panel has found, on a balance of probabilities, that the Urabe\u00f1os are not actively looking for the claimant or would be looking for him in the future. Therefore, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that it would not be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, for the claimant to have to travel to Tunja either by road or by connecting flight from an international airport within Colombia.\n[29] The panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant has a viable IFA in the city of Tunja.\nCONCLUSION\n[30] Having considered the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee, nor a person in need of protection, pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the IRPA. The panel finds that he does not face a serious possibility of persecution upon a return to Colombia, and his removal to Colombia would not subject him personally, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to his life, or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or to a danger of torture. Therefore, his claim is rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Roslyn Ahara\"\nRoslyn Ahara\nJuly 15, 2019\nDate\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n2 Exhibit 1, Package of Information from the Referring CBSA\/CIC, Copy of Passport.\n3 Exhibit 5, Federal Court Record, Disclosure Received February 12, 2015, at pp. 1-11.\n4 Ibid., at pp. 12-19.\n5 Rasaratnam, Sivaganthan v.

In summary, the claimant alleges that he is being personally targeted by the \"army, the police, the Karuna Group, the Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal (TMVP) group, the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) and army intelligence\" because he filed a complaint with the United Nations about his brother's disappearance which occurred in 2008.\n[3] The claimant says that he is afraid he will be \"questioned by the police and the CID\" if he returns to Sri Lanka. The claimant says he fears that he will be tortured and \"maybe disappear\" if he returns to his country.\n[4] Finally, the claimant is raising a sur place element to his claim as a failed asylum seeker returning to Sri Lanka after living in Mexico, the United States, and Canada.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] The determinative issue in this claim is credibility. The panel finds that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection for the reasons that follow.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[6] The panel is satisfied that the claimant is a citizen of Sri Lanka based on a certified true copy of his birth certificate and his Sri Lankan National Identity Card.3\nCredibility\n[7] Before making its credibility finding, the panel has considered that the claimant is XXXX years old, he has 6 years of education and he has limited literacy skills. He has worked as a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for approximately 13 years. The claimant is somewhat unsophisticated.\n[8] As the panel is aware of the difficulties of providing testimony in a hearing room environment, the panel made efforts to ask questions phrased in a simple and concise manner and, when required, rephrased questions throughout the hearing and frequently asked for clarification from the claimant when his testimony was unclear. The panel also took two breaks throughout the course of the almost 3 hour hearing.\n[9] \"A refugee claimant's sworn testimony is presumed to be true unless there are reasons to doubt its veracity. In assessing a refugee claimant's sworn testimony, the Board is entitled to consider its plausibility, and to apply common sense and rationality. Where the evidence before the Board is inconsistent with the claimant's sworn testimony, the presumption of truth is rebuttable.\"4\n[10] Due to the reasons that follow, the presumption has been rebutted, and on a balance of probabilities, the panel does not find the claimant to be a credible or trustworthy witness with respect to the central allegations of these cases.\n[11] There were several omissions in the claimant's BOC form that are material to the claim. These omissions include:\n* A United Nations meeting that occurred just prior to the precipitating event on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017 which caused the claimant to flee Sri Lanka;\n* The claimant's allegation that he was \"constantly questioned\" by one or more of the agents of persecution between 2013 and 2017; and\n* The claimant's allegation that his family still experienced persecution after he left Sri Lanka in 2017.\n[12] None of these allegations were outlined in the BOC form and yet they formed the basis of the claimant's testimony at the hearing.\nThe 2017 United Nations Meeting\n[13] The BOC describes a United Nations meeting that took place in 2013 regarding missing persons in Sri Lanka. The BOC says that the claimant \"raised my missing brother's issue at the meeting\" and, following the meeting, \"one of the Karuna group members approached me and warned me to keep my mouth shut...\". Prior to the hearing, the claimant submitted documentary evidence from 2008 which confirm that members of the claimant's family made a written complaint to the Human Rights Commission regarding the claimant's missing brother.\n[14] The BOC then says the claimant was detained by the CID in XXXX 2013 shortly after the meeting described above. After these detentions, the next event mentioned in the BOC occurs on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017, when \"the TMVP group members approached me at home\" and ordered the claimant to register the death of his brother \"in order to avert any action regarding missing persons\".5\n[15] At the hearing, the claimant's description of events was completely different. The claimant testified that the United Nations Meeting occurred in early XXXX 2017, just prior to the TMVP coming to his home. The claimant explained that the meeting was organized by the United Nations and he, among several other attendees, signed a letter at the meeting regarding his missing brother. The claimant was unable to provide any documentary evidence to confirm that the United Nations meeting occurred in 2017 and not 2013. The claimant was also unable to provide a copy of the letter he allegedly signed at the 2017 meeting.\n[16] According to the BOC, the TMVP visit on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017, appeared to be completely unprovoked and was not related to any recent meeting. When this omission was put to the claimant, he was unable to explain why he failed to mention this alleged second United Nations meeting for missing persons in his BOC, even though it was a key event that resulted in his departure from Sri Lanka.\n[17] While isolated omissions are not necessarily determinative of credibility, the panel finds that this omission is material to the substance of the claimant's fears of persecution. Not only does the BOC fail to mention this key event in 2017 that led to the alleged visit from and threats by the TMVP, but it actually says the event happened in 2013. The original version of events as outlined in the BOC is supported by the documentary evidence that was submitted with the BOC. In contrast, the claimant's version of events was unsupported by any documentary evidence and clearly contradicts the allegations contained in the BOC. As such, the panel is not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that a United Nations meeting for missing persons occurred in 2017 or that such a meeting led to the TMVP visiting the claimant's home and threatening him. The panel finds the claimant not to be credible on this point.\nThe Gap Between 2013 - 2017\n[18] The second omission in the BOC is the gap of time between 2013 and 2017. As described above, the BOC describes an alleged incident of persecution which occurred in 2013. The next event mention in the BOC occurs in 2017 when the TMVP allegedly visited the claimant at home and threatened him. There are no details, allegations, or facts mentioned in the intervening 4 years.\n[19] However, at the hearing, the claimant testified that he and his family had been \"constantly questioned\" between 2013 and 2017 \"every 2 months\". The claimant says that \"the CID, Karuna Group and sometimes military intelligence\" were the agents constantly questioning him and his family during the 4 year period between 2013 and 2017. When this omission was put to the claimant, he simply acknowledged the omission but provided no explanation for these missing details in his BOC.\n[20] The claimant was also asked to provide any written statements or documentary evidence to confirm the \"constant questioning\" from 2013 - 2017 that he described. At first, the claimant said he did not have any written statements. Then, he said his mother had written a letter, but he failed to bring it with him because he thought it had to be \"attested\" by a government official in order to be submitted at the hearing. The panel does not find the claimant's explanation to be credible on this point.\n[21] The panel also considered that the claimant obtained a valid and legal passport in 2015 but delayed leaving Sri Lanka until XXXX 2017. When asked about this delay, the claimant said that, in 2015, he had to look after his sister and his mother and he could not leave them alone. However, if the claimant's testimony is correct that he and his family members were \"constantly questioned\" by various agents of persecution every two months between 2013 and 2017, the panel does not find it reasonable that the claimant would delay leaving Sri Lanka until 2017.\n[22] The panel finds the claimant not to be credible regarding his allegations of constant questioning by agents of persecution during 2013 to 2017. Not only was the claimant unable to explain this material omission in his BOC, but he provided different responses when asked about supporting documentary evidence to confirm his testimony and he was unable to explain why he failed to leave the country in 2015 even though he had a valid passport. Based on the evidence before the panel, the panel finds the claimant's testimony not to be credible and the panel is not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that he or his family were \"constantly questioned\" by any agent of persecution during the period between 2013 and 2017.\nOngoing Persecution\n[23] There is no dispute that the claimant still has 2 sisters, 2 brothers, and his mother all still living in Sri Lanka. However, the claimant provided unclear and contradictory testimony regarding whether any of his family members continued to experience persecution after he left Sri Lanka in XXXX 2017. The panel was careful to ask the question clearly and repeated the question several times regarding whether his family had experienced any problems since he left Sri Lanka in XXXX 2017.\n[24] At first, the claimant said his family was questioned about his whereabouts after he left. Then, the claimant said his brother was questioned in XXXX 2018. Then the claimant clarified that the XXXX 2018 incident was not related to his departure from Sri Lanka, but rather his brother's recent deportation back to Sri Lanka from Malaysia where he had spent a significant amount of time. The claimant then said his family had received continued threats since 2017, but when asked for dates of those threats, he said XXXX 2017.\n[25] Based on the claimant's inconsistent and unclear testimony, and the fact that no ongoing persecution is mentioned in the BOC after XXXX 2017, and the absence of any documentary evidence to the contrary, the panel is not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that any of the claimant's numerous family members are experiencing any ongoing threats or persecution related to his departure from Sri Lanka in XXXX 2017. As such, the panel is not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that there is a serious possibility of persecution if the claimant were to return to Sri Lanka.\nOther Considerations\n[26] In addition to the inconsistencies and material omissions outlined above, the panel also considered the following factors when assessing the claimant's credibility.\n[27] First, the claimant provided inconsistent testimony regarding the date of the precipitating incident that caused him to leave Sri Lanka. At the start of the hearing, the claimant was adamant that he left Sri Lanka on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017. However, later in the hearing, he said that he actually left on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017, because the TMVP threatened him on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017. The claimant provided no explanation when this inconsistency was put to him in the hearing.\n[28] Second, the panel also considered that the claimant was unable to precisely describe who he fears in Sri Lanka. The claimant's BOC describes an alleged period of detention by the CID in 2013 and then an incident of threats by the TMVP in 2017. However, at the hearing, the claimant said he feared \"the army, the police, the Karuna Group, the TMVP group, the CID and army intelligence\" and he felt the police and CID would question him, detain him, torture him, and possibly kill him. While the panel understands the situation in Sri Lanka is considered somewhat perplexing with the police, army, CID, and various paramilitary groups having influence and control over various parts of the population, the panel does not find it reasonable that the claimant would not be able to precisely identify one or two specific agents of persecution in a consistent and logical manner. The claimant's testimony that the police would arrest him is not supported by the allegations in his BOC and the contents of the BOC regarding the pseudo-governmental organization TMVP is not supported by the claimant's testimony that the army and the CID are persecuting him. In short, in addition to the inconsistencies and omissions outlined above, the panel draws an adverse inference from the claimant's inability to testify clearly regarding who precisely he fears in Sri Lanka.\n[29] Finally, the panel also considered the claimant's failure to claim refugee protection in any of the five countries he travelled through on his way to Canada. In particular, the claimant says he spent 5 months in India, 2 1\/2 months in Mexico, and 3 1\/2 months in the U.S.A. on his way to Canada but he failed to claim refugee protection in any of those countries.\n[30] The claimant says he failed to claim refugee status in India because \"granting for asylum to Sri Lankans is less frequent there; they are sending back the Sri Lankans who are already there.\" The claimant says he failed to claim refugee status in Mexico because he \"doesn't like it there; there is a lot of kidnapping, ransom demands, mafia problems\". Finally, even though the claimant has a relative living in New Jersey, the claimant says he failed to claim refugee status in the U.S. because he \"wanted to come here\". This intention to come to Canada is supported by the fact that the claimant arranged to have a package of important documents sent to his cousin's house in Canada while he was in detention in Mexico, many months before his arrival in Canada.\n[31] While the panel recognizes that a claimant's failure to claim refugee status in a third country on the way to Canada is not determinative, it is an important factor in assessing the claimant's subjective fear and can impact the claimant's credibility. In addition to the inconsistencies, the omissions, the claimant's inability to precisely describe the agent of persecution, and his failure to claim refugee protection in several countries where he resided for several months, the panel is not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the claimant has a subjective fear of persecution or that he is credible and trustworthy.\nThe Nexus Issue\n[32] The panel notes that the bulk of counsel's oral submissions were devoted to an exposition of the plight of the Tamil community in Sri Lanka. Counsel quoted from several country conditions documents and it is his position that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution based on his ethnicity as a Tamil male living in the eastern province of Sri Lanka.\n[33] The difficulty for the panel is that there are no allegations in the BOC or heard during testimony to support the position that the claimant is fleeing persecution based on his ethnicity as a Tamil. The claimant says he fears persecution solely based on his alleged complaint to the United Nations about his missing brother. The BOC does not contain any allegations of personal persecution that is directly related to his ethnicity and the claimant failed to provide any details at the hearing regarding this allegation.\n[34] While the claimant is a Tamil male living in the eastern province of Sri Lanka, there is no objective evidence before the panel to suggest that every Tamil male living in the eastern province of Sri Lanka has a serious possibility of persecution. In fact, objective evidence suggests that the Tamils who are most likely to experience surveillance, detention, and\/or persecution are those who have been associated with the LTTE, or suspected of LTTE involvement or have been suspected of committing other crimes. In the case before the panel, the claimant does not fit this profile and, as a result, the panel is not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that he will face a serious possibility of persecution should he return to Sri Lanka.\n[35] Based on the evidence before the panel, the panel is not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that there is a nexus pursuant to s. 96 of IRPA nor that he is a Convention refugee. The panel is not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the claimant is facing a personalized risk to his life pursuant to s. 97(1) of IRPA, and the panel also does not find the claimant to be a person in need of protection.\nThe Sur Place Claim\n[36] Counsel also made oral submissions regarding a possible residual profile since the claimant has been in Canada for several months. It is counsel's position that, if the claimant were to return to Sri Lanka, he would immediately be flagged by the authorities, questioned, and possibly detained.\n[37] While the panel recognizes the often tenuous situation for some Sri Lankans returning to their country through the airport, the objective evidence does not confirm that every single Tamil male returning to the country through the airport will be flagged, questioned, and detained by authorities.\n[38] This fact is actually supported by the claimant's own experience. When the claimant left Sri Lanka in XXXX 2017, he spent several months in India and then travelled to Dubai. However, in order to get to Dubai, the claimant says he flew back to Sri Lanka and spent several hours in the Sri Lankan airport. There is no evidence before the panel to suggest that the claimant was flagged, questioned, detained, or mistreated in any way during his stay in the Sri Lankan airport. In short, the claimant's own experience contradicts counsel's position that he will inevitably be mistreated simply by virtue of returning to his own country via the Sir Lankan airport.\n[39] Furthermore, the objective evidence confirms that the claimant should have no difficulty re-entering Sri Lanka via the airport even though his valid passport was taken by the agent who brought him to Canada. The National Documentation Package (NDP) document at 14.1 says:\nCiting the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the report further explains that by law, Sri Lankan nationals are able to enter the country without a passport, so long as they can prove Sri Lankan nationality, such as by providing a National Identity Card or birth certificate (UK 31 Mar. 2017, 68). The same report also cites a source at Bandaranaike Airport as indicating that those travelling to Sri Lanka are required to at least have an \"Emergency Travel Document or ID, the most important thing is to establish whether they are of Sri Lankan nationality\"[Emphasis added]6\n[40] In addition, while the Sri Lankan authorities do have lists of people who are flagged when they re-enter the country, the objective evidence says that this list is reserved for criminals and other people with separatist intentions. The NDP at 14.1 says:\n'Stop' lists include names of those individuals that have an extant court order, arrest warrant or order to impound their Sri Lankan passport. 'Watch' lists include names of those individuals that the Sri Lankan security services consider to be of interest, including due to separatist or criminal activities. Those on a watch list are not likely to be detained, although there have been some media reports claiming that individuals, mostly Tamils, travelling from the United Kingdom have been detained on arrival at the airport. DFAT has not been able to verify these reports but notes that those on a\nwatch list are likely to be monitored.7\n[41] Based on both the objective evidence and the claimant's own experience, the panel is not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution simply because he is returning to Sri Lanka after an extended stay in North America. The panel therefore rejects the sur place aspect of the claimant's claim for refugee protection\nCONCLUSION\n[42] Having considered the totality of the evidence before the panel and given the concerns regarding the claimant's credibility, assessed under both sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA, the panel therefore finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the central allegations of this case are not true and that there is insufficient credible or trustworthy evidence upon which to reach a positive determination under section 96 or subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\n[43] The claimant has therefore not satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, or that, on a balance of probabilities, he would be personally subjected to a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture upon return to Sri Lanka.\n[44] The panel concludes that the claimant is not a Convention refugee and not a person in need of protection. The claim is rejected.\n(signed)\n\"L. Hartslief\"\nL.

The claimant was working in Saudi Arabia and he asked his brother-in-law to find a peaceful solution. He was not successful. As a result the claimant sued his uncles.\n[6] Subsequently the claimant's brother-in-law violently confronted the uncles' family and two of his cousins were shot and injured. The claimant returned to Pakistan to seek a settlement.\n[7] The claimant sought the help of elders in the panchayat, which was led by a man named XXXX XXXX XXXX, who was also a member of the Provincial Assembly. The claimant alleged that this man was very influential and his uncle was a member of the XXXX XXXX. In addition this man was a member of the PML-N, the political party in power in both the provincial and national assemblies. As a result it was difficult to change a decision of the punchayat.\n[8] The punchayat decided that there should be compensation from the claimant's side as they were the aggressors in the confrontation. The punchayat declared that the claimant's 11-year-old daughter should be given as vani (compensation) to one of the cousins who was 15 years old. The claimant refused and contacted the police, but they refused to register a report because XXXX XXXX XXXX was involved. The claimant told the police that he did not have any written evidence and the police responded that without this evidence the case would not be registered. The claimant was warned that if he did not agree then the community would terminate relations with his family, his home and land would be seized, and they will harm him and his family. The claimant's mother, sister, and brother-in-law were also pressuring him to comply.\n[9] The claimant returned to Saudi Arabia to seek a solution and during this time the members of the punchayat harassed his wife. One member threatened to kidnap this daughter. As a result, the claimant brought his family to Saudi Arabia.\n[10] The claimant was advised by a friend to go to the United States (US). He obtained visas for his family and they left Saudi Arabia and arrived in the US on XXXX XXXX, 2017. On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017, they crossed the border and came to Canada.\nISSUES\n[11] The issues in regard to these claims are credibility, failure to claim elsewhere, and internal flight alternative (IFA).\nCredibility\n[12] The claimant testified to the allegations noted above, and he did so in a straight-forward manner without any inconsistencies with the documentary evidence.\n[13] The claimant emphasized in his testimony the influence of XXXX XXXX XXXX in regard to the punchayat's decision. The claimant was asked if he had any corroborating evidence as to this man's influence. The claimant said no. The panel noted that this man's political party, PML-N, had lost the 2018 election both in Punjab and at the national level, and the alleged influence of this man was in question. The panel notes the governing party in the Punjab provincial assembly and the national assembly is now the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf. The claimant testified that this man had been in power for XXXX years and the bureaucracy would still be with him. The panel asked if the claimant had any evidence in this regard, and none was provided.\n[14] The panel notes that the claimant emphasized the significance of this man's leadership in the punchayat and his influence with the government as to the claimant's inability to resolve the dispute. The panel notes the alleged role of this man is central to the claim and finds that, on a balance of probabilities, it is reasonable to expect that the claimant would have provided some supporting documentation as to this man's influence. The panel further finds that if the claimant's description of this man was true, such documentation would have been available to him.\n[15] The panel noted that the claimant returned to Saudi Arabia and left his family in Lahore even though his wife was being harassed by members of the punchayat. The claimant was asked why he left them alone. He responded he had been on leave and had to return, and his children had exams. The panel noted it was difficult to understand his actions in this regard. The claimant responded that his wife and children were supported by his wife's parents.\n[16] The claimant was asked why he had not requested an extension of his leave and he testified that he had already extended his leave. The claimant was further asked how long he remained in Saudi Arabia. The claimant replied that he returned to Saudi Arabia in XXXX 2017, and he brought his family there in XXXX 2017. He was asked why he had not brought his family with him in XXXX, to which he responded that he had to make arrangements and his children had exams. He further stated that he hoped to get the punchayat to amend its decision. The claimant was asked what he wanted the punchayat to do. He stated that the violent incident was the responsibility of his brother-in-law and not his family.\n[17] The claimant was asked why he and his family did not stay in Saudi Arabia, rather than go to the US. He responded that his contract would have to be renewed and this depended on employment. The panel asked if there was any reason the contract would not have been renewed. The claimant said there was no guarantee.\n[18] The panel notes the claimant had status in Saudi Arabia as a contract employee when he and his family travelled to the US. He had been working in Saudi Arabia since 2004, that is, for 13 years. The panel further notes that no evidence was disclosed as to his inability to continue working in that country where he was employed as a XXXX XXXX. The panel also notes that the claimant testified that he hoped to get the punchayat to amend its decision, yet no evidence was disclosed as to the result of his alleged efforts in this regard.\n[19] The panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, it is reasonable to expect that, if the claimant was still negotiating with the panchayat, he would have sought an extension of his contract in Saudi Arabia, where he had been living and working for 13 years, and remain closer to Pakistan.\nFailure to claim elsewhere\n[20] The claimant testified that he and his family remained in the US for two weeks. The panel further asked if they made claims for protection in the US, and he said no because his wife's brother lives in Canada, and the process was very long in the US. He was asked what he knew about the process, and he said he heard about it.\n[21] The panel finds that the family member exception to the Safe Third Country Agreement allows for the claimants to seek protection in Canada, because they have a family relationship with a Canadian resident.\nInternal flight alternative\n[22] The panel has a number of concerns as to the claimant's allegations. These include the claimant's failure to provide corroborating evidence as to the alleged influence of XXXX XXXX XXXX; the lack of corroborating evidence as to the punchayat's decision; the failure of the claimant to take his family with him when he returned to Saudi Arabia even though his wife was allegedly being harassed; and the lack of any credible evidence that the claimants are being pursued. However, the panel finds that, even if the claimant's allegations as to the land dispute and the punchayat's decision are true, they have a safe haven available to them in Pakistan.\n[23] The panel noted that it had indicated at the beginning of the hearing that one of the issues to be considered is the availability of an IFA in Pakistan. In this regard, the panel that the claimants could find a safe haven in Hyderabad. The panel asked the claimant if there was any reason that he and his family could not resettle safely in Hyderabad. The claimant responded that he could stay there, but there would be constant fear that they could be found any time.\n[24] The claimant was asked how anyone would know the family was in Hyderabad. He responded that he would have to provide his national identity card to a landlord and the police. The panel noted that it had reviewed country document evidence and there was no mention that this is the case.3 This document notes a range of activities for which the ID card is used, but as noted above, there is no mention of a requirement to present to a landlord or register with the police. The claimant responded that as a result of terrorism, the authorities had made it compulsory for landlords to report to the police. The panel notes the claimant provided no corroborating evidence in this regard.\n[25] The claimant was asked if he had any evidence that he and his family were being pursued by the agents of persecution. In this regard, the panel noted that the claimant's uncles had possession of his land and asked the claimant why they would pursue him. The claimant responded that his brother-in-law was still in hiding and people came to the house in 2017. The claimant was asked if he had any evidence that they were still being pursued. He responded that they were waiting for us. The claimant was further asked if he had any evidence in this regard and he said only verbal.\n[26] The panel asked the claimant if he had any evidence that the perpetrators would have access to his national identity card number. He responded that they have resources, and XXXX XXXX XXXX had been in politics for XXXX years. The claimant also stated that his number was related to a family number and his mother would have access to it. Moreover, he said that his mother was trying to save his brother-in-law and she would give the claimant's ID card number to the alleged perpetrators.\n[27] The panel notes that no evidence was disclosed to support the claimant's allegation that his ID number could be obtained as result of a relationship to a family number. The panel further notes that no such information is included in the country document evidence available to the panel.4 Furthermore, as noted above, the claimant was unable to provide any evidence that he and his family are being pursued by the perpetrators approximately two and a half years after the punchayat's alleged decision. In this regard, the panel notes that the claimant disclosed two letters from family members.5 Neither of them mentioned that the claimants were being pursued.\n[28] The panel notes that Hyderabad is approximately 1200 kilometres from Gujrat, the claimant's home city. It is also a large metropolitan centre with a population of more than 1,300,000 people. The panel further notes the claimant is well educated and he has had living and work experience in another country for many years.\n[29] The panel cites country document evidence which indicates that \"[w]here a person's fear is of persecution or serious harm at the hands of non-state actors or rogue state actors, it is likely to be both relevant and reasonable to expect them to relocate to escape that risk.\"6 It is further indicated that \"internal relocation is, in general, likely to be both relevant and reasonable for persons involved in land disputes.\"7 Moreover, Pakistan is a large and diverse country which \"generally allows for reasonable relocation options depending on the person's individual circumstances...\"8\n[30] The panel notes the IFA test is divided into two prongs. The first prong requires that the claimants would not face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, and on a balance of probabilities, they would not personally be subjected to a risk to their lives or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture upon their return to Pakistan.9 On the basis of the analysis above, the panel finds that this is the case in the proposed IFA.\n[31] The second prong of the test requires that it would be reasonable in all the claimants' circumstances for them to resettle in the proposed IFAs.10 The panel notes that the claimant is a young man with work experience away from his home. The panel further notes the claimant's daughter will have the support of her family. Therefore, the panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, there is no serious constraint in the claimants' circumstances on their resettling in Hyderabad.\n[32] The panel notes the burden is on the claimant to show that he and his family do not have an IFA in Hyderabad, which he has not done. The panel further notes that the Federal Court of Appeal has set a high threshold for the unreasonable test, requiring \"nothing less than the existence of conditions that would jeopardize the life and safety of [the] claimant[s].\"11 There must be \"actual and concrete evidence of such conditions.\"12 The panel finds that no such evidence has been disclosed.\nCONCLUSION\n[33] Having found that the claimants have an IFA available to them in Hyderabad, the panel further finds that they do not require the protection of Canada. Therefore, the panel also finds that the claimants are neither Convention refugees, nor persons in need of protection. The claims are dismissed.\n(signed)\n\"Milton Israel\"\nMilton Israel\nJune 26, 2019\nDate\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n2 Exhibit 2.2, Basis of Claim Form (BOC) - TB7-22365.\n3 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) for Pakistan, (March 29, 2019), item 3.3.\n4 Ibid.\n5 Exhibit 4, Supporting Documentation, at pp. 19-20.\n6 Exhibit 3, NDP for Pakistan (March 29, 2019), item 1.14.\n7 Ibid.\n8 Ibid., item 1.12.\n9 Rasaratnam, Sivaganthan v.
