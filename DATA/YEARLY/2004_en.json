He is a devout follower of the Shia faith, and his family is very active politically. He belongs to a middle class family residing in XXXXX, Punjab. In 1984 he XXXXX in the XXXXX. In 1993 he formally joined the XXXXX. In 1994 the fundamentalist Sunnis made negative remarks and harassed his family because of his community, social, political, and religious work. In XXXXX 2000, he protested against XXXXX and his family involving the treatment of a Christian servant XXXXX who worked for XXXXX family, who later died from injuries sustained by the family. The police initially refused to register a complaint against the XXXXX family as they were influential members of the SSP, and the family threatened the police. He (the claimant) rallied support for XXXXX family, including protests and speaking to the local media who aired the news of XXXXX death and the atrocities committed by XXXXX. When the government learned about the incident, its officials ordered the senior superintendent to register the case and take actions. The police registered the case, arrested and detained XXXXX for approximately a week. Afterwards, XXXXX spoke against him, and XXXXX supporters, including SSP members, physically assaulted him on several occasions out of revenge and to silence him.\nIn XXXXX 2002 the claimant's cousin, representing the XXXXX, XXXXX against XXXXX XXXXX nephew in the same XXXXX during the XXXXX. The claimant actively campaigned for his cousin, however, XXXXX nephew won the XXXXX. XXXXX became more powerful and the threats against the claimant continued as well as attacks by SSP members, including an attack on the claimant's home in XXXXX 2002, however, no one was home at the time. He and his family moved to XXXXX in XXXXX 2002 approximately 20 to 22 miles away from the claimant's home. Further, on XXXXX 2002 XXXXX and the SSP traced the claimant's whereabouts and four masked men attacked his car. They hit the windshield with their guns, and as the claimant escaped from the vehicle they hit him on his back and shoulder with their guns. They disappeared after they heard sirens from approaching vehicles. He received medical treatment for his injuries. The police questioned him about the attack, however, they refused to register a complaint against XXXXX and his supporters. The next day he filed a private complaint against XXXXX and his supporters with the Judicial Magistrate, XXXXX. On XXXXX 2003 his wife who had a heart condition suffered a massive heart attack and died.\nAfterwards he decided his life would never be safe in Pakistan, his brother hired an agent, and he travelled to Canada on 29 April 2003 using a fraudulent United States of America passport. He filed a claim for protection on 16 May 2003 in Canada.\nDETERMINATION\nThe panel determined that the claimant is not a Convention refugee as he has a viable internal flight alternative outside Punjab in Hyderabad, Sindh Province. There is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted or being personally subjected to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or to a danger of torture in Hyderabad, Sindh Province.\nANALYSIS\nThe claimant's identity as a citizen of Pakistan has been established by his National Identity Card,1 his children's registries in XXXXX,2 his birth certificate,3 and copies of his Pakistan passport (which remains in Pakistan).4 The panel also accepts the claimant's wife passed away on XXXXX 2003 of a heart attack as noted in the death certificate submitted.5\nHaving concluded, through the following analysis, that an internal flight alternative (IFA) is available to the claimant, the panel has not made any finding in relation to the well-foundedness of his fear in his city of Gujranwala, Punjab.\nThe panel then applied the two-pronged test.6\nIs there a serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the IFA location?\nThe panel found, after carefully considering all the evidence, that the claimant was targeted by the local politician in his area, XXXXX, his supporters, and SSP members who support XXXXX who the claimant alleged is also a XXXXX of the local SSP. The panel determined on a balance of probabilities that once the claimant left his area of XXXXX, Punjab, neither the local politician nor his SSP supporters would have any interest in pursuing the claimant. It is the claimant's own evidence that he was targeted by XXXXX out of revenge, to silence the claimant, and to prevent him from speaking against him XXXXX within Gujranwala. The claimant alleged the police in his area refused to register complaints against XXXXX as they feared the political clout the XXXXX member had in his area and the police also feared the local SSP. As a result, the panel determined that there is no credible evidence that XXXXX or local SSP members would have any clout or impunity if they targeted the claimant in XXXXX, Sindh Province.\nThe claimant testified that XXXXX has influential family members including his nephew who won the XXXXX in XXXXX 2002 for his area, and other close relatives, namely the XXXXX and a senior level official XXXXX. The panel noted the claimant did not lead evidence that he had any particular problems with XXXXX relatives. The panel found that there is insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish the claimant would be pursued by XXXXX relatives or, if he became noticed by them outside Punjab, that they would attempt to harm him. The claimant's profile is that of a local XXXXX and XXXXX, who also actively supported his religious community, and spoke out against the injustice involving the murder of a Christian by the hands of XXXXX. The panel noted the claimant's cousin who submitted a statement into evidence7 claimed that XXXXX had a grudge against the claimant and targeted him. However, the panel also noted although this was the same cousin who ran in the elections against XXXXX nephew, he did not allege he had any specific problems as a result, from XXXXX or his nephew, the winner of the XXXXX.\nThe panel considered the following. The panel accepts the claimant's religion is Shia as corroborated by the president of the XXXXX dated XXXXX 2004,8 the statement from the XXXXX of the XXXXX in XXXXX dated XXXXX 2004,9 and the statement from XXXXX dated XXXXX 2004.10 Further, the panel accepts the claimant was the XXXXX in 1984 and that he formally joined the XXXXX in 1993. The claimant submitted an undated poster with his picture enclosed promoting himself for the XXXXX.11 He also submitted a membership card from the XXXXX dated XXXXX 1998 XXXXX District, XXXXX,12 indicating he was the president of the party at that time. The claimant also submitted a letter from the president of the PML-N XXXXX dated XXXXX 200413 indicating the claimant was elected as XXXXX XXXXX in 1984, he was president of the XXXXX in 1993, and as a result the fundamentalists, local opponents, and SSP made him a target of their criticism. Further, he supported the claimant's allegations regarding the death of the Christian girl, that the claimant registered a criminal case, and that prompted an arrest. In addition, he supported the claimant's allegations that the claimant actively XXXXX against his XXXXX rival in XXXXX 2002, exposing the opposition's criminal acts, and when XXXXX won the XXXXX and his supporters attempted to kidnap and attack the claimant, however, the police appeared and the claimant was saved. He claimed the XXXXX family had influence, is powerful, and backed by the XXXXX and the Pakistan army. Further, the claimant provided a number of other statements of support corroborating the claimant's allegations as stated above, including from XXXXX dated XXXXX 2004,14 the claimant's father dated XXXXX 2004,15 and the claimant's cousin dated XXXXX 2004,16 who ran as a XXXXX, and also claimed that the claimant's wife died of a heart attack due to the threats from XXXXX, and that XXXXX and his nephew XXXXX hold a grudge against the claimant because of his \"overseeing\" the case of the Christian girl and his speeches during the XXXXX. Further, he stated that in XXXXX 2003 two of the claimant's cousins were murdered by the XXXXX because of the animosity against the claimant's family. The mother of the Christian girl, XXXXX, submitted a statement XXXXX 2004,17 and XXXXX husband submitted a letter dated XXXXX 2004,18 supporting the claimant's allegations. Several newspaper articles were also submitted involving the death of XXXXX, protests that occurred, police raids, arrests that took place, and subsequent legal actions against the persons accused of the incident.19 Further, other newspaper articles were submitted concerning violent assaults or death dated XXXXX 199820 and XXXXX 200321 and the most recent concerning the murder of the claimant's cousins in XXXXX 2003. The panel also noted the death certificates22 entered into evidence for the claimant's cousins and the denouncement of the murders by the Shia community in Wazirabad.23\nThe claimant stated his family is middle class and that he was self-employed on the XXXXX from XXXXX 1977 until XXXXX 2003 in XXXXX, XXXXX in Punjab Province. The panel noted the XXXXX that was entered into evidence in XXXXX, District Gujranwala, indicating the claimant's father XXXXX XXXXX.24 Within his statements to immigration officials he claimed his brothers and his father run the business, XXXXX of XXXXX and XXXXX.25 Further, within his PIF the claimant claimed that his two sons, two daughters, and two sisters live in Gujranwala, his father, one brother and two sisters live in Wazirabad, and his mother and one sister live in XXXXX, all in the Province of Punjab. Further, he testified at his hearing that his family continue to live in Gujranwala, Punjab Province, however, they have moved from their original home and are in hiding out of fear from XXXXX and his supporters.\nThe panel considered the other letters the claimant submitted on behalf of his claim. On XXXXX 2003 the claimant's father wrote that even after the claimant's cousins' deaths the claimant's enemies are still roaming freely, threatening the family, and the police have not taken any action against them.26 A letter was also submitted from a lawyer in Gujranwala dated XXXXX 2004 indicating he was not able to find anyone who wanted to come forward to testify against the claimant's enemies, and even the court of Magistrate did not act impartially, appointing a policeman as an inquiry officer who had already refused to take any action against the \"culprits\".27 A statement registered by the claimant with the court of Judicial Magistrate Wazirabad dated XXXXX 2002 was submitted into evidence.28 Within the statement the claimant alleged he was threatened and physically assaulted by persons yelling, \"We will teach you a lesson for delivering speeches, making propaganda and doing politics against us\", and they threatened to kill him.29 Further, within the statement the claimant alleged the police refused to register the complaint as the accused were influential persons as such he registered a complaint at the Judicial Court.30 In addition the claimant stated that the accused are terrorists of an influential, \"vandalistic\" organization XXXXX, who raped and killed a Christian girl, namely XXXXX, in XXXXX 2000.31 A medical report was submitted from XXXXX Hospital dated XXXXX 2002, indicating the claimant attended the clinic on XXXXX 2002 and his injuries amounted to swelling and abrasions, a pain killer was prescribed and bed rest recommended.32 A summons was submitted into evidence for the claimant along with his witnesses to appear at the police station in Wazirabad to provide their statements on XXXXX 2002 as an inquiry had been ordered into the criminal case.33\nThe claimant alleged within his narrative that his problems originated between himself and XXXXX in 1994 as he was his XXXXX opponent, and a rivalry developed. Further, he testified at his hearing that his problems became more serious in XXXXX 2000 after the death of XXXXX, the Christian servant. Further, he claimed because XXXXX was an active member and leader of the local XXXXX, the XXXXX also began targeting him under the direction of XXXXX. It is his evidence that he was threatened with violence, called a \"kafir\", intimidated, his home was fired at when no one was home, his wife died of a heart attack, and he was physically assaulted several times. He claimed he moved once in Gujranwala in XXXXX 2002, approximately 20 miles away from his home, and he was located by XXXXX and his supporters, however, he continued to work on the XXXXX until he left Pakistan in April XXXXX.\nThe panel considered the statement provided by the XXXXX of the XXXXX in Wazirabad dated XXXXX 200434 stating that in XXXXX 2002 the goons of XXXXX attacked the claimant and his cousins, they were injured, and the police refused to provide any assistance. Further, the XXXXX indicates the XXXXX set ablaze the XXXXX, and the claimant's cousin was a witness to the burning and as such he and the family became a target of the XXXXX. In addition, he claimed that on XXXXX the goons of XXXXX murdered the XXXXX of XXXXX and XXXXX, because of the animosity towards the claimant and his family, and as a result the claimant is not safe. The panel also considered the statement submitted from XXXXX dated XXXXX 2004 that indicates the claimant is Shia and his work within his community has caused him to have a personal enmity that he was attacked with an intention of political and religious narrowness and he was forced to leave Pakistan as a result.35 The panel also noted the Mourning Meetings that were submitted into evidence.36\nIt is the claimant's own evidence that he was targeted in his home region of Gujranwala, Punjab Province, by a local XXXXX supporter and SSP members, because of the influence the XXXXX supporter XXXXX had in his community, and that XXXXX is also the leader of the XXXXX locally. It is also his evidence that the same person was able to influence the local police with intimidation to such an extent that they refused to file the claimant's initial complaints. The claimant was asked if he feared harm outside his local area, or province, in Hyderabad, Sindh Province.\nThe claimant stated he could not relocate to Sindh Province because XXXXX and the XXXXX would find him as they have power and they would kill him. Further, he testified he would not keep quiet if he moved to Hyderabad, and he would soon come to the attention of Sunni fundamentalists in his area or other political opponents. In addition, he testified Shias are getting killed everywhere in Pakistan and protection for Shias is not forthcoming from the Government of Pakistan.\nThe panel found the claimant's evidence in this regard as not credible as outlined below. The claimant has no national profile, and after considering the totality of the claimant's evidence, the panel does not accept local political or religious leaders would want to, or have the resources to track the claimant down in Hyderabad, Sindh Province. The panel determined on a balance of probabilities, that the interest in the claimant in Gujranwala was mostly political and personal, it is after all the claimant's own evidence that XXXXX used the religious fanatics to further persecute him through his religion. \"My XXXXX opponent XXXXX an active member of the XXXXX, used this toll against me to spread stories about we being kafir. They discouraged people from maintaining any type of relationship with me.\"37 As a result, the panel found it is only reasonable to assume that once the claimant removed himself from his area and posed no further threat to XXXXX endeavours, he would no longer have any reason or desire to harm the claimant. As a result, the panel found there is no more than a mere possibility the claimant would be persecuted by anyone in Hyderabad, Sindh Province. The panel noted the newspaper article from the weekly Zameer dated XXXXX to XXXXX 200338 that indicated the claimant and his family have been targeted in the past by \"local\" XXXXX members and the police registered the case against the persons named in the murder of the claimant's cousins, and the police were searching for the accused.\nThe panel determined the claimant's problems in Gujranwala were mostly political and the following statements to immigration officials reinforced the panel's finding.\nThe claimant claimed within his statements to immigration officials that he feared the XXXXX,39 however, he omitted mentioning he feared the XXXXX. The claimant explained the omissions by stating when he made those statements he was \"neither alive or dead\" as he left his children and parents behind in Pakistan. The panel found the claimant's explanation unreasonable as it is reasonable to assume the claimant would have not omitted the XXXXX if he feared them as he alleged in his narrative. The panel noted the claimant never mentioned that he spoke against XXXXX members, or that he is a Shia, in fact when he listed his religion he claimed Islam, and did not specify Shia Muslim.40 The panel noted the claimant claimed within his narrative that he is a devout follower of the Shia faith, and because of this fact fundamentalist Sunnis \"always gave him a hard time\", and his XXXXX opponent was a XXXXX member and because of this, XXXXX supporters targeted him. The panel found under the circumstances of this claim, the claimant's failure to mention the XXXXX or that he was targeted partly because of his religion seriously undermined the existence of a subjective fear of persecution from the XXXXX when he left Pakistan.\nThe panel also noted the following statement the claimant provided to immigration officials when he was asked to explain in his own words why he is seeking refugee status and\/or why he could not return to his home country.\nAs XXXXX I had some problems with XXXXX started in 2002. In 2002 XXXXX killed some Christian girl and I had supported her. (The claimant was asked by an immigration official what do you mean supported her?) We had done a demonstration against the XXXXX this was to protest her killing. In XXXXX 2002 during XXXXX one of my cousins was a candidate for the XXXXX For that reason I am afraid of the XXXXX -they are in power now. My life is in danger because I am with an opposition group.41\nThe claimant was asked to explain the discrepancies noted within his statements to immigration officials to that of his narrative, namely when the Christian girl was killed by the XXXXX member and when his problems began as his narrative indicates the Christian girl was killed in XXXXX 2000 and his most serious problems began then. He explained the discrepancy by stating he was upset at that time and he could not recall dates or events. The panel found the claimant's explanation unsatisfactory as it is reasonable to assume the claimant would recall when his problems began in Pakistan, recently or several years ago. The panel noted the claimant is a well-educated XXXXX -year-old man, who has been steadily employed in Pakistan since 1977 when he graduated from university. The panel also noted the claimant had legal representation when he was interviewed by immigration officials on XXXXX 2003 and the use of an Urdu interpreter, that the claimant acknowledged he understood.42\nFurther, within the claimant's statements to immigration officials he acknowledged that he \"lied\" about his identity and whatever his agent may have stated to obtain the documentation, that an agent arranged his travel documents and the travel plan from Lahore, Pakistan to the United Kingdom to Toronto, Canada.43 He claimed he traveled on a false U.S. passport under the name of XXXXX, his own photograph was in the passport, he traveled with the agent, and returned the passport to the agent afterwards.44 Further, the panel noted the claimant denied within his statements to immigration officials that he had previously applied for a visitor visa, or that he had been refused admission into another country.45 However, further in his statements to immigration officials he indicated he had been refused a U.S. visa in XXXXX 2002,46 within his PIF the claimant acknowledged he was refused an United States of America visitor's visa in XXXXX 2002 for an unknown reason,47 and the panel also noted the claimant filed an application at the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad on XXXXX 2002 according to the copy of the claimant's Pakistan passport.48 The panel noted the claimant has established a pattern of misleading immigration officials and this undermined his credibility.\nThe claimant was asked to explain why he applied for a U.S. visa on XXXXX 2002, and he testified his life was in danger, he had received threats, so he thought of leaving Pakistan. In light of the claimant's evidence that he thought about leaving Pakistan as early as XXXXX 2002, the panel found his explanation for \"neither being alive or dead\" when he explained the discrepancies noted in his statements to immigration officials as also unreasonable. The panel had time to prepare, plan, and to think about his reasons for leaving Pakistan and this undermined his explanation further.\nThe panel determined that an internal flight alternative is available to the claimant. The panel considered whether or not the claimant would be persecuted in Hyderabad by other Pakistanis because of his Shia religion or for political reasons.\nThe panel considered the two witnesses that testified at the claimant's hearing. The first witness stated that he knew the claimant since 1995 from his neighbouring village and like the claimant he was a XXXXX worker. He also testified that he is aware the claimant's religion is Shia and he was active in the Shia community. Further, he testified the claimant was targeted in his region after he protested against XXXXX death in XXXXX 2000 and registered a case against XXXXX when everyone else was too afraid to speak up as XXXXX is part of the influential class in their area. The witness testified he left Pakistan in XXXXX 2000, however, he knows from his conversations from home that XXXXX family is more powerful than before, as XXXXX has powerful relatives, and he corroborated the claimant's allegations concerning XXXXX relative's political positions and that the claimant would not be safe if he returned to Pakistan. The second witness stated he is the claimant's cousin, that they originate from the same village, and he is also a Shia. Further, he testified that the claimant was at the forefront of every religious activity and became popular politically in their village when he won the XXXXX in 1984. He claimed he became an enemy of XXXXX XXXXX after he protested the murder of XXXXX, and was attacked by XXXXX supporters. As stated earlier, the panel accepts the claimant's identity that he was an active member of the XXXXX and he is also a Shia. Further, the panel accepts the claimant protested with many others the death of Asia, and he registered a complaint against XXXXX for justice for the Christian girl. The panel considered the witnesses' testimony that they did not believe the claimant would be safe in Pakistan because of his political opinion and religion. The panel does not accept, however, the claimant would be at risk of serious harm in another region outside Punjab. The panel considered the documentary evidence, and it does not support these allegations. The panel prefers the independent objective evidence over that of the claimant and his witnesses. The panel noted the claimant's witnesses were not neutral in their beliefs, one is a XXXXX member, the other a Shia cousin, and they are both successful refugee claimants.\nThe claimant has no national profile and, after considering the totality of the claimant's evidence, the panel does not accept XXXXX XXXXX, other XXXXX leaders including XXXXX influential relatives, or religious leaders would want to track the claimant down in Hyderabad, Sindh Province, or have an interest in harming him today. The panel determined, on a balance of probabilities that the interest in the claimant in Gujranwala was XXXXX, and local XXXXX opposition members attempted to quieten the claimant in regards to his political activities in Gujranwala, especially regarding the death of XXXXX and the circumstances that led to her death. As a result, the panel found it is only reasonable to assume that once the claimant removed himself from his area and posed no further threat to XXXXX in Gujranwala, his opponents would no longer have any reason or desire to harm the claimant. The documentary evidence indicates XXXXX activists usually do have the option of moving to another region of the country, unless they are of high prominence.49 The panel noted this is not the profile of the claimant as he was a local XXXXX of the XXXXX. Further the panel noted that there are hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of political activists in Pakistan today.\nThe panel considered whether or not the claimant would be persecuted in Hyderabad by other Pakistanis because of his Shia religion. The panel is well aware of the country conditions in Pakistan today concerning religious minorities and Islamic fundamentalist groups, including religious violence.\nThe panel acknowledges that certain Shias are persecuted in Pakistan today, however, the documentary evidence also reveals that not all Shias are persecuted in Pakistan. The documentary evidence reveals that 20% of the population of Pakistan is Shia and that Shias are generally protected by the government and are well integrated into Pakistan's society, but there have been outbreaks of violence between the two sects.50 Most Sunni Muslims live peacefully with Shia Muslims.51 Shias are not systematically discriminated against by other elements in Pakistani society.52 They are not an economically disadvantaged group, they are found in all of the professions, in government and in the army.53 Where Shias have been the targets of Sunni violence, the perpetrators are generally members of extremist Sunni organization, such as Sipah-i-Sahaba-i-Pakistan.54 Many of the victims were Shia professionals, doctors and lawyers, who were not politically active or involved with sectarian groups.55 Incidents of sectarian violence between Shia and Sunni Muslims typically occur during Muharram, when Shia Muslims mourn the death of the Prophet Mohammad's nephew.56 Government efforts to stem this included mass arrests of those suspected of participation and a public call for religious leaders to enforce a code of conduct resulting in fewer deaths in the 2001 Muharram period than in 2000 and no deaths in 2002.57 The panel noted the claimant claimed Sunni fundamentalists always gave him a hard time by making negative remarks, however, he did not lead evidence that he was persecuted by religious fanatics until they were influenced by his XXXXX opponent, XXXXX, whom the claimant openly criticized.\nIn addition the documentary evidence indicates that there were fewer killings between rival political factions and sectarian groups during the year, however, there was increased violence against Christians.58 The government claims it is committed to protecting the rights of religious minorities, General Musharraf himself is reported to be a liberal Muslim, who has little patience with Islamic militants or religious intolerance.59 Wealthy religious minorities and those who belong to religious groups that do not seek converts report fewer instances of discrimination.60\nThe important issue in this claim is whether adequate61 state protection is available to the claimant respecting his fears of being persecuted, tortured, losing his life or being subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment at the hands of members or supporters of the XXXXX or other Sunni fundamentalists in the future. The panel refers to the presumption of state protection set out in the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Ward62 and finds it also applicable to s.97. States are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens and it is the claimant's burden to rebut the presumption of state protection with \"clear and convincing proof\" of the state's inability to protect. The claimant stated the local police originally did not register his complaints because of the influence of XXXXX, however, the panel noted the claimant never attempted to relocate outside of his region of Punjab and seek protection.\nThe panel finds the claimant's allegation that the state is unwilling or unable to protect Shias from threats, physical mistreatment, death or torture by Sunni extremist groups such as the XXXXX is not supported by the documentary evidence. The panel considered the actions being taken by police and government authorities to curb sectarian violence in Pakistan. According to the documentary evidence, the government has taken steps to curb religious extremism and militancy, with mixed results. During the year (2002), the government undertook a major effort to curb religious extremism.63 Five organizations responsible for sectarian killings were banned by year's end and the government accelerated a crackdown on members of several extremist groups.64\nThe panel found on a balance of probabilities that although problems exist, killings still occur, and random acts of violence happen, there is no longer impunity for these acts. The panel cites Villafranca.65 The panel also recognizes the present political structure of Pakistan.\nNo government that makes any claim to democratic values or protection of human rights can guarantee the protection of all of its citizens at all times. Thus, it is not enough for a claimant merely to show that his government has not always been effective at protecting persons in his particular situation. Terrorism in the name of one warped ideology or another is a scourge afflicting many societies today; its victims, however much they may merit our sympathy, do not become Convention refugees simply because their governments have been unable to suppress the evil. Where, however, the state is so weak, and its control over all or part of its territory so tenuous as to make it a government in name only, as this court found in the case of Zalzali v. Canada (Minister of Employment & Immigration), [1991] 3 F.C. 605, 14 Imm.L.R. (2d) 81, 126 N.R. 126 (C.A.), a refugee may justly claim to be unable to avail himself of its protection. Situations of civil war, invasion or the total collapse of internal order will normally be required to support a claim of inability. On the other hand, where a state is in effective control of its territory, has military, police and civil authority in place, and makes serious efforts to protect its citizens from terrorist activities, the mere fact that it is not always successful at doing so will not be enough to justify a claim that the victims of terrorism are unable to avail themselves of such protection.\nThe panel found the claimant has not rebutted the presumption of state protection with \"clear and convincing proof.\" The documentary evidence referred to above indicates that the government and the police are responding to the acts of sectarian violence perpetrated against Shias and are making serious efforts to find members of Sunni extremist or fundamentalist groups and to bring them to justice. The panel prefers the documentary evidence over that of the claimant because it comes from independent and objective sources with no interest in the outcome of this claim\nWhile the panel accepts that Pakistan is technically not a democratic state since the military coup of October 1999, the panel found that the civilian police have remained, and with the assistance of the military continue to make serious efforts to deal with and prevent sectarian violence between Sunni and Shia Muslim extremist groups. The case law clearly indicates that a guarantee of state protection for all citizens, at all times, is not to be expected and nor is perfect protection. In Milev, the Federal Court of Appeal stated:\nThe fact that the state does not provide perfect protection is not, in itself, a basis for determining that the state is unwilling or unable to offer reasonable protection in the circumstances.66\nWith respect to this particular claim, Milev confirms that, while protection against Sunni extremists in Pakistan may not be perfect, it is available and adequate. In summary, while there is sectarian violence in Pakistan, Shias are not a disadvantaged group, and the police do respond to outbreaks of violence by arresting perpetrators from both sides of the violence. The panel prefers the documentary evidence before the panel to the evidence of the claimant because it comes from numerous independent sources with no interest in the outcome of these proceedings. Although there continues to be ongoing sectarian violence in Pakistan impacting on both Sunni and Shia Muslim groups, the panel found that the authorities are making serious efforts to control it and stamp it out. The news articles and documents submitted by counsel reflect the ongoing violence but also that the police are actively pursing the culprits of such criminal acts.67\nBased upon the foregoing analysis, the panel found that there is adequate state protection for the claimant in Hyderabad, Sindh Province.\nThe panel found that there is insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish this claimant would be persecuted in Hyderabad, Sindh Province by Islamic fundamentalists or by anyone else, because of his religion or political opinion.\nAfter considering all the evidence, the panel determined that there is not sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish that the claimant would be at risk of persecution for any reason in the IFA location, Hyderabad, Sindh Province.\nWould it be unreasonably harsh in all circumstances for the claimant to move to the IFA location?\nThe panel considered whether it is reasonable in all circumstances for the claimant to seek refuge in Hyderabad, Sindh Province. The panel noted the claimant has a Bachelor of XXXXX degree from the XXXXX and that he has over XXXXX years of work experience in XXXXX within Pakistan. He speaks Urdu, Punjabi, and English. He appeared healthy and able-bodied. He would be able to travel to the IFA location.\nBased on the foregoing analysis, the panel finds that it would not be unduly harsh for the claimant to seek asylum elsewhere in Pakistan, such as in Hyderabad, Sindh Province. The documentary evidence before the panel indicates that most citizens enjoy freedom of movement within the country and the freedom to travel abroad.68 The claimant is not a national political leader or religious leader whom at times are restricted. Further, the evidence reveals that groups with a limited internal flight alternative are women, mixed inter-religious and inter-caste couples, some Ahmadis and Christians,69 and as such the panel noted the claimant does not fit the above documented profile.\nWhile the claimant may find it difficult to live elsewhere in Pakistan, this in itself is not sufficient to eliminate an otherwise viable internal flight alternative. What is required is nothing less than the existence of conditions that would jeopardize the life and safety of the claimant in traveling to a safe area elsewhere in Pakistan and actual and concrete evidence of such conditions.70 The claimant has failed to discharge the onus of establishing that he does not have a viable internal flight alternative elsewhere in Pakistan.\nHaving considered all of the evidence, the panel finds that there is not a reasonable chance that the claimant would be at risk of persecution at the hands of political opponents or the XXXXX or anyone else if he were to return to Pakistan today.\nThe panel noted that a person in need of protection must establish that removal to the country of reference would subject them personally to the harm feared.\nThe panel then considered the elements of S.97(1). For the same reason, that is, the availability of a viable internal flight alternative in Hyderabad, Sindh Province, the panel finds that there are not substantial grounds to believe that he would be subjected personally to a danger of torture, or is at risk of his life or at risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he were to return to Pakistan. The panel noted the claimant claimed that he had never been arrested nor is he wanted in Pakistan today.\nThe panel also finds for the reasons already given that there is an accessible internal flight alternative for the claimant in Hyderabad, Sindh Province and for the same reasons as articulated above it is reasonable for the claimant to relocate to the IFA area. As a result, there is no serious possibility that the claimant faces a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or is in danger of torture if he were to return to Pakistan and relocate to the IFA area.\nCONCLUSION\nFor these reasons, the claim is rejected.\n\"Deborah Lamont\"\nDeborah Lamont\nDated: 2 March 2004\n1 Exhibit C-3, National Identity Card, page 1\n2 Exhibit C-3, XXXXX pages 5 and 6\n3 Exhibit M-1, Port of Entry Notes, pages 22 and 23\n4 Exhibit M-1, Port of Entry Notes, Passport, pages 17-19\n5 Exhibit C-3, Death Certificate, page 4\n6 asaratnam, Sivaganthan v.

She claims refugee protection in Canada under section 961 and subsection 97(1)2 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act).\nTHE ALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant stated that her aunt, XXXXX XXXXX, was married to a certain Mr. XXXXX who was suspected of being an accomplice in the assassination of XXXXX. That is why, for their safety, the claimant and her brothers and sisters moved several times to stay with friends or with their grandmother.\nThe claimant said that she had spent two years in Kinshasa without a fixed address until she had left for Canada on XXXXX, 2003, transiting through Ivory Coast and arriving at Dorval on August 23, 2003.\nDECISION\nThe panel finds that the claimant is not a \"Convention refugee\" and is not a \"person in need of protection\" according to the Act for the following reasons.\nANALYSIS\nTo establish her identity, the claimant filed a birth certificate issued on XXXXX, 2003, and a certificate of loss of identity documents issued on XXXXX, 2003. When confronted as to how she had obtained these documents, the claimant said that it was her aunt who had taken care of obtaining them.\nConfronted as to whether the documents were genuine or false, the claimant said that she did not know, adding that her aunt had paid to get them.\nThe panel expressed some doubts about the two documents. However, since the claimant has two sisters living in Montreal, they could come and testify that the claimant was indeed XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX. The panel said that it was satisfied as to the claimant's identity.\nTo come to Canada, the claimant said that she had travelled with a false passport, which she had returned to her facilitator. She also said that upon her arrival at the airport in Montreal the immigration officers kept her airplane ticket and her boarding card without giving her copies of them. The panel does not believe this because why wouldn't they have made copies when they had done so for other documents?\nThe fact that she had returned the false passport to the facilitator deprives the panel of an important and relevant document that would at least have corroborated the claimant's testimony about the route she had taken from the DRC to Canada.\nThe panel finds that Elazi3 applies to this case:\nI take this opportunity to add that it is entirely reasonable for the Refugee Division to attach great importance to a claimant's passport and his air ticket. In my opinion, these documents are essential to establish the claimant's identity and his journey to come to Canada. Unless it can be assumed that a refugee status claimant is actually a refugee, it seems unreasonable to me to ignore the loss of these documents without a valid explanation. In my view, it is to easy for a claimant to simply state that he has lost these documents or the facilitator has taken them. If the Refugee Division insists on these documents being produced, the facilitators may have to change their methods\nMinimizing the importance of the passport and air ticket as documents to be produced or ignoring their non-submission for all sorts of reasons in my opinion only serves to encourage all those whose only purpose is to take advantage of a system which is intended solely to enable genuine refugees to come to Canada.\nTo come to Canada, the claimant testified that she had passed through Ivory Coast where she had spent almost three weeks and through Morocco where she had gone through customs control so that she could wait in the airport waiting room for a second facilitator who accompanied her from Morocco to Canada.\nConfronted as to why she had not claimed refugee protection in Ivory Coast or Morocco, the claimant said that her aunt XXXXX had not told her to claim refugee protection in these two countries. This shows that the claimant did not have a subjective fear of persecution in the DRC otherwise she would have claimed protection in the first Convention signatory country where she had set foot.\nRegarding a similar conduct, the Honourable Mr. Justice Dub\u00e9 said in Skretyuk:4\n?...? the panel was required to take into consideration the claimants' conduct when they failed to claim refugee status in two countries before arriving in Canada. A claimant travelling through a country that is a signatory to the Convention must claim refugee status as soon as possible, or the claim may not be considered.\nThe claimant said that her problems had begun on XXXXX 2001, when the military had come to her grandmother's house where the claimant lived to arrest her uncle XXXXX who was suspected of having participated in XXXXX assassination.\nThe claimant testified that her brother had been arrested on XXXXX, 2003, that is, after the XXXXX, 2003 verdicts in the trial of XXXXX p\u00e8re. Confronted, she repeated several times that the verdicts had been rendered on XXXXX, 2003, whereas, on line 24 in answer to question 41 on her PIF, she indicated the following: [TRANSLATION] \"in XXXXX 2003, after the verdict (XXXXX ,2003) in the trial for the assassination of XXXXX XXXXX\". Questioned about the inconsistency, the claimant said that the Refugee Protection Officer (RPO) had asked the questions very quickly. However, she was asked these questions several times. The inconsistency between XXXXX and XXXXX 2003 undermines the claimant's credibility.\nFurthermore, when confronted about the events concerning XXXXX assassination and the trial of his alleged assassins, the claimant said that she did not know anything about those events. This is rather implausible coming from someone who says she was persecuted because her uncle XXXXX was suspected of participating in XXXXX assassination.\nThis leads the panel to conclude that the story is wholly invented, especially since the name of Mr. XXXXX does not appear in paragraph 5.83 of the United Kingdom Home Office of April 2003, among those who were arrested in the XXXXX affair. The panel is of the opinion that the claimant has not been living in the DRC since XXXXX 2001, for is it plausible that she would have lived without a fixed address from XXXXX 2001 to XXXXX 2003, allegedly because her aunt XXXXX had never been at home and so she could not live there, and also allegedly because she could not live with her grandmother who had apparently been sick? Nevertheless, apparently, she did go to live there in XXXXX 2003.\nThe claimant testified that she had gone to live with her grandmother on XXXXX, 2003, while, on lines 24 and 25 in answer to question 41 of her PIF, she indicated that she had gone to her grandmother's house on XXXXX, 2003. Confronted, she said that she did not know the reason for the inconsistency This other inconsistency, where she allegedly lived for three weeks or for six months with her grandmother in 2003, undermines the claimant's credibility.\nAt the port of entry, the claimant said that her sister and her aunt, XXXXX XXXXX, had been arrested, but she did not mention that her brother had been arrested as well. Confronted on this point, the claimant said that she had been afraid to say so. However, the alleged arrest of her brother was supposed to have been the triggering event that had led to her leaving her country. The omission undermines the claimant's credibility.\nGiven so many omissions and implausibilities that undermine the claimant's credibility, the panel finds that the claimant is not credible and, in this connection, the Court of Appeal ruled as follows in Sheikh:5\n?...? even without disbelieving every word an applicant has uttered, a first-level panel may reasonably find him so lacking in credibility that it concludes there is no credible evidence relevant to his claim [...] In other words, a general finding of a lack of credibility on the part of the applicant may conceivably extend to all relevant evidence emanating from his testimony.\nThis decision fully applies to the present case.\nCONCLUSION\nAs a result of the preceding analysis, the panel finds that the claimant is not a \"Convention refugee\" and is not a \"person in need of protection\" according to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Act.\nFurthermore, the panel finds that the claimant has failed to present any credible or trustworthy evidence on which it could have made a positive decision. It therefore finds that there is no \"credible basis\" for this claim, pursuant to subsection 107 (2) of the Act.\nThe panel rejects this claim for refugee protection.\nJean-Marie Chastenay\nJean-Marie Chastenay\nAugust 10, 2004\nDate\n1 96. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,\n(a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that rear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or\n(b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.\n97.

He just turned 18 two months ago. He alleges that his father is a XXXX of a XXXXXX in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and that his family was targeted by criminals. The claimant was kidnapped four times between 2001 and 2003, when he left his country. Each time, his father paid the ransom which was asked by the kidnappers, and the claimant was released. As indicated in his Personal Information Form (PIF), his father was afraid to ask for police protection, because that could have resulted in the claimant being killed by the kidnappers.\nAfter the claimant was kidnapped for the fourth time, in March 2003, his father arranged a Canadian visitor's visa for himself and for the claimant, and they both came to Canada on July 27, 2003. The claimant has family in Canada. His father's sister and her husband live here. The claimant's father left him with the family, and he himself returned to Bangladesh. The claimant asked for Canada's protection at the end of August or at the beginning of September 2003.\nShould he go back to Bangladesh, the claimant is afraid to be kidnapped again, and even to be killed by the kidnappers.\nANALYSIS\nAs I have mentioned before, the claimant is now 18 years old. When he came to Canada, he was still a minor. When all the events described in his PIF took place, he was between 13 and 16 years old. Consequently, he has a limited knowledge about the events which had happened and about actions taken by his family. In addition to that, the claimant has a speech impediment. I must however state that he expressed himself clearly and gave satisfactory answers to my questions, even though he had some difficulty speaking. However, due to his age during the alleged events and to his speech impediment, there were also some limitations to the scope of the questions I could ask.\nThe claimant's identity was not a problem in this case, since he came to Canada with a valid Bangladeshi passport and with a Canadian visitor's visa. I therefore conclude that his identity has been established.\nThe claimant produced several corroborating documents concerning problems he had experienced in Bangladesh. However, these documents have to me a probative value only if I believe the claimant's testimony, because basically, they were written by the claimant's parents, by people who are family friends or who are his father's collaborators.\nI have asked the claimant to provide details and explanations concerning the alleged events. He answered my questions in a straightforward manner, and basically, there was no contradiction between his written and oral testimonies. There were some minor plausibility issues regarding certain events, but they were not serious enough to damage the credibility of the claimant's testimony in general. There were also some problems with the claimant's testimony concerning the change of address by his family after he was kidnapped for the first time. The claimant testified that his family moved at that time, whereas no such change of address is indicated at question 18 of his PIF. But again, this is not sufficient to reject his testimony as not credible in general.\nThe documentary evidence is very clear as to the raise of criminality in Bangladesh. It is amply illustrated in the documentary package submitted by the Refugee Protection Officer (RPO), as well as in press clippings provided by the claimant. The kidnapping of children for ransom seems to be a widespread practice among the criminals in Bangladesh. The documentary evidence provided by the claimant indicates that in such cases, police get involved in searching for and sometimes finding the abducted young people, even though not always with success. However, I accepted the claimant's explanations that his father was afraid to report his kidnapping to the police, fearing that the criminals holding the claimant could kill him if they learned that the police had been notified. I find it plausible that the families of the kidnapped children, like the claimant's, can be reluctant to call the police, who are reputed to be corrupted and inefficient.\nConsequently, I found the claimant's story plausible. His testimony was credible. He also provided an extremely detailed narrative, as well as corroborating documents. Therefore, even if there might have been some minor problems with the claimant's testimony, I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt.\nDECISION\nConsidering all the above, I conclude that the claimant has established that, should he go back to his country, he would face a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.

He fears persecution, cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or death at the hands of attach\u00e9s in Haiti and he asserts that there is no state protection available to him against the harm feared.\nThe Claimant's Evidence\nThe claimant came to Canada on a student visa, supported by his father, but his father stopped this support when he learned that the claimant had turned over revenues from a property his father had entrusted to him, to his mother. The claimant's student authorization was valid to XXXXX 2003. A particular situation arose that caused his mother and siblings to flee Haiti in XXXXXX 2002 for the Dominican Republic, and, in early XXXXX 2002, when he made his claim in connection with that same situation, they had not yet returned to Haiti. By the time of the hearing, they had been forced to return. The claimant fears persecution, cruel and unusual treatment or punishment and death at the hands of attach\u00e9s who have tormented his mother for many years.\nThe claimant asserts that since about 1987, attach\u00e9s have harassed, threatened and extorted his mother and asked her to store weapons for them and to join their political party. These people could act as they wished thanks to their links to the r\u00e9gime. They thought her to be well off because of her house and her marriage to an influential businessman. He divorced her but let her stay in the house, and, even after the divorce, when he would look out for her, the attach\u00e9s would leave her alone; likewise, when another influential person, associated with one of the military r\u00e9gimes that ruled the country, would look out for her, the pressure from the attach\u00e9s would subside. Apart from such temporary relief from attach\u00e9 pressure, and when she would occasionally flee to seek sanctuary at a church, the harassment, extortion and threats would continue.\nThe claimant asserts that he could not return to Haiti for were he to return he would face community pressure to take up arms to defend his mother against the attach\u00e9s, and this would put his life at risk. The attach\u00e9s would take a persecutory and dangerous interest in him as well for the simple reason that he was a Haitian returning from abroad, and the attach\u00e9s were known to target such people.\nDecision\nThe claimant is not a Convention refugee. However, the claimant is a person in need of protection.\nAnalysis\nIdentity\nThe claimant's identity is readily established through his passport and various other personal documents available to the panel.\nOn Credibility\nI have considered the claimant's evidence and find his evidence generally reliable insofar as his mother's experiences are concerned. He testified in a straightforward manner and, under questioning, spontaneously provided details beyond the circumstances he described in his\nPersonal Information Form (PIF). His information is broadly consistent with that of the documentary evidence, especially insofar as the availability of state protection is concerned.\nI am thus satisfied as to the general credibility of his evidence, except as noted below.\nI do not accept the claimant's assertion that he would be forced into taking up arms against the attach\u00e9s by communal pressure for the following reasons: When asked whether his adult brother there had faced such pressure, the claimant said this was not the case. When asked why, then, did he think he would face such pressure, he suggested that this was because he was the eldest and that with both he and his brother there, there would be pressure. In my view the claimant is simply speculating that he would face communal pressure to protect his mother. Beyond this, notwithstanding any communal pressure to do so, it would be fully his choice whether or not to take up arms to defend his mother or, indeed, to defend her in any manner at all. The fact that he is seeking asylum in Canada, from where he can hardly defend her against the daily pressure from attach\u00e9s, suggests to me that while he may love his mother and care about her well-being, he is not inclined to engage her assailants in a manner that would put his own well-being at risk. His fear of harm in this connection is not well founded.\nI do, however, accept the claimant's assertion that the fact of his return to Haiti from Canada would mark him as an attach\u00e9 target. This assertion is supported in the documentary evidence in Exhibit A3 at Tab 10, page 1, where we read that, \"the attach\u00e9s' favorite targets are rich merchants, businessmen, brand-new vehicles, former soldiers, opposition political militants, and Haitians returned from abroad.\" On attach\u00e9s generally, the documentary evidence indicates, in an article in Exhibit A4 that \" the term \"attach\u00e9\" is widely used in Haiti to describe armed or unarmed civilians \"attached\" or working with police or military units.\" In the same document we learn that contemporary attach\u00e9s \"reportedly derive their power from the support of higher authorities, including...the ruling Lavalas Party...\". Most significantly, the document indicates that \"police attach\u00e9s do what they like at the police station,\" \"are more powerful than the policemen,\" and commit a range of abuses, including arrests, thefts and murder.\nMoreover, the documentary evidence before me in Exhibits A2, A3 and A4, as well as Exhibit R4 broadly suggests that state protection against attacks from the attach\u00e9s is not available. We read in Exhibit A2 at Tab 1 that, \"Haitian National Police (HNP) officials at all levels were implicated in corruption, incompetence and narcotics trafficking. The HNP failed to pursue criminals, promoting a growing condition of judicial impunity.\" In Exhibit A3 at\nTab 10A, a February 2003 article entitled \"Democracy Unraveling,\" provides further details on the impotence of the judicial sector. It is in this context that, according to Exhibit A3 at Tab 10, page 17 the attach\u00e9s \"arrest people, steal people's money, steal vehicles, put people in secret cells and kill them later on. Those people are so powerful that the policemen are not able to do their job as policemen.\"\nNexus to the Convention Refugee Definition\nWhile the claimant argues that the attach\u00e9s are a political party, the evidence before me suggests otherwise. The claimant's evidence as well as the documentary evidence suggest that each r\u00e9gime, in effect, has had its own attach\u00e9s, but their targets have remained essentially constant. The attach\u00e9s are people whose special connection with the powerful authorities at the time allows them to engage with impunity in criminal conduct for personal gain. They target political opposition militants to demonstrate loyalty to their political patrons, to assure continued patronage. This allows them to target businessmen, merchants and Haitians returning from abroad for these are presumed to have money or to have access to money, and it is this money that the attach\u00e9s are seeking to gain through theft or extortion. The claimant's mother has been one such target, on account of her being a small-time merchant and, at least in the attach\u00e9s eyes, a property owner. In any event, the claimant is not a former soldier nor is he a political opposition militant. The attach\u00e9s' interest in him and people like him is for his wealth or perceived wealth. It is a purely criminal interest.\nMy analysis above leads me to find that the claimant fears criminality in Haiti, unrelated to any Convention ground. His Convention refugee claim fails for lack of nexus to the Convention refugee definition.\nThe Section 97(1)(b) Claim\nThe claimant asserts that he is a person in need of protection because his removal to Haiti would subject him personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment at the hands of the attach\u00e9s.\nThe documentary evidence canvassed above is silent as to the geographic range of attach\u00e9 activity in Haiti, but in my view it is reasonable to think that attach\u00e9s operate throughout the country. The documentary evidence suggests a general collapse or near-collapse of civil society in Haiti and, in large measure, a pervasive absence of the rule of law. As well, inasmuch as the claimant's fear of harm is based on his being a Haitian citizen returned from abroad, the risk he faces is not faced generally by other individuals in or from Haiti.\nThe documentary evidence canvassed above also leads me to find that there is no state protection available to the claimant in Haiti against actions of the attach\u00e9s.\nThe question remains what the likelihood is that the claimant would be subject personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nMy analysis of the documentary evidence above leads me to conclude that political opposition militants and former soldiers are, among the attach\u00e9s' favourite targets, the most likely to suffer the imprisonment in secret cells and the summary execution described above. Their elimination furthers the interests of the attach\u00e9s' patrons, who in return continue to accord their patronage to the attach\u00e9s. Businessmen, rich merchants and Haitian returnees from abroad are more useful for what can be stolen or extorted from them. Given the culture of violence of the attach\u00e9s and their capacity to commit criminal acts with impunity, it is reasonable to think that only when such people disappoint their extorters would they face physical harm or death. For this latter group, while it is more likely than not that they would face threats and extortion, there is only a reasonable chance or serious possibility that they would face a risk to their life or a risk of harm such as would be cruel and unusual. The claimant falls into this latter category. Does the claimant merit Canada's protection?\nThe Standard of Proof on a Section 97(1)(b) Claim\nThe Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) is silent on the standard of proof to establish a claim for protection under Section 97(1)(b). The Federal Court has issued conflicting judgments on the matter.\nIn Thangasivam, Kantheepan v. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (F.C., no. IMM-8986-03), Snider, November 25, 2003 the Court was ruling on a motion to stay the Applicant's removal scheduled for November 27, 2003 pending the outcome of his application for judicial leave and judicial review concerning a PRRA officer's decision. It held that the words \"would subject them personally...to a risk to their life....\" are not qualified, and therefore, \"balance of probabilities\" must be the applicable standard. The Court also notes that Section 97 follows the wording of the Charter, Sections 7 and 12, to which a higher evidentiary standard applies.\nIn Tameh, Ali Farrokhi v. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (F.C., no. IMM-6266-02), Blanchard, December 15, 2003, 2003 FC 1514 the Court was reviewing a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD). It held that the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) applied the correct standard of proof, that is, \"serious possibility\" as set out in Adjei, to the question of whether the claimant feared persecution at the hands of the r\u00e9gime or faced a risk to his life.\nIn Li, Yi Mei v. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (F.C., no. IMM-5838-02), Gauthier, December 22, 2003, 2003 FC 1514 the Court was reviewing a decision of the RPD where the Court noted that the most serious issue raised was whether the IRB had applied the correct standard to determine whether the Applicant was a person to protect under subsection 97(1) of the IRPA. It held that \"pursuant to subsection 97(1) of the Act, there must be persuasive evidence (i.e. balance of probabilities) establishing the facts on which a claimant relies to say that he or she faces a substantial danger of being tortured upon his or her return. Second, the danger or risk must be such that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured or subjected to other cruel and other degrading treatments.\" The Court added that the RPD must continue to give the benefit of the doubt to a claimant. An appeal of this decision has been filed at the Federal Court of Appeal.\nIn my view, there are ample reasons to prefer the position taken in Tameh with regard to the standard of proof in making a determination under Section 97(1)(b). The challenge of determining the correct standard of proof is an exercise in statutory interpretation. The current approach to statutory interpretation favours an approach that examines the legislative context and the intent of legislators over a simply literal construction of the statutory provision in question. This contextual approach is particularly important where - as is the case with Section.97 (1)(b) - the statute is silent on the point in question.\n(A) The purpose of the statute and the particular provisions\nThe Immigration and Refugee Protection Act sets out a series of objectives. Sections 3 (2) (c) and (d) are relevant to the issues in this case, in that they give general guidance with respect to refugee protection. It is notable that the intent of Parliament in this regard is the same, whether or not a claimant is seeking protection under Sections 96 or 97(1)(b). They read:\n(2) The objectives of this Act with respect to refugees are\n(c) to grant, as a fundamental expression of Canada's humanitarian ideals, fair consideration to those who come to Canada claiming persecution;\n(d) to offer safe haven to persons with a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group, as well as those at risk of torture or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment; (emphasis added)\nIn my view, the reason for this is that the provisions of Sections 96 and 97 express the way in which Canada chooses to safeguard core human rights. These provisions have common roots in the international instruments that articulate core human rights. The provisions of Section 97(1)(b) derive, practically speaking, from principles articulated in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, especially Articles 3 and 5. The 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (Refugee Convention) - of which the key provisions are incorporated in\nSection 96 - evolved in the same context as the Universal Declaration and responded programmatically to address the predicament of a particular subset of the human community suffering a denial of human rights. The Refugee Convention's preamble begins, \"Considering that the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights approved on 10 December 1948 by the General Assembly have affirmed the principle that human beings shall enjoy fundamental rights and freedoms without discrimination...\"\nIn the same manner, reflecting the evolution of international humanitarian law that has taken place in the last half-century, the incorporation into the IRPA of the Section 97(1)(b) provisions responds programmatically to address the predicament of a larger group of people than the Refugee Convention can accommodate, who face a similar and, in some instances, arguably more severe abuse of their fundamental rights in their home countries. Both Sections 96 and 97(1)(b) seek to protect people against prospective serious breaches of their human rights.\n(B) Prospective risk assessment and the nature of the evidence supporting a claim\nNot only do Sections 96 and 97 engage core human rights; the determination of the risk to those rights is, in both instances, prospective. As well, the evidence in support of a claim under either or both sections has certain basic characteristics that distinguish refugee protection determination from other forms of adjudication in Canada.\nIn all but a small minority of cases, the claimant's evidence is presented through an interpreter; cultural differences can affect the way what the claimant says is understood by the decision-maker even where the decision-maker has been trained in cross-cultural communication; and where the claimant has been the victim of trauma, and even here, what is trauma in one culture may not be trauma in another, this too may impede testimony going to the heart of the claimant's fear. One might also consider that although the claimant knows she or he is in a protection hearing, and has presumably been told that the hearing is in camera, her or his prior encounters with officialdom may not have been good, and, indeed, it may have been officials in the home country who were the source of her or his suffering, thus there may be a natural reticence to testify openly, and it becomes apparent that the decision-maker is faced with a formidable challenge in making findings of fact.\nApart from the challenges facing a claimant in presenting her or his evidence, objective country evidence is rarely so specific as to allow a direct confirmation of or challenge to something a claimant asserts. It is often if not almost always the case that the same countries where there is significant human rights abuse, and where the state is either the agent of persecution or powerless to stop it, are generally the very same countries that have become skilled at concealing the worst abuses and denying access to neutral observers and investigators. Thus, country evidence may, for example, suggest the plausibility of the claimant's assertions, but except in the most rare of circumstances, it cannot confirm the claimant's assertions. Likewise, it may raise doubt about the reliability of a claimant's assertions, but not exclude the possibility that they are true.\nFinally, in recognizing that protection decisions rendered are prospective, we recognize that they are inherently speculative. The decision-maker is assessing the risk of harm a claimant faces in a distant land based on relatively general country information, where even the most recent of the events prompting the claimant's escape or departure will have taken place months or years before.\nParliament did not legislate a standard of proof for making determinations under the Refugee Convention as incorporated in the former Immigration Act. It was while that Act was in force that the matter was considered and resolved by the Courts. In Seifu v. Canada (Immigration Appeal Board) [1983] F.C.J. No. 34, A-277-82 the Court held that the evidence must show that the refugee status applicant has good grounds for fearing persecution. In Adjei v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1989] 2 F.C. 680, [1989] F.C.J. No. 67, A-676-88 the Court, following Seifu, held that \"although an applicant has to establish his case on a balance of probabilities, he does not nevertheless have to prove that persecution would be more likely than not.\" The Court called this standard \"good grounds\" or \"reasonable chance\" or \"a \"reasonable\" or even a \"serious possibility\", as opposed to a mere possibility. In setting the standard as it did, the Court appears to have been acutely sensitive to the realities of the protection determination process described above. It appreciated that for the claimant the stakes are high-her or his life, liberty, or personal security is at issue; that for the decision-maker, the evidence is always shrouded in the mist of uncertainty; and that there is virtually no capacity to save a claimant from the possibly fatal consequences of a wrong decision once that claimant is removed as a consequence of a failed claim.\nIn my view, it is not appropriate to assess the standard of proof question in connection with Section 97(1)(b) against the background of civil law. In setting the standard of proof as it did in Adjei, the Court recognized the special challenge involved in assessing evidence of events in a foreign country, with a foreign culture, with documentary evidence usually far more generic than claim-specific and most often with the claimant's evidence coming through an interpreter\ninterpreting from the claimant's language, and on that basis predicting what could happen to the claimant should she or he return there. These features of a protection claim distinguish such proceedings from civil litigation. That this is the relevant context in which to assess the standard of proof question is effectively affirmed by Parliament's choice in designing the structure of IRPA by co-locating Sections 96 and 97(1)(b), and in treating them identically in the articulation of the Objectives and Application of the Act, set out above.\n(C) The results of the adjudication process\nIn this context it is reasonable to think that had Parliament considered the standard of proof established in the jurisprudence in connection with refugee status determination to have not been the correct standard, a different standard of proof would have been legislated along with the refugee definition in Section 96. There would be no need to legislate a standard of proof where the Courts had already articulated one and where what had been articulated was satisfactory. Now, even as the IRPA is silent on the standard of proof in Section 96, it is also silent on the standard of proof in Section 97(1)(b). Given the similarity of the human rights protected, the evidence presented and the objective sought, and how whether the RPD determines that the claimant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection or both, there is no hierarchy of status and the same refugee protection is conferred under Section 95(1)(b) and the same protected person status ensues under Section 95(2), it is reasonable to think, in my view, that Parliament is silent on the standard of proof in Section 97(1)(b) because that standard is apparent, and it is the standard in Adjei.\n(D) Consideration of the tribunal's process\nMultiple standards of proof for the same claim for the same status by the same claimant on the same story leads to more complexity in case preparation for the parties and a more complex and slower tribunal process including hearing and determination. Considerations of process and efficiency should not drive the interpretation of substantive provisions. At the same time, an interpretation that is consistent with the overall scheme of the Act is preferable. The great value of an expert administrative tribunal is that it allows the rendering of simple, quick and fair decisions on specific and limited matters, in this case, protection determination. If a viable interpretation is available which respects the norms of international protection and facilitates an efficient and accessible tribunal process, then, in my view, it is the preferred approach.\n(E) Fair results\nStatutory interpretation is faulty when in its application it yields unfair or absurd results. Section 97 already contains various limitations on its applicability. It is reasonable to think that had Parliament intended to limit the applicability of the section further, it would have so legislated. Were we to apply two different standards for the granting of protection under Sections 96 and 97, the result would be that although two people might face the same serious harm, and face the same risk of experiencing that serious harm, one would be protected and the other not because the harm feared by one was on a Convention ground and the harm feared by the other was not. This would surely not be a desirable outcome. The United Kingdom's Immigration Appeal Tribunal, in Kacaj (Secretary of State for the Home Department v. Kacaj, Immigration Appeal Tribunal, Appeal No. CC-23044-2000, July 19, 2001), in addressing the standard of proof issue in connection with Article 3 of the CAT, mentions that applying different standards to asylum and Article 3 claims would be surprising when both conventions are concerned with whether future ill-treatment will amount to a breach of a person's human rights. The use of different standards of proof was thought to lead to confusion and inconsistent decisions. The point is well taken in the present context. It is not simply a matter of decision-makers being confused and potentially issuing inconsistent decisions. Decision-makers may be quite comfortable applying different standards of proof as required by legislation or the Courts. But the reputation of the justice system is at stake where two people from the same country, fearing the same harm, and equally having no state protection, get different decisions on protection, just because the harm feared by one is on account of his political opinion and the harm feared by the other is on account of having helped convict a prominent mobster.\nDetermination\nFor these reasons I adopt the standard of proof set in Tameh and find that the claimant\nXXXXXXXXXX is a person in need of protection because there is a reasonable chance or a serious possibility that he would face a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he were to return to Haiti. I therefore accept his claim under Section 97(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\"Ian J. Kagedan\"\nIan J.

According to the claimant, the police did nothing to provide protection to him.\nThe claimant indicated that because of harassment, his parents moved to a different part of Panama City, but the claimant and his brother remained in the same house. The claimant indicated his brother was not having problems because he was not a Jehovah's Witness.\nThe panel received in evidence as well a letter from the claimant's father discussing the increasing violence in Panama and indicating that his children had been the objects of hostility in Panama.\nANALYSIS\nThe panel notes the documentary evidence in assessing whether there is an objective basis to this claim for protection. The panel notes in particular Exhibit R-2, which is a Response to Information Request dated March 11, 2003. This document provides information from an official at the Latin America Administration Section of the Jehovah's Witnesses World Headquarters in New York during a March 10, 2003 telephone interview. This official stated that Jehovah's Witnesses are a legal organization operating freely in Panama. They have a branch office and missionaries working in Panama, where they have been operating freely for several decades. This official at Jehovah's Witnesses World Headquarters reported that his office has no knowledge of attacks, harassment, violence or other forms of mistreatment or abuse suffered by Jehovah's Witnesses in Panama over the last decade. He said however there may be isolated cases of prejudice and mistreatment by some groups or individuals, although no nationwide pattern or discernable situation of concern has been noted.\nThis evidence is supported by other documentary evidence before the panel. For example, in Exhibit R-1 at Tabs 3 and 4, which are the International Religious Freedom Reports for 2001 and 2002, it indicates that the government generally respects religious freedom in practice in Panama. The government at all levels strives to protect this right in full and does not tolerate its abuse, either by governmental or private actors. The documents further indicate that relations among the different faiths are generally harmonious and finally that aggressive Evangelical Protestant criticism of \"new\" religions such as Jehovah's Witnesses is not widespread.\nThese documents which set out the objective situation for Jehovah's Witnesses in Panama paint a different picture from the claimant's allegations. The claimant alleges for example that in January 2001, someone said he would like to shoot the claimant, and in July 2001, a group in front of his house was shouting, \"You will never know when something will happen to you\". The claimant alleges that he took these two incidents as death threats.\nIn light of the documentary evidence which does not provide support that Jehovah's Witnesses are mistreated in such a fashion in Panama, the claimant was questioned further. The panel noted that the alleged death threats occurred in January and July of 2001 and the claimant did not change his residence until November of 2001. He alleges that the last two months he was in Panama, XXXX and XXXX 2001, he was in hiding at his parents' place where they had been living since approximately the mid-1990s without serious problems.\nThe claimant was asked why he remained living at the same address where he allegedly received these two death threats until November 2001. The claimant responded that they could not move, that this was their house. He said even if he was living four hours away, the gangs are controlled by the mafia and they will find him anywhere in Panama. He says they will go after him because he is a Jehovah's Witness.\nThe panel asked if his parents, who are also practising Jehovah's Witnesses in Panama, had been suffering problems in their new place of residence where they moved in the mid-1990s. The claimant indicated that nothing serious has happened to them so far other than some vandalism.\nIn the panel's view, the claimant's testimony was not plausible, nor credible. Surely if the claimant truly believed that he had been the subject of two genuine death threats, it is not plausible that he would remain living at the same address for so long. It is not plausible that if the claimant truly received two genuine death threats, one in January and one in July 2001, that he would not move to his parents' place, which has been a place of safety for them, until November 2001. The claimant's actions in remaining at the same address are indicative to the panel of a lack of subjective fear of persecution.\nThis conclusion by the panel is supported by the above noted objective documentary evidence. The panel places more weight upon the independent objective documentary evidence which comes from international sources, including the World Headquarters of the Jehovah's Witnesses in New York, than upon the claimant's testimony which is clearly self-serving and implausible.\nCONCLUSION\nOn the basis of all of the above, the panel concludes that the claimant has not established a well-founded fear of persecution in Panama on the grounds of his Jehovah's Witness religion nor any other Convention grounds. The claimant has further not established a reasonable chance of a risk to life, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, nor a danger of torture.\nOn the basis of all of the above, the panel concludes that the claim for protection made by XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is rejected.\n\"Dale L.

During the course of his employment, he observed the owner of the warehouse, a Mr. XXXXXXXXXXX, and two other unknown men, whom he thought to be Colombians, inspecting approximately 10 bags containing a white substance, which he thought to be cocaine.\nMr. XXXXX and the two men became very angry that he had seen them with the cocaine. They warned him not to say anything or tell anyone including the police about what he had seen. Otherwise, they threatened that they would kill him and his family.\nThe claimant alleges that he continued to work at the warehouse for approximately another eight months, at which time the warehouse closed. He told no one other than the members of his family what he had seen.\nThe claimant also received threats or threatening telephone calls at his office and also at his mother's home where he was living. He alleges that a friend of his, XXXXXXXXX, who was a police officer, was present in his house when one of the threatening telephone calls was made. Mr. XXXXX wanted to make a report about the cocaine incident and the threatening phone calls.\nThe claimant insisted however that his friend not tell anyone because he feared that he (the claimant) and other members of his family would be killed. As a result, there was no police investigations made. Neither did the claimant report this incident to any other agency in Costa Rica that might have been available to assist him to prosecute the persons involved.\nFearing for his life and the safety of his family and on the advice of his mother, the claimant left Costa Rica on XXXXXX, 2001. He arrived in Canada on the same day. His claim for refugee protection was made on January 27, 2003.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\nThe claimant established his personal and citizenship identity through genuine documents (including his passport)1 he provided in support of his claim. I accept that he is a citizen of Costa Rica.\nState protection\nThe determinative issue in this claim is whether state protection would be forthcoming.\nThe Chairperson has the authority under Section 159(1)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (SC 2001, c.27) to identify decisions of the Board as jurisprudential guidelines to assist Members in carrying out their duties. The Board's policy on the use of jurisprudential guidelines is available on the Board's website.2\nEffective May 15, 2003, the Chairperson identified two decisions of the Refugee Protection Division as jurisprudential guidelines.3\nMembers are to consider and follow these decisions when determining claims in which the availability of state protection in Costa Rica is the determinative issue in claim profiles of risk due to general criminality or sexual orientation.\nAt the commencement of the hearing, counsel for the claimant, Ghislaine Mac Lellan, requested an adjournment. She wanted to present evidence from a psychologist, a Canadian nurse and a Costa Rican doctor. She advised that the claimant had requested the initiation of an Interpol investigation into the activities of the company which employed the claimant in Costa Rica. She argued that such an investigation would assist in determining whether the claimant was a person in need of protection.\nI noted that the Immigration and Refugee Board had advised the claimant and his counsel on September 12, 2003 that the hearing of the claimant's claim for refugee protection would take place in Ottawa on December 18, 2003. Counsel had more than three months to prepare for the hearing and to arrange either for the attendance of the witnesses personally or by way of videoconference or conference call. Alternatively, their evidence could have been submitted in the form of affidavits.\nI also advised counsel that the basic issue to be resolved was whether or not there was state protection available to the claimant in Costa Rica. Counsel admitted that she had received a copy of the jurisprudential guide and that she had read the decision of Mr. XXXXXXX (TA2-14980).\nIn my opinion, the tendering of additional evidence from other witnesses was not crucial or even relevant. I advised counsel and she agreed that the onus was on the claimant to prove that state protection would not be forthcoming if the claimant returned to Costa Rica.\nI therefore rejected counsel's request for the adjournment and the hearing proceeded.\nThe first question I had to determine was whether the decision in TA2-14980 applies in this case.\nI determined that the facts and the evidence regarding country conditions in this claim are sufficiently close to those before the panel in TA2-14980.\nThe same standard RPO disclosure package for Costa Rica in TA2-14980 was also disclosed at the claimant's hearing, including an additional document to update the source of materials for the jurisprudential guide.\nThe claimant did not file any complaints with the police. He was concerned for the safety of himself and his family given the threats made against him. He also stated that the police forces in Costa Rica are corrupt (\"you can buy their services\"). The police would not have helped him.\nThe claimant did not lodge a complaint either with the Ombudsman office or with the Ministry of Security. The claimant was unaware that the Ombudsman or the ministry even existed.\nGiven the various remedies available to deal with police abuse or misconduct, I do not find the claimant's reasons for his lack of effort to seek state protection to be persuasive. I find that the claimant ought to have made some investigations of the existence of these institutions and their mandates and then pursue the options opened to him by reporting the incident and the death threats to the police. If there was any misconduct on the part of the police, he was free to report to the Ombudsman, the Ministry of Security or the Constitutional Accord.\nThe availability of state protection for this particular claimant is clearly the determinative issue in this claim. Ignorance of the complaints mechanism is no excuse for the claimant's failure to pursue the avenue available to him in Costa Rica.\nThe availability of state protection in Costa Rica has been comprehensively analysed in TA2-14980. That reasoning applies to the facts of this claim. As a result, I adopt the reasons given in TA2-14980.\nI find that the claimant has not discharged the onus of showing clear and convincing proof of the state's inability or unwillingness to protect him.\nDETERMINATION\nGiven the findings of available state protection for the claimant, XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX, I find that he is not a Convention refugee and that he is not a person in need of protection pursuant to Section 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nAccordingly, I reject his claim for refugee protection.\n\"William M.

They claimed refugee protection in Canada for reasons of membership in a particular social group, namely families who are victims of domestic violence. The panel has used the Board's guidelines on persecution against women and the guidelines relating to minors.\nDETERMINATION\nThe claimants are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\nThe claimant and her two sons provided valid identity documents. The panel is satisfied as to their respective identities. Numerous documents and psychological reports support the claim that the mother and her children were victims of abuse and mental torture (see Exhibit D-11.1 to 11.11, volumes 1 and 2).\nFacts\nThe circumstances surrounding the claimant's decision can be outlined as follows:\nThe claimant and her children were subjected to the volatile and violent moods of Mr. XXXXXX, the claimant's husband and the children's father. The claimant's sister testified that she had seen bruises and marks on her sister's body several times. The claimant's husband tried to kill her. He beat one of the children with a garden hose.\nHe would not tolerate the slightest refusal or hesitation by his family to be subservient to him. The main details of this \"hell,\" as the claimant called it, are set out in the personal information form (PIF) and the psychological reports. The claimant and one of her children are currently in therapy; the older child refuses to go.\nCredibility\nThe principal claimant testified very candidly and spontaneously. She answered questions directly even though some of the memories were painful. Her behaviour was just as meaningful in getting across the seriousness of the marital problems she endured. The claimant was a credible witness.\nAt the hearing, the claimant's sister, who lives in Canada, described the events she had witnessed. She also gave an account of the discussions that had led the claimant not to return to Morocco at the end of her visit to Canada, as had been planned. The panel finds the witness to be credible.\nFinally, as proof of her credibility, the claimant referred to the steps she had taken as of XXXXX 2003 to obtain a final divorce from her husband. Her first efforts were unsuccessful because of some malicious advice she received. The claimant's fragile, depressive state also helped delay the process. However, prior to the hearing date, the claimant found a lawyer who was more aware of the specific type of problems posed by a divorce in the special circumstances currently faced by the claimant. At the hearing, the claimant spontaneously provided the business card of the lawyer looking after her case. Exhibit D-12 is a letter confirming the steps that are under way. There is no doubt that the claimant, who always referred to Mr. XXXXX as her \"former husband\" firmly intends to divorce her attacker and to protect the children from their father's extreme fits of rage.\nPossibility of exclusion under 1F(b)\nThe claimant testified that her intention had not been to kidnap her children but simply to protect them. When Mr. XXXXX learned that she and the children had claimed refugee protection in Canada, he complained to the Canadian ambassador in Morocco that his wife had kidnapped his children. An assistant to the ambassador met with Mr. XXXXX to discuss the matter.\nThe Minister's representative expressed an interest in the case, but, on April 16, 2004, stated that he no longer intended to intervene since there was no information suggesting that the claimant might be excluded under Article 1F(b) of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. In his letter, he stated that he had contacted the Canadian embassy in Rabat to check whether the claimant's husband had brought criminal proceedings against her. There are no charges against the claimant. The Minister's representative added that, since the children's father had authorized them to travel with their mother in XXXXX 2003 and the claimant had initiated divorce proceedings in 1996, and, in view of the sensitive issues raised by this case, he did not think there was substantial enough evidence to justify applying the exclusion set out in Article 1F(b). Finally, he saw no need to intervene with respect to issues of credibility, as indicated in the notice announcing his participation sent on September 26, 2003 (see English text in Exhibit M-1).\nAfter carefully reviewing the evidence, the panel agrees with the Minister's representative on these points. The claimant testified that she had never intended to kidnap her children. She gave in to pressure from some members of her family, who, seeing that she was so unhappy and that she was battling with a situation in which her life and her children's physical and mental security might be in danger, convinced her to remain in Canada and claim Canada's protection. Since there is no reason to doubt the credibility of the claimant or her sister, the panel finds that the decision was not premeditated and was the result of thinking guided by the need, first and foremost, to protect the children. The information found in the psychological reports supports this need for protection.\nThe exclusion clause found in Article 1F(b) does not apply in the instant case.\nState protection\nThe claimant's counsel referred to numerous documents to demonstrate that the state cannot adequately protect the claimant and her children from the agent of persecution. She made eloquent submissions based on detailed research into this type of question. The panel will provide only a broad summary.\nAccording to Nahla Abdo, an expert on spousal abuse problems in Morocco, spousal abuse is a major problem. The committee for the elimination of discrimination and violence against women deplores the lack of seriousness of Moroccan institutions and society in general in ensuring that all discrimination and violence against women and children are eliminated. Moroccan society is patrilineal, and women have no say in making decisions in the family. Spousal abuse is considered a private matter. This fact constitutes a major obstacle to the success of the ratification of the protocol signed by Morocco. As well, abused women do not receive effective, adequate services. They have little leeway to complain about abuse. Victims' shelters are few in number and do not have the means to provide lasting protection. The police side with men and are seen as an additional means of oppression. The vast majority of police officers are male, and they receive no training on these sensitive issues. They are interested only in cases in which a crime has already been committed, which is often too late for women.\nSharia law is particularly strict in dealing with these matters. The Moudawana or personal status law confirms that women are inferior to men. Women have no immunity from their spouses. There are no measures to protect children from a violent father. Although divorce is allowed, restrictions make obtaining it difficult and very rare. It is not unusual for a judge to return a complainant to the attacker's home. Women cannot live alone. If their family does not want to take them back, they are left to their fate. A divorce cannot be granted without the husband's consent.\nSome changes to the law are planned so that the country can comply with the protocol it has signed. However, the government has not enacted all the necessary legislation or established mechanisms to reinforce the new legislation.\nIn the case of the claimant and her children, the panel believes that the legislation is insufficient to protect abused children. See Nahla Abdo's report, Exhibit D-1.10. Moreover, Exhibit D-13 confirms the inequalities noted by other experts in this area. Exhibit A-1.2 (U.S. Department of State, Reports on Human Rights for 2003, page 11) confirms the inequalities that exist within families. There is no law governing domestic violence. Exhibit A-1.6, a report by the WOAT (The World Organization Against Torture) provides a detailed account of matrimonial obligations and their application as described. Finally, Exhibit A-1.8 describes the steps involved in obtaining a divorce. It is not unusual for a divorce to take more than 10 years to be resolved. There are no measures for guaranteeing custody of the children to the mother or for ensuring that the father's contact with his children will occur in a protected, supervised environment to make sure the children remain safe. From this standpoint, the documentary evidence reveals that the state provides only limited protection to women dealing with serious spousal abuse problems in the current legal context.\nIn the claimant's particular case, given the current legal framework, the particularly violent acts endured in the family context and the fact that Mr. XXXXXX blocked the proceedings associated with the 1996 divorce petition, the panel finds that the evidence as a whole shows that the claimant has discharged her burden of proving that state protection is ineffective in cases such as hers and that of her children.\nInternal flight alternative\nThe claimant stated that her \"former husband\" has threatened her parents. Her younger sister has been accosted and bothered. To gain a measure of peace, the claimant's parents have had to move to another city. Apparently, Mr. XXXXX is still harassing them. However, the distance has created a zone of relative safety. While this move to another region may be relatively effective for the claimant's parents, the same would not be true for her and her children. It can be inferred from the facts of the case and the attacker's character that a move to another city would not protect the claimants or be enough to keep away the agent of persecution. As mentioned above, there are no laws prohibiting the children's father from taking them back home. The same situation applies to the best interests of the children. Relocation within the country is not a viable option in this case. Moreover, the Moudawana applies throughout the country.\nConclusion\nFor all these reasons, the panel finds that XXXXXXXXXXXX and her two children, XXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXX, would face a serious possibility of persecution if they had to return to Morocco.\nTheir claims for refugee protection are accepted under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\"Marie-Andr\u00e9e Lalonde\"\nMarie-Andr\u00e9e Lalonde\nDated at Ottawa the 21st day of May, 2004.\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP - DOMESTIC VIOLENCE - EXCLUSION CLAUSES - ART. 1F(b) - SERIOUS NON-POLITICAL CRIME - WOMEN REFUGEES - STATE PROTECTION - INTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE - FEMALE - POSITIVE - MOROCCO\nRPD File # \/ No de dossier de la SPR: AA3-00181\/00185\/00186\n6\n",

XXXXXXXXXXXXXX, the minor claimant, is the son of the principal claimant and also a citizen of Venezuela. He also claims refugee protection pursuant to ss.96 and 97 of the Act basing his claim on the claim of his mother.\nThe principal claimant is the designated representative of the minor claimant.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe principal claimant alleged that she came to Canada to seek protection because she was constantly harassed by one XXXXXXXXXXXXX who was her friend in Venezuela and that the said friend threatened her life. She alleged that the threats were the result of her refusing the sexual advances of XXXXXXXXXXX who is a lesbian.\nDETERMINATION\nI find that the claimant is not a Convention refugee, as she does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Venezuela. I also find that the claimant is not a person in need of protection in that her removal to Venezuela would not subject her personally to a risk to her life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, and there are no substantial grounds to believe that her removal to Venezuela will subject her personally to a danger of torture.\nI find that the minor claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection for the same reasons as his mother as his claim depended on the circumstances of his mother.\nANALYSIS\nThe claimant testified that she befriended XXXXXXXXXXX in 1998 when her family moved to the city of XXXX where her father operated a restaurant. Her newfound friend frequently came to her father's restaurant where she worked so they got close. After a while XXXX told the claimant that she was in love with the claimant. She responded that XXXX must be crazy as she, the claimant, was not a lesbian. XXXXX reacted that she was joking after the claimant's response but after a short while resumed making advances to her. The claimant testified that XXXXX became hostile to her female friends, especially XXXX and XXXX as XXX thought that the claimant was a lesbian and was having a relationship with one of the two friends. The claimant testified that when XXXX threatened to harm XXX and her family she reported the hostility to the police. The claimant provided documentary evidence of the police report1. This document confirms that the XXXX had uttered threats to the claimant. The claimant further testified that her friend XXXX who was also her lawyer advised her that should the threats get more serious, it would be necessary for her to go to Caracas and seek help from the department of defence. I find the claimant's failing to follow the advice of her lawyer and going to seek help from the department of defence or higher police authority to be a failure to seek protection where, on a balance of probabilities, it would have been forthcoming.\nThe issue to resolve in this case is whether it was objectively unreasonable for the claimant to have sought state protection. While states are presumed to be capable of protecting their nationals, it was open to the claimant, according to the law, to rebut the presumption of protection with \"clear and convincing\" evidence. I find, on the evidence before me, that the claimant has not rebutted that presumption in this case. The claimant did not follow the advice of her lawyer who told her the steps to take if she felt the threat had reached serious proportions. She did not approach a higher level of authority of the police where she had initially reported threats from the perpetrator.\nBased on the above reasons I find that there is no serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted for a Convention ground if she were removed to Venezuela. I also find that the claimant's removal to Venezuela would not subject her to a risk to her life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment and there are no substantial grounds to believe that her removal to Venezuela will subject her personally to a danger of torture.\nFor those reasons I reject her claim.\nRegarding the circumstances of the minor claimant, I reject his claim for the same reasons as his mother in so far as his claim is based on the outcome of her claim.\nThe principal claimant raised the issue that she fears for her son's life in Venezuela as he suffers from epilepsy and is currently receiving treatment in Canada and feeling better. She testified that Venezuela does not have emergency response services like the 911 system in Canada that saved her son's life one time when he suffered a seizure while at school. In response to questions about persons in situations similarly situated as her son the claimant stated that the cost of medicine is very high and her son would need to seek treatment in private clinics as his uncle who suffers from the same ailment does. I find that this is not an acceptable reason to seek refugee protection.\nAccording to section 97 (1) (b) (iv) of the Act, protection on the basis of a risk to life or a risk to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment is not available where the risk is caused by the inability of the country of reference to provide adequate health or medical care. I find that protection is not available to the minor claimant in this case as the risk he allegedly faces is caused by the inability of Venezuela to provide such care. The claimant has not provided any evidence before me to indicate that Venezuela is unwilling to provide health or medical care to the minor claimant. I, accordingly, reject his claim on this basis as well.\nCONCLUSION\nBased on the above reasons I find that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection and I, therefore, reject their claims.\n\"Benjamin Ayorech\"\nBenjamin Ayorech\nDATED: 20 January 2004\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - PERSON IN NEED OF PROTECTION - STATE PROTECTION - RISK TO LIFE - MEDICAL TREATMENT - INABILITY OF COUNTRY - INADEQUATE HEALTH OR MEDICAL CARE - FEMALE - MALE - NEGATIVE - VENEZUELA\n1 Exhibit C-3, Item #6\n---------------\n---------------\n---------------\n---------------\nRPD File # \/ No. dossier SPR : CA3-00671\nCA3-00672\n2\n",

The claimant's counsel's disclosures are meeting intake notes made by a clergyman while interviewing the claimant in detention in Canada on October 29, 2004 and were disclosed by the claimant and his counsel the day of the claimant's refugee protection claim hearing. These notes outline the various problems that confronted the claimant while he was living in XXXXX, Washington as well as his juvenile criminal convictions, imprisonment and parole and the impact that these problems had on him during this time.\nThe Minister's application for late disclosure of documents is the Minister's Amended Notice to Participate, both in writing and in person, at the claimant's refugee protection claim hearing pursuant to Article 1F(b) of the Convention and related documents concerning the claimant's criminal convictions in the United States in XXXXX 1998, all received by the Board on October 29, 2004. The basis of, or reason for, the Minister's application for late disclosure of these documents arose from the Minister's error in disclosing a Notice of Intent to Participate based on the issues of the claimant's credibility and Article 1E as opposed to Article 1F(b) of the Convention.\nI accepted both counsel's application and the Minister's application pursuant to Rule 44 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules. In making these determinations, I considered all of the relevant factors, including those listed in Rule 30 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules, the Commentary to Rule 30, and the Chairperson's Guideline 7, in particular 1.2 Disclosure of Documents and Witness Information respecting counsel's application. With respect to counsel's Rule 44 application, the Minister's representative had no objection to the late disclosure of this document by the claimant and his counsel. In addition, notwithstanding the Minister's earlier error respecting the Minister's Notice of Intent to participate pursuant to Article 1E as opposed to Article 1F(b) of the Convention, the claimant and his counsel had notice of the claimant's convictions in the State of Washington in XXXXX 1998 pursuant to the Minister's Notice of Intent to Participate disclosed on August 19, 2004 pursuant to Article 1E. In addition, the claimant's counsel had no objection to the Minister's application for late disclosure of the Minister's Amended Notice of Intent to Participate respecting Article 1F(b), and made no application to postpone the claimant's refugee protection claim hearing because of the Minister's late disclosure. As well, the claimant's counsel's post-hearing submissions dated November 3, 2004 respecting the application of Article 1F(b) to the claimant's protection claim were accepted by the Board.\nALLEGATIONS\nIn his Personal Information Form (\"PIF\") narrative, the claimant makes a number of material allegations respecting his fear of persecution in Somalia. However, given my determination that the claimant is excluded from the Convention refugee definition pursuant to Article 1F(b) of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (the \"Convention\"), I did not find it necessary to consider the claimant's allegations respecting his fear of persecution in Somalia or whether there was sufficient evidence before me to determine that the claimant's fear or persecution in Somalia for a Convention ground is well-founded.\nDETERMINATION\nI determine that the claimant is not a person in need of protection pursuant to Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. My reasons are as follows.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\nI find that the claimant's identity as a national of Somalia is established by his testimony and the documentary evidence before me, namely a letter issued to the claimant by the United States Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya advising the claimant that the United States Immigration and Nationality Service had determined him to be eligible for resettlement in the United States as a Somali refugee.1\nExclusion - Article 1F(b)\nThe determinative issue for me in this refugee protection claim was whether the claimant is excluded from refugee protection because there are serious reasons for considering that he committed a \"serious non-political crime\" pursuant to Article 1F(b) of the Convention. On the evidence before me, I determine that the claimant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection because he committed a serious non-political crime while a resident of the United States. My reasons are as follows.\nThe first issue to be addressed is whether the claimant has been convicted of a serious non-political crime outside of Canada. The Minister submitted into evidence a number of documents that indicate that the claimant was convicted in XXXXX, Washington of rape in the first degree, robbery in the first degree and assault in the fourth degree in the Superior Court of the State of Washington, County of XXXXX, Juvenile Court on XXXXX, 1998.2 In addition, the claimant is a registered sexual offender in XXXXX, Washington until XXXXX 2099.3 The documentary evidence submitted by the Minister also indicates that the claimant is a wanted felon in the United States and a Parole Arrest Warrant was issued against him on XXXXX, 2004 for a failure to attend a scheduled appointment with the Juvenile Rehabilitation Administration of the State of Washington on XXXXX, 2004.4\nI considered the evidence of the witness, Mr. XXXXX, a Parole Officer with the State of Washington Juvenile Rehabilitation Administration Region XXXXX in XXXXX, Washington. Mr. XXXXX provided the following testimony at the hearing. The claimant is currently on his parole caseload. The claimant was convicted of rape in the first degree because the rape involved the use of a weapon. He cut the woman victim of the rape with a knife and used a telephone cord to strangle her. He also held the knife to the woman's child's throat and asked the woman to have sex with him. Both the rape and the robbery were in the first degree because of the aggravated nature of the crimes. The claimant was designated a \"serious offender\" because of being convicted of rape and robbery, both in the first degree.\nAt the hearing, the claimant provided the following testimony respecting his trial and conviction in the State of Washington on the charges referred to above in XXXXX 1998, and his breaches of his parole conditions following his release from prison. Although he had a trial and was convicted of the charges, his female roommate at the time, one of the victims, lied about the rape, robbery and assault incident and he did not commit these offences. Upon his release from prison in XXXXX 2002, he was required to take a polygraph test because some unknown person had thrown a firearm in his car. For this breach of his parole conditions, he was sent back to prison for thirty days. He did not complete the conditions of his parole in the State of Washington and fled to Canada because he had a lot of problems. He was living with a family that was not his real family and he could not find a job after his release from prison. He could not follow all the parole conditions imposed on him and wanted to start a new life in Canada.\nI considered the case law respecting the application of Article 1F(b). The burden of establishing \"serious reasons for considering\" that Article 1F offences have been committed falls on the Minister.5 There is no requirement to balance the nature of the Article 1F crime with the degree of persecution feared.6 In order for a crime to be characterized as \"political\", thus falling outside the ambit of Article 1F(b) (serious non-political crimes), both aspects of a two-pronged test must be satisfied:\n(a) the existence of a political disturbance related to a struggle to modify or abolish a government or government policy;\n(b) a rational nexus between the crime committed and the accomplishment of the political objective sought.7\nIn this protection claim, neither prong of the test has been met, and the offences committed by the claimant and for which he was convicted in the United States are clearly non-political crimes.\nI also considered the case law respecting what constitutes a \"serious\" non-political crime pursuant to Article 1F(b) of the Convention. A misdemeanor probably lacks the requisite seriousness to be considered under Article 1F(b).8 In Taleb et al,9 the court found that the offence of attempted kidnapping is a \"serious\" offence within the meaning of Article 1F(b). In Chan,10 the court found that a conviction in the United States for using a communication facility to facilitate trafficking in narcotics was a \"serious\" offence. In Sharma,11 the Court upheld the finding by the Board's Refugee Determination Division that armed robbery was a \"serious\" non-political crime. Again, in Chan,12 the Court referred to the following quotation:\nWith a view to promoting consistent decisions, UNHCR proposed that, in the absence of any political factors, a presumption of serious crime might be considered as raised by evidence of commission of any of the following offences: homicide, rape [emphasis added], child molesting, wounding, arson, drugs trafficking, and armed robbery [emphasis added].\nAs a Member of the Board, I take judicial notice of and I considered the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code of Canada, namely those provisions of the Code that address the commission of offences of sexual assault and robbery in Canada. The evidence before me indicates that the claimant was convicted of rape in the first degree and robbery in the first degree, aggravated forms of rape and robbery, because both offences involved the use of a weapon. Therefore, I specifically considered Sections 272 (sexual assault) and 344 of the Code respecting sexual assault and robbery with a weapon. Section 272 states in part:\n(1) Every person commits and offence who, in committing a sexual assault, carries, uses or threatens to use a weapon or an imitation of a weapon; Every person who commits an offence under subsection (1) is guilty of an indictable offence and liable\n(a) where a firearm is used in the commission of the offence, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years and to a minimum punishment of four years; and\n(b) in any other case, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years.\nSection 344 states in part:\n(1) Every person who commits robbery is guilty of an indictable offence and liable\n(a) where a firearm is used in the commission of the offence, to imprisonment for life and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of four years; and\n(b) in any other case, to imprisonment for life.\nI find that foregoing provisions of the Criminal Code of Canada would form a solid basis for finding that the commission of either one of these offences in Canada constitutes a \"serious\" non-political crime.\nI also considered whether their were any mitigating circumstances or factors respecting the claimant such that Article 1F(b) of the Convention no longer applies to the claimant. I refer to Paragraph 157 of the UNHCR Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status that states:\nIn evaluating the nature of the crime assumed to have been committed, all of the relevant factors - including and mitigating circumstances - must be taken into account. It is also necessary to have regard to any aggravating circumstances as, for example, the applicant may already have a criminal record. The fact that the applicant convicted of a serious non-political crime has already served his sentence or has been granted a pardon or has benefited from an amnesty is also relevant. In the latter case, there is a presumption that the exclusion clause is no longer applicable, unless it can be shown that, despite the pardon or amnesty, the applicant's criminal character still predominates.\nThe evidence before me indicates that the Superior Court of the State of Washington convicted the claimant of rape in the first degree and robbery in the first degree as a juvenile and that at the time of these convictions in XXXXX 1998 the claimant was the age of 13 years. In addition, the claimant's testimony that these convictions arose because of the family that he lived with and this family was not his real family. To corroborate this allegation, as referred to above, the claimant submitted into evidence intake notes from a meeting that he had with a clergyman in the presence of a chaplain on October 29, 2004 while in detention in Canada. In these meeting notes, the clergyman states that at the age of approximately 11 years, the claimant was initially sent to live with a family in XXXXX, Washington.13 The writer goes on to state in part:\nIn 1995 this family immigrated to Vancouver, B.C., Canada and left XXXXX behind in the care of another family. This family lived in an apartment with an extended family. XXXXX slept in the living room. He reports being beaten by the father of the house, accused of theft and crimes, which he said he did not commit. He reports that one such charge was that he attempted an assault with a knife against members of his household. He was accused of stealing a car when it was taken and the keys to the car were missing from the home. He reports that he did not do this, and that the car was later found stripped down with many parts missing. He said he was not involved at all with the theft. He was 12 years old at the time. He reports that he was not believed by the juvenile justice system. At the age of thirteen he was accused again by a member of his care-giving family of rape. At that time he was a given a sentence of the remainder of his youth in detention. He reports being very angry during his incarceration with the family who had agreed to care for him. He believed that they agreed to his care in order to obtain the money from his welfare, but cared little for him. He remembers being like the family scapegoat for blame, and was beaten by them for grievances that he did not commit. He had attempted suicide in detention by cutting his wrists with glass. He did this while in a closed circuit monitored room at the correctional facility. He was cared for by attending health professionals who prescribed heavy medication, which included Ritalin. He was given six medications altogether he recalls.14\nBased upon the claimant's testimony and the documentary evidence before me, I accept that the claimant had a troubled life as a juvenile in XXXXX, Washington from age 11 onwards and after his arrival in the United States as a resettled Somali refugee from Kenya, and at the time of his convictions in the State of Washington, he was a juvenile of 13 years of age. However, there is no medical or psychological evidence before me that indicates that the claimant has suffered from or continues to suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder or that there is any other condition affecting him. In addition, the documentary evidence before me and the evidence of the witness, Mr. XXXXX XXXXX, indicate that there were aggravating circumstances respecting the claimant's conviction of the offences of rape in the first degree and robbery in the first degree. These aggravated circumstances include the claimant's use of a weapon (a knife) in committing these offences, using a knife against and attempted strangulation of the female victim with a telephone cord, as well as holding a knife to the neck of the female victim's child as part of the commission of the rape. This same evidence indicates that the Superior Court of Washington, Juvenile Court designated the claimant as a \"serious offender\" and for this reason he was sentenced to a longer period of incarceration than the standard range for these two offences.15 The claimant is also a registered sexual offender in XXXXX, Washington until XXXXX XXXXX, 2099. In addition, the evidence before me indicates that the claimant breached his parole conditions on three separate occasions (unauthorized leaves) in the State of Washington before fleeing to Canada to avoid his conditions of parole. For all of the foregoing reasons, I find there are no mitigating circumstances such that exclusion from Article 1F(b) of the Convention does not apply to the claimant. In making this finding, I refer to Jafri where the Federal Court held that because the serious offence of murder had been committed by the claimant 27 years ago and that the applicant was only 18 years of age at this time, these were not sufficient mitigating circumstances to not bar the claimant's refugee protection claim.16\nThere is no evidence before me that the claimant was convicted in the United States without due process or a fair trial. The claimant breached his parole conditions and chose to flee the United States without completing the conditions of his parole. Therefore, I find the claimant's evidence that he was wrongfully convicted of rape in the first degree and robbery in the first degree to be self-serving and not credible. Based upon the documentary evidence before me, the claimant's testimony and the testimony of the witness, Mr. XXXXX XXXXX, I find that the foregoing crimes for which the claimant was convicted in the United States in XXXXX 1998 constitute a sound basis for having serious reasons for considering that the claimant has committed a serious non-political crime outside of the country of refuge.\nThe second issue to be addressed is whether Article 1F(b) of the Convention should not be applied to the claimant because he completed the prison term of his sentence in the United States prior to coming to Canada. At the hearing, and by way of post-hearing submissions, counsel for the claimant submitted that Article 1F(b) of the Convention does not apply so as to exclude the claimant because he served the entire prison or jail term of his sentence and was released on parole. Counsel submits that Article 1F(b) only applies in the situation where the jail term of the sentence is not served by the claimant. In support of this argument, the claimant's counsel cites Chan17 where the Federal Court held that Article 1F(b) is not applicable to refugee claimants who have been convicted of a crime committed outside Canada and who have served their sentence prior to coming to Canada. In addition, the claimant's counsel makes the following post-hearing written submissions:\n1. Pursuant to Section 50(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, a removal order is stayed \"in the case of a foreign national sentenced to a term of imprisonment in Canada, until the sentence is completed\".\n2. Pursuant to Subsection 128(1) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act - \"An offender who is released on parole, statutory release or unescorted temporary absence continues, while entitled to be at large, to serve the sentence [emphasis added] until its expiration according to law\".\n3. Pursuant to Subsection 128(3) of the same Act, despite Subsection (1) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, for the purposes of Section 50(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and Section 40 of the Extradition Act, the sentence of an offender who has been released on parole, statutory release or an unescorted temporary absence is deemed to be completed unless the parole or statutory release has been suspended, terminated or revoked [emphasis added] or the unescorted temporary absence is suspended or cancelled or the offender has returned to Canada before the expiration of the sentencing according to law.\n4. This provision, coupled with the reasoning in the Chan decision means that it would be contrary to law to exclude the claimant. The sentence of the claimant must, in law, be deemed to have been completed once he was released on parole. Since the deeming is both for the purpose of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and the Extradition Act, the Board must recognize this deeming provision and find that Article 1F(b) is not applicable to the claimant.\n5. The Chan decision was also based upon a finding that a person convicted abroad was not excludable under Article 1F(b) because of the scheme of the former Immigration Act. The relevant provisions in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act remain the same, namely Section 101(2)(b) for eligibility and Section 115(2) for removal. In Chan, the court noted that a person who is convicted abroad, and has served his sentence prior to coming to Canada cannot be found ineligible to make a refugee protection claim in Canada or be returned to a country of danger from which the claimant fled unless the Minister has issued a public danger opinion against the claimant. Allowing exclusion on a conviction abroad alone, without a Ministerial danger opinion, is contrary to the intent of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. It would have the effect \"of virtually abrogating\" the legislated need for a danger opinion.\nI considered the documentary evidence before me respecting the sentences imposed on the claimant by the Superior Court of the State of Washington. On his conviction for the crimes of rape in the first degree and robbery in the first degree the claimant was sentenced to 150 weeks for each conviction for a total sentence of 300 weeks or over 5.5 years of incarceration in a facility operated by the State of Washington Department of Social and Health Services, Division of Juvenile Rehabilitation.18\nI also considered the following testimony of the witness, Mr. XXXXX XXXXX respecting the claimant's sentences for being convicted of rape in the first degree and robbery in the first degree in the State of Washington. Again, Mr. XXXXX is a parole officer with the State of Washington Juvenile Rehabilitation Administration in XXXXX Washington. The claimant was released from a juvenile prison facility on XXXXX, 2002 and therefore he would have only served approximately four years of prison time. However, the documentary evidence before me indicates that the Superior Court of Washington, Juvenile Court credited the claimant for time already served of 201 days.19 In addition, according to Mr. XXXXX testimony, the claimant was released from prison after serving 80 percent of his sentence, the minimum under the law of the State of Washington. Part of his sentencing on the conviction for rape in the first degree as well, was to serve two years of sex offender parole following his release from prison. This two years of parole imposed the following conditions on the claimant: (a) attending sexual offender treatment; (b) weekly meetings with a parole officer with the State of Washington Juvenile Rehabilitation Administration (\"JRA\"); (c) to avoid being around all high risk places such as zoos or parks unless in the company of a chaperon approved of by his sex offender treatment provider; (d) no contact with the victims of the offences that he committed; (e) no contact with any person that is two years younger than he is; (f) to actively seek full-time employment; (g) to not be tardy in attending his weekly meetings with a parole officer; (h) to obtain verbal permission from the JRA before leaving the Country and to obtain written permission from the JRA before leaving the State of Washington; (i) to remain at his address of record and provide notification of any change in his address of record to the JRA; (j) to provide information to the sexual offender registry in the State of Washington to ensure that the information remains accurate; and (k) to take a polygraph test as directed by the JRA.\nMr. XXXXX also provided the following testimony respecting the two-year parole portion of the claimant's sentence. The claimant did not complete his two-year parole because he has been on unauthorized leave since XXXXX, 2004. As referred to above, in XXXXX with this unauthorized leave, JRA issued a Parole Arrest Warrant against the claimant on January 30, 2004 for failure to keep a scheduled meeting with a JRA parole officer on XXXXX, 2004.20 The claimant was found to be on unauthorized leave on three previous occasions during 2003. For the first two unauthorized leaves, the claimant was sent back to prison for two weeks and for the third unauthorized leave, he was sent to prison for one month. Under State of Washington law, the parole portion of a criminal sentence stops when the parolee is on unauthorized leave or is otherwise in breach of his or her parole conditions or requirements. For this reason, the claimant is currently still under the parole portion of his sentence in the State of Washington. If he were to return to the United States today, he would face a further period of incarceration, and the Parole Arrest Warrant issued against him on XXXXX, 2004 currently remains in effect.\nI also considered counsel for the claimant's submissions concerning the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, and as a Member of the Board I take judicial notice of the provisions of the Act. Although the claimant's counsel makes reference to Subsection 128 (1) of the Act in his written submissions, counsel doe not refer to Subsection 128(2) of the Act. Subsection 128(2) states:\nExcept to the extent required by the conditions of any day parole, an offender who is released on parole, statutory release or unescorted temporary absence is entitled, subject to this Part, to remain at large in accordance with the conditions of the parole, statutory release or unescorted temporary absence and is not liable to be returned to custody by reason of the sentence unless the parole, statutory release or unescorted temporary absence is suspended, cancelled, terminated or revoked.\nIn his written submissions, counsel also refers to the deeming provision contained in Subsection 128(3) of the Act. Subsection 128(3) states:\nDespite subsection (1), for the purposes of 50(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and section 40 of the Extradition Act, the sentence of an offender who has been released on parole, statutory release or an unescorted temporary absence is deemed to be completed unless the parole or statutory release has been suspended, terminated or revoked or the unescorted temporary absence is suspended or cancelled or the offender has returned to Canada before the expiration of the sentence according to law.\nWith respect to the claimant's sentences and parole conditions in the United States, I find the operative words in Subsection 128(2) of the Act are \"unless the parole, statutory release or unescorted temporary absence is suspended, cancelled, terminated or revoked\". I also find that the operative words in Subsection 12(3) of the Act with respect to the application of the deeming provision are \"unless the parole or statutory release has been suspended, terminated or revoked...\". Based upon the evidence of Mr. XXXXX, I conclude that the claimant's parole in the State of Washington was suspended, terminated or revoked pursuant to the laws of the State of Washington by reason of the claimant's three unauthorized leaves in breach of the conditions of his parole.\nI also refer to Section 135 of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act. Subsection 135(1) of the Act states:\nA member of the Board or a person, designated by name or position, by the Chairperson of the Board or by the Commissioner, when an offender breaches a condition of parole or statutory release or when a member or person is satisfied that it is necessary and reasonable to suspend the parole or statutory release in order to prevent a breach of any condition thereof or to protect society, may, by warrant,\n(a) suspend the parole or statutory release;\n(b) authorize the apprehension of the offender; and\n(c) authorize the recommitment of the offender to custody until the suspension is cancelled, the parole or statutory release is terminated or revoked or the sentence of the offender has expired according to law.\nSubsections 135(10) and 135(11) of the Act state:\n(10) For the purposes of this Part, an offender who is in custody by virtue of this section continues to serve the offender's sentence.\n(11) for the purposes of this Act, where a suspension of parole or statutory release is cancelled, the offender is deemed, during the period beginning on the day of the issuance of the suspension and ending on the day of the cancellation of the suspension, to have been serving the sentence to which the parole or statutory release applies.\nAgain, in evidence before me is a Parole Arrest Warrant issued against the claimant by the JRA of the State of Washington on XXXXX, 2004 for breach of one of the conditions of his parole on XXXXX, 2004. In addition, it is Mr. XXXXX evidence that the claimant was recommitted to serving his sentence in prison on three separate occasions for breaching the conditions of his parole in the State of Washington. Based upon the foregoing provisions of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, the documentary evidence before me and the evidence of Mr. XXXXX, I find on a balance of probabilities that the scheme for suspension, termination, and revocation of parole in the State of Washington in the United States is similar to suspension, termination and revocation of parole in Canada. In addition, the Chan21 decision does not refer to the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, and as such the decision is not authority counsel's submission respecting the Act. For all of the foregoing reasons, I conclude that provisions of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act do not assist the claimant respecting the application of Article 1F(b) of the Convention to his protection claim.\nBased upon the foregoing documentary evidence and evidence of the witness, Mr. XXXXX, I find that the claimant has not fully completed the sentences imposed on him by the Superior Court of Washington, County of XXXXX, Juvenile Court on XXXXX, 1998. Therefore, I also find that principle enunciated in the Chan decision is not applicable to the claimant.\nWith respect to the claimant's counsel's remaining written submissions, I find that they are not applicable to Article 1F(b) of the Convention. My reasons are as follows. The Federal Court of Appeal in Zrig22 refused to limit Article 1F(b) to crimes that are extraditable pursuant to a treaty. Rather, it interpreted the reference to extraditable crimes in Pushpanathan as an indication of the nature and seriousness of the crimes that may fall under Article 1F(b). Based upon the foregoing analysis, I find that there are serious reasons for considering that the claimant has committed and was convicted of a serious non-political crime outside of the country of refuge, and as such he is excluded from the Convention refugee definition pursuant to Article 1F(b) of the Convention. Pursuant to Section 98 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, I also find that the claimant is excluded from being a person in need of protection pursuant to Section 97(1) of the Act.\nCONCLUSION\nHaving considered all of the evidence before me, and for all of the foregoing reasons, I determine that XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, and therefore I reject his claim.\n\"Gordon McKenzie\"\nGordon McKenzie\nDATED: December 14, 2004\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - EXCLUSION CLAUSES - ART. 1F(b) - SERIOUS NON-POLITICAL CRIME - MINORS - MALE - NEGATIVE - SOMALIA\n1 Exhibit M-2, page 40\n2 Exhibit M-1, pages 8 and 9\n3 Exhibit M-2, page 27\n4 Exhibit M-1, page 7\n5 Ramirez v.

He also claimed to be a person in need of protection, under paragraphs 97(1)(a) and (b)2 of the Act, stating that there are substantial grounds for believing that if he were returned to Algeria, his country of citizenship, he would be personally subjected to a danger of torture, to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nL. Cozza, of SARIM, was appointed as his designated representative in this case.\nThe evidence presented by the claimant, his counsel, the Refugee Protection Officer (RPO) and Lucie S\u00e9guin, representing the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC), essentially consisted of the claimant's testimony, his Personal Information Form (PIF) and personal documents, and documents related to the social and political situation in Algeria. They formed Exhibits A-1 to A-9, R-1 to R-6 and M-1 to M-14.\nIt should be noted that, through her representative, the Minister intervened in this case, to raise the question of the application of the exclusion clause, Article 1F(b) of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, on the grounds that the claimant had committed a serious non-political crime before he was admitted to Canada.\nTHE FACTS\nThe facts alleged may be summarized as follows:\nThe claimant was born on XXXXX, 1966, in Algiers, the capital of Algeria. Before he left his country, he had been unemployed since 1988.\nThe claimant was deported from Germany to Algeria in XXXXXX 1999. At the end of the year, he went to Tunisia in order to reach Italy. However, his plan did not succeed. In 2000, the claimant travelled secretly to Morocco in order to get into Spain. He paid 6,000 French francs for the trip, which was also aborted. He then returned to Algeria.\nThe claimant told the panel that the regional security directorate [Direction r\u00e9gionale de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (DRS)] and military security services [S\u00e9curit\u00e9 militaire (SM)] had asked him to break into the offices of the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. The claimant said that he took some documents relating to the party, even though it had been banned since 1992.\nAs early as 1992, the claimant had decided to leave Algeria. On XXXXX, 2001, he left Algeria by boat. He arrived in Canada at Baie Comeau on June 4, 2001. However, he did not seek refugee protection until June 11, 2001.\nThe claimant said that, if he had to return to Algeria, he did not know what he would fear; he said that he was not afraid of anyone. While he said that he had converted from Islam to Catholicism in 2000, the claimant could not identity the supreme head of the Church; he did not know what Easter was; he has not been baptized; he has not taken courses on either religion or the Bible; and he thought Christmas was on December 24 or 25.\nTHE APPLICATION OF THE EXCLUSION CLAUSE\nThe case law has established that it is not necessary to rule on the merits of a claim, i.e., inclusion, before deciding whether the exclusion clause applies.3\nSection 98 of the Act provides that\nA person referred to in section E or F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\nArticle 1F(b), which is reproduced in the Schedule to the Act, reads as follows:\nThe provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that\n(...)\n(b) he has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee; (...)\nThe panel feels that it is important to emphasize that, for the application of Article 1F(b) of Article 1, the panel is not required to balance the \"seriousness\" of the claimant's conduct \"against the alleged fear of persecution.\"4\nWith respect to the burden of proof, it is recognized that the party that raises the issue of the exclusion clause must prove that it is justified. The onus is therefore on the Minister to prove that the claimant must be excluded, in accordance with Article 1F(b). In this regard, the Honourable Justice McGuigan wrote in Ramirez:\n[...] the burden of establishing serious reasons for considering that international offences had been committed rested on the party asserting the existence of such reasons, i.e., the respondent. 5\nAs for the degree of proof required, the Honourable Justice Robertson indicated in Moreno that the Minister does not have to prove that the claimant was charged with or convicted of the acts attributed to him, but the Minister must meet the standard of proof implied in the phrase \"serious reasons for considering,\" in Article 1F(b):\nIt is universally accepted that the applicability of the exclusion clause does not depend on whether a claimant has been charged or convicted of the acts set out in the Convention. The Minister's burden is merely to meet the standard of proof embraced by the term \"serious reasons for considering\".6\nThe Honourable Justice D\u00e9carie was in full agreement in Bazarghan,7 as was the Honourable Justice Nadon in Mohamad.8 As well, the panel notes that this standard of proof is lower than that of the balance of probabilities.9\nIn the case before this panel, are there \"serious reasons for considering\" that the claimant, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, has committed at least one serious non-political crime?\nThe evidence on the record revealed that on XXXXX, 2000, the claimant was involved in a case of attempting to defraud through the use of false documents in Algeria (Exhibit M-4: Interpol document from Algiers, dated XXXXX, 2002). In Germany, he was involved between 1992 and 1994 in a theft from a motor home, infractions of the laws relating to foreigners on two occasions, as well as one offence of attempted identity theft (Exhibit M-6: Interpol document from the Federal Republic of Germany, dated of XXXXX, 2001). The evidence also showed that he was involved in a theft in Amsterdam in XXXXX 1992. In addition, a warrant for his arrest was issued by the public prosecutor's department in XXXXX, Germany, for the execution of a prison sentence of 1233 days, more than three years, for aggravated robbery with violence (Exhibit M-6). In addition, on two counts of robbery, he was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of six years and nine months, beginning on XXXXX, 1997 (Exhibit A-9: translation of a sentence of the Federal Republic of Germany of XXXXX, 1997).\nAt the hearing, the claimant made the following admissions: He committed two armed robberies in Germany; he was arrested in Germany in 1994 for theft from a motor home; he used false documents in Europe; he was arrested in Amsterdam, but had not stolen anything there; he felt forced to commit offences because he did not have enough money to live on. He also said that in Canada he had stolen things without being charged; he also tried to steal a computer from a car and he has worked here illegally. In addition, the claimant testified that, in 2000, while he was in Morocco, he found the bodies of three dead Algerians in his apartment. He said that even though he had no connection with their deaths, he had not notified the police or emergency services, and had left for Algeria in XXXXX or XXXXX 2000. He also said that in Germany, around 1993, he hit a person violently in self-defence. He said he thought he had killed that person, but was relieved when he saw him again a few days later. He said he had not been arrested for these aggravated assaults. He related a relatively similar incident that took place in Algeria around 2000. In addition, he said that in Canada, as well, he almost hit someone one day. He said that the person had been lucky and if he saw him again he would \"punch his face in.\" He denied, however, that he had been involved in attempting to defraud through the use of false documents in Algeria, and maintained that he had no criminal record in Algeria.\nWith respect to his sentence (Exhibit A-9), and the warrant for his arrest issued by the German authorities to execute a prison sentence of 1233 days (Exhibit M-6), the claimant testified at the hearing that he had been sentenced to eight years in prison. However, according to Exhibit A-9, the term was six years and nine months. When confronted on this point, the claimant said that there was only one conviction; he had already served 21 months before being sentenced; and that from the date of sentencing, he had served about three years. In all, he served five years and one month of his sentence. When questioned about the 1233-day-sentence to be served, he indicated that it was a credit. Showing clemency toward him, the German authorities released him on XXXXX (he then said it was XXXXX, 1999), and then deported him to Algeria, accompanied by two Interpol officers. He also said that, if he were returned to Germany, he might have to serve that sentence; or, after five or ten years, the conviction might lapse. He said, to make a long story short, he was deported before serving the whole sentence and that, if he returned to Germany, he might be put in prison. Finally, he admitted, everything was very complicated.\nThe claimant was also confronted with the fact that in his answer to question 21 on his PIF, signed May 22, 2002, he stated that he had never been convicted of a crime or criminal offence. As well, in answer to question 22 in his Notification of Claim as a Convention Refugee, dated June 12, 2001, at Montreal (Exhibit M-1), he stated that he had never been charged with or convicted of an offence or a crime in any country. There was a similar statement in question 22 of Exhibit M-2, which was dated July 12, 2001, at Toronto. The claimant's explanation was that this statement was not accurate because when he is in Europe he always commits some kind of crime; it's automatic.\nNow, what meaning is to be given to the term \"non-political crime\"? According to paragraph 152 of the UNHCR Handbook:\nIn determining whether an offence is \"non-political\" or is, on the contrary, a \"political\" crime, regard should be given in the first place to its nature and purpose i.e. whether it has been committed out of genuine political motives and not merely for personal reasons or gain. There should also be a close and direct causal link between the crime committed and its alleged political purpose and object. The political element of the offence should also outweigh its common-law character. This would not be the case if the acts committed are grossly out of proportion to the alleged objective. The political nature of the offence is also more difficult to accept if it involves acts of an atrocious nature.\nParagraph 155 of the Handbook adds:\n(...) In the present context, however, a \"serious\" crime must be a capital crime or a very grave punishable act. Minor offences punishable by moderate sentences are not grounds for exclusion under Article 1 F (b) even if technically referred to as \"crimes\" in the penal law of the country concerned.\nWriting for the majority in Pushpanathan,10 Mr. Justice Bastarache said with respect to Article 1F(b):\nIt is quite clear that Article 1F(b) is generally meant to prevent ordinary criminals extraditable by treaty from seeking refugee status, but that this exclusion is limited to serious crimes committed before entry in the state of asylum.\nThe documents filed on the record showing that the claimant had committed crimes, namely, Exhibits A-9, M-3, M-4, M-6 and M-7, are credible. It is obvious that these are serious non-political crimes. Furthermore, the claimant has confessed to a number of his crimes.\nConsequently, in light of the case law, the documentary evidence and the testimony on the record, the panel has serious reasons for considering that the claimant committed serious non-political crimes before he was admitted into Canada. The panel refers here to the aggravated robbery with violence, for which German authorities issued an arrest warrant to execute a 1233-day-prison sentence, as well as to his failure to assist a person at risk when he discovered three dead bodies in his apartment in Morocco in 2000. The panel also refers to the aggravated assaults, one in Germany in 1993, and the other in Algeria in 2000. It should also be noted that the claimant has not served his sentence for one offence and has not even been charged in respect of the other offences.\nDECISION\nConsequently, the panel has serious reasons for considering that the claimant has committed serious non-political crimes and that, by reason of Article 1F(b), and in accordance with section 98 of the Act, he is excluded from the definitions of refugee and person in need of protection.\nThe panel finds that the claimant, XXXXXXXXXXXX (alias XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX alias XXXXXXXXXXXX, alias XXXXXXXXXXXXX, alias XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX), is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\nConsequently, this claim for refugee protection is rejected.\nSt\u00e9phane Handfield\nMe St\u00e9phane Handfield\nMay 5, 2004\nDate\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - SERIOUS NON-POLITICAL CRIMES - EXCLUSION - ARTICLE 1F(b) - DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE - MALE - NEGATIVE - ALGERIA\n1. 96.

He claimed refugee protection on March 21, 2002 alleging a well-founded of persecution because of his membership in a particular social group, namely abandoned minor children.\nHe is also seeking refugee protection on the ground that he is subjected to a risk to his life and to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.2\nIt should also be noted that XXXXXXX from the Service d'aide aux r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s et aux immigrants du Montr\u00e9al-M\u00e9tropolitain (SARIMM) [(translation) support services for refugees and immigrants of metropolitan Montreal)] was designated as the representative for the claimant, who is still a minor.\nRecall that the claimant had arrived in Canada with XXXXXXXX. Ms. XXXXX had custody of young XXXXX until the Honourable Justice XXXXX XXXXX of the Court of Quebec, Youth Division, removed him from her custody following a request from the Direction de Protection des droits de la Jeunesse (DPJ) [(translation) directorate for protection of the rights of the youth].3 After those incidents, an investigation was conducted (a DNA test) to establish the child's parentage,4 and it determined that XXXXX XXXXX was not young XXXXX biological mother. Shortly after, it was learned that XXXXX XXXXX had abandoned the child and returned to Haiti.\nIn the XXXXX, 2000 judgement,5 the Honourable Justice XXXXX XXXXX of the Youth Division of the Court of Quebec decided that [translation] \"Ms. XXXXX XXXXX is not the child's mother\" and [translation] \"orders that the child receive all services required in view of his circumstances (medical follow-up, social follow-up).\"\nA lawyer with Montreal legal aid subsequently applied to the Department of Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) to recognize young XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX as a Canadian citizen under subsection 4 (1) 6 of Part I (The Right to Citizenship) of the Citizenship Act. On November 18, 2003, the director of Montreal legal aid received a letter7 from CIC stating that the application was denied.\nSUMMARY OF THE ALLEGED FACTS\nIn support of his claim for refugee protection, the claimant alleged the following.\nHe says his name is XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX and that he is a Haitian citizen. Unfortunately he has almost no memories of his childhood in Haiti, except that his grandmother had wanted to drown him. He had arrived in Canada in 1999 with XXXXX XXXXX, and after the DNA test, he learned that this woman was not his mother and that his mother and father were unknown.\nHe is very afraid of returning to Haiti. Since XXXXX XXXXX fled there because she had been afraid of being charged criminally or by Immigration Canada for abusing him, the claimant is convinced that XXXXX XXXXX would kill him or have him killed if he were to return to Haiti.\nHe also alleged that the Haitian State would not protect him from XXXXX because he is of no interest to the State and because both his mother and father are unknown.\nIf he returns to Haiti, the claimant would be a street child, prey to prostitution and homelessness. [Translation] \"Impunity is reins in this country; crimes go unpunished.\" The Haitian authorities are lax towards corruption among the police, civil servants and partisans of the regime.\nThese are, in essence, the facts made known to the panel by the claimant.\nANALYSIS\nTo establish his identity and citizenship, the claimant filed a single document: a birth certificate8, which indicates that XXXXX is his mother.\nIn light of this one document, the panel can only state that the claimant has not proven his identity and citizenship. The panel must consider the DNA test conducted, which demonstrated that XXXXX XXXXX is not his mother, and especially since the claimant conceded in his answers to questions 15 and 37 of his Personal Information Form (PIF)9 that he does not know his biological mother or father.\nHowever, still with respect to the claimant's identity, the Minister's counsel pointed out in her submissions that the preponderance of evidence on record establishes that the claimant's name is XXXXX XXXXX and that he is a Haitian citizen. The panel shall abide by the submissions of the Minister's counsel, given the absence of evidence to the contrary.\nIn addition, the panel wants to make it clear that it took into account section 106 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act even though the claimant does not possess acceptable documentation establishing his identity. Also, in light of the circumstances surrounding his arrival in Canada, the claimant has provided a reasonable explanation for not having any identity papers and has demonstrated that he has taken the steps available to him to try to obtain the documentation.\nMoreover, the panel took into account the Convention on the Rights of the Child which states:\nWhere a child is illegally deprived of some or all of the elements of his or her identity, States Parties shall provide appropriate assistance and protection, with a view to speedily re-establishing his or her identity.10\nThe same Convention also states:\n1. In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.11\nRegarding the claimant's credibility, the panel is prepared to accept the facts alleged in support of his refugee protection claim. In arriving at this conclusion, the panel has also taken the claimant's testimony into account. His testimony was spontaneous and visibly sincere, albeit of poor quality.\nThe panel also considered the Chairperson's guidelines on child refugee claimants, which states:\nIn general, children are not able to present evidence with the same degree of precision as adults with respect to context, timing, importance and details. They may be unable, for example, to provide evidence about the circumstances surrounding their past experiences or their fear of future persecution. In addition, children may manifest their fears differently from adults. 12\nIn light of these guidelines and the claimant's young age, the panel deems that the claimant's testimony deserves to be given the benefit of the doubt regarding its truthfulness.\nHowever, the panel determines that the claimant is not a \"Convention refugee\"13 because his fear of Ms. XXXXX has no nexus with any of the five grounds in the refugee definition.\nHowever, the evidence on the record showed that the claimant is a \"person in need of protection\" because he has nowhere to go and to live safely if he were to return to Haiti. Under the circumstances and given that it appears impossible to locate the claimant's biological mother or father, the panel finds that, in accordance with the principle of best interests of the child, a principle recognized by the international community, the claimant cannot return to Haiti, where it would be possible that his life will be at risk.\nAs such, the panel finds that the Declaration of the Rights of the Child applies in this case, and it states:\nThe child, for the full and harmonious development of his personality, needs love and understanding. He shall, wherever possible, grow up in the care and under the responsibility of his parents, and, in any case, in an atmosphere of affection and of moral and material security; a child of tender years shall not, save in exceptional circumstances, be separated from his mother. Society and the public authorities shall have the duty to extend particular care to children without a family [...]14\nIn addition, it should be noted that the panel reached this decision in view of the fact that the claimant has no known father or mother in Haiti and that its decision would not have been the same if his parents had been known.\nDETERMINATION\nThe panel therefore determines that XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX is a \"person in need of protection\" as defined in paragraph 97(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and accepts his claim for refugee protection.\nJean-Guy Jam\nMe Jean-Guy Jam\nSeptember 16, 2004\nDate\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - MINOR - MALE - THREAT TO LIFE - STATE PROTECTION - NEXUS - BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD - POSITIVE - HAITI\n1 Exhibit D-14: medical report\n2 Section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C.

The claimant alleges that he is a citizen of Pakistan and that he has a well-founded fear of persecution because of his political opinion and his membership in a particular social group. He is also alleging that he is a person in need of protection because he faces a risk of torture or risk to life, or of cruel and unusual punishment or treatment.\nThe Minister's representative filed Exhibits M-1 to M-12 consisting of documentary evidence on Human Rights in Pakistan.\nCounsel's written submissions were received by the IRB on September 2, 2003 and were taken into consideration by the tribunal.\nTHE ALLEGED FACTS\nThe claimant alleges the following:\nHe was born on XXXXXX, 1974, in XXXXX, XXXXX.\nIn 1997, he joined the Police department, as a XXXXXXXX, and was posted in XXXXX. In XXXXX 1999, the claimant learned from an informant that XXXXX XXXXX, a close associate and family friend of the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and of his elder brother, Shahbaz Sharif, the Chief Minister of the Punjab Province, was the chief of the criminal underground mafia in Punjab.\nBesides smuggling drugs and weapons, XXXXX XXXXX operated illegal gambling joints, with the connivance of the Pakistan Moslem League (PML) government which he was heavily funding.\nAfter verifying the information, the claimant brought the matter to the attention of his superior officers. They appeared uninterested. When he tried to take the matter to the higher officials, he was prevented in doing so by his immediate superiors.\nAbout a month later, the claimant was stopped on his way home on his motorcycle by six armed men. They beat him in the nearby park and threatened that if he continued to \"meddle\" with XXXXX XXXXX affairs, he would be killed.\nThe claimant reported the incident to his superior officer who ignored it. His superior officers discouraged him from talking about XXXXX XXXXX and his criminal world, and his colleagues distanced themselves from the claimant.\nA few days later, the claimant began to get threatening phone calls from XXXXX XXXXX hench-men. He was afraid because, in XXXXX 1995, a sub-inspector had already been assassinated by XXXXX XXXXX.\nThe claimant wanted to flee his country, but his financial resources were insufficient. In November 1999, the claimant managed to get some loans from friends and relatives and, in XXXXX 1999, he escaped to the USA.\nA year later, in XXXXX 2000, the claimant returned to Pakistan because he had been erroneously informed, in XXXXX 2000, that the military authorities had \"smashed\" the \"crime mafia\". On XXXXX, 2001, gunshots were fired from an unknown vehicle at his friend's car, the claimant was also in the car. The same night, the claimant was threatened by XXXXX group. He was told that he was still on their hit list. The claimant then realized that they were still operating freely.\nOn XXXXX, 2001, the claimant flew to the USA and on March 20, 2003, he requested protection in Canada at the Lacolle border.\nDetermination\nThe claimant established his identity as a Pakistani citizen (A-111: passport seized by CIC); nevertheless after carefully reviewing all the evidence, both oral and documentary, the tribunal has reached the conclusion that the claimant is not a \"Convention refugee2\" nor a \"person in need of protection3\".\nA notice of intervention had been sent by the Minister on July 3rd, 2003 to the effect that, according to documentary evidence, the Pakistani police forces were committing human rights violations.\nThe claimant was a police officer in Pakistan and as such he is excluded from the definition, according to Sections 1F (a) (crimes against humanity) and (c) (acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations) of the Convention.\nANALYSIS\nI Exclusion\n1. Method of recruitment\nThe claimant was asked what motivated him to enter the police. At first, he said that the police were violating Human Rights, persecuting the people, oppressing the people by taking money from them, killing people. The claimant was further invited to clarify why in such circumstances, he wanted to become a police officer. He explained that his aim was to join the police and serve the people with justice and honesty. He testified that there was no police officer in his family, but that he was from a religious family with a \"soft heart\". He added that he was committed to join the police and do the efforts he could.\nThe claimant testified that he applied to the XXXXX Public Service Commission and that he took a specific written exam and had an interview to become a XXXXX. It is clear that the claimant joined the police voluntarily.\n2. Nature of the organization\nEven though a legal organization, part of the governmental structure, the Pakistani police force, through corruption of the system, committed human rights violations.\nAccording to Exhibit M-64 (Background paper on Refugees and asylum seekers from Pakistan - UNHCR - centre for documentation and research, Geneva, May 1998):\n\" In 1996, then - President Leghari alleged that police officials pay bribes to the politicians and senior officials in order to get posted to police station of their choice, subsequently recouping their investment by extorting money from citizens (US DOS for 1996, 1997).\nAnother observer noted that \"many of those killed in fake encounters are people whose only crime was to be politically active and who had never been known for any kind of violent act\", while others were victimized solely for being in the wrong place at the wrong time and were later labelled \"MQM activists\".\nThe Chief Minister of Punjab is reported to have cited the great amount of corruption in the police force as one of the factors contributing to the violence in his province. (...)\".\nHere are two more recent examples:\nThe Pakistani police committed extrajudicial executions.\nAccording to Exhibit M-25 (Human Rights Watch World Report 1998,p. 1):\n\"Sectarian violence and the government's harsh response to it dominated Pakistan's political landscape in 1997, leaving little scope for improvement in human rights. (...)\nThe change of government did not herald an end to human rights violations in Karachi. At least 400 persons had been killed in the city between January and November, victims of extrajudicial executions by police and federal security forces or retaliatory killings by the MQM\".\nThe Pakistani police continued to practice torture.\nAccording to Exhibit M-36: (Amnesty International Report (January to December 2001):\n\"In April, police officials acknowledged that torture, particularly of members of disadvantaged groups, continued to be practised. In May, Law Minister Shahida Jamil criticized the previous government's failure to invest in police training, stating that police frequently had no other investigative techniques but the use of force to extract confessions. (...)\".\nThe tribunal concludes that on the basis of the documentary evidence found in M-27, M-38 and M-69, the Pakistani police committed and continue to practice extrajudicial executions and torture.\n3. Rank in the organization\nThe claimant testified that he started to work for the police as a trainee XXXXX, T\/SI, and he filed as Exhibit P-1910, a Police identity card dated XXXXX, 1999. He said that he had one issued before but that it was too old and in bad condition, that is why he had gotten a new one. The claimant further explained that he started directly at the XXXXX level, the levels under his, being XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX. So the claimant was not a simple officer.\nAccording to him the training lasted almost a year, from XXXXX 1997 until XXXXX 1998. It is confirmed by Exhibit P-311, order regarding the completion of his basic one year Police Practical Training Course, dated XXXXX, 1998.\nThen, he testified that he attended courses A, B, C and D, which is also confirmed by Exhibit P 312, order dated XXXXX, 1999 regarding the completion of his practical training courses A, B and C and the possibility to start course \"D\" (Police Practical Course), at Police Station XXXXX. The claimant said that course A lasted from four to six weeks, course B almost as long, and that after course C, he started course D at the end of XXXXX 1999 for two years.\nThe claimant further alleged that in XXXXX 1998, he started \"A\" training which consisted in studying law in a police district where reserve forces are sent for peace, they tell you how to lead these forces consisting of 40 to 50 constables and head-constables, they teach you how to present yourself to a superior. He also said that he started the rounds after coming into that district.\nTo the question \"Did you have the opportunity to apply this training ?\", the claimant answered: \"Once or twice I went, it could have been in XXXXX 1998; they tell you how to go around this gathering, how to place your men around \". Then, he confirmed that twice in XXXXX 1998 he applied this training consisting in leading police forces.\nHe also gave the example when he was sent three times to keep the peace with the reserve, while people were raising slogans: he was in charge of twenty people.\nThe claimant was asked how many constables he had under his command, as a trainee. He replied that it depended on the ratio of crimes. He gave as an example: \"You may have two constables and three to four assistant sub-inspectors, you can also ask for more constables\".\nTo the question, \"Why is your training so long ?\", the claimant answered: \"You are appointed in any district under an experienced supervisor, an Inspector, who tells you how to do prosecution, FIR, daily routine, reports\".\nThe tribunal concludes that although a trainee, the claimant maintained a position of authority, having constables under his command.\n4. Knowledge of the atrocities\nThe claimant admitted during his testimony that he knew that the police were committing Human Rights Violations.\nThe claimant confirmed documentary evidence according to which there are many \"encounters\" between common-law criminals and police. The claimant admitted that it was happening within the jurisdiction of the police station where he was working. The claimant testified that the policemen \"just pick up the criminals, let them free and shoot them\". He added: \"The policemen kill them, of course\".\nThe claimant was asked when was the first time he heard about that. He replied: \"I do not remember the date, it was during the \"D\" course, when I came to the police station, between XXXXX 1999 and XXXXX 1999\". He said that it happened only once and that he did not have the exact figure, as to how many were killed during that \"encounter\". Then he said: \"three people were killed\".\nThe claimant acknowledged that innocent people as well could be victims in these encounters, but that he did not \"observe\" it happened with \"political people\".\nThe claimant was asked how he could justify staying in the police if they are killing people in his own police district. He replied that his ambition was to do something at his level, that he could not do anything about \"them\". He further testified that the Senior House Officer (SHO) was the person in charge of those \"encounters\" or he would appoint someone else who is reliable to him.\nThen, the claimant said: \"Police in our country do not care about anyone, they can kill anyone; police are part of the army, they do not care\".\nThe claimant admitted that he had seen his colleagues beating a person who was under arrest. He added: \"We have the worst police in the world\". He admitted that he attended \"harsh interrogations\" where they beat the accused many times, that it is a daily routine, and he added that the whole world knows about the behaviour of the Pakistani police, \"the interrogation is just to persecute\".\nHe was asked whether the reputation of the police changed during the year, between XXXXX 1997 and XXXXX 1998. The claimant replied that the police's reputation did not change and that it was ill-reputed. He added that he heard of a lot of Human Rights violations, but he continued because: \"My ambition was to perform my role with honesty. I am an honest person. If people come to me I can provide justice and honesty\".\nThe claimant testified that in XXXXX 1999, he was warned by his superiors that he should \"hide the truth\" and be part of the \"system as it is going on already\", in other words, that he should not be \"soft\". He added that during the \"D\" course, he was reminded it from time to time, but that he did not think of leaving the police at that time, because he was \"completely committed\".\nThe claimant was confronted with Exhibit A-713 (US Country Report, page 5, paragraph c: torture...) to the effect that police are still torturing people:\n\"Police personnel continued to torture persons in custody throughout the country. A newspaper reported that there were 80 cases of torture in police custody in Lahore\".\nWe conclude that the claimant admitted knowing about the atrocities and being present many times.\n5. Opportunity to leave the organization\nThe claimant testified that he decided to leave Pakistan in XXXXX 1999, but that he only left in XXXXX 1999. He continued to work for the police until his departure. He did not resign from his job because he thought that \"if things are normal again, he could do his job again\". He added that he was not dismissed from the police.\nWe conclude that the claimant was free to leave the police but chose to remain in the police force until his departure from Pakistan.\n6. Length of time in the organization\nThe claimant testified that he worked for the police from XXXXX 1997 until XXXXX XXXXX 1999, for approximately two years and four months.\nHe started in XXXXX.\nAccording to jurisprudence14, there are serious reasons to believe that the claimant was an accomplice in the perpetration of crimes against humanity.\nThe same acts that constitute crimes against humanity under Section 1F(a) are also found to be contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations pursuant to Section 1F(c).\nWe conclude that the claimant is excluded from the definition, under Section 1F (a) and (c).\nII INCLUSION\nFurthermore, after carefully reviewing all the evidence, both oral and documentary, the tribunal has reached the conclusion that the claimant is not a \"Convention refugee\" nor a \"person in need of protection\" for the following reasons.\nWe found the claimant's testimony not to be credible. Omissions and inconsistencies on essential elements of his claim led us not to believe the claimant's allegations of persecution.\nWe do not believe that the claimant was attacked in XXXXX 1999.\nThe claimant testified that he was badly beaten in XXXXX 1999, he was bleeding from the nose and had a swollen face, he had to stay seven days in hospital, at the XXXXX Medical Centre, in XXXXX.\nThe claimant was first confronted with the fact that in the medical certificate, dated XXXXX, 1999, filed under Exhibit P-615, there is no mention of hospitalization. The claimant replied: \"I got this certificate from them, I do not have a discharge certificate\". This answer does not explain the discrepancy between the certificate, in which medication only is prescribed, and his testimony. For these reasons, we do not ascribe any probative value to this medical certificate, nor to the FIR filed by the claimant (Exhibit P-716) which refers to a medical report dated XXXXX, 1999.\nThe claimant was also confronted with the fact that the date of this alleged incident is omitted in his PIF. He did not give a reasonable explanation for this omission. He only said that he got the help of someone. For all these reasons, the tribunal does not believe that this alleged incident occurred.\nIn addition, the claimant testified that he decided to leave Pakistan in XXXXX 1999, but that he only left in XXXXX 1999, and continued to work for the police until his departure. This behaviour shows a lack of subjective fear.\nHe further testified that on XXXXX, 1999 he went to the USA, where he stayed eleven months until XXXXX, 2000, as confirmed by his passport.\nHe did not claim refugee status in the USA because he said that he did not know the word refugee.\nThe claimant testified that he returned to Pakistan in XXXXX 2000, he alleged that his father was sick and that he wanted to see whether the \"circumstances were good\" after the army coup.\nHe testified that he was in hiding when he arrived in Pakistan \"because he had to take precaution\". This is omitted in his PIF. He said that he was living at his uncle's place, in a village, 25 kms away from his father's house, he would drive his uncle's car to go and visit his father. He also said that when they tried to shoot him and his friend, in XXXXX 2001, they were going to his friend's home in his friend's car. The claimant was confronted with the fact that going around in a car in public places is inconsistent with being in hiding. He replied that he was not as free as in the USA, which is not an explanation. Therefore, we do not believe that the claimant was in hiding.\nWe also do not believe that the claimant was attacked while in his friend's car on XXXXX, 2001.\nFirst, because the claimant filed as Exhibit P-817, a FIR, dated XXXXX, 2001 to which we cannot give any probative value since it refers to the alleged incident \"about a year and a half ago\", described in the FIR dated XXXXX, 1999 (Exhibit P-7) which we did not believe happened.\nIn addition, \"prima facie\" this document dated XXXXX, 2001 (Exhibit P-8) contradicts the allegation that the claimant was not working in the police since XXXXX, 1999 because it reads: \"I am resident of the above said address and serving as XXXXX XXXXX in Police Department\".\nFurthermore, when confronted as to whether he had any proof of this incident, the claimant said that he did not think it was important to file a receipt of the repairs of the damaged car.\nThe claimant left for the USA a second time on XXXXX, 2001.\nHe did not claim refugee status either this time. He said that he had no job, he did not know anybody and a lawyer would have cost him 5000 to 6000 US$. His lawyer asked him whether there were other reasons. The claimant then said that he was told that it was hard to get refugee status in the USA and that many people were living there without status.\nThe claimant added that after September 11, 2001, he became very scared, but he did not inquire from the US Immigration authorities; eventhough he had a visa valid until XXXXX XXXXX, 2001 and, therefore, was legal. He said that it was his mistake.\nThe claimant was asked why it took him more that a year to come to Canada and ask refugee status. He replied that he thought that with the passage of time things will get better.\nThe tribunal is of the opinion that the claimant's behaviour shows a lack of subjective fear.\nThe claimant did not establish, should he return to Pakistan that he would have a \"reasonable chance\" of being persecuted, in the words of Adjei18, nor that he would face a risk of torture or a risk to his life, or of cruel and unusual punishment or treatment, because we did not believe his story of persecution.\nCONCLUSION\nFor these reasons, we find that the claimant, XXXXX XXXXX is not a \"Convention refugee\", nor is he a \"person in need of protection\", as defined in Section 9619 and 9720(1) a) or b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nThe claimant is excluded from the definition under Section 1F (a) and (c).\nDominique Leclercq\nDominique Leclercq\nApril 15th, 2004\nDate\n\/gl\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - POLITICAL OPINION - PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP - EXCLUSION CLAUSES - ART. 1F(a) - CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY - ART. 1F(c) - ACTS CONTRARY TO THE PURPOSES AND PRINCIPLES OF THE UNITED NATIONS - ACCOMPLICES - MALE - NEGATIVE - PAKISTAN\n1 Exhibit A-11: Passport seized by CIC.\n2 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C.

Because of this XXXXX, highly valued by President Biya, the claimant became a preferred XXXXX on all youth-related issues and, as a result, Biya appointed him as a XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX committee of the party in power, the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM).\nFrom then on, the claimant was given a great deal of responsibility and was involved in very complex missions, crowned by his appointment as XXXXX XXXXX of President Biya Youth (PRESBY). Unfortunately, over time, this organization, which had been established to promote socio-political mentoring for young people to prepare them to take over, became an instrument of political propaganda aimed at the electoral fringes to benefit the authorities.\nThis ambiguous situation and the government's false promises had negative consequences for the claimant and his family, including physical and mental abuse. The claimant, feeling threatened, had requested a meeting with President Biya, but was unsuccessful. Following this, certain that the President of the Republic had literally used him for his own purposes, the claimant decided in XXXXX 2003to resign from his position.\nTaking advantage of a mission that was to be held in the United States, the claimant left his country for the United States, where he arrived on XXXXX, 2003. After a stay in the United States, he arrived in Canada on April 1 and sought Canadian protection two days later.\nLong before the hearing, the Solicitor General expressed his intention to intervene in this case, since sections F(a) and F(c) of Article 1 of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees potentially applied to the claimant.\nANALYSIS\nIn his submissions, the Solicitor General argued that the claimant should be excluded under articles 1F(a) and (c) of the Convention because he had been XXXXX of President Biya Youth (PRESBY) until he left Cameroon and therefore had worked closely with the President of the Republic of Cameroon, Paul Biya, since 1996. The Solicitor General particularly emphasized the fact that there were serious reasons for considering that the claimant, by virtue of his position as XXXXX of PRESBY and his knowledge of the human rights abuses perpetrated by the authorities, should be considered an accomplice in their activities.\nPage 2 of Exhibit M-31 provides the following information about human rights violations:\nThe Government's human rights record remained poor, and it continued to commit numerous serious abuses. Citizens' ability to change their government remained limited. Security forces committed numerous unlawful killings and were responsible for disappearances. They also tortured, beat, and otherwise abused detainees and prisoners, generally with impunity. However, the Government prosecuted a few offenders. Prison conditions remained harsh and life threatening. Security forces continued to arrest and detain arbitrarily various opposition politicians, local human rights monitors, and other citizens, often holding them for prolonged periods, often without charges or a chance for trial and, at times, incommunicado.\nPage 1 of the same document states that:\nCameroon is a republic dominated by a strong presidency. Since the early years of independence, the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM) has remained in power. In 1997 CPDM leader Paul Biya won re-election as President in a vote boycotted by the three main opposition parties. ?...? the election generally was considered by observers not to be free and fair.\nExhibit M-102 describes the major violations committed by the Operational Command (OC), a special army unit set up by decree in 2000 by President Biya, with the mission of ensuring security in the province of Littoral. Page 3 of this document states that:\n[TRANSLATION]\nThe people of Douala very soon complained about the serious abuses committed by OC soldiers. Repeated disappearances were reported ?...?\nPage 6 of Exhibit M-113 states the following about the PRESBY:\n[TRANSLATION]\nRepression of the democratic movement was and still is going on. ?...? demonstrations and meetings organized by opposition parties are regularly prohibited, allegedly for radicalism. ?...? A demonstration organized by the Parliamentary Opposition on January 13, 2001 to protest against the NEO ?National Elections Observatory? and demand the establishment of the NIEC ?National Independent Electoral Commission? was harshly repressed, with the assistance of plain-clothes parallel police officers and the militias of PRESBY, a fascistic organization affiliated with the CPDM.\nExhibit M-144 confirms that the PRESBY organization was proposed and\/or is maintained by the government in power. Page 2 of this document states that:\n[TRANSLATION]\n?...? the power holders are launching \"Autod\u00e9fense\". The two movements are sowing terror in the Ngoa-Ekell\u00e9 area, leaving the students Ndam Soul\u00e9 and Djengou\u00e9 Collins high and dry. Their sponsors, who are still power hungry, arranged their \"exile\" or their conversion.\nSome are in the West, after passing through Burkina. The others are in President Biya Youth (PRESBY) today. This organization received official unction in November 1996, on the occasion of the 14th anniversary of President Biya's coming to power. It was believed that his militants had returned to civilian life when, in late 2000, they revealed themselves and, with punches, forcefully broke up the march on Etoudi Palace conducted by members of the Social Democratic Front (SDF) to present to Biya a memorandum on the Independent Electoral Commission.\nThe article headed \"Armed PRESBY Gang Attacks\", produced in Exhibit M-16 in a bundle,5 corroborates this violence perpetrated by the PRESBY. The article states as follows:\n?...? After hours of heated arguments with top level government officials, and after darkness descended on Yaound\u00e9, a gang of over 200 youths, allegedly belonging to the President Biya Youths, PRESBY, armed with pistols, attacked, leaving several injured. Over a dozen opposition militants were reportedly hospitalised.\nThis is also corroborated on page 20 of Exhibit M-18,6 which states that during French President Jacques Chirac's visit to Cameroon on January 13, 2001, a PRESBY group savagely and publicly attacked the opposition:\nAs another example of how the Government was trying to frighten and embarrass the opposition. Asonganyi and Che described events during the French President Jacques Chirac's visit to Cameroon in connection with the Franco-African summit in January 2001. During the parade in Yaound\u00e9 on 13 January 2001 before the summit, opposition politicians including the SDF had taken up positions like everyone else on the parade ground in the town centre. However, members of the so-called \"Presby group\", which had close ties with the Government, had infiltrated the SDF group. When Chirac's convoy passed by, members of the Presby group threw stones at the convoy, so that it looked as thought it was SDF politicians who were behind this action. The chauffeur and private secretary of the SDF Chairman, Jon Fru Ndi, were then openly attacked by the Presby group.\nFinally, page 3 of Exhibit M-127 states as follows:\n[TRANSLATION]\n?...? Paul Biya set up tribal militias and other heavily armed self-defence groups in an attempt to save his unpopular regime. These militias, which brought terror and death to university campuses and neighbourhoods in the capital city, would systematically attack members of certain communities, suspected of having close ties to the opposition. ?...?\nThese tribal militias are heavily funded by the authorities ?...? this is true for the Presby and Jachaby youths, who take their orders directly from the presidential palace.\nAccording to the Solicitor General, exclusion is particularly warranted since the claimant, as the XXXXX XXXXX of PRESBY, an association that defends Paul Biya's ideals, displayed tremendous tolerance with regard to the government in power, in order to derive advantages from it. In fact, he never resigned from his position, despite that government's bad reputation.\nAccording to his testimony, the claimant voluntarily joined the party in power, the CPDM, in 1996. Because of his outstanding work with young people, Biya appointed him as XXXXX of President Biya Youth in XXXXX 1996. This association was set up to establish a dialogue between the government and students on decisions involving student demands. As part of his duties, to which he devoted approximately 25 hours per week and through which he significantly increased student involvement, the claimant had numerous meetings with the Head of State and his representatives. His responsibilities as PRESBY XXXXX consisted of XXXXX the national office's activities, XXXXX members of the national committee, XXXXX and XXXXX internal and external conferences, XXXXX cultural activities, and XXXXX invitations from influential people in the party. In short, as he stated [translation] \"I went wherever there was a need.\".\nThe claimant added that he had travelled solely on his duty passport, a privilege granted to him by his government when they sent him abroad for the first time to France in 1999. He also conceded that some PRESBY members had committed certain acts of violence, but he downplayed these acts, describing them as isolated incidents that, according to him, had not been dictated by his management. He also mentioned that he was aware of the use of torture by Biya's government, which, according to him, was an oppressive, despotic government that would arrest opponents and opposition leaders. The claimant also added that this regime had been oppressive since independence in 1960. He stated that he had definitely noticed this oppression in 1997, saying:\n[TRANSLATION]\n?...? being myself a witness. I have to say that as of 1997 I noticed that there were a great many blunders, and I witnessed the arrest of XXXXX XXXXX.\nWhen asked to explain how he had witnessed this arrest, the claimant, throughout the hearing, tried to downplay his involvement and replied that he had learned about this arrest like all Cameroonians, i.e. in the newspapers. He also stated that he had never thought of dissociating himself from PRESBY because the students would not have looked favourably on this action. In addition, although he knew that the Biya regime was oppressive and murderous, he did not resign because, in his view, when a person decides to resign, he or she needs to have an alternative; and in his case, if he had resigned, he would have been called a subversive and a traitor. He added that his resignation would have been frowned on, either by the young people or by the authorities.\nIt should be noted that the claimant was first elected XXXXX of PRESBY in 1996 for a XXXXX -year term. He ran for XXXXX in 1998 and was re-elected for a XXXXX year term. When asked why he had run in 1998, he replied [translation] \"Didn't reach the objectives that had been set.\" In 2002, he again ran for XXXXX of PRESBY and was again re-elected. When again asked why he had run for the position of PRESBY XXXXX, he replied [translation] \"The work felt like a calling to me.\"\nThe law and case law\nArticles 1F(a) and (c) of the Convention, incorporated into Canadian law through section 98 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, which applies in this case, excludes the following persons from the \"Convention refugee\" definition:\nThe provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:\n(a) he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes;\n(b) ?...?\n(c) he has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\nIt is now well established by the case law that when a claimant is not identified as the perpetrator of a crime against peace or a crime against humanity, that claimant is still subject to the exclusion clause through complicity. In this regard, Linden J., in Sivakumar,8 summarized the concept of complicity as follows:\nIt is clear that if someone personally commits physical acts that amount to a war crime or a crime against humanity, that person is responsible. However, it is also possible to be liable for such crimes, to commit them as an accomplice, even though one has not personally done the acts amounting to the crime.\nMacGuigan J., in Ramirez,9 assessed the degree of complicity that could lead to the application of the exclusion clause. He stated as follows:\nClearly no one can commit international crimes without personal and knowing participation. What degree of complicity, then, is required to be an accomplice or abettor? A first conclusion I come to is that mere membership in an organization which from time to time commits international offences is not normally sufficient for exclusion from refugee status. ?...? however, where an organization is principally directed to a limited, brutal purpose, such as a secret police activity, mere membership may by necessity involve personal and knowing participation in persecutorial acts.\nNadon J., in Mohammad,10 listed the principles of the concept of complicity:\n1. A person who commits a crime must be held responsible therefor.\n2. A person may be responsible for a crime he or she did not personally commit, that is, as an accomplice.\n3. The starting point for the existence of complicity is personal and knowing participation by the person in question.\n?...?\n9. A person who continues to hold a leadership position in such an organization with full knowledge that the organization is responsible for crimes may be considered an accomplice.\n10. Evidence that the individual protested against the crime, tried to stop its commission or attempted to withdraw from the organization must be taken into consideration in determining whether he or she is responsible.\nIn the case before us, it is clear that the claimant voluntarily joined President Biya's party and worked very closely with him. In 1996, the claimant was elected XXXXX of PRESBY. Despite his full knowledge of the Biya government's practice of torture and the acts committed by his association, PRESBY, he ran for XXXXX twice following his first term as XXXXX and was re-elected each time. He never tried to dissociate himself from PRESBY and did not resign from his position as XXXXX.\nAdmittedly, following the first sitting of his hearing, when the possibility of exclusion was raised, the claimant tried to downplay the significance of his position as PRESBY XXXXX and his duties, as well as his cooperation and meetings with President Biya. Unfortunately, he has failed to convince the panel, since all the evidence submitted clearly demonstrates his close cooperation and his complicity with Paul Biya.\nIn light of the case law and considering the evidence on the record, the panel is of the opinion that, in this case, the Solicitor General's representative has discharged his burden of proof and that, consequently, there are serious reasons for considering that the claimant committed crimes against humanity or was complicit in such crimes.\nCONCLUSION\nTherefore, the panel determines that the claimant is excluded from the application of the Convention, pursuant to Articles 1F(a) and (c) and cannot be granted protection in Canada, as set out in section 98 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nAnna-Maria Silvestri\nMe Anna-Maria Silvestri\nNovember 3, 2004\nDate\nKEYWORDS: REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - POLITICAL OPINION - EXCLUSION - PARAGRAPHS 1Fa) AND 1Fc) - COMPLICITY - CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY - NEGATIVE - CAMEROON\n1 Exhibit M-3: Country Report on Human Rights Practices - 2002, Cameroon.\n2 Exhibit M-10: International Federation of Human Rights, Cameroun : Peur au ventre et chape de plomb [Cameroon: The fear inside and the cloak of lead].\n3 Exhibit M-11: Social Democratic Front, Demande de bons offices de la France pour l'av\u00e8nement de la d\u00e9mocratie avec des \u00e9lections libres, honn\u00eates et transparentes au Cameroun [Request for the good offices of France to bring democracy through free, honest and transparent elections in Cameroon].\n4 Exhibit M-14: Le Messager, Rompre avec la fatalit\u00e9 de la violence [Breaking with a destiny of violence].\n5 Exhibit M-16: Documents siezed at the port of entry.\n6 Exhibit M-18: Danish Immigration Service, Fact-finding mission to Cameroon - 2001.\n7 Exhibit M-12: Ambazonia.Indymedia, Une bombe qui peut exploser \u00e0 tout moment [A bomb ready to explode] - 2003.\n8 Sivakumar v.

Also claiming with them are the sons of Mrs XXXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, as well as her mother, Mrs XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX. Finally, Mrs XXXXXXXX nephew, Mr XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, is also claiming asylum with them. All of the claimants are citizens of Costa Rica, and avail themselves of articles 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nAt the beginning of the hearing, Mrs XXXXX was appointed designated representative for her minor children XXXXX , XXXXX and XXXXX.\nFACTS\nThe facts can be summarized as follows.\nThe principal claimant, Mr XXXXXXXXXXXX was a XXXXX in his country, Costa Rica.\nIn XXXXX 2001, he was sent to a XXXXX station of \"XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX\", in the province of San Jose. This place was known for its high level of delinquency, drugs, killings, firearms and clandestine alcohol.\nA lot of persons in this place come from Nicaragua and Colombia.\nOn XXXXX 2002, the claimant and other XXXXX caught a group of people involved in arm trafficking and drugs. One of the persons interrogated mentioned the name of XXXXX XXXXX, who is the XXXXX of the \"Comit\u00e9 du d\u00e9veloppement du secteur de la Carpio dans l'Uruca\". He would be a corrupted man, without any scruples.\nThe claimant would have come to the conclusion that there was a group of delinquents that was protected by some powerful people. Those delinquents could thus act without being punished.\nXXXXX XXXXX would have bought the silence of the principal claimant's bosses, due to his economic power.\nStarting in XXXXX 2002, the principal claimant would have started to suffer pressure, moral as well as economic. The claimant writes in his Personal Information Form (PIF): \" ...peu \u00e0 peu mes chefs m'ont fait \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 en m'\u00e9cartant de mon poste pour accomplir mes t\u00e2ches, de risques sans jamais \u00eatre inform\u00e9, en passant \u00e9galement sur toutes les lois du travail. Ceci co\u00efncide pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le m\u00eame jour, que j'ai donn\u00e9 toute l'information \u00e0 mes chefs imm\u00e9diats... \" (reproduced as is from paragraph 14 of the answer to question 41).\nHis bosses would have told him that the reason for that was the pressure of Mr XXXXX XXXXX, who had a lot of power.\nOn XXXXX 2002, the claimants received their first threatening phone call. The man calling said he was doing so on behalf of Mr. XXXXX XXXXX, and uttered death threats.\nThreatening phone calls continued, day and night. On XXXXX 2002, the principal claimant presented himself to make a denunciation to the \"Organisme d'Investigation Judicaire\" (OIJ). There, he would have been told that it was impossible to do anything to protect him, if the claimant had no proof.\nAfter that, the phone calls continued, but the people against the claimant and his family also threw stones at their house and broke the windows.\nIn XXXXX 2002 the principal claimant was transferred to another sector, less dangerous.\nEverything was going much better, but the claimant was transferred back again to his former place of work, where he had had so many problems.\nAt this place Mr XXXXX XXXXX and many persons came to threaten him in person and to tell him he would make the claimant and his family disappear.\nThere would have been also people watching the claimants' house and work places.\nOn XXXXX 2003, three men would have brutally attacked the principal claimant, asking him not to say anything to the police. They also would have told him to leave the country, with his family, if he wanted to continue to live.\nThe last warning would have been given on XXXXX 2003. Some people came in the claimants' house, destroying a lot of things and leaving a note saying: \"aujourd'hui c'est le mat\u00e9riel mais demain il pourrait \u00eatre vos vies qui vont dispara\u00eetre\" (reproduit tel quel du paragraphe 25 de la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question 41).\nAfter this last incident, the claimants decided to leave their country, some members of the family arriving before other members of the same family in Canada.\nAll the claimants base their claims on the same facts related by the main claimant. However, some of them add some new facts, but those facts are all related to the main narrative of Mr XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX.\nANALYSIS\nAfter having analyzed all of the evidence, testimonial as well as documentary, we are of the opinion that all the claimants are not \"Convention Refugees\"1 nor are they \"persons in need of protection\"2 and this, for the following reasons.\nThe main question in this case is one of protection. The principal claimant said he asked protection only once to the OIJ, but this organism would have told him that he needed sufficient proof. This is all what he did. We are aware that the principal claimant is a policeman, but we do not think that he has discharged the onus of showing clear and convincing proof of the state's inability or unwillingness to protect him.\nWe confronted the principal claimant with exhibit A-2, which is a jurisprudential guideline done in accordance with article 159 (1) (h) of the Law (Immigration and Refugee Protection Act). This article reads as follows:\n\" 159. (1) The Chairperson is, by virtue of holding that office, a member of each Division of the Board and is the chief executive officer of the Board. In that capacity, the Chairperson\nh )may issue guidelines in writing to members of the Board and identify decisions of the Board as jurisprudential guides, after consulting with the Deputy Chairpersons and the Director General of the Immigration Division, to assist members in carrying out their duties;\"\nTherefore the President identified the decision of the Board that was written by Mrs Schlanger as a jurisprudential guide. This is what is deposited under exhibit A-2. In this decision, which makes a review of different documents relating to state protection in Costa Rica, we can read the following extracts:\n\"...There are a number of recourses available in Costa Rica for the assessment, prosecution and granting of remedies resulting from failure of law enforcement agencies to conduct their work...if police misconduct or abuse occurs, an effective mechanism for lodging complaints exists through the Ombudsman's Office, which serves as a recourse to citizens who have complaints about violations of their civil and human rights, and about deficiencies in public and private infrastructures. It investigates complaints, and when appropriate, initiates suits against officials. ...The law provides for the functional, administrative, and judicial independence of the Ombudsman's Office. Furthermore, the Constitution provides for the right to a fair trail, and an independent judiciary vigorously enforces this right...\n....The documentary evidence also indicates that the Judicial Investigative Police (OIJ), which has a 20 member anti-gang division, is currently in the process of investigating the numerous San Jos\u00e9 youth gangs and has profiled the alleged gang leaders....\n...The extensive account of prosecution of crimes in the various courts in Heredia, and the resulting sentences indicate that criminals in Costa Rica are being punished. The panel finds that all the above0-cited documentary evidence indicates that Costa Rica is making serious efforts to protect its citizens who are victims of crime.\n...Given that Costa Rica is a longstanding stable, constitutional democracy, with an independent judiciary providing effective means to deal with individual instances of abuse, the claimant bears the onus of establishing that state protection would not be available. The claimant must do more than simply show that he went to some members of the police force and that his efforts were unsuccessful. The more democratic the state's institutions, the more the claimant must have done to exhaust all the courses of action open to him....\"\nThere is also a mention in this jurisprudential guide of government organisms dealing with drug dealers where one could ask protection.\nThe panel finds that the claimants have not discharged the onus of showing clear and convincing proof of the state's inability or unwillingness to protect him. The main claimant asked for protection only once, to the OIJ. The people at this organism told him they needed proof. The claimant wrote in his PIF that \"la loi au Costa Rica ne permet pas comme prouve aucun enregistrement t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, et dans autre sens il n'existe pas non plus de lois qui permettent d'interf\u00e9rer un appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique.... (reproduced as is from paragraph 18 answer of question 41) With respect for his opinion, we never heard that before, even though we heard a lot of cases from Costa Rica. The claimant did not present documentary evidence on this point either. On the contrary, his counsel, in his submissions on page 10, referred the Panel to an information request dated October 25, 2000 and bearing the number CR135539, in which we can see that wiretapping is allowed: \"when cased of witnesses requiring protection reach the Public Ministry, the measures at its disposal have been to request wiretaps to locate the source of the telephone threats....\" (p. 10 of his submissions). The claimant also had other chances to go back to OIJ to present evidence: at the end of XXXXX 2002, there were stones that were thrown at his house, the windows were broken. He could have called the authorities to come and have a look at his house, to make an inquiry, try to find some fingerprints, etc. Also, on XXXXX, 2003, they received a threatening note. He never went back either to the OIJ to present this note.\nHe told us there was not other organisms in Costa Rica that could have helped him. The only place, according to him, was the OIJ. Invited to tell us if he could have gone to the Ombudsman, he answered to us that \"the Ombudsman only takes care of business issues\". We then told him it was not what was written in exhibit A-2, even reading to him the part where it says that one can go to the Ombudsman to complain when one is not satisfied with police work. The principal claimant answered: \"you have that, but in reality it is not like this\". He also added that democracy in Costa Rica is just on paper, and that as a policeman it was very hard to be protected.\nThe claimant XXXXX told us that he went also once to the OIJ, on XXXXX 2003. He went to report a threatening phone call. He was asked why did he go to the same organism as the main claimant, since he already knew that this organism did not help when the main claimant went to report the same thing, i.e. threatening phone call. XXXXX answered: \"I thought they would take it seriously, because we are from the same family, it is the same issues\". He did not show us with this that the State was unable or unwilling to protect him.\nWe may also infer from the testimony given by the main claimant that there exists protection in his country. Indeed, he said that he did not report anywhere the XXXXX incident \"because if I report this to the police they were going to kill us, even me, being a XXXXX\". He writes in his PIF, paragraph 15 of his answer to question 41, that he was warned not to say anything to the police, after this incident of XXXXX. If the Costa Rican police and authorities were so inefficient or unable to protect its citizens, why would those people who were after the claimants tell them not to report anything? Why would the claimant say in his testimony that if he reported this incident to the police, \"they were going to kill us\"? It is very plausible to think that those people who were after the claimants were AFRAID of the authorities, that is why they did not want the claimants to address themselves to the authorities. We presented our point of view to the main claimant who simply answered the following: \"I do not know about other people's fears, I just know about mine\".\nWe also consulted carefully exhibit A-1, which is the \"cartable regional de Montr\u00e9al ao\u00fbt 2003\". The documents inserted in this cartable all talk about Costa Rica as being a democratic country, where effective means of dealing with its citizens' problems exist.\nWe also read very carefully the written submissions that were sent by the claimants' counsel. We want to comment some of his allegations before the conclusion of our decision. The counsel refers to two exhibits, P-12 and P-35. The counsel makes a very general conclusion, based on two very specific cases. He writes in his submissions: \"The above two articles describe a country that is not interested in pursuing justice\". This, according to us, is too much of a general statement concerning two very specific cases. Also, he mentions a decision bearing the number CRI 138217. E, dated January 22, 2002, containing an attachment, that is, an article from the Tico Times. The counsel quoted certain extracts out of context. The article talks about \"rampant petty crime\", which is not the case in the main claimant's narrative. The claimant talks about a Mr. XXXXX XXXXX, being very important and influent economically and who has a lot of contacts. We are not talking here about \"petty crime\".\nAgain, when the counsel quotes the president Abel Pacheco, from the document produced under P-36, he does it out of context. The President expresses himself about the murder of a young girl, who was 11 years old at the time, by a neighbour who was obsessed with her. She was beheaded. We therefore understand fully the comments of the President, when he says: \"Je ne suis pas g\u00ean\u00e9 de dire que ce dernier horreur m'a boulevers\u00e9. Le Costa Rica est malade. Nous sommes des victimes d'une violence sans limite honteuse et se dirige contre les plus faibles \" (reproduced as is from the translation of P-36). We were very surprised to read the claimant's counsels' submissions when he twisted the facts to says the following : \"At Exhibit P-36, we read that the president Abel Pacheco describes Costa Rica, not as a democratic country replete with an effective police force and a judiciary system, no; such remarks are reserved for the department of the Immigration Canada and those responsible for drafting the guidelines on Costa Rica...\". The comments of the President were made in relation to that particular incident, which indeed is terrible. He was not at all commenting on the police force and judiciary system of his country, and the same comment could have been made by any President of any country where such a barbarian act would have taken place. We will not quote and comment on all of the claimants' counsel's submissions. Suffice us to say that we did not find in the counsel's submissions any documents or arguments that would have made us think that the State of Costa Rica was unable or unwilling to protect the claimants.\nAs the panel therefore finds that there is adequate state protection available to the claimants in Costa Rica, it determines that they are not \"persons in need of protection\".\nBefore concluding, we want to add that we are satisfied with claimants' identities, since a copy of their passports is deposited in our file.\nCONCLUSION\nFor all those reasons, we therefore conclude that the claimants are not \"Convention refugees\", nor are they \"persons in need of protection\".\nConsequently, their claim for asylum in Canada is denied.\nSylvie L\u00e9vesque\nMe Sylvie L\u00e9vesque\nMay 28, 2004\nDate\nrc\n1 \" 96.

She took courses at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al from XXXXX 2000 to XXXXX 2001.\nA citizen of Burkina Faso, the claimant alleged that she could not return to her country because she would be forced to do military service. She also alleged that she cannot live in the Ivory Coast, where she grew up, because of the xenophobia problems there. Finally, she alleged that she cannot live in Senegal because she was discriminated against there in various ways because of her Burkinan origins and also that she cannot return to live in that country because of her Christian religion.\nANALYSIS\nThe Refugee Protection Division (RPD) determines from a review of all the evidence that this claim should not be allowed, since the evidence adduced by the claimant is insufficient to establish that she is a person referred to in section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Act.\nThe claimant's identity has been established by her testimony and by various documents relating to her Burkinan citizenship. The claimant has also established that she lived in the Ivory Coast and studied in Senegal for several years.\nThe panel determines that the claimant, who took residence in Senegal, could live in that country. The panel refers to document SEN35851.F,3 dated November 2, 2000, which stated:\n[Translation]\nNationals of countries that are members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) automatically receive permanent residence in Senegal pursuant to an agreement entered into by the ECOWAS member countries.\nAccording to the ECOWAS Website, the countries that belong to that organization are: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, the Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo.\nThe panel has made a negative determination based on section E of Article 1 of the 1951 Convention, which is worded as follows:\nThis Convention shall not apply to a person who is recognized by the competent authorities of the country in which he has taken residence as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of the nationality of that country.\nIn light of the evidence as a whole, the panel determines that XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX cannot be considered to be in need of international protection, since she is accepted in Senegal, where she can have most of the rights normally attached to the possession of the nationality of that country. The claimant resided in Senegal for several years. From 1983 to 1989, she went to elementary school in Dakar, Senegal; from 1989 to 1996, she attended secondary school in Dakar; and from 1996 to 1998, she studied at the University of Dakar, where she obtained a degree as a XXXXX XXXXX. In August and September 1997, she worked as a XXXXX XXXXX; and from November 1998 to July 1999, she worked at the XXXXX of Dakar as a XXXXX assistant. In actual fact, she left Senegal because she had obtained a grant to come and study at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. The claimant studied in Senegal, took residence there and resided there on an ongoing basis. It was not a mere stay.\nMoreover, the claimant has not satisfied the panel that she is a person referred to in section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Act.\nThe claimant made conflicting statements.\nIn her first narrative in the Personal Information Form (PIF), the claimant stated that she had left Senegal because of the unrest there. She also stated that life in Canada was pleasant and that she appreciated the kindness of Canadians; these were the reasons she gave for not wanting to return to Senegal.\nAt the hearing, the claimant stated that she could not return to Senegal because she had been discriminated against there during her studies and had not had an opportunity to study. When the panel pointed out to her that she had nevertheless studied and even gone to university there for several years, the claimant said that she had not had an opportunity to do her master's degree and that there was systematic discrimination against people from foreign countries. Once again, the panel is surprised, since the university she attended is recognized as a place where people from a number of African countries study. Moreover, the claimant was privileged compared with other students, since she even worked as a research assistant during her time in university.\nThe claimant then added some information she had allegedly left out of her two pieces of written evidence, namely that she had worked as a Jehovah's Witness and had been persecuted in Senegal because of this. The panel does not believe this story, since, based on its assessment of all the evidence, the claimant added these facts for the purposes of her hearing. In her PIF, this is an amendment made much later, since this information was omitted from the first and second narratives. The claimant's explanations have not convinced the panel, since these are significant omissions concerning essential facts.\nAn analysis of all the evidence does not make it possible to establish or determine that the claimant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. The claim of XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX is therefore rejected. Moreover, she must be excluded from the definition of refugee, pursuant to section E of Article 1 of the 1951 Convention.\nJoulekhan Pirbay\nJoulekhan Pirbay\nFebruary 25, 2004\nDate\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - CREDIBILITY - COUNTRY OF HABITUAL RESIDENCE - EXCLUSION - ART. 1E - DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE - NEGATIVE - BURKINA FASO\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, reads in part as follows:\n96.

He claims to be a citizen of India. He stated that he left his country on XXXXX, 2003 to come to Canada. He has made a claim for refugee protection in two parts. First, he claims to have a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of his imputed political opinion. Second, he claims to be a person in need of protection under section 97(1)(a) and (b) of the Act.\nALLEGED FACTS\nIn support of his claim, the claimant alleged the following.\nIn his country, he lived in the city of Bathinda, where he began working with his father in his father's XXXXX company in 1999. He later became a partner in this company.\nOn XXXXX, 2002, one of the company's XXXXX was stopped by the police who, after conducting a check, arrested two passengers, who were terrorists, as well as the driver. The police accused the driver of transporting terrorists and weapons. He was tortured.\nOn XXXXX, 2002, the police went to the company's offices and arrested the claimant. He was tortured but released two days later after being questioned about the terrorists.\nOn XXXXX, 2003, the police again raided the company's offices, stating that they had found a bag containing explosives in one of the XXXXX. The claimant was arrested and tortured and accused of possessing explosives. He was released three days later. He was then told to report to the police station on XXXXX, 2003 to give information about the terrorists.\nAfraid of being tortured again, the claimant left his home on XXXXX, 2003 and went to his uncle's home in the city of XXXXX in the state of Haryana. When he did not report to the station on XXXXX, 2003, the police raided his home and arrested his father. The next day, the claimant's uncle learned of this and made the claimant leave his home to go live with a friend. From there, the claimant travelled to Delhi, where he made arrangements with a smuggler, who obtained a visitor visa for him and helped him leave his country to come to Canada.\nANALYSIS\nAfter analysing all the evidence, both testimonial and documentary, I have determined that the claimant is neither a refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nIdentity\nI examined the exhibits in the record, in particular the photocopy of the claimant's passport (Exhibit R-20) and his driver's licence (Exhibit R-2), and I am satisfied as to his identity.\nCredibility and basis of the claim\nThe claimant had a great deal of difficulty giving direct answers to the questions he was asked, and I had to intervene more than once to remind him of the question and to point out to him that he must first answer the question before entering into explanations, which, very often, explained nothing. I question his testimony on these points.\nWith regard to the basis of the claim, I must note that the story contains such major contradictions and inconsistencies that it cannot be true.\nFirst, with regard to his fear of returning, the claimant stated that he was afraid to go back to his country because he would risk being killed by the Indian police, who have considered him a terrorist since XXXXX, 2002, when he was first arrested. I have difficulty believing the claimant on this point because if the police had indeed accused him of being a terrorist, it is not unreasonable to think that they would not have arrested him on XXXXX, 2002, then released him two days later, then arrested him again on XXXXX, 2003 and tortured him, then released him again three days later - particularly since the claimant stated that when the police arrested him the second time, they claimed to have found a bag of explosives in one of the XXXXX they searched at that time. The police would surely have charged him formally and brought the case to court.\nMoreover, there is cause to wonder about the arrests and torture the claimant claims to have endured in his country. In his Personal Information Form (PIF) signed July 23, 2003 and in his testimony, he stated that he had been arrested and tortured on XXXXX, 2002 and on XXXXX, 2003. However, during an interview with an immigration officer (see the officer's notes filed with the immigration documents as Exhibit A-2), at question 51, he was asked whether he had ever been detained by the police or military forces in another country, and he answered yes, stating that he had been arrested in his country on XXXXX, 2002. When questioned about this discrepancy regarding the date, he stated that it was an error because what he had said was XXXXX, 2002, not XXXXX, which is not impossible. However, with regard to the fact that he had mentioned only the arrest of XXXXX 2002, the claimant was caught off guard and gave a number of explanations, each of which contradicted the others. He first stated that he had been asked only about the most recent arrest. This explanation does not hold because, according to his account, his most recent arrest occurred on XXXXX, 2003. Realizing that this explanation did not work, he then stated that when he was questioned on June 27, 2003, he had simply been asked on what date he had been arrested by the police and he had stated XXXXX, 2002. This explanation does not hold because according to his PIF, he had been arrested not once, but twice. When I pointed this out, he provided another explanation, stating that he had been asked when he had been arrested for the first time. With this final explanation, the claimant was obviously altering his testimony to get himself out of the predicament since question 51, which he had to answer, reads as follows: \"Have you ever been detained by the police or the military force in any given country?\" The question is not at all debatable. As I have said, the claimant was simply trying to get out of a difficult situation.\nStill along the same lines, it should be noted that during this interview, the claimant failed to mention not only that he had been arrested twice, but also that he had been tortured. This can be seen fairly clearly in his response to question 55, when he was asked if he had anything else to add. He spoke of the reasons he was afraid to return to his country, but made no mention of having been tortured. When questioned on this subject, he stated that he had been told to write something brief. I reject this explanation, as the claimant's response extends to four lines. As I pointed out to the claimant, it is clear that if he had wanted to write that he had been tortured, there was plenty of space in which to do so. Therefore, I do not at all believe the claimant on this point.\nFurthermore, in another document that he completed himself and signed with his own interpreter (the document entitled \"Schedule 1\", filed with the immigration documents as Exhibit A-2), in response to question 4J asking whether he had been detained or imprisoned, he answered yes; however, at the sub-question asking for details about his detention(s), he made no mention of the two arrests or of having been tortured. In explanation, he stated that this may be an error because he was simply asked whether he had been detained by the police and he had answered \"yes\". I reject this explanation because although it is true that he answered \"yes\" to the question regarding detention, he also gave a response to the sub-question requesting details but did not, as mentioned above, refer to having been tortured. This leads me to believe that the claimant was never arrested or tortured as he claims and that his story was simply invented for the purpose of his claim for refugee protection.\nIn her arguments, counsel for the claimant pointed out that the interview notes were not retranslated for the claimant and that we do not know in what form the questions were asked or what the claimant's exact response was, therefore suggesting that the notes may contain errors. I reject this argument for more than one reason. First, those documents were disclosed to the claimant well before the hearing. If he had noticed errors or inaccuracies as he claims, he was free to have the interpreter, the immigration officer or both summoned to testify in order to re-establish the facts, but he did not feel it necessary to do so. Second, in this particular case, the officer's notes are in English. The claimant was therefore able to understand them without an interpreter: at question 11 on his PIF, he stated that he spoke Punjabi, and at question 12 asking \"What other languages or dialects do you speak and understand?\", he answered \"English\". Further, at the end of his PIF, after signing the document, he signed the statement reading: \"I declare that I am able to read English and that I fully understand the entire content of this form.\" This means that the claimant acknowledges that he speaks and understands English. Therefore, if he had noticed errors as he claims, he could have made this known well before arriving at the hearing. I therefore reject this argument.\nIn addition, the claimant stated that his family had had to move because of the situation, leaving Bathinda to settle in Barnala as of XXXXX, 2003. However, he produced a series of documents contradicting this statement. He filed Exhibit R-10, allegedly an affidavit from his father confirming that he had indeed been arrested and tortured. However, in this document, dated February 25, 2004, his father states that he lives in Bathinda. When confronted about this, the claimant stated that his father had gone to Bathinda only to prepare this document. This explanation does not hold because, as I have already indicated, the father states that he is living in Bathinda. The claimant then gave another explanation, stating that his father had written Bathinda because they have a house in that city. I reject this explanation as well because the issue was not whether the family owned a house in Bathinda but whether they live there. Therefore, on this point, Exhibit R-10 contradicts the claimant.\nIt should be noted that the claimant produced a number of documents in support of his claim, in particular Exhibit R-10 and another affidavit (also filed under R-10) from a municipal councillor in Bathinda. I attach no probative value to this document since it only repeats the claimant's story, which I have already stated is not credible.\nThat being said, I find that the claimant has not established that there is a reasonable chance that he would be persecuted should he return to his country. With regard to section 97(1)(a) and (b) of the Act, it should be noted that the claimant submitted no particular evidence on this point, confining himself to the story he related in his PIF, which I have already stated is not credible.\nDECISION\nConsequently, the Refugee Protection Division determines that XXXXX is not a refugee or a person in need of protection. I therefore reject his claim for refugee protection.\nYves Boisrond\nMe Yves Boisrond\nMarch 31, 2004\nDate\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - IMPUTED POLITICAL OPINION - CREDIBILITY - PORT-OF-ENTRY NOTES - MALE - NEGATIVE - INDIA\nNo. dossier SPR \/ RPD file #: MA3-04932\n5\n",

Counsel argued that the Board unilaterally decided to select claimants from certain countries to have their cases heard through videoconferencing from the Toronto office to Montreal. Counsel raised an objection on the constitutionality of videoconferencing. The required notice respected the RPD rule 48, and therefore, the Panel gave the appropriate time to Counsel to make written submissions as well as the representative from the Ministry of Justice to submit arguments. The panel then took the file under reserve and examined all arguments presented in order to rule on this objection.\nThe Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) has statutory duty to proceed informally quickly and fairly.\nSection 162 (2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) provides that \"Each Division shall deal with all proceedings before it as informally and quickly as the circumstances and considerations of fairness and justice permit\".\nThe claimants were present in the Toronto IRB office with their Counsel. The member and the interpreter are from the Montreal IRB. The Board has stated that the reason for proceeding in some cases by videoconferencing is the reduction of the Board's unprecedented backlog of cases in Toronto, and an increase in average processing times. The Board has had to use all means at its disposal and has had to find more effective ways to manage its national caseload. All three of the Immigration and Refugee Board's Divisions have experience in conducting their hearings by videoconferencing and have done so for a variety of reasons including operational necessity. The Board is therefore relying on its statutory authority to hear cases by videoconference and on the decision of the Federal Court in Gonzalez1 (2002, FCT-1229, November 28, 2002), which \"approved of the hearing of refugee claims by videoconference\". Videoconferencing is one of the tools put at the RPD disposal as per section 164 of the Act.\nGiven the backlog in files in Toronto, the Board chose selected files to be transferred by choosing specific countries, based on a number of factors, such as the number of claims in the Toronto inventory for a given country and the operational capacity of the receiving office to have those claims heard; familiarity of the receiving office with claims from the country concerned; the language associated with the country concerned, and the need for and availability of related interpreters in the receiving office, as well as the geographic teams in the Toronto office that had the highest inventories.\nThe Board member can decide that in exceptional circumstances, a videoconference can be unfair for unaccompanied minors, for the mentally incompetent, for detainees, and for other complex cases, such as ones requiring the presence of minister's counsel. However, in this particular case, there is no evidence that such exceptional circumstances exist. The panel therefore overrules Counsel's objections for the following reasons.\nThe RPD rule 59 (2)(f) obliges Counsel to provide a summary of legal arguments to be raised. The legal arguments presented by Counsel were related to discrimination based on nationality, section 15 of the Charter. Counsel argued that the claimants to be heard by videoconference are chosen by specific countries, and therefore on nationality, and although the Board states that this policy is based on neutral administrative factors without any intent to be discriminatory, the impact is discriminatory based on nationality.\nThe Panel believes that although selecting certain cases by nationality for videoconferencing may constitute differential treatment, it is not treatment which is discriminatory for the purposes of Section 15 (1) of the Charter as interpreted by Canadian courts. In the Andrews2 case, the Supreme Court of Canada held that not all distinctions or differential treatment in the law amount to discrimination. Discrimination may be described as a distinction, whether intentional or not, but based on grounds relating to personal characteristics of the individual or group, which has the effect on imposing burdens, obligations or disadvantages on such individual or group not imposed upon others, or which withholds or limits access to opportunities, benefits and advantages available to other members of society.\nCounsel's Charter argument is based on the idea that claimants coming from other countries who have hearings in person enjoy an advantage over claimants from those countries that are selected to proceed by videoconferencing. The panel refers to the Act which clearly indicates that both ways are allowed by statute and valid in the absence of exceptional circumstances as stated above and either way claimants receive a fair hearing without disadvantaging those that are heard by videoconferencing.\nThe Supreme Court, in the Law3 case, built upon Andrews and other cases that followed to articulate the proper approach to analyzing claims of discrimination under Section 15(1). Justice Iacobucci stated, \"It may be said that the purpose of Section 15(1) is to prevent the violation of essential human dignity and freedom through the imposition of and disadvantage of stereotyping or political or social prejudice, and to promote a society in which all persons enjoy equal recognition at law, as human beings, or as members of Canadian society, equally capable and equally deserving of concerned respect and consideration. Legislation which effects differential treatment between individuals or groups will violate this fundamental purpose, where those who are subject to differential treatment fall within one or more enumerated or analogous grounds, and where the differential treatment reflects the stereotypical application of presumed group or personal characteristics or otherwise has the effect of perpetuating or promoting the view that the individual is less capable or less worthy of recognition or value as a human being or as a member of Canadian society. Alternatively, differential treatment will not likely constitute discrimination within the purpose of Section 15(1), where it does not violate the human dignity or freedom of a person or group in this way...\"\nIt is the member's belief that videoconferencing, although it may constitute differential treatment, it is not treatment which is discriminatory under the Andrews test of disadvantage or the Law test, which adds the element of violating human dignity. Videoconferencing does not impose a burden or disadvantage on the people whose cases are heard by this means. Videoconferencing, although it is not identical to an in person hearing, does not disadvantage the claimant such that Section 15 of the Charter would be engaged. The claimant still has a full and fair hearing and there is no unfairness in selecting claims from a particular country to be heard by videoconferencing. The Board had to take into account the context of the overburdening caseload in Toronto that obliged them to select cases to be heard by means of videoconferencing. The reasonable person would also realize that the criteria used to choose which countries to transfer for hearing are similar to those used to allocate cases to teams. On a balance of probabilities, this would lead a reasonable person to conclude that although the selection was done on the basis of country of origin for administrative purposes, there is no reason to feel that his dignity as a national of a particular country was being demeaned.\nFurthermore, Canadian courts have determined that the requirements for procedural fairness are met and that a hearing by videoconference does not substantially differ from a hearing in person.\nThe videoconference procedure .... allows the witness to be brought electronically into the Court where the Court has the opportunity to hear and see the evidence as it is given and to control the evidentiary process while it is taking place. The witness is live before the Court and the Court is live before the witness. R. v. Dix (1998) 125 C.C.C. (3d) 377 (Alberta Court of Queen's Bench)\nThe evidence (by videoconference) had all the features of evidence given in court except for the actual presence of the witnesses (...). There was nothing about the manner in which the witnesses testified that suggested that the remote location of the Court and the mode by which the evidence was being taken had any influence upon them. Bradley v. Bradley (1999) B.C.J. No. 2116 (B.C. Supreme Court)\nAlthough every claimant has a right to a hearing, the Act does not give or entitle one to a hearing in any particular region or in front of any particular member. Each case is decided on its own merits. Variance in acceptance rates can be due to a number of different factors on which Counsel argues in her submissions. In order to prove that cases were being decided unfairly, the claimant would have to show that the difference in acceptance rates could not be justified by differences in the merits of the claims heard, which is not the case in Counsel's submissions.\nWith respect to Counsel's argument that a hearing by videoconference is not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice, and thus violates Section 7 of the Charter, the Panel believes that a hearing held by videoconference is an oral hearing which provides the claimant with the opportunity to state his case and to know the case he has to meet. This complies with the standards set out in Singh4, whereby the Panel believes that there is no denial of natural justice and\/or procedural fairness in hearing a claim by videoconference.\nThe Supreme Court in Singh sets out the requirements of fundamental justice in the context of a refugee hearing. They are that the refugee claimant has an adequate opportunity to state his case and to know the case he or she has to meet given the nature of the fundamental right in question \"security of the person\" this means an oral hearing. In a videoconference, the claimant does have the opportunity to state his or her case and to know the case he or she has to meet, he can see, hear and comment on the evidence presented and he has the opportunity to respond to any concerns expressed by the decision-maker. The claimant is in front of the decision-maker in all relevant respects, particularly in that the videoconference is held in real time, so there is direct communication among all participants. In brief, it has all the essential elements of an oral hearing.\nWhat is ultimately important is fairness, and the fact that the law or its application could be even better does not invalidate a provision which meets the requirements of fairness. The Panel refers to the Lyons5 decision from which the following is quoted: \"It seems to me that section 7 of the Charter entitles the Appellant to a fair hearing. It does not entitle him to the most favourable procedures that could possibly be imagined.\"\nWith respect to Section 7 of the Charter being infringed by the use of videoconference hearings, the Panel notes that in the Singh decision, the Supreme Court held that in the context of a refugee hearing, Section 7 of the Charter on \"security of the person\" is engaged. Justice Wilson found that the fundamental justice required that there be an adequate opportunity for a refugee claimant to state his case and to know the case he has to meet. Both requirements are met whether the hearing is held in the presence of the claimant or by means of videoconferencing.\nWith respect to the argument that the Charter right to a fair hearing is of greater importance than administrative convenience, the Panel believes that a hearing by videoconference is a fair hearing. As noted in the Toronto registrar's letter of February 23, 2004, the Board has a statutory obligation to hear cases as expeditiously as possible. In Pillai6, it was stated that the Board is the master of its own procedure. It is required by Section 68 (2) of the Immigration Act, now IRPA Section 162(2), to deal with proceedings before it as informally and expeditiously as the circumstances and the considerations of fairness permit. At paragraph 26, the Court said: \"It is required to strike a balance between expeditious proceedings on the one hand, and procedural fairness or natural justice on the other\".\nCounsel argued that credibility cannot be properly evaluated if the claimant is not physically present before the decision maker and therefore, the claimant does not get the benefit of a full and fair hearing. The Panel believes that credibility can be adequately assessed by videoconference. Canadian case law on the subject indicates that an adequate assessment of credibility can be made by videoconference. The Panel refers to the decision of R. v. Gibson7, indicating that videoconferencing was entirely acceptable and that the claimant could clearly be seen and observed, including his facial expressions and body language. Furthermore, it indicates that on balance, the use of video technology will not preclude a fair trial and will not in any way impede the right to make full answer and defence.\n(...)the (...) video link was entirely acceptable. I could clearly see and observe the witness (...) including her facial expressions and her body language. In fact, I would go so far as to say that a well-placed camera may accentuate the expressions of a witness under cross-examination. (...) I am satisfied that the use of video technology will not preclude a fair trial and will not in any way impede the right to make full answer and defence. R. v. Gibson (2003) B.C.J. No. 812 (B.C. Supreme Court)\nIn the decision of Bradley v.Bradley8, it is indicated that videoconferencing had all the features of evidence given in court except for the actual presence of the witnesses. There was nothing about the manner in which the witness testified that suggested that the remote location of the court and the mode by which the evidence was being taken had any influence upon him.\nIn R. v. Heynen, it is indicated that there was no breach of any principles of fundamental justice, the use of video testimony enhanced the capacity of the court to evaluate testimony. There was no significant difficulty in evaluating testimony but rather the judge found several advantages such as camera angles and close-up views, in many respects, enhanced the ability to evaluate demeanour.\n(...) In some respects, the use of video testimony enhanced the capacity of the Court to evaluate testimony. (...) I found no significant difficulty in evaluating testimony, but rather noted several advantages. Camera angles and close-up views, in many respects, enhance the ability to evaluate demeanour. R. v. Heynen (2000) Y.J. No.6 (Yukon Territorial Court).\nIn Gonzalez versus M.E.I, which is the only Canadian case dealing with a refugee claimant being heard by videoconference, it was argued that videoconferences did not accurately assess the demeanour of the claimant. The court rejected this argument, finding that videoconference did not adversely affect the procedural fairness owed by the Board to the claimant\nCounsel argued that videoconferencing can impact on the claimant's level of comfort in presenting his or her case, and therefore, it should not be used. The Panel believes that it is not possible to state as a general rule that claimants are less comfortable with a hearing held by videoconference rather than in person hearing. As stated in the Toronto registrar's letter, \"Circumstances may exist that would render a case not appropriate for videoconferencing. If Counsel has reason to object to the holding of a videoconference in a particular case, he can request an in person hearing\". This is however decided by the member on a case by case basis. If Counsel does not feel that a videoconference will serve the best interests of his client, Counsel and claimant also have the option of going to the regions where the hearing will be held to appear in person. In this particular case, there is neither an affidavit from the claimant nor any psychological report documenting any fear or attesting to how his stress and discomfort would prevent him from having a fair hearing. There is no evidence upon which the Panel could conclude that to hold a hearing by videoconference would be unfair.\nWith respect to the claimant's expressed surprise at the purported lack of clarity of picture and sound at the previous videoconference hearing, this is in contradiction to what he said at the hearing, that he could see and hear the interpreter perfectly well. Neither the claimant nor the Counsel expressed any concern about the quality of the picture or the sound at the first sitting.\nThe Panel wants to underline that in a videoconference hearing as also in an in person hearing, claimants enjoy the right to, a) have a real time hearing before the decision maker, b) to adduce oral and documentary evidence in support of their claim in the hearing, c) access the assistance of Counsel to advance their claim, d) access an interpreter if they cannot speak English or French, e) have a designated representative appointed to aid them in advancing their claim if the circumstances warrant it, f) call evidence from other witnesses in support of their claim, and g) receive written reasons if the claim is rejected. These entitlements enable the claimants in videoconference and in person hearings an adequate opportunity to state their case and to know the case to be met as required by Singh. The claimant and Counsel have not shown that holding a videoconference hearing undermines these key elements of the oral hearing.\nCounsel argued that for claims referred to the Toronto offices, claimants do not agree with the administrative process to transfer. The IRPA however, under Section 164, authorizes the Board to conduct its hearings by means of live telecommunication without consent. The Board also has control of its own procedures as a quasi-judicial administrative tribunal. Cases such as Prassad v. MEI, Cota Alfredo Barajas v. MCI, and Gorodiskiy Volodomir v. MCI have confirmed this point of law.\nThere is also compelling public interest in Canada in having refugee status determined as soon as it practically is possible after a claim is made. This is confirmed in the decision of Seth9 v. Canada. Furthermore, the IRB has experience in conducting its hearings by videoconference. All three of its divisions have conducted hearings by videoconference for various reasons, including operational necessity. The Federal Court has approved of the hearing of Convention refugee claims by videoconference in the decision of Gonzalez Jos\u00e9 Ciprian Gonzalez v. MCI.\nCounsel argued that the claimants do not trust the technology or has concerns about the reliability and confidentiality. On this issue, the Panel wants to stress that the IRB has many years of experience in conducting its hearings by videoconference. Videoconferencing has been a widely used and successful technology that has been used by the Immigration and Refugee Board. Any attempt to tap into point to point ISDN videoconferencing (the system that the Immigration and Refuge Board use) terminates the videoconference. This therefore allows the RPD hearings by videoconference a measure of security and confidentiality.\nIn conclusion, the claimants have not shown that having their claim heard through a videoconference hearing would constitute a serious violation of their human dignity, and therefore constitute discrimination in the substantive sense. The claimants have not shown that the hearing of their claim by videoconference infringes their Section 7 or 15 of the Charter of Rights. The Panel concludes that none of the arguments raised by Counsel in this case, establish that the claimants will suffer any substantial prejudice or that the fairness of their hearing will be compromised by proceeding by way of videoconference. The panel therefore overrules Counsel's objection and will reconvene the hearing to continue on the merits of the case.\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne Panagakos\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne Panagakos\nJuly 19, 2004\nRc\nDate\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - INTERLOCUTORY MATTERS - PRACTICE - PROCEDURE - HEARING - CONDUCT OF HEARING - ORAL HEARING - STATUTORY INTERPRETATION - IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEE PROTECTION ACT - CONSTITUTIONAL LAW - CANADIAN CHARTER OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS - DISCRIMINATION - NATIONALITY - EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW - FUNDAMENTAL JUSTICE - FAIRNESS - PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS - EVIDENCE - EVIDENCE ASSESSMENT - CREDIBILITY - DEMEANOUR - CONSENT - MALE - DISMISSED\n1 Gonzales, Jose Ciprian Gonzales v.

It must use all means at its disposal to fulfill this obligation.\nThe Refugee Protection Division (RPD) is facing a difficult situation. With a disproportion in the volume of claims between RPD offices, more particularly, an unprecedented workload concentrated in Toronto, and an increase in average processing times, the RPD has had to find more effective ways to manage its national caseload. One tool at its disposal is found in section 164 of the Act. It authorizes the Board to conduct hearings \"by means of live telecommunication\". Hearing claims by videoconference has improved the RPD's ability to address the challenges it is facing and to deliver on its public commitment to hear claims simply, quickly, and fairly.\nThe Immigration and Refugee Board has experience in conducting its hearings by videoconference. All three of its divisions have conducted hearings by videoconference for various reasons including operational necessity. The Federal Court has approved of the hearing of Convention refugee claims by videoconference: Gonzales, Jose Ciprian v. M.C.I. (F.C.T.D. no. IMM-2005-01), MacKay, November 28, 2002; 2002 FCT 1229\nIn face of the Board's clear authority to conduct hearings by videoconference, counsel has raised a number of arguments against proceeding in this way. Although the Board recognizes that there are circumstances in which videoconferencing should not be used, such circumstances do not exist in this case. I overrule counsel's objections for the reasons that follow.\nI will deal first with the argument that selecting cases to be heard by videoconference on the basis of the country of origin constitutes discrimination based on nationality and is prohibited by section 15 of the Charter. Since the 1989 Andrews decision, the Supreme Court of Canada has followed an analytical approach to equality rights cases. This approach includes the determination of whether differential treatment constitutes discrimination within the meaning of s.15(1). What is relevant to respond to counsel's argument in this case is that distinctions are discriminatory only if they have a negative effect, such as imposing a burden, obligation or disadvantage; or limiting access to opportunities, benefits or advantages available to other members of society. Counsel's Charter argument is premised on the idea that claimants from other countries who have hearings in person enjoy an advantage over claimants from those countries selected for hearings by videoconference. This tribunal considers that both ways of proceeding are allowed by the Act and, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, are equally valid. There is no unfairness in selecting claims from a particular country, in this instance, Nigeria, to be heard by videoconference. Canadian courts have found that the requirements of procedural fairness are met and that a hearing by videoconference does not substantially differ from a hearing in person.\nThe videoconference procedure [...] allows the witness to be brought electronically into the Court where the Court has the opportunity to hear and see the evidence as it is given and to control the evidentiary process while it is taking place. The witness is live before the Court and the Court is live before the witness. R. v. Dix (1998) 125 C.C.C. (3d) 377 (Alberta Court of Queen's Bench)\nThe evidence [by videoconference] had all the features of evidence given in court except for the actual presence of the witnesses.[...] There was nothing about the manner in which the witnesses testified that suggested that the remote location of the court and the mode by which the evidence was being taken had any influence upon them. Bradley v. Bradley [1999] B.C.J. No. 2116 (B.C. Supreme Court)\nCounsel contends that a hearing by videoconference does not satisfy the court's intent in the Singh decision, which calls for an oral hearing. In Singh, it was held that the procedure for determining refugee status was inconsistent with the requirements of fundamental justice because the procedure set up by the Immigration Act did not provide the claimant with an adequate opportunity to state his case or to know the case he had to meet. The Refugee Status Advisory Committee made a recommendation to the Minister on the basis of a transcript of the claimant's examination under oath. The claimant was given no opportunity comment on recommendation given to the Minister. In response to this ground for objecting, I point out that whether the claimant is present in the same room as the member or appearing by videoconferencing, the claimant does have an oral hearing before an RPD member, can see and hear and comment on the evidence presented and has the opportunity to respond to any concerns expressed by the decision-maker.\nCounsel submits that as part of its evaluation of credibility, the Board must be able to evaluate the claimant's demeanour and that there can be no serious assessment of demeanour by video. Canadian case law does not support the view that demeanour cannot be assessed in a hearing held by means of videoconference. At least two cases have commented that videoconferencing can be better than actual presence :\n[...] the [...] video link was entirely acceptable. I could clearly see and observe the witness [...] including her facial expressions and her body language. In fact, I would go so far as to say that a well-placed camera may accentuate the expressions of a witness under cross-examination. [...] I am satisfied that the use of video technology will not preclude a fair trial and will not in any way impede the right to make full answer and defence. R. v. Gibson [2003] B.C.J. No. 812 (B.C. Supreme Court)\n[...] In some respects, the use of video testimony enhanced the capacity of the court to evaluate testimony. [...] I found no significant difficulty in evaluating testimony, but rather noted several advantages. Camera angles and close-up views, in many respects, enhance the ability to evaluate demeanour. R. v. Heynen [2000] Y.J. No. 6 (Yukon Territorial Court)\nCounsel has also suggested that the selection of certain countries to be transferred to other cities may not have been done on the basis of objective criteria or in good faith. The choice of which files to transfer falls squarely within the tribunal's right to be master of its own process. It must take into consideration a number of factors that are relevant to its statutory obligation to deal with proceedings simply, quickly and fairly. Among those factors would be the specialisation of the members in the regions receiving transferred files. The RPD operates on the basis of geographic specialisation because refugee determination requires developed familiarity with country conditions. Members develop expertise dealing with a certain region or group of countries. For this reason it is appropriate to transfer blocks of files where members have geographic expertise - i.e. all from same country.\nCounsel argues that the claimant did not consent to being heard by videoconference. However, unlike section 165 of the Canadian Criminal Code, or Rule 1.08 (2) of Ontario's Rules of Civil Procedure, the use of videoconferencing is not contingent upon the consent of the person concerned. By enacting section 164 of the Act, Parliament explicitly conferred discretion on the Division to choose between a hearing in the presence of the subject of the proceedings or by means of live telecommunication such as videoconferencing. Consent of the person concerned is not required.\nCounsel has further argued that the claimant speaks with a marked Nigerian accent, which would be significant when it came to communication and comprehension of his testimony. Whether the claimant was testifying in person or by videoconference would not change his accent. If his testimony is not comprehensible due to his accent, an interpreter may be required. If the accent is just difficult to understand at times, whether he is attending in person or by video, he may be asked to repeat some parts of his testimony. The claimant will suffer no prejudice because his case is heard by videoconference.\nNone of the arguments raised has established that the claimant will suffer any substantial prejudice or that the fairness of his hearing will be compromised by proceeding by way of videoconference.

XXXXX was jealous from the very beginning. His jealously quickly escalated, and it became so bad that in XXXXX 2002 she decided to leave this man who had become violent and who called her a whore, hit, slapped, shoved and pushed her, dragged her on the ground and even raped her three times while they were living as spouses.\nXXXXX stubbornly refused to accept their breakup. He hounded her, harassing her directly and through third parties.\nOn XXXXX, 2002, the claimant, who could not stand the telephone harassment any longer, went to the police station (XXXXX) of XXXXX, where, she said:\n[Translation] I filed a complaint. My complaint did not accuse anyone in particular, even XXXXX. I did not mention him even though I was convinced he was behind this. I was afraid he and the people who made the calls would harm me. That is why I asked that my telephone line be monitored and I requested protection for myself and for my child. However, an intervention order was never made.\nOn XXXXX, 2002, while the claimant was coming back from work, XXXXX attacked her and then forced her to get into his vehicle. Driving at high speed, he crashed into a pole while coming out of a dangerous curve. The claimant was taken to the XXXXX XXXXX hospital to undergo tests and receive the care she needed.\nThe claimant continued by stating:\n[Translation] After that incident, I decided not to report him.\nXXXXX would not let go and continued harassing the claimant by telephone. After losing three jobs in a row and moving six times to escape this man, she was attacked again on XXXXX, 2003. She decided not to follow the advice of a witness to the scene, who urged her to report XXXXX.\nInformed by a teacher at her child's school that a man claiming to be a close relative had come and asked to see her son, she decided to take the child out of school on XXXXX. After describing all these difficulties and horrors to an acquaintance of her father's uncle, who lived in Canada, she took his advice that she exile herself to Canada, where she could obtain protection.\nThe claimant fears returning to Costa Rica, her country of citizenship.\nIDENTITY AND CITIZENSHIP\nThe identity and citizenship of the claimants have been established through reliable documents to which the panel attaches probative value, namely the passports issued to them by the Costa Rican authorities.\nANALYSIS\nThe consideration and analysis of this claim for refugee protection raise a determinative issue: is there adequate protection for the claimants in Costa Rica?\nAfter reviewing the facts and the adult claimant's testimony and written evidence, it became clear to the panel that the adult claimant did not file any formal complaint with the authorities against her assailant, XXXXX XXXXX, despite all the suffering he put her through. Although she was raped three times, viciously attacked for the first time on XXXXX, 2002 and then another time on XXXXX, 2003, and beaten the entire time they lived together, she never filed a complaint against XXXXX XXXXX. According to what she said, she filed only a vague complaint seeking to have her telephone line monitored to expose those threatening to retaliate against her if she did not go back to live with XXXXX XXXXX, whom she deliberately did not accuse even though she knew he was behind all the telephone threats. In passing, the panel would like to note that, during her testimony, the claimant contradicted her PIF by saying that she had stated in her complaint that the originator of the threats was her former boyfriend, XXXXX XXXXX. When confronted about this contradiction relating to the only complaint she had allegedly filed, the claimant gave the panel no explanation. When asked to adduce in evidence a copy of her alleged complaint, she said that her mother had been unable to obtain a copy from the authorities because it was a personal document. With all due respect, the panel cannot accept such an explanation, since the complaint did not belong to the police themselves but to their police records, which means that a copy could have been obtained simply by making a request, supported, if necessary, by an authorization from the claimant.\nThree rapes, six moves and the loss of three jobs due to the behaviour of her assailant, XXXXX XXXXX, did not manage to convince the claimant to lay a complaint or to seek help or assistance from the police or a women's rights organization in Costa Rica because, according to her, protection in that country takes a long time to obtain and is unreliable. She also feared that XXXXX would be imprisoned for two months and then get out of jail, kill her and commit suicide: this became her excuse for not availing herself of the protection of the Costa Rican authorities. It is appropriate to compare this excuse to the documentary evidence to determine whether it is convincing and has some basis.\nThe panel asked the claimant to explain to the panel how she had had the courage to report threatening telephone calls even though she knew that XXXXX XXXXX was behind them and knew that the complaint might lead to reprisals against her if it resulted in his arrest, even though she had not expressly mentioned that the originator of the calls was none other than her assailant, XXXXX XXXXX. This strikes us as inconsistent. The claim that her life and that of her child were her only motivation for not laying a complaint against XXXXX does not hold up, since, in either case, she laid herself open to retaliation by XXXXX by filing a complaint. When asked to dispel any doubts about this inconsistency, the claimant contradicted her PIF by stating that she had expressly mentioned XXXXX name in her complaint.\nWhen the panel mentioned to the existence of resources that provide help and assistance to victims of domestic violence in Costa Rica, the claimant immediately stated that she had not gone to see any advocacy groups for women who are victims of spousal abuse.\nFrom a review of the claimant's testimony, the panel is compelled to find that she deliberately cut herself off from the help and assistance the Costa Rican authorities make available to victims of domestic violence in that country. She did not bother to find out about the real effectiveness and professionalism of which the Costa Rican police and other advocacy groups for women who are victims of spousal abuse are capable.\nA review of the documentary evidence concerning Costa Rica, and specifically the evidence on violence against women versus the quality of the protection available in Costa Rica, compels the panel to find as follows.\nFrom every point of view, Costa Rica is a free and democratic country. This finding is confirmed by the Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2002,1 which stated:\nCosta Rica is a longstanding, stable, constitutional democracy with a unicameral legislative assembly directly elected in free multiparty elections every four years. . . . The judiciary was generally independent.\nGenerally, this document described Costa Rica's human rights situation as follows:\nThe government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law and judiciary provided effective means of dealing with individual instances of abuse; however, there were problems in a few areas. There were some instances of physical abuse by police and prison guards, and the judicial system processed some criminal cases very slowly, resulting in lengthy pre-trial detention for some persons charged with crimes.\nThe Country Reports stated as follows with respect to violence:\nDomestic violence was a serious problem, and traditional patterns of unequal opportunity for women remained, despite continuing government and media efforts to advocate change.\nMore specifically, the Country Reports described the situation of women as follows:\nThe government identified domestic violence against women and children as a serious societal problem. The national institute for women (Inamu), an autonomous institution created in 1998 that is dedicated to gender equality, received 63,990 calls on its domestic abuse hot line from January through October. During this same period, Inamu counselled 4,097 female victims of abuse in its San Jose office and accepted 194 women in Inamu-run shelters. Inamu maintained 41 offices in municipalities around the country and had trained personnel working in 32 of the country's 81 cantons.\nThe office of the special prosecutor for domestic violence and sexual crimes prosecuted 448 cases related to domestic violence during the year, compared with 456 cases in 2001. Inamu reported that 24 women were killed in incidents of domestic violence during the year, compared with 11 in 2001.\nThe 1996 law against domestic violence establishes precautionary measures to help victims. At year's end, the legislative assembly was still debating a bill to qualify violence against women as a crime, which would classify certain acts of domestic violence as crimes and mandate their prosecution, whether or not the victim pursued charges against the perpetrator. The authorities incorporated training on handling domestic violence cases into the basic training course for new police personnel. The domestic violence law requires public hospitals to report cases of domestic violence against women. It also denies the perpetrator possession of the family home in favour of the victim. Television coverage of this issue increased in news reporting, public service announcements, and feature programs. Reports of violence against women increased, possibly reflecting a greater willingness of victims to report abuses rather than an actual increase in instances of violence against women.\nOther documents included in the documentary evidence provide a list of organizations whose mission it is to advance the situation of women in Costa Rica. The list of organizations found in the documentary evidence2 stated the following in its introduction:\nThe following list of organizations dealing with the advancement of women and gender equity in Costa Rica was taken from the website of the directory of national organizations in charge of policies and programs for women in Latin America and the Caribbean (Directorio de organismos nacionales a cargo de las pol\u00edticas y programas para las mujeres de am\u00e9rica latina y caribe). The list is comprised of organizations active in the promotion of women's rights in 1998.\nInstituto nacional de las mujeres (national women's institute)\nThe institute is an autonomous governmental entity. It was formerly called the national centre for the development of women and the family (Centro nacional para el desarrollo de la mujer y la familia, cmf).\nObjectives:\nTo define and promote national policy for gender equality and equity;\nTo defend the rights of women;\nTo promote equality of the sexes;\nTo act as coordinator and to ensure that government bodies establish and implement a national policy for gender equality and equity;\nTo promote the full participation of women in social, political, cultural and economic life.\nDelegaci\u00f3n de la mujer agredida (women's delegation)\nIt is accountable to the ministry of government in coordination with the national women's institute.\nObjectives and functions:\nFree help for women who have suffered physical, psychological and sexual violence, reception and processing of complaints, official protection, legal, psychological and medical assistance and referral to hostels.\nDefensor\u00eda de la mujer (office of women's affairs)\nIt is accountable to the office of public defence (defensor\u00eda de los habitantes) and the ministry of justice and pardon (ministerio de justicia y gracia).\nObjectives and functions:\nTo protect, extend and promote the rights and interests of women against violations, restrictions and discrimination arising from the actions or omissions of the public authorities; and\nTo help eliminate discrimination against women by protecting and extending their rights.\nThe same documentary evidence stated:\nIn addition to the main activities mentioned above for the national women's institute, the Tico Times reports that the institute's national plan for the attention and prevention of domestic violence (planovi) operates two shelters for abused women in Cartago and San Jos\u00e9 (6 Aug. 1999). In one of its reports, la naci\u00f3n provided a list of resources in Costa Rica that offer services to victims of sexual violence (6 June 1999). They include the phone number of an emergency help line, which is 800-300-3000; the women's delegation (delegaci\u00f3n de la mujer), which can be reached at 222-7372 or 222-7533; offices for women's affairs in the municipalities of Alajuela, Goicoechea, Moravia, San Carlos Puntarenas and Paquera (there are 32 such offices in the country, however, not all of them are specialized in domestic violence training); social work offices in hospitals and clinics of the Costa Rican social security office (Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social); and the family court (Juzgado de familia) or mixed court (Juzgado mixto) to which the victim should file a complaint.\nAnother la naci\u00f3n report adds that the emergency help line called \"breaking the silence\" (rompamos el silencio) provides relevant information to the person calling, including legal orientation and emotion support, while maintaining anonymity (3 Jan. 1999). This emergency help line is staffed by 30 female volunteers and is coordinated by the \"mujer no est\u00e1s sola\" (\"woman is not alone\") program of the non-governmental organization feminist centre of information and action (centro feminista de informaci\u00f3n y acci\u00f3n, cefemina). The women's delegation, in addition to the activities mentioned above, also provides follow-up with women's complaints related to sexual violence and will accompany them through the judicial process.\nAnother initiative responding to violence against women in Costa Rica is a project financially supported by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) that would facilitate the Universities of Toronto and Western Ontario in providing assistance for the University of Costa Rica \"to develop human resources in domestic violence prevention and intervention\" (Canadian Newswire, February 25, 1999). The resources allocated to this project, which will run for five years, will help the university of Costa Rica \"train, for example, teachers, students, court personnel, and journalists, in how to respond to the problem of domestic violence.\"\nThe following information on the services and activities of the office of women's affairs within the ombudsman's office (Defensor\u00eda de los habitantes) is in addition to that mentioned above and is provided in the office's 1997-1998 annual report.\nWith regards to domestic violence, the office carried out training sessions on the contents and application of the law against domestic violence within the public sector, and educated public servants in overcoming the myths and stereotypes that serve as obstacles to the application of this law. Furthermore, while this law mandated the office to monitor the actions and irregularities of state officials or institutions (sujetos p\u00fablicos), the office had treated every case of domestic violence brought before it and had provided women with assistance in the preparation of making a request for protection measures through the appropriate channels (v\u00eda jurisdiccional).\nThe office continued to develop training initiatives for groups of women with emphasis on the issues that contribute to the cycle of violence, the importance of self-esteem and the legal channels available to victims of violence.\nWith regards to sexual harassment, the office wanted to organize conferences and workshops with persons, who, because of their position in the workplace, would be able to promote and disseminate the law against sexual harassment in employment and teaching (Ley contra el hostigamiento sexual en el empleo y la docencia). To that end, the office established an informal agreement with the public education ministry to facilitate the training of civil servants who were in charge of managing the application of this law and its internal regulation in the various educational institutions in the country.\nIn terms of domestic violence statistics, la naci\u00f3n states that the women's delegation (Delegaci\u00f3n de la mujer) received 12,231 complaints from January 1998 to December 22, 1998, 46 more than in the previous year. Furthermore, according to the women's delegation, the number of domestic violence cases reported and phone calls made to the emergency help line tended to increase during the Christmas holiday season (la naci\u00f3n January 3, 1999). One of the help-line operators stated that the increase in complaints made by women could be attributed to a greater consumption of alcohol by men.\nIn 1999, according to the national women's institute, there has been an increase in the number of cases of violence against women reported, as well as an increase in the number of women calling the emergency help line (la naci\u00f3n 10 Nov. 1999). As of 31 October 1999, the help line had received 8,729 calls, an increase from the total of 8,640 received in 1998. Of the 4,210 cases of violence against women processed by the women's delegation between January and October 1999, 2,188 were new ones. The numbers are expected to increase in the months of November and December because potential aggressors are likely to spend more time in the home and consume more alcohol. The national women's institute reports that 20 women had died as a result of aggression against them in 1999, 16 of whom were killed by their spouse or partner. At least 8 of the 20 women were on a list of passionate or conjugal homicides (Homicidos pasionales o conyugales) being investigated by the judicial investigations body (Organismo de investigaci\u00f3n judicial, oij).\nThis description of the situation of women facing violence in Costa Rica would be incomplete if the dimension added by another response to information request3 were not noted. It stated:\nA summary of the 1996 law on domestic violence includes reference to psychological aggression by a spouse or domestic partner, but only refers to police intervention at the home where the aggression takes place and the authority to expel aggressors from the home.\nEarlier, the executive submitted to congress another bill to increase the number of courts that could handle cases of domestic violence, and requested congress members to approve one of the above-mentioned bills that would penalize physical, sexual, economic and psychological aggression against women (Proyecto de ley que penaliza la agresi\u00f3n f\u00edsica, sexual, psicol\u00f3gica y patrimonial en contra de las mujeres).\nA 1999 report on the shortcomings of the law on domestic violence refers to obstacles in the legal process for effective conclusion of some cases, lack of training among many policemen, and the capability of police to expel an aggressor from the home. The report cites the example of women who were killed by their former spouse or partner while travelling on a bus from work, and the case of a woman who repeatedly received threats from her estranged husband, with police not responding to the majority of her calls.\nIn terms of the tools available to women who are victims of violence, the panel might add (even if this remedy was not one chosen by the claimant) that there is a divorce law allowing spouses to end their relationship once and for all.\nThe domestic violence act, passed in 1996,4 established preventive measures to help victims of domestic violence, who can go to see a police officer or judge and ask to keep their home and exclude their spouse, to have firearms seized, to be paid support and to have child custody suspended. The law also required hospitals that admit battered women to report cases of violence, and there are television advertising campaigns and special broadcasts on domestic violence.\nThe national women's institute, an independent organization that deals with women who are victims of violence, has 41 offices in the various municipalities of Costa Rica, with staff who have been specially trained to meet needs in 32 of the country's 81 cantons. There are shelters for victims of spousal abuse in which women and their children can take refuge.\nThe panel is compelled to note that Costa Rica, which already has a free, impartial and fair judicial system, has provided that system with a budget and measures to reduce violence against women and to ensure better protection for victims of such violence. Not only have the Costa Rican authorities, through the minister for the status of women, expressed their willingness to support the search for solutions to violence against women, but they are also making laudable and significant efforts to this end.\nThe issue of state protection, which is a determinative one in this case, must be assessed in light of the principles established by the superior courts, which this panel would like to briefly mention.\nIn Ward,5 the Supreme Court of Canada examined the issue of state protection. The principle established by the Court is that, except in situations of complete breakdown of the state apparatus, it should be presumed that a state is capable of protecting its citizens. This presumption can be rebutted only through \"clear and convincing\" proof of the inability of the country in question to protect its citizens.\nThe learned Hugessen J.A. added the following in Villafranca:6\nNo government that makes any claim to democratic values or protection of human rights can guarantee the protection of all of its citizens at all times. Thus, it is not enough for a claimant merely to show that his government has not always been effective at protecting persons in his particular situation. . . .7\nIn a unanimous judgment by the Federal Court of Appeal, and I am referring here to Minal Kadenko,8 the Honourable D\u00e9cary J.A., writing for the Court to address a certified question about protection by the state of Israel, noted the following:\nWhen the state in question is a democratic state, as in the case at bar [Israel], the claimant must do more than simply show that he or she went to see some members of the police force and that his or her efforts were unsuccessful. The burden of proof that rests on the claimant is, in a way, directly proportional to the level of democracy in the state in question: the more democratic the state's institutions, the more the claimant must have done to exhaust all the courses of action open to him or her.\nIn another case,9 Heneghan J. stated that claimants must show that they took all reasonable steps, given the situation in the country of origin in general, and must prove the steps they did in fact take, as well as their relationship with the authorities.\nThe superior courts tell us that claimants are first required to pursue the courses of action available in their country before availing themselves of international protection. This does not mean, however, that they are required to do anything that it would be objectively unreasonable for them to do in seeking protection from their country of citizenship. Thus, they do not have to go so far as to endanger their own life10 or jeopardize their safety by pursuing courses of action that would be pointless in the circumstances.\nAs regards the quality and level of protection available within a state, it cannot be expected that a state will guarantee the protection of its citizens at all times. Nor does protection have to be perfect. Where a state is in effective control of its territory, has civil and police authorities in place and makes serious efforts to protect its citizens, the mere fact that it is not always successful in doing so will not be enough to justify a claim that victims are unable to avail themselves of such protection.11 The standard of protection is that of adequate protection, the Federal Court of Appeal having held that protection must be \"adequate, though not necessarily perfect.\"12\nIn light of the principles established by the case law and the situation that exists in Costa Rica with respect to state protection from domestic violence, the panel finds that Costa Rica, a country that is recognized to be free and democratic, is presumed to be capable of protecting its citizens. It is up to the claimant to rebut this presumption through clear and convincing proof of the inability of the Costa Rican state to protect her.\nThe panel's finding about the existence of adequate protection for victims of domestic violence in Costa Rica was recently endorsed by the Federal Court in Arguedas, Maricela Los Angeles Alfaro, et al. v. C.I.C., in which the Honourable Lemieux J. concluded as follows:\nA review of the state apparatus in Costa Rica in relation to the problem of domestic violence meets the standards required for state protection in by refugee law. The tribunal enumerated those elements in its reasons.\nThe claimant left her country before the state had even had an opportunity to demonstrate its ability to protect her and the reliability of the tools available to her for that purpose. By limiting herself to her belief that protection takes a long time to obtain and is unreliable, without really trying to verify whether what she believed was true, and by refusing to lay a complaint against XXXXX each time the opportunity arose, the claimant turned her back on the justice system. The words of the learned McKeon J. are applicable here:\nThe relevant evidence to determine this issue would include the documentary evidence and the personal circumstances of the claimant. The claimant's own subjective feelings on state protection would, however, not be a relevant factor.13\nIt seems clear to the panel that the claimant did not attempt to avail herself of all the services offered to her in Costa Rica. She closed her eyes to all the measures designed to provide safety and peace of mind to victims of spousal abuse in Costa Rica, measures that make it possible to conclude that there is adequate protection14 for victims of domestic violence in that country.\nOn the question of state protection, in a recent case (Medina v. Canada),15 the Federal Court, per the Honourable O'Reilly J., stated the following at paragraphs 7, 10 and 11 of its judgment:\n?7? Applicants for refugee protection must show that state protection was not available to them, or that it would be unreasonable in the circumstances to expect them to have sought it out. States are presumed to be in a position to protect their citizens, unless applicants prove otherwise: Canada (Attorney General) v. Ward, ?1993? 2 S.C.R. 689. The question, then, is whether Mr. Medina's evidence should have persuaded the Board that state protection was not available to him, or that it was unreasonable to expect him to have tried to obtain it under the circumstances.\n. . .\n?10? On balance, however, the Board concluded that Mr. Medina should have tried to obtain protection from the authorities because there was at least some assistance available in El Salvador. It said it believed that \"if he returns to El Salvador, [he] has a responsibility, if he is again threatened by gang members or other criminals, to report these incidents to the police and that protection could be obtained.\"\n?11? Mr. Medina provided no evidence that other persons in his situation sought and failed to obtain state protection. Nor did he show that he had tried and failed to get state protection. In this situation, \"the claim should fail, as nations should be presumed capable of protecting their citizens,\" Ward, above at p. 725.\nOnce again, the panel notes that responsibility for providing international protection becomes binding only when national or state protection cannot be provided to a claimant. International protection is surrogate protection.16 It follows that the claimant's first obligation was to give priority to Costa Rican solutions to her problem before claiming international protection in the way she did.\nThe claimant did not provide clear and convincing proof that the Costa Rican state is incapable of protecting its citizens. The burden was on her to rebut the presumption that the state can protect both her and her son. The claimant did not discharge this burden.\nAfter reviewing the facts, the documentary evidence, the circumstances of the case and the Chairperson's guidelines on women who claim refugee protection on gender-related grounds,17 this panel determines that there is adequate protection for victims of violence in Costa Rica and that the claimants have not shown through clear and convincing evidence that the Costa Rican state would be unwilling or unable to adequately protect them if they returned to their country of citizenship.\nDECISION\nFor all these reasons, the panel determines that the claimants, XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, and her minor son, XXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXXX, are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nAccordingly, the panel rejects their claims for refugee protection.\nMartial Guay\nMe Martial Guay\nMarch 11, 2004\nDate\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - DOMESTIC VIOLENCE - STATE PROTECTION - DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE - NEGATIVE - COSTA RICA\n1 Exhibit A-1, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2002, 4.1, March 31, 2003.\n2 Ibid., Response to Information Request No. CRI132984.E, 6.2, November 18, 1999.\n3 Ibid., 6.4, CRI36656.E, February 2001.\n4 Law No. 7586, Law against domestic violence.\n5 Canada (Attorney General) v.

Both the claimant's parents and the claimant herself are from the minority Brava tribe. The claimant's mother, together with her, fled Mogadishu and went to Brava, a city where most of the Bravas lived. Her mother tried to make a living for herself and her daughter. However, she passed away in 1997, due to an illness, and the claimant was left alone.\nThe claimant started living with a friend of her mother, a single woman with three children. The economical situation was difficult, and the woman started abusing the claimant and telling her that she should go out and sell her body in order to bring money for food.\nThe claimant wanted to leave Somalia, but did not really have a way out, until she met a person who was ready to buy properties belonging to her father. However, the claimant did not sell those properties for money, she did so in exchange of a promise to take her to the United States. Following the transaction, the man took the claimant first to Mombassa, and then, via Malaysia, to the United States.\nUpon her arrival in the United States, the claimant applied for refugee status, which was denied to her, as well as her appeal from that decision. In the meantime, the claimant met a man in the United States, whom she married in a religious Muslim ceremony. However, he was not able to sponsor her, nor to formally marry her, because he was not yet officially divorced from his first wife.\nThe claimant came to Canada in XXXXX 2003, and at the border, asked for refugee protection.\nShould she go back to her country, the claimant is afraid that she will be in danger of rape or other physical abuse or even death, as a young single woman from the minority Brava tribe without any family protection. As for her son, the claimant stated that he does not have any fear of persecution or any other fear in the United States. The son, as I mentioned before, is a citizen of the United States.\nANALYSIS\nWe have asked the claimant several questions concerning the reasons for her leaving Somalia. She answered in a spontaneous, direct way. Although she was quite young at that time, she was able to give very coherent and plausible explanations. She explained her situation clearly, without hesitations. She was also able to explain the situation of her clan or how she can be recognized as a member of the Brava tribe. I found her testimony particularly credible.\nIn order to establish her identity, the claimant was not able to present any direct identity documents from Somalia, but she obtained the passports of her father and her mother, as well as an old photo of her parents. She also explained in a credible way how she was able to obtain those passports. There is a striking physical resemblance between the woman on the old photo and the claimant. There is no doubt that the woman on the photo and in one of the passports is the claimant's mother. We also have on file a few affidavits from Canadian citizens and permanent residents, who confirm that they knew the claimant and her parents in Somalia, and that she is from the Brava clan. Also, her testimony concerning her tribe was very credible.\nThe claimant was questioned about why she was refused in the United States. She did not present the decision which she had received. She said that she would try to obtain that decision if required; however, she explained that she was refused, being considered as a victim of the war and not a person targeted for persecution, which is also plausible. So I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt on this point and to accept her testimony concerning the reasons of her refusal by the United States as plausible.\nConcerning the fear of return and objective documentary evidence concerning the Brava tribe, we can read in the UK Assessment3 that:\n\"The Benadiri ?...? and Bravanese (people long established in the city of Brava, believed to be of mixed Arab, Portuguese and other descent), suffered particularly badly at the hands of armed militia and bandits as their home areas were fought over by the competing USC factions and the SPM. USC\/SNA forces in particular singled out the Benadiri and Bravanese, with a campaign of systematic rape of women.\"\nFurther down, this information is also confirmed in another paragraph of the same document, which quotes the report of a British-Danish fact-finding mission in May 2002 (Exhibit A-114), which suggests that:\n\"?...? Bravanese have mostly fled from the coastal town of Brava, although some are still living in the town, which is controlled by the Habr Gedir. Information suggested that Bravanese who remained faced abuses forced labour, sexual slavery and general intimidation.\"\nThe documentary evidence also confirms that women, particularly from the minority clans, who do not have male protection, are vulnerable in Somalia, particularly in the areas where the civil war is still raging. We can read in the same UK Assessment, under paragraph 6.105, that:\n\"Most vulnerable have been women who have been internally displaced within Somalia, who have lacked the protection of powerful clan structures, and those from minority clans and ethnic minorities.\"\nAs for the general situation in Somalia, although it seems that the civil war ended in the north of the country, the Somaliland, with some kind of semblance of government there, the situation in the south, in Mogadishu and Brava, where the claimant is from, is still very unstable and it is difficult to speak about the existence of a government in these areas.\nConsidering all the above, I conclude that the claimant, Ms. XXXXXXXXXXX, has established a well-founded fear of persecution as a member of a particular social group (young women without male protection), as well as on the grounds of her nationality (member of the Bravanese clan). She is therefore a \"Convention refugee\", as per Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nHowever, this tribunal cannot grant the protection to the claimant's minor son, XXXXX XXXXX, since, as his mother stated, he does not have any fear in the United States. His father lives there, and the United States government is certainly able to offer protection to a minor child.\nCONCLUSION\nThe claim of the minor claimant XXXXXXXXXXX is refused, while the claim of Ms. XXXXXXXXXXXXX is accepted.\nBarbara Berger\nBarbara Berger\nApril 8, 2004\nDate\n\/jcbo\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - WOMEN REFUGEES - GENDER - PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP - GENDER-RELATED PERSECUTION - NATIONALITY - MINORS - FEMALE - MALE - BENCH REASONS - POSITIVE - NEGATIVE - SOMALIA - USA\n1 \" 96.

INTRODUCTION\nXXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, a 30-year-old citizen of the People's Republic of China, has claimed Convention refugee status on political grounds, alleging that he fears persecution by the authorities. He has also claimed to be a person in need of protection1 on the basis that he would be personally subjected to a danger of torture, to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in China.\nII. ALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant alleged that, from 1997 on, he was part of the village committee for XXXXX in XXXXX, Fujian province. He was a messenger; when he was not passing on messages, he stayed in the committee's office. Over the years, he often saw the committee, along with police officers, take women for abortions at the XXXXX hospital, pursuant to the one-child policy. On XXXXX, 2003, the mother of XXXXX, a neighbour, came to get help from the claimant. XXXXX XXXXX was expecting her third child, and the committee was guarding her at its offices. That evening, the claimant released her. The next day, he admitted what he had done. He was ordered to bring the fugitive back within three days. He left XXXXX on XXXXX, 2003, and China shortly thereafter.\nIII. DETERMINATION\nThe Refugee Protection Division is of the opinion that there are serious reasons to believe that the provisions of paragraph 1F(a) of the Refugee Convention must be applied in this case. This means that, as set out in section 98 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX is not a Convention refugee2 or a person in need of protection.\nIV. ANALYSIS\nExclusion\n1. The claimant described the enforcement of the one-child policy. If a woman's first child was a girl, she had to wait four to five years to have a second child. Even if the second child was a girl, the family could not have a third child. A third pregnancy led to abortion, which was forced if not done voluntarily. If the woman gave birth in another province, the third child was not registered in the family record book of Fujian province.\n2. The claimant described his duties as a messenger for the village committee of XXXXX in XXXXX district, XXXXX city, Fujian province. If there was a fight in the village, he was responsible for advising the antagonists to stop, as well as arresting, detaining and questioning them and reporting the incident to the village leader. The claimant added that the village leader was actually the one responsible for conducting interrogations. If he considered it necessary, he asked for help from the police, whose station was half an hour from the village. The youngest committee member, the claimant stayed at the office, took telephone calls and did the cleaning. While the leader conducted interrogations, the claimant boiled water to make tea. When a storm was announced, it was up to him to notify the villagers by putting up signs. The claimant also played a role as a guard.\n3. The claimant described his role as a guard. When a woman was pregnant for the second time, after having a boy, or the third time otherwise, she was brought to the office. There was a small cell in the office. The guard guarded her for two hours; there was a rotation every two hours. If the women fled, her husband was detained. The claimant said that the only people arrested pursuant to the policy in 2003 were the couple involved in his story. It is this couple, whom the claimant testified that he had released, who are the source of his problems.\n4. The claimant said that he did this work from 1997 to 2003. When asked whether he had detained women in 2002 for the purpose of abortion, he initially said that he had not. But when asked the question again, he answered in the affirmative, saying that some women had been arrested. However, he said he did not remember how many were arrested in 2002, since it was so many years ago. He was asked how many women had been arrested while he was performing this job, that is, from 1997 to 2003. He answered that there had been about 10. He explained that there had been 10 monitors in the village. When one of them learned that a woman was pregnant, he reported this to the village leader, who decided whether the woman had to be arrested. When asked whether he had been among the 10, the claimant said that he had not, that he had always stayed at the office to take calls and that he had not been present for the arrests, which he said were very dangerous to the women's health. A little later, however, he did admit that he had also been one of the people who made inquiries. It would even be more accurate to say that he was forced to admit that he himself had been among the 10, but, he insisted again, the 10 were responsible mainly for security and, as the youngest, he stayed at the office.\nThe difficulty the claimant had in dissociating himself from the other informers, who were members of the village committee, instead supports the argument that, as a committee member, the claimant behaved like the others. The only thing he did not admit was whether he himself had also reported any pregnant women who were violating the one-child policy.\n5. The claimant admitted that, from 1997 to 2003, he had guarded eight or nine women at the committee's office before they were taken to XXXXX for abortions. He did his two hours of guard duty before being replaced. He admitted that he had guarded the same person more than once, in other words, that he could come back on duty and have to guard the same person again before she was taken to XXXXX. Although he denied being one of those who went to arrest pregnant women or took them to have their abortions, he did participate directly in the process by guarding imprisoned women until they were taken to undergo forced abortions.3\n6. The claimant explained that, because he was younger, he had been relegated to the committee's office while the other committee members took women to XXXXX to obtain abortions. He was at the bottom of the hierarchy. The claimant was rather ambiguous about the question of whether he had wanted to rise in this hierarchy so he could leave the office and accompany his colleagues taking women to XXXXX. After acknowledging that there was some prestige involved in being able to escort women to the hospital, he said no when asked whether he had wished to be part of the hierarchy so he could take the women himself, but he stated that those at a low level had to stay at the office. Despite a few weak denials, the claimant did not really oppose the one-child policy or the role of the committee, of which he was a member, in applying that policy. At a minimum, as a member of the group that apprehended women for the purpose of forced abortion, he was, if not a direct participant, at least complicit in carrying out the plan.4 The fact remains that the claimant's thorough knowledge of the committee's functions indicates that he was indeed a member thereof. The panel therefore finds that the claimant's testimony about the duties he performed is credible.\n7. The claimant alleged that he had released one of the women and that this was the cause of his problems. The panel does not consider it necessary to look at the inconsistencies and contradictions brought out by the testimony. That said, the claimant alleged that he had freed one of the incarcerated women. Despite the claimant's lack of credibility as regards the woman, or the woman and her husband, whom he allegedly released, the panel finds that the claimant has acknowledged that he was in a position that enabled him to release at least one of the women who were supposed to have a forced abortion. It seems obvious to the panel that he never did so. No doubt his job would have been affected if he had. He might even have had to leave his village. However, it must be noted that the claimant never put forward a defence of duress.\n8. The claimant's counsel argued that applying the one-child policy was not the village committee's only function. This is true. However, knowingly participating on more than one occasion in the enforcement of this policy, which may be reasonable in theory but which is horrible in its application, cannot be accepted. Even thinking about its application is repulsive to anyone who considers what it involves. Its application is contrary to international principles and standards relating to human dignity and rights. Article 3 of the Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person. Article 5 states that no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Yet this is what the claimant participated in when he guarded imprisoned women who were to undergo abortions.\nMoreover, the Supreme Court of Canada has described forced sterilization as a practice that is clearly contrary to Canada's human rights obligations.5 In this respect, the panel finds that, if forced sterilization is considered brutal, it has no choice but to consider forced abortion to be a similar act with a similar impact, in accordance with international instruments, particularly Article 7-1(g) and (k) of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal:\nArticle 7: Crimes against humanity\n1. For the purpose of this Statute, \"crime against humanity\" means any of the following acts when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack:\n. . .\n(g) Rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization, or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity;\n. . .\n(k) Other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health.\nThe panel's interpretation of paragraph 7-1(g) is based on the history of the provision, which originated in the Draft Code of 1954,6 which tried to codify the principles derived from the Nuremberg trials, the charters7 of which are recognized as one of the sources of the definition of crimes against humanity.\nInclusion\nDuring the hearing, credibility questions raised in relation to matters central to the claim were not satisfactorily answered. However, since the panel determines that the claimant should be excluded, it will not deal with them in these reasons.\nV. CONCLUSION\nThe panel determines that, through his acts, namely guarding women who were going to undergo forced abortions because of their opposition to such a practice, the claimant was complicit in crimes against humanity. In the panel's view, if a person who was complicit in forced abortion were not excluded from Canada's protection, this would outrage the Canadian public. The panel therefore determines that the claimant is excluded under paragraph 1F(a) of the Convention.\nL\u00e9on Graub\nL\u00e9on Graub\nMarch 24, 2004\nDate\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - POLITICAL OPINION - CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY - ONE-CHILD POLICY - EXCLUSION - ART. 1F(a) - NEGATIVE - CHINA\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, reads in part as follows:\n97.

He alleged that he has a well-founded fear of persecution in his country of origin because of his sexual orientation and his membership in a particular social group, namely homosexual minorities who are persecuted in Peru. He also alleged that he would be personally subjected to a danger of torture, to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he had to return to Peru.\nALLEGED FACTS\nThe evidence in this case, as presented by the claimant, his counsel and the refugee protection officer (RPO), is made up of the following: the claimant's Personal Information Form (PIF), oral evidence, identity documents and personal papers, as well as documents on the socio-political and human-rights situation in Peru. The claimant's PIF and oral evidence revealed the following facts:\nThe claimant was born in the city of Lima, where he lived his entire life. In his PIF, he stated that he attended school for 16 years, including a year of university studies in XXXXX, and that he has had four different jobs since December 2000, including one in the United States, where he lived from XXXXX 2000 to XXXXX 2001. He stated that he is single and that he began living publicly as a homosexual in Peru in XXXXX 2002.\nThe claimant based his claim for refugee protection essentially on the fact that his neighbours near his home and his fellow students - whom he identified by name at the start of the hearing - harassed and attacked him because of his homosexuality. The claimant testified that his problems had begun in XXXXX 2000, when he was beaten by a group of homophobic students from the university he attended. He was advised to leave the country, so he went for five months - from XXXXX 2000 to XXXXX 2001 - to live in the United States, where he was able to work in Miami. However, he did not seek the protection of authorities there because of their refusal, he said, to grant refugee protection on the basis of sexual orientation and, above all, because of the violence and discrimination that exist everywhere in the United States.\nThe claimant returned voluntarily to Peru, where, in XXXXX 2002, he ended up deciding to live openly as a homosexual. Driven out of the family home by his intolerant father, the claimant began life as part of a homosexual couple for the first time when he lived with a certain XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX from XXXXX 2002 to XXXXX 2003. During that period, people from their neighbourhood attacked the couple twice, on XXXXX and XXXXX, 2002; as a result, the claimant had to be hospitalized for three days, from XXXXX to XXX, 2002, at the XXXXX clinic. After each attack, the claimant and his partner went to a police station, where no one would listen to them and where they were even dismissed off-handedly with the threat that they would be detained for \"immoral conduct.\" The couple ended up separating in XXXXX 2003.\nIn XXXXX 2003, the claimant began another homosexual relationship with a certain XXXXX XXXXX, which lasted until mid- XXXXX 2003. During that period, homophobic individuals attacked the new couple while they were strolling hand in hand in a park on XXXXX, 2003. The claimant and his partner notified a police officer who was on the scene, but, rather than helping them, he took them to the station, where they were put in a cell for a few hours because of their \"immoral conduct.\" On XXXXX, 2003, neighbours came to their home and, after savagely attacking them, told them to leave the neighbourhood. The claimant and his partner had to be hospitalized for a few days, again at the XXXXX clinic, because of the attack. In the meanwhile, the claimant lost his job twice despite approaching the ministry of labour, where officials did not want to hear what he had to say.\nIn such a context, the claimant flew out of Peru on XXXXX, 2003, and landed in New York the next day. He then travelled by road the same day to the Canadian border at Lacolle, where, as soon as he arrived, he expressed his intention to claim refugee protection. He said that he feared for his life if he had to return to Peru, where he would again be harassed and attacked, not only by the neighbours and students who had already harassed him but also by Peruvian society, which is largely homophobic, including the security forces. In his opinion, the Peruvian authorities were unable to provide him with adequate protection.\nThese, in substance, are the facts brought to the panel's attention by the claimant, the only person who testified in this case. The panel must decide whether he is a Convention refugee1 and\/or a person in need of protection,2 based on the criteria established in sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nANALYSIS\nAfter thoroughly analysing all the evidence, both testimonial and documentary, the panel finds that the claimant has discharged his burden of proving that he would be personally subjected to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he had to return to his country. The panel's reasons are as follows:\nHaving had an opportunity to observe the claimant's behaviour, the panel notes that, on the whole, he testified directly and spontaneously, without exaggerating. The panel does not find any significant discrepancies between his testimony and his previous statements, whether in his PIF or at the port of entry. He filed in evidence medical certificates and notarized affidavits, which seemed to confirm several of the facts he referred to in his testimony. There is, of course, the fact that the claimant voluntarily returned to his country of persecution in XXXXX 2001, but his explanations were not unreasonable. The panel has no reason to doubt that the claimant is homosexual, and it has decided to give him the benefit of the doubt as to the possibility that he was persecuted in his country because of his homosexual orientation.\nWhat remains to be determined is whether the claimant would be at risk if he returned to his country of origin. The most recent documents seem to indicate that the Peruvian authorities are not yet able to provide adequate protection to sexual minorities. A very recent report by the U.S. Department of State on human-rights practices in Peru contained the following passage:\nOn April 22 (2003), the Front for the Right to be Different, a gay rights group, began a campaign to amend the Constitution so that it would forbid discrimination against people for their sexual orientation. Homosexuals face strong discrimination, and most preferred to remain anonymous for fear of social sanctions from their families and by society in general.3\nMoreover, Andrew Reding, an expert on sexual minorities in Latin America, recently published a wide-ranging study on the status of homosexuals in North American countries. The part of his study concerning Peru contained the following significant passages:\nThough there are no longer any laws explicitly prohibiting sexual activity between civilians of the same sex, authorities frequently invoke vague laws aiming to uphold \"public morality\" as a tool to repress sexual \"deviance\". Moreover, Section 269 of the Military Penal Code of 1988 provides for penalties ranging from 20 days to 20 years in jail for \"dishonorable acts of carnal knowledge against the order of nature.\"\nThe Lima Homosexual Movement (Movimiento Homosexual de Lima, MHOL) was founded in 1983. But Peru's first gay pride parade was not held until 2002, when a scant few hundred marchers braved Lima's hostile atmosphere. Marchers wore masks to hide their identities as they bore signs saying \"we want to be visible, but intolerance suppresses us.\"4\nFinally, the Board's Documentation Centre has produced a number of questions and answers on the status of homosexuals in Peru. The most significant passages are as follows:\nWhilst homosexuality is legal in Peru persecution of gays and lesbians does still occur. For example there are periodic raids on gay bars and clubs. In 1996 such raids led to 600 arrests.\nNotwithstanding this there is a surprisingly active gay scene centred in Lima. There are over 10 clubs and bars, 3 saunas and even 4 gay hotels. In 1997 Peru had its first gay parade and there are several LGBT organisations including the Homosexual Movement of Lima (MHOL), founded in 1983.\n...Homosexual acts, in private and between consenting adults, are not illegal. Laws referring to \"public morality\" however are often used against gays and lesbians. The Constitution and numerous other pieces of legislation include anti-discrimination provisions, but none refer to sexual orientation specifically. Gays are banned from the armed forces and the police (GayTimes 2003).5\nLima apparently has a relatively small gay community for a city of 8 million people. ... The gay scene is much smaller than Buenos Aires, Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, or Bogot\u00e1 and about the same as Santiago. Also, the gay scene here is so well-hidden that when I first came to Lima in 1997 it appeared there was no gay community here at all. ...\nAlthough Lima has become a little more liberal in the last few years bear in mind that Peru generally still has a macho and conservative culture. ... [H]omosexuality continues to be viewed negatively so adjust your behaviour accordingly and keep a low profile in public. Acceptance will only be achieved slowly and by not provoking reactionary elements (9 May 2002).6\nThere are no specific legal protection measures for homosexuals in Peru. Despite Constitutional articles that declare every person equal under the law, in practice homosexuals are subject to a variety of abuses by police authorities. Although there is no legal provision outlawing or penalizing homosexuality in Peru, police authorities penalize some homosexual behaviours by considering them transgressions against morality and good traditions, as specified in Article 450 of the Peruvian Penal Code. . . .\nAlthough homosexual men and women are not targets of violence because of their sexual orientation, they do face expulsion from their homes and from their work, can be detained by police for extortion or intimidation, can be slandered and, particularly in recent times, the news media describe persons as homosexuals to denigrate or ruin their lives. . . .\nIn Peru, homosexuality is associated with prostitution, drugs, sex, depravity and scandal, among other things. This is a reason why many homosexuals prefer not to be open about their homosexuality. Hiding their sexual orientation has been the way many homosexuals avoid societal discrimination and homophobia, and gain access to public or private employment.7\nIn light of these extracts from the independent documentary evidence, it seems obvious to the panel that, for the moment, homosexuals who want to live openly as such in Peru are at risk in every part of the country.\nBefore concluding, the panel should make clear that the claimant's identity documents entered into evidence are acceptable, so that the panel has no doubts about his identity.\nCONCLUSION\nThe panel finds that the evidence with respect to the most important points of this claim for refugee protection is sufficient to establish that there is a reasonable chance the claimant would be personally subjected to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he returned to Peru. For this reason, the panel determines that the claimant, XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, is a person in need of protection. His claim for refugee protection is therefore accepted.\nCharles DeBlois\nCharles DeBlois\nMay 7, 2004\nDate\n1 96.

He claimed refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act).\nSUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS (as they appear in the Personal Information Form)\nThe claimant is Protestant. He showed compassion and patience for XXXXXXXXXX, a man who used to extort money. As a result of the claimant's attitude, XXXXXXXX stopped transgressing the law. Both men became friends. In XXXXX 2001, the claimant \"evangelised\" his new friend and gave him spiritual guidance through weekly church attendance and involvement in social activities. Muslims who learned of this turn of events disapproved.\nOn XXXXX, 2002, XXXXX XXXXX decided to convert to Christianity. Members of Jemaah Islamiah (JI) threatened to kill the claimant. On XXXXX, 2003, members of JI threw stones at the claimant's kiosque, burnt his car and waved their weapons, threatening to kill him. He escaped from the back door of his kiosque.\nThe following day, when he went to report the incident to the police, the latter saw nothing wrong in what happened to him. On XXXXX, 2002, he fled to Jakarta. Three days later, he left Indonesia and arrived in the USA.\nNineteen months later, on XXXXX, 2003, he arrived in Canada and applied for protection.\nDETERMINATION\nThe panel determines that the claimant is neither a \"Convention refugee\"1 nor a \"person in need of protection\"2.\nANALYSIS\nThe panel considers that the claimant's passport3 seized by Citizenship and Immigration Canada is a sufficient proof of his identity.\nThe claimant alleged that he feared the JI. Despite repeated questions, he was unable to tell who the JI is or what its activities are. The panel is of the opinion that a thirty-three-year-old person with twelve years of education should be able to describe the alleged agent of persecution seeking to kill him. Consequently, the claimant's credibility is adversely affected.\nThe claimant testified that when he reported an alleged attack on his store on XXXXX, 2002, the police told him that such an incident had already taken place and he had to accept it. He was asked again and again to repeat what the police told him. He stated that a policeman said to him that he was an infidel; this is what the JI do in the area and he was \"too brave to teach Christianity to a member of the JI\" and nothing else. Yet, he indicated in his narrative that the police told him that according to the Islamic law, it was proper and normal for him to be stoned to death, which makes the police no better than the people who supposedly attacked him. Pressed to explain this inconsistency, he answered that the police thought that it was normal because he is an infidel and he was too brave. Then, he argued that he mentioned what his narrative contains. He finally replied that the JI said that he deserved to be stoned to death. His failure to address the inconsistency erodes his credibility.\nDuring his hearing, the claimant affirmed that XXXXX XXXXX was a member of the JI. He was asked why he omitted this allegation in his written statement. He responded that he was sorry, he made a mistake. The panel does not accept this response since if the person who sought conversion from Islam to the Protestant faith, was a member of a reputed militant Islamic group4, his story takes on a greater dimension. Furthermore, he omitted to mention in his oral testimony the allegation in his narrative that on XXXXX, 2002, JI assailants swore to kill him. He replied he was sorry. Finally, he did not mention in his narrative that since his departure from his hometown to the present time, members of his family and his friends have been questioned about his whereabouts by the JI. He explained that he forgot. These omissions reflect negatively on his credibility.\nThe claimant submitted a one-page police report5 to corroborate the attack on XXXXX, 2002. He said that he reported that the assailants were from the JI and this is mentioned in the police report. It was pointed out to him that it is not mentioned. He responded that it was not because the police is afraid of the JI. This shows how easy it was for the claimant to contradict himself and justify his last version of events. Consequently, the panel does not find him to be credible.\nThe claimant was advised that according to his written statement, he was brushed away by the police when he went to report the XXXXX, 2002 attack. Without the police report, one would never imagine in reading his written statement, that the police had made a report. He had no comment to offer. Moreover, according to his narrative, the JI attackers on XXXXX, 2002, threw stones at his store while in testimony, he alleged that they ransacked his store, destroyed his merchandise, walls, equipment, including his show window and fence door. He replied he was sorry he did not write that down. Consequently, the panel grants no probative value to the police report and does not find the claimant to be credible.\nThe claimant was confronted with Schedule 16 in which he indicated:\n\"Someone tried to kill me. A man named XXXXX tried to kill me. He wants money from me to buy alcohol. Sometimes I give it to him, sometimes I do not. When I do not give him money, he threatened me. He said if I do not give him money, that he will kill me. This happened in XXXXX 2002.\"\nHe explained that he was nervous when he arrived at the Canadian border and he could not concentrate on what he experienced before. In the panel's opinion, this is not a valid justification for giving a version of events which is in no way consistent with his written and oral testimony. Consequently, the panel does not believe that he faced problems in Indonesia as alleged and his whole story is a fabrication.\nThe claimant testified that he had a US visitor's visa since the year 2000 and he went to the USA on XXXXX, 2002 \"to save himself\". He gave a confused description of how someone associated with an Indonesian - Christian association took advantage of him after he gave him money to assist him in seeking asylum in the USA. He first stated that in his opinion, a claim for asylum was filed on his behalf. To follow-up questions, he backtracked. His counsel also commented upon conditions for a claim to be considered as being filed or not. This comment is of no merit since the claimant was simply requested to reveal whether he claimed protection in the USA and he acknowledged that this is what he understood. He was asked why he earlier stated that he was of the opinion that a claim for asylum in the USA was filed and at the same time, in question 36 of his Personal Information Form (PIF), instead of listing all claims for protection or requests for asylum he would have made in any country other than Canada, he put \"N\/A\" (not applicable). He said he did not know. Because of his confusion, change of mind, and inability to provide an explanation, the panel does not believe that he applied for protection in the USA and does not believe that in the nineteen months he spent in the USA, he showed he had a subjective fear.\nIn order to assess the claimant's risk associated with sections 96 and 97(1) of the Act, the panel carefully took into consideration the general documentation, counsel's submissions as well as relevant case law. It carefully reviewed each and every document, even those dating back to 1998, like Human Rights Watch7 or consisting of an individual opinion8 or coming from a partisan organisation9 which cannot be recognised as independent sources. The panel also noted that according to the Europa World Yearbook 2003, 9,6 % out of a population of two hundred and six million is Christian. Violence against Christians in Indonesia is well documented. Although not satisfactory, the situation of Christians is not hopeless as shown in the following documents:\n\"Following a sharp drop in violence between Christians and Muslims in the provinces of Maluku, North Maluku, and Central Sulawesi, inter-religious tolerance and cooperation improved during the year. During the first 6 months of the year, many Muslims and Christians in those provinces worked together to repair mosques and churches.\"10\n\"After brokering peace accords signed by Christian and Muslim community leaders in the provinces of Maluku, North Maluku and Central Sulawesi, the Government deployed large numbers of troops and police in key conflict areas and encouraged Java-based Islamic extremists to depart. Interreligious violence decreased in all three provinces; the death toll in the Malukus fell by two-thirds. Peaceful conditions prompted many displaced persons to return to their homes (...) The Government made progress in promoting religious freedom by cracking down on terrorists and other extremists who carried out attacks in the name of religion.\"11\n\"(...) it was the election of Abdurrahman Wahid as President in October 1999 that many ethnic Chinese first saw some hope for improvement in their situation in Indonesia. (...) The new President was relatively quick to translate his hope into something more concrete when in January 2000 he issued Presidential Decree No.6\/2000. The Decree revoked a 1967 law, which prevent the performance of rites and rituals associated with Chinese beliefs and culture outside of the home. Chinese New Year 2000 was therefore celebrated publicly in Indonesia for the first time in over 30 years and significantly, without incident. Many ethnic Chinese therefore entered the year 2000 with great expectations for further improvement in their situation (...) During the recent period, incidents of violence against ethnic Chinese have declined relative to the period preceding it, which included the May 1998 violence (...) There has been progress in Indonesia politics on anti-discrimination, however this has largely remained rhetoric.\"12\n\"The general impression among Indonesian specialists is that incidents of specifically anti-Chinese violence have decreased since 1998-1999.\"13\n\"According to Human Rights Watch executive director, the police (...) were the poorest trained and poorest paid of any part of the security forces, and were thus not effective as law enforces. (...) In some places, as in Ambon, the police were seen to be from one side of the conflicts, so that there were allegations that the police were supporting the Christians and the army was supporting the Muslims (HRW 24 Oct. 2000).\"14\n\"We praise the adoption of the Chinese New Year or Imlek as a national holiday and the policy to scrap the term that identifies Chinese-Indonesians as non-indigenous people as good signals to develop equality. But there are some basic discriminatory rulings which have not been revoked, while those already annulled remain non-operational (Chinese-Indonesian expert Andrie Wongso told the Jakarta Post on Thursday) (...) Andrie suggested that the government look at Chinese-Indonesians here as an asset for the country who would develop the nation alongside other indigenous people. Manu Chinese-Indonesians want to dedicate themselves like Kwik Kian Gie, State Minister for National Development Planning, but they hesitate due to the discriminatory atmosphere, (he said)\"15\n\"Two men opened fire at a church during the Easter service in an eastern Indonesian town, lightly wounded seven people, including a four-year-old girl, police said on Sunday. (...) Despite the attack, thousands of Christians in Poso, some 1,600 km north-east of Jakarta, flocked to churches in the lakeside town for Easter Sunday masses, Mr Tranggono said, adding hundreds of police had been deployed to secure the services.\"16\nThe panel is finally of the opinion that by the mere fact that an Indonesian is of Christian faith is not sufficient to conclude he or she should be given protection. The burden of proof is still on his or her shoulders.\nFor all the above reasons, the panel does not believe that the claimant provided credible evidence which would establish a possibility of future persecution or risk of harm. Therefore, the panel is of the opinion that there is no serious possibility that he would suffer the harm he alleged should he return to Indonesia. He is neither a \"Convention refugee\" nor a \"person in need of protection\".\nCONCLUSION\nThe claimant of Mr. XXXXX XXXXX is rejected.\nFarid Osmane\nFarid Osmane\nAugust 24, 2004\nDate\n\/grb\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C.

They are claiming to be Convention refugees and persons in need of protection within the meaning of sections 961 and 97(1)2 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nMs. XXXXX XXXXX was appointed as the designated representative of her minor child.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant, aged 24, and her son, aged 5, were born in Angola. The claimant's father, a Portuguese citizen, passed away in 1980. The claimant's mother, an Angolan citizen who was Portuguese by marriage, passed away in 1990.\nSince the claimant no longer had any family, she stayed with her mother's boss, XXXXX XXXXX and his wife, XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, both of whom are Portuguese. The claimant and her mother had been living with the XXXXX because the claimant's mother was their housekeeper. Despite her young age, the claimant replaced her mother as the housekeeper when her mother died. She had to quit school at age 14 to look after her adoptive mother (identified as such after her mother died) when she became ill. Her bosses abused her, and when she managed to escape, she would seek refuge with a female friend, with whom she began a clandestine romantic relationship.\nIn January 1998, the claimant admitted to her adoptive parents that she was homosexual, which triggered her adoptive father's anger. The claimant was hit again, which required her to stay in bed for two days. The claimant was subsequently raped by Mr. XXXXX who threatened to kill her if she reported him.\nThe claimant reported her sexual assailant to the police anyway. He was summoned the following day, but after he bribed the police, no charges were laid against him. The claimant was raped again at the end of February 1998, and the following month she discovered she was pregnant. She claimed that she tried to commit suicide with pills, but that Ms. XXXXX came to her rescue and wanted to know who the father of her child was. Mr. XXXXX forced the claimant to say that it was one of his employees, a Mr. XXXXX who was homosexual as well. Mr. XXXXX agreed to give his name to the claimant's child.\nSeveral months later, Ms. XXXXX learned the truth from the neighbours, which resulted in Ms. XXXXX separating from her husband. This separation was short-lived: one month later, Mr. XXXXX came back home because his wife was ill and was financially dependent on him. This illness led the claimant and her bosses to Portugal so that Ms. XXXXX could receive treatment. The claimant's child was entrusted to Mr. XXXXX during their four-month trip to Portugal.\nDuring her stay, the claimant took steps to obtain a Portuguese passport because she was of that nationality by birth, her father being Portuguese. Mr. XXXXX seized this passport when they returned to Angola.\nIn XXXXX 2003, Ms. XXXXX passed away and her husband turned to alcohol, which resulted in him trying to sexually assault the claimant again. She managed to flee and sought refuge at Mr. XXXXX home. With Mr. XXXXX help, the claimant left Angola on XXXXX, 2004 with her child and a false Portuguese passport. After travelling via Portugal and the United States, she arrived at the border at Lacolle on XXXXX, 2004 and claimed refugee protection.\nThe claimant submitted that she cannot live in Portugal because Mr. XXXXX being Portuguese, would be able to find her.\nDECISION\nThe panel determines that the claimants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection for the reasons set out below.\nANALYSIS\nTo establish her identity, the claimant filed an identity card issued by the Portuguese Republic (Exhibit P-2), which was seized by Immigration Canada. The panel has a certified true copy on file (Exhibit A-2). Regarding the minor claimant, a personal book issued by the Republic of Angola (Exhibit P-3) was filed, also seized by Immigration Canada (Exhibit A-2). The panel finds that the claimants provided acceptable documents establishing their identities within the meaning of section 106 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nTo start, the panel wishes to point out that the claimant testified that she had travelled with a false passport between Angola and Portugal when she went to that country in XXXXX 2003 with her adoptive parents. She stated that this was because of the urgency of their departure in light of Ms. XXXXX health condition. The claimant stated that she returned to Angola with her identity card and Portuguese passport, issued in her name (Exhibits P-2 and A-2), during her stay. However, since Mr. XXXXX had confiscated this passport, according to the claimant, she had travelled with her son to the United States using a false Portuguese passport that did not contain her name or her photo. She stated that when she arrived in New York, she threw away, under no force or duress, all her travel documents, including her passport, allegedly simply at the direction of Mr. XXXXX who was still in Angola. Needless to say, that act deprived the panel of important, relevant documents that could at least have corroborated the claimant's testimony that it was indeed Angola that she had left, and not Portugal or some other country, to come to Canada via the United States, with false travel documents.3\nThe claimant testified to being a citizen of Angola and also of Portugal by birth, since her father had been Portuguese. Her parents had approached the Portuguese authorities when she was born to obtain citizenship for her for that country as well. As for her child, the claimant testified that he is Angolan because he was born in Angola and that he is Portuguese as well because the claimant has Portuguese citizenship.\nWhen asked to tell the panel what steps or formalities she had had to complete to have her son granted Portuguese citizenship by the authorities of that country, the claimant answered that she had had to follow the procedure - in other words, go to the Portuguese embassy and submit [translation] \"her papers\" to prove that she is Portuguese. Therefore, it is a simple formality, and Portuguese officials do not have the discretionary power to deny her child Portuguese citizenship.\nThe panel believes it is unnecessary and redundant to undertake a lengthy analysis of the credibility of the claimant's testimony, which on several points is not trustworthy, because the panel believes that there is no reasonable chance that the claimant and her son would be persecuted and\/or threatened if they were to return to Portugal.\nAt the start of the hearing, the panel directed that it would first like to hear the evidence concerning the refugee protection claimants' fear of returning to Portugal. The claimant stated that Mr. XXXXX a Portuguese citizen, had family in that country and that it would be easy for him to find them. She claimed that Mr. XXXXX had sworn that he would kill her and her son. During the hearing, the claimant was confronted with the statements she had made at the port of entry, where she had said that she could not seek refuge in Portugal because she did not know anyone there, which is inconsistent with her oral and written testimonies, in which she claimed that it was because Mr. XXXXX would be able to find her there, which is a point she did not bring up when she claimed refugee protection. When asked to explain this, the claimant responded that she had been tired and nervous when she arrived.\nWhen confronted with independent, trustworthy documentary evidence4 indicating that Portugal is a democratic country with an independent legal system and police officers who protect citizens, the claimant gave no response that the panel considered to be reasonable and of use. Since this was a crucial point, the panel restated the question and asked the claimant why she could not go to the Portuguese authorities for assistance and protection. This time, the claimant answered that she had learned from some acquaintances that lesbians and homosexuals were discriminated against in Portugal. Since she had evaded the question, it was repeated for the third and final time. The claimant thought at length and then said that she had decided to come here (to Canada), not there (to Portugal). When asked to explain her answer, the claimant testified that she knew that, in Canada, the government would protect her, whereas in Portugal she did not know this. The claimant was confronted with her written testimony, in which she states that she lived in Portugal for four months; she was then asked what had led her to believe that the authorities in that country would not protect her. Once again, the claimant attempted to evade the question by saying that, during her stay in Portugal, she had seen on the televised news that homosexuals had been assaulted in that country. The question was repeated to her again, this time stressing that she was seeking protection against Mr. XXXXX. The claimant answered [translation] \"I don't know\".\nAs to her fear of persecution as a lesbian, the claimant was confronted with the documentary evidence filed as Exhibit A-4,5 which indicates that there is a centre for the gay and lesbian community in Portugal, that homosexuality is not a crime in that country and that homosexuals are not persecuted there either. The claimant again said that, during her stay in Portugal, she had heard on the news that some homosexuals had been assaulted in the streets because society does not accept them. When asked to tell the panel whether, to her knowledge, the police had intervened during the alleged assault, the claimant answered [translation] \"I suppose so, but I'm not sure,\" and added that she had seen on television that the police were there, but that she did not know what had happened after that.\nThe panel rejects the claimant's explanations as unsatisfactory. The claimant has the responsibility to provide clear and convincing evidence demonstrating that the Portuguese state is unable to protect her.6 Portugal has not experienced a complete breakdown of its state apparatus, and as such, we must assume that the Portuguese state is capable of protecting its nationals. The documentary evidence7 clearly shows that state protection is available and accessible in Portugal. The claimant did not rebut the presumption that she could avail herself of Portuguese state protection. Refugee protection claimants have the obligation to seek the protection of their own country before claiming refugee protection in another country. The panel finds that the Portuguese state is able to protect the claimants, and there is no evidence demonstrating that such protection would be ineffective.\nCONCLUSION\nAfter analysing all the evidence, and given the lack of credibility of the claimants, the panel determines that they are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.\nMoreover, setting aside the evidence found to be not credible, the panel has no other evidence before it, from either the documentation on the country or any other source, that could lead the panel to the conclusion that the claimants are Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.\nThe panel rejects the refugee protection claim made by XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX and her son, XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX.\nRuth Delisle\nMe Ruth Delisle\nJuly 14, 2004\nDate\n1 96.

The Ministry of XXXXX employed him as a XXXXX from 1991 to 2004. He claims to fear being persecuted by homophobic persons in society at large because of his membership in a particular social group, namely, homosexuals.\nThe claimant also alleges he has been a carrier of the AIDS virus for 11 years. He alleges that, since 2003, he has had problems obtaining the retroviruses needed to treat his condition. At XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX hospital, where the claimant was being treated, the medications were administered to him irregularly.\nOn April 6, 2004, the claimant participated in a march to denounce this situation, and that is when his colleagues and the XXXXX XXXXX learned of his sexual orientation and that he had AIDS. The claimant was subsequently threatened and pressured by them, with the result that he was unable to work XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX because he risked \"infecting\" them.\nOn April 7, 2004, he was barred entry to the XXXXX and was attacked and threatened by his co-workers and his XXXXX XXXXX. He also received telephone calls at his home telling him that his house was going to be burned down. On April 10, 2004, stones were thrown at his house and injurious words were written on the walls. In the circumstances, the claimant left his house at his mother's request to go and live with a friend in XXXXX.\nThe claimant alleges that after speaking with representatives of the Ministry of XXXXX, he was offered another position as an office worker rather than as a XXXXX. The claimant turned down this offer because he had studied to become a XXXXX, and besides, he claims that his co-workers refused to work with him.\nOwing to this discrimination the claimant alleges having suffered in his country, he decided to leave Costa Rica on XXXXX, 2004, for Canada. He made his claim for refugee protection on May 21, 2004.\nDETERMINATION\nAfter having analysed both the testimonial and documentary evidence, and after having heard the representations of the refugee protection officer (RPO) and of counsel, the panel determines that the claimant has not shown there would be a \"reasonable chance of persecution\" were he to return to his country, and is therefore not a \"Convention refugee\". Nor has he shown that he is a \"person in need of protection\".\nANALYSIS\nThe claimant bases his claim on his homosexuality and the fact that he has AIDS, the reason he was persecuted by XXXXX XXXXX, who allegedly threatened his life; and he fears society at large.\nHe further alleges he is the victim of discrimination, since the retroviruses he needs to treat his AIDS were not administered to him regularly. For all these reasons, he fears returning to his country.\nJURISPRUDENTIAL GUIDES\nThe jurisprudential guides pertaining to criminality and sexual orientation in Costa Rica have been disclosed in this case. The panel believes that the decision of our colleague Schlanger, Decision TA0-15870, applies in this case, since certain facts and the evidence regarding conditions in that country are quite similar to those in the present case.4\nThe determinative issue in this case is whether the state of Costa Rica can ensure the claimant's protection. In the above-cited decision, extensive analysis was done as to the existence of a thriving homosexual community in Costa Rica and the fact that the community was not the target of systematic persecution by the authorities or by society at large. It also closely perused the documentary evidence pertaining to sexual minorities, the police, mechanisms for lodging complaints of police abuse, recourses for victims of violence and discrimination, and the level of democracy in Costa Rica.\nIn the case in point, the claimant, who claims to have received death threats on April 7, 2004, from the XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, and to have been attacked at his home on April 10, 2004, when stones were thrown at it and injurious words were written on the walls, never filed a complaint with the police. According to his testimony, he took no steps to do so, because he was afraid he would be asked questions about his sexual orientation and his illness.\nAs mentioned earlier, in Decision TA0-15870, all recourses available to the claimant were closely perused. If the claimant did indeed receive death threats, it is reasonable to think he would have filed a complaint with the police, particularly as he knew the names of the XXXXX who were threatening him. The panel also notes that if the police officers abused their authority, the claimant could have filed a complaint with the Office of the Ombudsman. In addition to the Ombudsman, there is also the Constitutional Court, which can help protect the rights of sexual minorities if they are threatened. In the above-cited decision, a number of other non-government organizations are mentioned as also providing assistance in protecting the rights of sexual minorities.\nThe claimant also claims he was the victim of discrimination in the workplace, since his employer told him he could no longer keep his XXXXX position because he had AIDS, but that he was offered another position within the Ministry of XXXXX as an office worker. On this point, at the hearing, the claimant provided many details about the advice he received from the XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX where he XXXXX. He told of receiving a number of telephone calls from her following the incident of April 7, 2004, when a group of XXXXX and colleagues barred his entry to the XXXXX. Yet, in his narrative, the claimant makes no reference to his private conversations with the XXXXX, but instead refers to conversations with representatives of the Ministry of XXXXX. When asked to explain this discrepancy, for any comment, the claimant said it was not important. The panel is of the view that he had the possibility of complaining about the conduct of the Ministry of XXXXX authorities. In fact, in the above-cited decision, it states that a person who has been discriminated in the workplace can file a complaint with the Ministry of Labour. In the present case, the panel notes that the claimant worked at the Ministry of XXXXX since 1988 and was employed by this ministry as a XXXXX from XXXXX 1991 until XXXXX 2004, and his employment was somewhat stable for quite some time. The panel further notes that his employer offered him another position as an office worker, and if the claimant believed he was the victim of discrimination he could have pursued the matter by filing a complaint with the Ministry of Labour.\nFinally, the claimant alleges that he was a victim of discrimination because he was occasionally denied the medications he needed to treat his health condition, being infected with the AIDS virus. At the hearing, the claimant provided many details about the medications he was unable to obtain regularly at the hospital where he was being treated, and said this was one of the reasons he was seeking the protection of Canada. However, when the claimant claimed this protection and was examined by an Immigration Canada officer on May 28, 2004, he made no mention of this reason. He spoke of discrimination because of his homosexuality and the fact that he is HIV-positive. The officer continued the examination, asking him if he took \"medication,\" and the claimant said, [translation] \"Yes, I take three medications together that cost $600 a month paid for by the government\". If the claimant was indeed occasionally denied the retroviruses he needed to treat his medical condition and this was a reason he was claiming refugee protection, it is reasonable to think he would have spontaneously told the officer who interviewed him on May 28, 2004, about the problems related to obtaining his medications. The documentary evidence on the record and quoted below makes no mention of problems with the administration of the medications for carriers of the HIV virus in Costa Rica. In fact, the report of Andrew Reding5 refers to two favourable decisions rendered by the Supreme Court of Costa Rica in favour of people with HIV. Notably, at page 45, we can read as follows:\nIn 1997, the Costa Rican Supreme Court issued two rulings benefiting persons afflicted with AIDS. In the first, it found that the Calder\u00f3n Guardia Hospital discriminated illegally against AIDS victims for over 10 years by refusing to provide laboratory services for them. The second ruling directed the Costa Rican Social Security Fund (Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social, CCSS) to provide antiretroviral medications to a psychology graduate student who was ill with AIDS. In its verdict, the court stated that \"medical assistance is a duty of the Costa Rican State, derived from the concepts of justice and social solidarity contained in the Constitution, and the mission it assigns to the Costa Rican Social Security Fund.\" Until that decision, it had been CCSS policy to provide treatment only to pregnant women infected with HIV.\nCosta Rica is now the only country in Central America that provides advanced antiretroviral cocktail therapy to all who need it, including foreign residents.\nIn addition, the panel notes that if the claimant was indeed denied medication, he could have sought a recourse of protection before the Constitutional Court, as noted in the above-cited decision.6\nIn view of all the above, given the various remedies available to the claimant to deal with the abuse or misconduct of citizens or his employers, the panel does not find the claimant's reasons for his lack of effort to seek state protection to be persuasive, and finds that the claimant should have pursued the options open to him, by reporting the discrimination he suffered to the Ombudsman, the Ministry of Security, the Constitutional Court, or an agency dedicated to protecting homosexuals and lesbians in Costa Rica.\nIn the present case, the claimant never sought the protection of his country. It was incumbent upon him to overcome the presumption that the authorities were able to protect him. While the situation is not perfect in Costa Rica, this panel cannot conclude that there is clear and convincing evidence that the Costa Rican state would be incapable of protecting the claimant if he had to return to his country.\nCONCLUSION\nIn view of the foregoing, the panel determines that the evidence submitted to it is insufficient to establish that the claimant, XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, should he return to his country of origin, Costa Rica, could face persecution on a Convention ground, and that there would be a \"serious possibility\" of his being subject to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nAccordingly, the panel rejects his claim.\nMarie Chevrier\nMarie Chevrier\nDecember 17, 2004\nDate\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP - HOMOSEXUAL - STATE PROTECTION - CREDIBILITY - DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE - NEGATIVE - COSTA RICA\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C.

(1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\n(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or\n(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person in unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.\n3 Exhibit A-3, Immigration documents ?see claimant's passport ?.\n4 Exhibit A-2, Index of the update of April 19, 2004, including the package of documents in support of the Jurisprudential Guides (May 2003), including Decision TA0-15870.\n5 Exhibit A-4, Index of the Montreal Regional Binder - Costa Rica, September 20, 2004, Exhibit 7.5, pages 45 and 46.\n6 Supra, note 4.\n---------------\n---------------\n---------------\n---------------\nNo. dossier SPR \/ RPD file #: MA4-03463\n6\n",

In Colombia she was educated, worked and lived in Bogot\u00e1. Her father worked for XXXXX in Colombia for 25 years and because of his work did much travelling by road. Because of his association with this large well-known government company her father was well known and was sometimes robbed of food and money on his road travels. Her father retired from XXXXX and set up his own company but work for this company also entailed travel by road in Colombia.\nThe claimant came to Canada to study because her father insisted that knowledge of the English language was important to her, but also because of the armed conflict in Colombia. She arrived in Canada with student authorization on July 31, 1999. She claimed refugee protection on January 12, 2000.\nDetermination\nThe panel finds that the claimant is not a Convention refugee as she does not have a well-founded fear of persecution. The panel finds that if removed to Colombia the claimant would not face a risk to her life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment beyond the risk faced generally by other individuals in Colombia. No evidence was adduced that could lead the panel to find that substantial grounds exist to believe that she will be subjected personally to a danger of torture.\nAnalysis\nAt the hearing the clamant specified that she feared being kidnapped or killed by the FARC should she return to Colombia. She was asked to tell of any interactions between the FARC and her father, siblings or herself in Colombia.\nShe testified that when her father travelled by road on his work for XXXXX he would, sometimes, be stopped by persons who identified themselves as members of the FARC. These persons would demand of her father the cash he had on him together with any food that he may have in the car. Her father would then be allowed to continue on his journeys. She further testified that her father stopped working for XXXXX in 1996 or 1997 and together with former co-workers at XXXXX started his own\ncompany. Travelling for his own company, though less frequently than when with XXXXX, he was still sometimes stopped by the FARC with the same demands as formerly. The claimant testified that for the past three years her father has travelled by air on behalf of his company so has not encountered the FARC.\nAccording to the claimant the instances noted above were the only problems encountered by her father from the FARC. Given the information in the documents on Colombia, the panel accepts, on a balance of probabilities, that her father was sometimes stopped on his road journeys and did have to hand over monies and food that he had with him in his car. However, that was the extent of the harm suffered by the claimant's father. The claimant was clear that nothing further happened. There were no threats involving her, no mention of her by the FARC, nothing that would presage harm to her by the FARC based on her father's interactions with persons in the FARC while travelling for either XXXXX or his own company.\nThe claimant attended school and university in Bogota and had no interactions there with the FARC. In her job she travelled day and night by public transport, using taxis when her shift work entailed travel at times when buses were no longer running. The journey lasted thirty minutes. She had no interactions with the FARC. She testified that as far as she knew neither of her brothers had experienced contact with the FARC in Bogota. She testified that three months ago her father and youngest brother (10 years old) moved from Bogota to the town where her paternal grandparents live - XXXXX, about three hours drive from Bogota. The claimant had no evidence that in XXXXX her father or brother had experienced any interactions with the FARC.\nWith the evidence before it the panel cannot find that there is a reasonable chance that the claimant would face persecution by members of the FARC based on the limited interactions between her father and members of the FARC, interactions that stopped once her father started travelling by air three years ago.\nColombia is a country in which a civil war has been ongoing for decades and in which extortion and kidnapping are common. This is not a claimant who presented evidence that the FARC had any information about her or had sought any information on her. They had not uttered any threats against her. Based on the evidence of the claimant's life in Colombia and the lives of her father and siblings, the panel lacks evidence that the FARC could perceive the claimant as opposed to them either based on their political values, their links with the drug trade, or any of that guerrilla group's other activities. Since her father stopped travelling on his business by road he has not encountered problems from the FARC. The panel does not find in the evidence before it that the claimant, if removed to Colombia, would face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment there other than the risk faced generally by other individuals in that country.\nThe claimant at the hearing admitted that she would have returned to Colombia when her student's authorization ended in XXXXX 2001 but for her father's advice that she remain in Canada. She says that he did not tell her why he so advised. The panel therefore lacks information to lead it to find that his advice was based on any threats directed to the claimant or any fear of harm to her in Colombia beyond the general risk faced by all Colombians in the on going civil war there.\nThe claimant said that her fear of return to Colombia was also based on her marriage in Canada to a Canadian citizen. She said that if she returned to Colombia her husband would be perceived as wealthy, and because of her relationship with him she would be perceived as wealthy and therefore be more vulnerable to kidnapping. She testified that her husband works in the construction trade here and that he was originally from Chile.\nThe panel lacks credible evidence that a naturalized Canadian working in the construction trade would be perceived as wealthy in Colombia. Further the panel lacks credible evidence that would allow it to find that because of her marriage there is a reasonable chance that the claimant would face persecution from the FARC based on her membership of a particular social group: wife of a Chilean citizen who became a naturalized Canadian citizen.\nThe panel lacks sufficient evidence that would allow it to find that should the claimant return to Colombia her marriage to her husband would put her life at risk, or put her at a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment greater or different than the generalized risk of random violence there in the continuing civil war.\nThe panel lacks credible evidence that would allow it to find that the claimant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of refugee protection pursuant to s. 97. (1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nAccordingly, the panel rejects the claim to refugee protection of XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX.\n\"Hope Sealy\"\nHope Sealy\nDATED at Toronto this 30th day of April 2004\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - PERSON IN NEED OF PROTECTION - RISK TO LIFE - RISK OF CRUEL AND UNUSUAL TREATMENT OR PUNISHMENT - GENERALIZED RISK - NOT FACED GENERALLY BY OTHER INDIVIDUALS - FEMALE - NEGATIVE - COLOMBIA\n1 Exhibit R-2.

They alleged that they cannot return to Macedonia or Yugoslavia. The claimants met when the male claimant was in Macedonia on holiday, married on XXXXX, 1996 and lived in Prizren, Kosovo until the war began in January 1998.\nDuring the war, there was no tolerance for Albanians in Kosovo married to spouses of different ethnic backgrounds. The claimants alleged that a neighbour married to a Serbian woman was killed, along with his family in XXXXX or XXXXX 1998. Following this, the claimants moved to another city, Jakovo, where they lived with the husband's aunt until XXXXX 2000.\nWhile there, the male claimant assisted others to try to defend themselves against attacks by other groups such as the Serbs. He also helped to evacuate people from areas that were dangerous because of the fighting in Kosovo. The group was known as the UCK. The couple were advised by her husband's friend that it had become known by the UCK that the female claimant was Macedonian and that their lives could be in danger at the hands of the Albanian people. The couple crossed illegally into Albania and stayed with a friend of her husband until they arranged to come to Canada. The claimants alleged that they could not go to Macedonia because the male claimant is not Macedonian and it is too dangerous being married to an Albanian. They cannot return to Kosovo for the same reason, a mixed marriage.\nOn the day of the hearing, the claimants amended their Personal Information Forms (PIFs)2 to read that the male claimant advised others on how to defend themselves and that he advised people that they could help them to evacuate in areas that might be dangerous. The hearing was held over three days, March 4, 2003, December 9, 2003 and January 13, 2004.\nDecision\nI find that the male claimant is excluded under Section 1F of the Refugee Convention and is therefore not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. I also find that the claimants are not Convention refugees as they do not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Kosovo or Macedonia. I also find that the claimants are not persons in need of protection in that their removal to Macedonia or Kosovo would not subject them to personally to a risk to their lives or to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, and in that there are no substantial grounds to believe that their removal to Kosovo or Macedonia will subject them personally to a danger of torture.\nAnalysis\nAt the beginning of the hearing, the claimants were told that credibility and their perceived political profiles, ethnicity and membership in a particular social group, that is families, were issues and that the onus was on them to establish their claims. The claimants also identified religion as an issue but no mention of this was made in their PIF narratives. The member added change of circumstances to the issues and allowed counsel time to speak with the claimants with respect to the added issue. There are numerous instances of inconsistencies, implausibilities and omissions which led the panel to find the claimant had failed in this responsibility. The following, while examples, are not exhaustive. The panel notes the following:\n* Where a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption of truthfulness unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness.3\n* The existence of contradictions and inconsistencies in the evidence of a claimant is a well accepted basis for a finding of lack of credibility.4\n* The Board does not have to accept a witness's testimony simply because it was not contradicted at the hearing.\n* The Board is entitled to make reasonable findings based on implausibilities, common sense and rationality.5\n* The Board is forward looking in its decision-making.6\n* The Board is entitled to prefer the documentary evidence to that of the claimant originating from a variety of reputable mutually independent sources to that of the claimant because they are objective and have no interest in any refugee claim.\nAt the end of the first day of testimony, it was decided by the member to ascertain if the Minister was interested in intervening. The Minister issued a Notice to Intervene on May 16, 2003.7 The panel also notes the following:\n* The onus is clearly on the Minister to establish that there are serious reasons to consider that the individual has committed an excludable act.\n* The meaning of the standard serious reasons for considering is now determined in Canadian law as a lower standard of proof than a balance of probabilities.8\n* Serious reasons for considering and reasonable grounds to believe with respect to exclusion require something more than suspicion or conjecture but something less than proof on a balance of probabilities.9\nPersonal Identity, Female Claimant\nThe panel will deal with the identity of the female claimant first and for this section of the reason, she will be referred to as the claimant. On the first day of the hearing, the female claimant had only her birth certificate in support of her identity,10 the claimants having travelled to Canada on fraudulent Finland passports.11 The birth certificate had no photograph on it. When asked how she obtained the certificate, the claimant alleged that her sister went to the police station in her town and simply asked for the document with no letter or other indication that the claimant required the document or that the sister had the right to obtain it, stating in her words, that they \"give her easy\". She testified that she received it in April or March 2002 and that it was an original just like the one she had before, which she alleged had expired. The claimant testified that her original birth certificate is in her parents' home.\nThe claimant testified that no one in her family has spoken to her since she was married in 1996 because they disapproved of her marriage. She has spoken to her sister to help obtain documents and who allegedly is more tolerant than the rest of the family. The claimant alleged that Macedonian birth certificates expire about every two years. The female claimant was directed to the date of issue, June 5, 2001 and to the fact that there was no expiry date on it, nor was there a place for an expiry date. The claimant was asked to explain how the date of issue was June 2001 when she received it in March 2002. The Refugee Protection Officer (RPO) asked her when she requested it. The claimant alleged that she had contacted her sister when she finished her PIF with her lawyer. The claimant was told that she had signed her PIF on June 14, 2001. The claimant then alleged that she had had a meeting with her lawyer before they finished the PIF and he told them they needed a minimum, birth certificate and after that she contacted her sister. The claimant was inconsistent in her testimony, alleging first that she contacted her sister when she finished her PIF, then alleging that it was before she finished her PIF and offered no explanation for the lack of an expiry date, despite the fact that she had alleged that Macedonian birth certificates expire about every two years.\nThe screening form indicates that several documents were required, including, but not limited to, passports, birth certificates, marriage certificates, identity cards, and evidence of religious and political affiliation. Earlier, when her counsel asked her if they had tried to obtain documents such as their marriage certificate and religious affiliation, the claimant alleged that they had contacted the male claimant's brother for the documents in February 2003, about a month ago, and that she would try to contact her sister again for a document indicating her religious affiliation.\nIn part, the claim is based on the fact that the claimants are of different religions, she a Christian, he, a Muslim, which they allege is not accepted by either their parents or society. I do not accept as credible that the claimant would ask her sister to obtain only her birth certificate before she signed the PIF and then asked for the other required documents much later. The claimant testified that her sister had only to go to the police station and request a birth certificate with no information from the individual involved. The claimant's testimony was inconsistent with respect to when she requested the document and there is a lack of an expiry date on the certificate or even a place for an expiry date, despite the claimant's allegation that birth certificates expire about every two years. The country documents show that fraudulent documents are easily obtained in Macedonia. Therefore, given the claimant's lack of credibility and the availability of fraudulent documents, on a balance of probabilities, I give the birth certificate no weight.\nThe Board received additional identity documents on December 5, 2003, including a Certificate for Holy Baptism and a health card for the female claimant.12 The claimant alleged that they came from her sister, who had lots of trouble with her parents in obtaining the documents. The sister did not, however, obtain the original birth certificate which the claimant alleged was at her parents' home. The claimant alleged that her parents disapproved of her marriage and had not spoken to her since she married in 1996. The claimant alleged that her parents are still angry with her and that her sister took a chance in speaking to her. The baptismal certificate is dated May 7, 2003. The Health Card lacks the year, although there is a place for it, 19--. On a balance of probabilities, I find the claimant's action with respect to obtaining documentary evidence regarding her personal identity is inconsistent with those of someone who fears persecution.\nThe claimant alleged that her parents did not approve of her marriage. Later she alleged that before 1989, Muslims and Christians used to get married, but with the first demonstrations in 1989, it, the hatred, started and she never knew it. If, as she testified that she never knew about the hatred, then, on a balance of probabilities, her family was not a part of it. It is implausible that the claimant would not know of the religious hatred between Muslims and Christians if it was in her own family.\nGiven the claimant's lack of credibility above, the timing of the receipt of the documents, that is in December 2003, when the claimants had sufficient time to obtain these documents prior to the first hearing, and given the availability of fraudulent documents in Macedonia, I give these documents no weight.\nThe claimant tendered her marriage certificate in support of her identity as a Macedonian citizen. It was allegedly issued by the United Nations, obtained by the male claimant's brother, according to the male claimant's testimony. The place for the citizenship of the male claimant has been left blank. The claimant explained that this was because it was issued in Prizren, his place of birth. The female claimant testified that the Board could accept the documents as authentic because they all contained the identification numbers of the claimant, which she testified would be on every document issued to citizens of their countries.\nThe male claimant did not secure an Identity Card, explaining that the records were destroyed during the war. The member stated that she had specialized knowledge that the U.N. provided Identification Cards for purposes of identification for those whose cards had been lost or destroyed in the war. The claimant stated that he did not know how they, meaning others, got them. The male claimant gave varying testimony about his marriage:\n* He said his parents were unhappy with his marriage\n* He said his parents were dead when he was married, explaining that he meant family when he said parents\n* He reiterated that his mother was dead when he got married\n* The male claimant then testified that his mother was not present at the marriage because she was sick with cancer\n* He testified that he was married in October of 1996, not May, 1996\n* He said that he was not married by a Muslim priest but in a civil ceremony. When asked if there was a word other than priest to designate the Muslim religious official, (the interpreter stated that that was his word, as he, the interpreter was a Christian). The question was put to the claimant, if there was another word for a Muslim clergyman. The claimant testified that no, that was the one.\nGiven the above inconsistent testimony while his own counsel was asking questions and who gave the claimant every opportunity to explain the inconsistencies, and again, given the availability of fraudulent documents in Kosovo,13 I give no weight to the marriage certificate with respect to the female claimant's Macedonian citizenship.\nCounsel indicated in his questioning that the claimants were asked for all the documents mentioned in the screening form. The panel is aware that documents are not necessary to establish identity if there is a reasonable explanation as to how the claimant tried to obtain such documents and why they were unobtainable. The claimants had from at least June 14, 2001 when they signed their PIFs, until March 2002, the date of the first sitting in the hearing to obtain the required documents before the first hearing. In addition, the claimants had no knowledge that the hearings would be continuing beyond the first scheduled day. The identification documents came in only after the first hearing and when in February 2003 the claimants asked for them. The claimants were represented by counsel. Their lack of diligence in pursuing their case is inconsistent with the actions of persons who really feared for their lives.\nThe female claimant's health card is missing the year of the date of issue. The female claimant was challenged with respect to her birth certificate. On a balance of probabilities, I give the identification documents of the female claimant as to her citizenship as a Macedonian no weight. Counsel submitted that there was no indication that the information on the documents was in question and that it would be difficult to have so many documents with the correct identity numbers in them. The female claimant did, however, testify that the identification numbers were the same on all the documents and therefore, she knew that consistency was required. She also gave inconsistent testimony as to when she asked her sister for the birth certificate, changing it to accommodate the date of issue. The panel notes that the panel cannot be satisfied that the evidence is credible or trustworthy, unless satisfied that it is probably so, not just possibly so.14 Therefore, on a balance of probabilities, given the overall inconsistencies of the claimants with respect to the female claimant's Macedonian identity, I find that I cannot make a finding that the claimant is a citizen of Macedonia.\nPersonal Identity, Male Claimant\nThe male claimant has established his identity as a citizen of Yugoslavia through his Yugoslavian Driver's License which contained his picture and is dated XXXXX, 1972,15 and through his testimony as to his citizenship, which the panel accepts as credible with no implication as to the rest of his testimony.\nExclusion\nThe Minister filed the Notice of Intent to Intervene in the refugee hearing of the male claimant on the basis that his involvement with the UCK (Ushtria Clirimatrae E Kosoves) also known as the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) which raised matters involving Article 1F(a) of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and therefore exclusion became an issue. The KLA have been documented for widespread, systematic and severe human rights abuses, including ill treatment and torture of detainees.16 The panel will comment on the material contained in these documents at length further in the reason.\nCrimes Against Humanity\nArticle VI of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal defines Crimes Against Humanity as \"murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation and other inhumane acts committed against any civilian populations. Leaders, organizers, instigators and accomplishes participating in the formulation or execution of the common plan or conspiracy to commit any of the foregoing crimes are responsible for all the acts performed by any persons in execution of such plan.17\nThe Federal Court ruled crimes against humanity may be defined by various international instruments but courts may also consider statements of academics, commentators and various domestic, international courts, and tribunals in defining crimes against humanity since they flesh out the bare bones of the definition provided by such international instruments as the Charter in the International Military Tribunal.18\nThe Canadian Parliament defines crimes against humanity as: Murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, imprisonment, torture, sexual violence, persecution, or any other inhumane act or omission that is committed against any civilian population or any identifiable group and that at the time and in the place of its commission, constitutes crimes against humanity according to customary international law or conventional international law or by virtue of its being criminal according to general principles of law recognized by the community of nations, whether or not it constitutes a contravention of the law in force at the time and place of its commission.19\nCrimes against humanity must generally be committed in a widespread or systematic fashion and may be committed in war or peace.20\nAccomplices as well as principle actors can be held subject to exclusion. The court interpreted the word 'committed' in Article 1F(a) by enunciating the following principles:\n(a) mere membership in an organization involved in international offences is not sufficient for exclusion from refugee status\n(b) personal and knowing participation in prosecutorial acts is required.\n(c) membership in an organization which is directed to a limited, brutal purpose, such as secret police activity, may by necessity point to personal and knowing participation\n(d) mere presence at the scene of prosecutorial acts does not qualify as personal and knowing participation\n(e) presence coupled with being an associate of the principal offenders amounts to personal and knowing knowledge\n(f) the existence of a shared common purpose and the knowledge that all parties have of it is sufficient evidence of complicity21\nAccording to Ramirez,22 one of the fundamental purposes upon which complicity rests is the existence of a shared common purpose: \"He was an active part of the military\nforces committing such atrocities, he was fully aware of what was happening and he could not succeed in disengaging himself merely by ensuring that he was never the one to inflict the pain or pull the trigger.\"\nMadame Justice Reed comments on the meaning of shared common purpose in Penate: As I understand the jurisprudence, it is that a person who is a member of the persecuting group and who has knowledge that the activities are being committed by the group and who neither takes steps to prevent them occurring (if he has the power to do so), nor disengages himself from the group at the earliest opportunity (consistent with the safety of himself), but who lends his active support to the group will be considered to be an accomplice. A shared common purpose will be considered to exist.23\nIn Gutierrez, the court stated as follows: \"three prerequisites must be established in order to provide complicity in the commission of an international offence: (1) membership in an organization which committed international offences as a continuous part of its operation, (2) personal and knowing participation, and (3) failure to disassociate from the organization at the earliest safe opportunity.\"\nThe Federal Court has dealt with complicity in a number of cases involving 1F(a) exclusion.24 Six factors have been identified in analysing complicity, namely, method of recruitment, (voluntary\/involuntary), nature of the organization, position\/rank in the organization, knowledge of atrocities committed by the organization, opportunities to leave the organization and length of time in the organization.\nMethod of Recruitment\nIn this section of the hearing, the male claimant was testifying and I will refer to him as the claimant. The claimant gave conflicting evidence about what happened with respect to his recruitment. On the first day of the hearing, the claimant alleged that he was in hiding at the time the KLA knocked at the door to inquire about his uncle who was involved with, and was organizing for, the KLA. Because the uncle was an old man, according to the claimant, the KLA came to inquire about him because he had not gone. The KLA saw the claimant there and asked where he was from. The claimant told them that he was from Prizren and had only been there for two weeks, because his house had been destroyed. He did not tell them that he was married to a Macedonian woman. They told the claimant that he should go with them as they worked for the people. The claimant alleged that he told them he would go, as he had nothing to hide. The claimant alleged that he stayed with them for four months, went every week for about three days a week and they used to teach them how to use the arms during the first week of training, so they, including the claimant, were shooting things, specific targets.\nThe claimant went on to further explain that sometimes they did not use real ammunition in training after the first week. He also alleged that the situation was getting better and they would go to meet people in different villages to meet people who lost sons to see if they needed help which the claimant alleged they could give them. The claimant alleged that he was trained because he had not completed his military service.\nThe claimant testified that he went with the KLA because he had nothing to hide. It was only later that he said that he also went because it might put his uncle in trouble.\nThe claimant alleged that he had been in hiding for two years when the KLA came to the door and that he was in the sitting room when his uncle opened the door and they came in. The claimant was asked why he did not immediately hide when the knock came. He testified that he thought it was neighbours or relatives. Although the claimant was given several opportunities to explain why he would not be afraid of neighbours, who he alleged had no interest in him, coming to the door, when he was allegedly hiding from everybody, including them, the claimant did not offer any explanation other than he had not done anything wrong.\nThe claimant testified that he had joined the KLA in 1999, but later stated that it was in 2000, as he had alleged in his PIF. Then after he saw what was written on the paper [narrative], he knew it was another time.\nThe member reminded the claimant that at the beginning of the hearing he had sworn to tell the truth. The claimant then testified that he responded that way because the KLA did not mean anything to him, that he did not kill anyone and that his main problem was that he was married to a Macedonian woman. The claimant stated that he knew he should have told the truth but that he did not pay much attention to it. I do not accept this as credible. The claimant identified the year he was with the KLA as 1999, he was sworn to tell the truth and he knew that at the hearing the panel would decide whether or not his claim for refugee status in Canada would be accepted. The claimant knew that his testimony was important. On a balance of probabilities, I find the claimant was with the KLA in 1999.\nThe claimant's description of the events by which he was recruited was inconsistent throughout. He testified that he was in hiding for two years, then was not concerned when the knock came on the door because he thought it was just the neighbours. Given the opportunity to explain the inconsistency, he reiterated that he thought it was neighbours and did not know that they would come inside but that he had done nothing wrong and had nothing to hide. I do not accept this as credible. The claimant alleged that he was hiding from the neighbours for two years but did not hide when a knock came on the door because he thought it was just neighbours. On a balance of probabilities, I find the claimant not to be a credible or a trustworthy witness with respect to either hiding from everyone or how the KLA found him.\nThe claimant testified that he went with the KLA partly willingly and partly because of his uncle. When asked to explain what he meant, the claimant testified that the KLA came to see if his uncle was sick because he had not been with them for a week. He testified that his aunt and uncle told him it was best that he go with the KLA and tell them that he was there only two weeks. He also testified that he told the KLA people that he was only there two weeks as soon as they asked about him. He further testified that it was partly by choice and partly because of his own situation that his wife was Macedonian and he wanted to show that he was not connected to Serbs. The claimant stated that his uncle was old and tired and that was why he had not gone. When the claimant went with the KLA, the uncle was able to stay home.\nThe claimant testified that he went to train in order to defend himself because he had not completed his military service. Originally, the claimant testified that he told the KLA people that he was from Prizren on the day they first came. Later, when asked by the Minister's Counsel, he testified that his aunt told them. Although not put to the claimant, this inconsistency was part of a pattern of inconsistencies with respect to his involvement with the KLA. The claimant also testified that he did not want to fight while he was in Prizren and a lot of them did not want to jeopardize their lives. He did not like war and did not see it as a choice. However, he testified that one of the reasons he went with the KLA was because he needed to learn how to defend himself as he had no military training. He said it was normal. It was only much later that the claimant alleged that he went unwillingly because what would happen to him would be what happened to others, he would be killed. He did not state this on the first sitting of the heearing when questioned by his counsel. Then he stated that he went with them, partly by choice and partly for his uncle's sake. Therefore, on a balance of probabilities, I find that the claimant went with the KLA willingly.\nNature of the Organization\nThe documentary evidence tendered by the Minister's representative, Mr. P. Singh, contains overwhelming evidence that the KLA has been involved in many and brutal human rights abuses. The following, while not exhaustive, are examples, the whole of which are contained in Exhibit M-3.\nHuman Rights Watch reports the KLA committed abuses in which they abducted and murdered civilians during and after the war.25 The KLA was responsible for serious human rights abuses in 1998, including abduction and murders of Serbs and ethnic Albanians considered collaborators with the state. The KLA, which evolved between 1996 and 1999 from a scattered guerrilla group to an armed movement and ultimately to a more formidable armed force, engaged in military tactics in 1998 and 1999 that put civilians at risk. KLA units sometimes staged an ambush or attacked police or army outposts from a village and then retreated, exposing villagers to revenge attacks. Large massacres sometimes ensued, helping publicize the KLA's cause and internationalize the conflict. It is clear that the KLA understood the political benefit of publicizing civilian deaths after having attacked Serbian checkpoints near ethnic Albanian villages, exposing civilians to revenge attacks. Elements of the KLA are also responsible for post-conflict attacks on Serbs, Roma and other non-Albanians, as well as ethnic Albanian rivals. Immediately following NATO's arrival in Kosovo, there was widespread and systematic burning and looting of homes belonging to Serbs, Roma and other minorities and the destruction of Orthodox Churches and monasteries. As many as one thousand Serbs and Roma have been murdered or have gone missing since June 1999. Elements of the KLA are clearly responsible for many of these crimes.26\nThe KLA was organized into seven operational zones including Dukagjin where Djakovica (Gjakova\/Jakova) was located, usually based around villages or series of villages. There was a central command structure discernable by 1998 and the KLA recognized Geneva Conventions. Despite the structures there are no known cases of KLA soldiers having been punished for human rights abuse.27 Prizren municipality was the site of many crimes during the period of NATO bombing. Villages north of the city were particularly hard hit due to KLA activity in the areas and the use of certain villages as rebel transit routes.28 One of the first regions hit by the Serbs after the NATO bombing was a series of villages along the ten kilometre stretch of road between Prizren and Djakovica. Many of the villages under attack were well known for their ongoing support of the KLA and arms were most likely flowing through these villages from Albania since 1998 and the KLA were frequently seen in and around the area, sometimes attacking police on the main road.29\nBy June 20, all Serbian and Yugoslav security forces had withdrawn, leaving Kosovo under the control of NATO-led Kosovo Force (FROR). The KLA and ethnic Albanians carried out widespread burning and looting of homes belonging to Serbs, Roma and other minorities. Members of minority groups in Kosovo have been detained, beaten and sometimes tortured with as many as one thousand Serbs and Roma reported unaccounted for after abductions since the end of the conflict. Although a desire for revenge provides some of the explanation for the violence, Human Rights Watch research suggests that a great deal of the violence is politically motivated; namely the removal from Kosovo of non-ethnic Albanians in order to justify an independent state.30 Thus it has become increasingly clear that the KLA is an organization with a single brutal purpose, that of removing non-ethnic Albanians from Kosovo. A Finnish forensic team was granted permission by the local Kosovo authorities to exhume bodies from six sites, three of which were expected to hold the bodies of victims of the KLA.31\nThe International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia was founded in May 1993. As of July 2001, the tribunal investigations against the KLA continued and the post conflict abuses against the Serbs and Roma were criticized as the seeds of future revenge and lasting instability in the region.32\nThe FAS Intelligence Resource Program reports that the KLA began in Macedonia in 1992 and appeared for the first time in public in 1996 assuming responsibility for a series of attacks committed against police stations and police men in Kosovo and Metohija. The KLA is organized in small compartmentalized cells and its strength is apparently divided between a manoeuvrable strike nucleus of a few hundred trained commandos and the much larger number of locally organized members active throughout the region.33 The hundreds of thousands of Kosovar Albanians are taking shelter in many of the KLA controlled areas. The KLA is receiving recruits from the refugee population in Albania primarily and they are training aggressively.34 Thousands of young Albanians left their jobs both in Kosovo and all across western Europe where they had been working to go and join the fighting for the independence of their homeland; a three per cent income tax on all exiles working in Germany, Austria and Switzerland and funds sent by family members working abroad. Arms were procured from all sources but the single most important early channel was from the Serbs themselves.35\nThe 1991 Amnesty International (AI) Report states that the KLA seeks independence for Kosovo by violent means and has attacked Serbian police, civilians and ethnic Albanians if regarded as loyal to the Serbian authorities.36 There were numerous reports of the UCK (KLA) and other armed Albanians perpetrated human rights abuses, particularly forcible displacement, ill treatment, abduction or deportation of non-combatants Serbian, Montenegrin, Albanian or Romani ethnicity.37\nAI report for 2000 notes that the KLA were responsible for widespread human rights abuses, the victims being Serbs, Roma and Albanians accused of collaboration with the Serbs. Hundreds of people were unlawfully killed or abducted and partly as a result of these attacks, more than half the non-Albanian population had fled Kosovo by the end of 1999.\nThe International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI) published on the World Socialist Website notes that the KLA's program is ethnic separatism, driving out of Kosovo Serbs, Montenegrans, and other minorities, creating a Greater Albania including Albania, and the Albanian populated areas of Macedonia.38 Given the above, on a balance of probabilities, I find that the KLA is an organization established for a single brutal purpose.\nComplicity\nIn Gutierrez, the court stated as follows: \"three prerequisites must be established in order to provide complicity in the commission of an international offence: (1) membership in an organization which committed international offences as a continuous part of its operation, (2) personal and knowing participation, and (3) failure to dissociate from the organization at the earliest safe opportunity.39\nMadame Justice Reed comments on the meaning of shared common purpose in Penate: As I understand the jurisprudence, it is that a person who is a member of the persecuting group and who has knowledge that the activities are being committed by the group and who neither takes steps to prevent them occurring (if he has the power to do so), nor disengages himself from the group at the earliest opportunity (consistent with the safety of himself), but who lends his active support to the group will be considered to be an accomplice. A shared common purpose will be considered.\nThe claimant was asked the purpose of the UCK (KLA) at the Port of Entry (POE). He stated that there is a need over there, that he had no house and he was married with a Macedonian girl. He further stated at that time that \"We used to go in the mountains to see if there were any Serbian people coming to protect our people, that he was in active combat for two to three hours and that he left the group because they found out he was married to a Macedonian and he was afraid they were going to kill him. He told the officer that he joined in 1999.40 The claimant testified when his counsel asked about this that he only trained for two or three hours for the first week and several hours the second. The claimant was asked questions about the information given at the POE. It has come to the attention of the Board that the interpreter there was inadequate, so the information on the POE for the male claimant was not considered with respect to any inconsistencies which arose because of it. However, the male claimant's testimony at the hearing will be considered. When asked if the claimant was in the mountains, for example to look for Serbs, the claimant testified that maybe the Serbs will come again. He further stated : \"So to protect the Albanians who live in the area, we could protect them in the case the Serbs came back.\"\nThe claimant had previously testified that the situation was getting better. Then when asked about the evacuation, he testified that the pressure was still on, NATO was there but the situation was not good, the killings were going on all the time and people were getting killed and that is why they trained \"us\". The claimant was inconsistent even as he testified and when given the chance to explain by his counsel and the Minister's counsel. His PIF referred to advising on the evacuation and advising people on defending themselves. The claimant testified that he was not qualified to do that. He had no reasonable explanation as to why his oral testimony was inconsistent with his PIF. On a balance of probabilities, I find the claimant not to be a credible or a trustworthy witness with respect to advising others on evacuation and self-defence. This is consistent with the KLA's operational procedure as described above.\nThe claimant was asked what he knew about the KLA, that is that it had a \"bad reputation\". He testified that he did only after he came to Canada. The claimant was asked if he was recruited to serve in the KLA in Prizren where he lived. He stated that he was not but that he would have left right away if he was, because he was well-known in Prizren and he would have problems because he was married to a Macedonian. The claimant testified that, if he was asked to join in Prizren, he would have never joined them because the KLA would have seen him as a collaborator. He joined in Jakovo because nobody knew that he was married to a Macedonian. He testified that he was not part of them, that is those who went and fought. Later the claimant testified that he would not have stayed in the KLA, but would have gotten on with his life.\nTherefore, on a balance of probabilities, I find that the claimant knew the reputation of the KLA and that they were known for killing Serbs and other minorities and that as long as they were no threat to him, he would have stayed until he could get on with his life. Therefore, on a balance of probabilities, I find that the claimant was complicit in the crimes against humanity of the KLA.\nThe claimant testified inconsistently with respect to other things which goes to the claimant's overall lack of credibility. For example, in his PIF, he stated that he advised people on how to evacuate. He confirmed this to his counsel by stating in answer to a question about evacuation, that there were still killings and that is why they trained us. Later, when the Minister's Counsel referred to the claimant's role in evacuation in the PIF, the claimant testified that he was not able to do that.\nThe claimant testified that he used real bullets. He told the Minister's Counsel that he did not. When the Minister's Counsel put the inconsistency to him, the claimant alleged that he meant that he used real weapons, not real bullets. He also originally testified that he trained for three to four hours for the first week and after that they had guns but no ammunition. Later he testified that he trained three to four hours the first day and three to five hours the second day. When the inconsistency was put to him, the claimant alleged that maybe he understood the question to mean how many hours he trained the first day.\nGiven the above, I do not accept the claimant's testimony as credible or trustworthy with respect to his participation in the KLA, including his training, his knowledge about the organization and when he was a member.\nOpportunities to Leave the Organization\nThe claimant was asked when he left the organization. He testified that he was told by a friend that others may had found out that he was married to a Macedonian. He testified that he left for Albania the next day. The claimant stayed with the organization as long as it was of no risk to him, regardless of the fact that he knew that others were at risk. He was able to leave as soon as he found out he was at risk. Therefore, on a balance of probabilities, I find that the claimant did not leave as soon as he was able without risk to himself. Therefore, on a balance of probabilities, I find that the claimant was complicit in the crimes of the KLA.\nI have found that the claimant joined the KLA of his own free will, which has been found to be an organization which was established for a single brutal purpose. I have found that the claimant knew about the reputation of the KLA and that they killed civilians and minorities. I have found that the claimant did not leave the organization as soon as he was able to without endangering himself. Therefore, I find that there are serious reasons for considering that the claimant should be excluded from protection under section F of Article 1 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nInclusion\nGiven that I cannot find the female claimant a citizen of Macedonia, I cannot find her either a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. I have found the male claimant excluded under Article 1F. Even if I had not so found, the country documents do not support the persecution alleged by the claimants in either country.\nYugoslavia\nIn YUG42036.E, the Research Directorate, in commenting on religious freedom with respect to Roman Catholics indicates that religious and ethnic discrimination is prohibited by law and the government generally respects this right in practice. Further, it states that religion is not a significant factor in Kosovo. Most Albanians [in Kosovo] know that their future security depends on tolerence and co-existence with other peoples. Their leaders recognize that any constitution must safeguard the rights of minorities. Marriage between Muslims and Catholics is so common that individual cases go unremarked.41 On a balance of probabilities, if marriage between one Christian denomination goes unremarked, I find that marriage between Muslims and other Christians, that is Orthodox, would also be accepted. In areas such as Prizren there is long acceptance among different communities.42\nIn addition, the male claimant tendered a letter of attestation in support of his claim to be a Muslim.43 The letter had no security features on it. The member declared that she had seen other letters of attestation from mosques in Kosovo that had such security features on them and asked the claimant to explain, if he could, why this letter had no such features. The claimant stated that it depends on the mosque. The claimant testified that he did not attend a mosque but observed some of the religious traditions such as Ramadan. When asked how his brother obtained the letter, he explained that while all the records of the Mosque were destroyed during the war, his brother asked for the letter, giving the particulars. The cleric then asked ten or more people who survived. The claimant alleged that he had been registered at birth at the mosque. The claimant's brother cannot be considered to be objective. Given the claimant's overall lack of credibility, I give the letter no weight. On a balance of probabilities, I find the claimant not to be a Muslim.\nEven if I found the claimant to be a Muslim, which I do not, I find there is not a serious possibility he would face persecution if he returned to Yugoslavia. In addition, no evidence was adduced which would support a finding that the male claimant would be at risk to his life, cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or to a danger of torture.\nMacedonia\nThe Ohrid Agreement was the culmination of negotiation that sought to end hostilities between ethnic Albanians and Macedonian government forces. It rejects violence for political aims and preserves Macedonia's unity by denying possible ethnic division of the country. Minority languages used by more that twenty per cent of the population, shall receive official status and speakers of these languages shall have the right to be provided public services, primary, secondary and university level education and judicial proceedings. Albanians meets the twenty per cent criteria.44\nThe female claimant stated that she had no fears if she returns to Macedonia. Therefore, even if I found the claimant to have established her identity as a citizen of Macedonia, which I do not, the claimant has no fear of returning to Macedonia. Therefore, there is not a serious possibility that she will face persecution or be at risk to her life, cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture.\nConclusion\nHaving considered all the evidence, I have found that there is no evidence by which I could find XXXXX XXXXX to have established her identity as a citizen of Macedonia and therefore she is not a Convention refugee and not a person in need of protection and I reject her claim.\nI have found there are serious reasons for considering that XXXXX XXXXX should be excluded from refugee protection and therefore he is not a Convention refugee and not a person in need of protection and I reject his claim.\n\"Joanna Bedard\"\nJoanna Bedard\nDATED at Toronto this 16th day of March, 2004\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - EXCLUSION CLAUSES - ART. 1F(a) - CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY - COMPLICITY - ACCOMPLICES - IDENTITY - CREDIBILITY - MALE - FEMALE - NEGATIVE - MACEDONIA - YUGOSLAVIA\n1 As enacted by S.

In XXXXX 1997, he started working in a XXXXX business in Montevideo, owned by one XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, who was also a police official. Essentially, the claimant's duties were to accompany clients to banks and, when required, to drive XXXXX to meetings. In mid-1999, the meetings took on a disconcerting turn. The claimant found that the meetings involved the hand-over of boxes to unknown characters in return for money. In XXXXX 1999, he learned from XXXXX, a truck driver, that these boxes contained arms and ammunition. The claimant went to XXXXX and told him that he was going to leave his employ. XXXXX offered to increase his salary. When the claimant demurred, XXXXX told him to simply forget the idea of leaving his service. The claimant went on sick leave. XXXXX pressurized him to return. Finally, the claimant did so. In early XXXXX 1999, the claimant left Montevideo to work as a XXXXX in Punta del Este, some 160 kilometres away. In XXXXX 2000, he was arrested by two police officials and taken to Montevideo. He was called a traitor and beaten. He lost consciousness. When he came to his senses, he found he was in an abandoned building under guard. XXXXX came to see him. XXXXX offered to give him one more chance. The claimant continued working for XXXXX until XXXXX 2000. The claimant went to see a lawyer. The lawyer told him he could not help him. The claimant then spoke to a policeman acquaintance about the possibility of making a formal complaint against XXXXX. His acquaintance refused to listen to him. The claimant then moved to another city, Colonia, to work at a XXXXX repair service station. His son in Montevideo phoned to say the police were searching for him. The claimant went into hiding. Again, the police came to his son, saying that they had a warrant for his arrest but failed to produce one. In XXXXX 2001, the claimant fled to Canada.\nANALYSIS\nState protection is the determinative issue in this claim. Ward1 has firmly established that every state must be presumed capable of protecting its citizens unless \"clear and convincing\" evidence is presented to the contrary. The evidence presented by the claimant is simply not clear and convincing enough.\nThe claimant's main argument for not seeking police protection is because he believes that police are corrupt and rather than attack crime, support it. Pockets of police corruption exists, it is true. The documentary evidence, however, indicates that the state has been making serious efforts to combat such corruption.\nIn August 1997, the Public Prosecutor's Office of Police was created \"to prevent and stamp out irregular actions\" by police. At the same time, the National Inspection of Police that had been established in 1992 was expanded so that it could co-ordinate more efficiently with the Prosecutor's Office in the investigation of irregular or illicit police actions. It is true that XXXXX used his police office for private profit and used this office\nto intimidate the claimant. Despite a lawyer's wrong advice and the hostility of a police acquaintance, he could have gone to the Public Prosecutor's Office and filed a formal complaint against XXXXX. While a psychologist's report indicates him to be a person of high anxiety, this still does not excuse him to approach his own country for protection if such protection is reasonably affordable.\nCounsel has argued that courts seldom prosecute corrupt police officials and the higher an official is in the echelon, as is XXXXX, the less the chance of his being persecuted. What the documentary report is saying is this, \"While the courts seldom convicted and punished police enforcement officials in the past, such prosecutions are occurring more frequently.\"2 Over 400 police officers have been indicted in the past three years for offences ranging from corruption to abuse.3\nUruguay remains a functioning democracy with an independent judiciary. The Country Reports on Human Rights Practices states that \"the law and judiciary generally provided effective means of dealing with individual instances of abuse.\"4 A United Nations Human Rights Committee document states that:\nConsiderable progress has also being realized with the enactment of new laws and codes and with the strengthening of democratic institutions and processes aimed at promoting and protecting human rights.5\nIt has thus not established to my satisfaction that the claimant is in need of the surrogate protection that the international community provides. It is only when the need for such surrogate protection has been proven that either Section 96 and Section 97 of the Act kicks in. That not having been done, I reject the claim.\n\"H. Aulach\"\nH.

The principal claimant served in the armed forces of Colombia from the year 1988 until his departure from Colombia in XXXXX 2001. He had received his elementary and high school education at the XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, XXXXX, XXXXX, and, later, did a Professional Military Services course at the XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, XXXXXXX.\nThe principal claimant had many assignments4 as an armed forces XXXXX, and, by 1996, his identity as a soldier was known to the guerrillas, and he was considered a target for reprisals. One indication was that, in the year 1996, while the army carried on military operations in Antioquia, near to the principal claimant's military base at the time, a detained individual was found to be carrying a note with a written order to kill the principal claimant.\nSubsequently, in XXXXX 2001 and XXXXX 2001, while the female claimant and the minor resided at the home of the mother-in-law in Bogota, the family received serious threats to their lives, through telephone calls. The callers stated that they were aware of the principal claimant's work against the guerrillas and his position in the army and gave notice that the family was declared military targets. The female claimant received a\n\"suffragio\" (condolence letter\/death notice) on March ^, 2001. After the call in XXXXX 2001, the principal claimant sought protection for his family. However, his superiors informed him that they were unable to provide that protection because of lack of resources. Therefore, after the subsequent calls in XXXXX 2001, the principal claimant decided to leave Colombia to seek international protection. The claimants travelled to the USA on XXXXX, 2001 and from there they entered Canada on XXXXX, 2001.\nDETERMINATION\nAfter careful consideration of all of the evidence, I am of the opinion that the exclusion provision (Article 1F(a)) of the Act is applicable in the claim of the principal claimant and that he is not a Convention refugee. I concur with the conclusion of the Hearings Officer that the principal claimant comes within the parameters of Article 1F of the Refugee Convention.\nI determine, also, that the female claimant, the minor, and the mother-in-law have established valid claims on the basis of the allegations and the documentary evidence, as, in my opinion, no adequate national protection is available to them in Colombia.\nAll claimants established their identity5 as citizens of Colombia, and there is no evidence that they possess any other nationality.\nANALYSIS\nIn considering the issue of exclusion in the claim of the principal claimant, I take note of the following statutory provisions and the case law.\nSection 98 of IRPA6 states that persons referred to in Article 1F(a) of the Refugee Convention are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection, and states, in part:\n\"The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:\n\"(a) he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes...\"\nIn several decisions,7 the Court has dealt with the issue of serious reasons for considering that a crime, as defined in the international instruments,8 has been committed, and I am guided, primarily, by the decisions in Ramirez,9 Sivakumar,10 and Moreno.11\nIn Ramirez,12 the Court found that the burden of proving that the claimant should be excluded from determination as a Convention refugee is on the party so asserting, rather than on the claimant to demonstrate that he should not be excluded from such status. It further held that the test for determining whether there are \"serious reasons for considering\" that a crime has been committed, require less than a balance of probabilities.\nThe Court13 also reviewed the degree of involvement required on the part of the claimant in order to be excluded from Convention refugee status, and found that accomplices, as well as principal actors, may be subject to exclusion. It was held that a person could be considered to be an accomplice, if there is personal and knowing participation in the persecutorial act, and the Court went on to provide examples of this test. It stated14 that:\n\"... mere membership in an organization which from time to time commits international offenses will be sufficient for exclusion from refugee status where the organization is principally directed to a limited , brutal purpose, which may, by necessity, involve personal and knowing participation in persecutorial acts...someone who is an associate of the principal offender can never be said to be a mere onlooker...\"\nThe Court15 also looked at the claimant's opportunity to have left the organization earlier, without risk of harm to himself, and the length of time in the organization.\nIn Sivakumar,16 the Court looked at the method of recruitment (voluntarily) in the claimant's organization, the nature of the organization (violence\/killings), the claimant's position\/rank in the organization, including his high-level promotions, the claimant's opportunity to leave the organization and the claimant's length of time in the organization.\nIn Moreno,17 the Court further clarified that a claimant can be held for guilt by association where the organization in which he is involved is premised on achieving political or social ends by any means necessary, while still considering that mere membership in the organization involved in international offenses is not sufficient basis on which to invoke the exclusion clause.\nFirstly, on the issue of credibility, I consider that, in very significant areas, the principal claimant has presented implausible testimony with respect to his military assignments and the military operations in which he was involved. Counsel has argued that the principal claimant's oral testimony and explanations remain un-contradicted. However, I note the following.\nIn the narrative of his PIF,18 the principal claimant presented clear and very precise details of his military assignments, outlined as follows. From XXXXX 1998 to XXXXX 1990, he was the XXXXX of 40 men with the XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX - XXXXX. From May 1990 to October 1990 he was the XXXXX of 20 men with the XXXXX XXXXX in the Department of XXXXX. From XXXXX 1990 to XXXX 1991 he was involved in surveillance of XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, in XXXXX. From XXXXX 1995 to XXXXX 1997, he was the XXXXX of 60 men involved in anti-guerrilla operations and surveillance XXXXXX with the \"XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX in XXXXX XXXXX. From XXXXXX 1999 until his departure, he was attached to the anti-guerrilla operations with Mobile Brigade XXX XXXXX in XXXXX, XXXXX.\nFrom XXXXX 1991 to XXXXX 1995, and XXXXX 1997 to XXXXX 1999, the principal claimant was attached to the XXXXX XXXXX and XXXXX division.\nThe principal claimant states that in his first assignment in the Department of XXXXX, he and his men were in charge of public order of nearby towns and that there were operations against guerrillas. In his stint with Brigade No. 4, the XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX Unit, he was seconded there to lead the XXXXX Unit. Guerrilla operations were carried out in XXXXXXXXXXXXX. When he became a XXXXX in 1995 and was sent to be a XXXXX at the base in XXXXX, he participated in missions around XXXXX.\nWhen the principal claimant joined the XXXXX XXXXX, he was a member of the rapid deployment force at the XXXXX base in the town of XXXXX in XXXXX, and he states that:\n\"...the special deployment force would be called on to do operations against guerrillas. Especially in that period from XXXXX 2000 to XXXXX of 2001 I was a member of the mobile brigade XXXXXXXXXX where there was numerous combats with terrorists groups especially FARC. We would try to take back towns taken by the guerrillas, liberate kidnapped people and liberate roadblocks. We had operations in XXXXX, XXXXX, XXXXX and XXXXX. I was a member of the XXXXX group in charge of planning such operations. My title was XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX. I would also be involved in implementation of the operations. I remember particularly two difficult missions against the guerrillas one for about three months in XXXXX and another for about three months in the Department of XXXXX ...\"\nIn his oral testimony, however, the principal claimant has presented a different picture. In response to specific questions about the stated anti-guerrilla operations, he described these operations as mere administrative tasks. He testified that he was never involved in any combat activities that might be deemed atrocious or a violation of human rights. He stated that he had never been involved in the capture of guerrillas, and that basically, his mission was to train soldiers. He explained, further, that the expression \"anti-guerrilla operations\", in his particular case, merely meant showing a military presence as a means of support for the communities, being there to control and safeguard bridges and highways, being involved in the transportation of goods from one place to another and, generally, providing security in the areas. He stated that, occasionally, persons would be stopped at roadblocks and their documents checked. However, he stressed, he was only involved in administrative duties and missions. He had received training in human rights, and he was conscious of his role as a soldier.\nThe Hearings Officer has concluded that the principal claimant's oral testimony and explanations in this area are not plausible, and has pointed out excerpts from his documentary package19 in support of that conclusion. I concur with that conclusion, taking into consideration the principal claimant's XXXXX rank in the Colombian armed forces for at least thirteen years, and based on the documentary evidence on the activities of the Colombian armed forces in those same years, and in the geographical areas of the principal claimant's military assignments\/operations.\nI note decisions20 of the Court where it is held that the Board is entitled to make reasonable findings based on implausibilities. In particular, I note the commentary in Faryna v. Chorny21 on the test of a witness' credibility where it is stated that:\n\"...the test must reasonably subject his story to an examination of its consistency with the probabilities that surround the currently existing conditions. In short, the real test of the truth of the story of a witness in such a case must be in harmony with the preponderance of the probabilities which a practical and informed person would readily recognize as reasonable in that place and in those conditions...\"\nThe Hearings Officer has highlighted relevant references in his documentary package22 which indicate that there were intense guerrilla and anti-guerrilla activities in areas identified as those corresponding to where the principal claimant served, such as in XXXXX, XXXXX and XXXXX. From that package, I have reviewed some specific studies\/reports23 of credible sources such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the United Nations Human Rights Commission and the United States Department of State Report. These reports cite the Colombian army as being guilty of committing gross human rights violations against the civilian population for decades, with virtual impunity, before and during the claimant's period of service.\nOne such source24 says the following:\n\"...violations of international humanitarian law- the laws of war- are not abstract concepts in Colombia, but a grim material of everyday life. War bursts into the daily activities of a farm, a village, a public bus, or a school with the speed of armed fighters arriving down a path or in four-wheel drive vehicles. Sometimes armed men carefully choose their victims from lists. Other times, they simply kill those nearby, to spread fear. Indeed, a willingness to commit atrocities is among the most striking features of Colombia's war...the Colombian army teaches its officers the basics of international humanitarian law and makes instructional material available to officers, professional soldiers, and recruits...\nNevertheless, after examining hundreds of cases and interviewing many officers, government investigators and civilians who have witnessed violations, Human Rights Watch concluded that the army continues to engage in serious violations of the laws of war, with little apparent will to investigate or punish those responsible. At the root of these violations is the Colombian army's consistent and profound failure or refusal to properly distinguish civilians from combatants...\"\nAnother relevant example of the documentary information states the following:\n\"...the information received by the Special Rapporteur shows that violations of the right to life are continuing to occur n a large scale and that there are no indications that an improvement is foreseeable in the short term. Members of the army, paramilitary groups, the police, and to a lesser extent guerrilla groups are reported to have been responsible for a large number of violations of the right to life...\"25\n\"...during 1990 and 1991 the army launched major offensives against guerrilla forces in several parts of the country. Little or no effort was made to protect the civilian population during these operations...Military commanders routinely claim that unarmed civilians extrajudicially executed by soldiers were guerrillas killed in combat. Blaming the guerrillas is another of the army's usual responses to accusations of human rights violations...\"26\nThe United States Department of State reports27 on Country Conditions in Colombia for the years 1991 and 1993 give the same grim picture, and in each case state that members and units of the army, sometimes in collaboration with paramilitary forces, participated in a number of human rights violations including extrajudicial killings,\ndisappearances, torture and arbitrary detention, and that the army is reluctant to distinguish between guerrillas and non-combatants during counterinsurgency operations.\nA project28 undertaken by the Norwegian Refugee Council, subtitled \"Agents of Displacement: Colombian Armed Forces 1994-2002\" provided the following summary:\n* Successive Governments have assigned the armed forces a growing role not only in the counter-insurgency fight, but, also in maintaining public order in general\n* The Army has used indiscriminate means and methods of combat during its clashes with the guerrillas in various places, resulting in a number of mass displacements of peasants\n* The implicit or sometimes obvious support by the armed forces of paramilitary activities and the impunity for violations of human rights by army members are also among the aggravating factors\n* There are persistent reports of disappearances and arbitrary executions, as well as support to the paramilitary groups\n* According to the Colombian Commission of Jurists (CCJ), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia and several human rights organizations, government forces have played a role in many of the crimes committed by the paramilitary.\n*\nAs pointed out by the Hearings Officer, Human Rights Watch, in its annual report covering events of 1998, describes both the army's direct human rights violations and those accomplished indirectly through paramilitaries in the following way:\n\"...the Colombian army continued to commit serious violations with little apparent will to investigate or punish those responsible. As in the past, at the root of these abuses was the Colombian army's consistent and pervasive failure to enforce human rights standards and distinguish civilians from combatants. In eastern Colombia, where paramilitary forces were weak, the army was directly implicated in the killing of civilians and prisoners taken hors de combat, as well as torture and death threats. In the rest of the country, where paramilitaries had developed a pronounced presence over the past decade, the army still failed to move against them and tolerated their activity, including egregious violations of international humanitarian law; provided some paramilitary groups with intelligence and logistical support to carry out operations; and actively promoted and coordinated joint manoeuvres with them...\"29\nThe above reports reflect some of the situation during a period when the claimant was a serviceman of rank, who, by 1996, had already been targeted for his work as an XXXXX in the Colombian armed forces.\nI also find very persuasive, another Report30 of 1994, prepared by the Inter-Church Committee on Human Rights in Latin America (ICCHRLA) which states:\n\"...during its two most recent visits to Colombia, ICCHRLA representatives travelled to several conflicted zones in the country and received reliable reports of the same pattern of violations that have been signalled in the past. These include extrajudicial executions of civilians by military personnel which are later presented as \" guerrillas killed in combat\"; indiscriminate bombing and aerial strafing of communities where the military suspect a guerrilla presence and forced recruitment of civilians who are obliged to dress in military uniforms and act as guides in conflictive zones...\"\nIn addition, one of the key assignments of the principal claimant, albeit a brief one, was his attachment to the Mobile Brigade XXXXX, where he served as XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX. The principal claimant considers that his position as XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX does not place him in the role of an accomplice. I do not agree.\nA general description of the Mobile Brigade 31 is as follows:\n\"...the centrepiece of army strategy is the Mobile Brigade. The Mobile Brigade is conceived as a highly mobile force equipped with weaponry and vehicles suitable for the country's rugged, often densely forested countryside...Mobile Brigades are composed of professional soldiers who volunteer...\"\n...mobile brigade strategy follows a general pattern. The goal is to trap guerrillas, forcing them to flee by a route already covered by troops. The Mobile Brigade begins by softening up an area with the bombing of supposed guerrilla settlements and strafing from a variety of aircraft...despite the government and military's assertions that Mobile Brigades do not commit systemic abuses, some government agencies and independent human rights groups have documented a broad, consistent, and often shocking pattern of serious violations of human rights and the international covenants governing internal armed conflicts...Americas Watch believes that spreading terror among civilians is an integral part of Brigade strategy and appears to be tolerated and sometimes openly articulated by Brigade Commanders...\"\nBy the year 2000, when the principal claimant assumed the title of XXXXX and was XXXXXXXXXXXXXX with Mobile Brigade XX, the reputation of the Mobile Brigades was widespread. I do not agree with counsel's arguments that the principal claimant, for all of his years in the armed forces and his XXXXX rank, had no knowledge of the abuses committed by the Mobile Brigades or any other part of the army.\nCounsel has conceded that it is evident that some members of the Colombian army have committed crimes against humanity, as that term is defined in the relevant international instruments, but that the principal claimant did not personally commit such crimes, and he \"should not be excluded by virtue of being an accomplice to crimes\ncommitted by others\".32 Counsel argues, further, that, for the most part, the principal claimant was a XXXXXXXXXX, who also spent a large portion of his army years with the XXXXXXXXX unit, and in studies; that his anti-guerrilla service did not involve direct combat with guerillas, and that his testimony remains un-contradicted, and should not be deemed implausible.\nEven if the principal claimant did not personally commit atrocities while being a soldier, he admits that he had some knowledge of some of the stated atrocities, and he did not disengage himself from the armed forces at his earliest opportunity. Therefore he is complicit. In Sivakumar,33 cited above, it is stated that it is possible to commit crimes against humanity as an accomplice even though one has not personally done acts amounting to the crime. In Bazargan,34 the Court said that personal and knowing participation can be direct or indirect, and that one can be an accomplice to the organization's activities, by knowingly contributing to those activities in any way or making them possible, whether from within or from outside the organization.\nThe principal claimant has admitted that he was regularly informed of guerrilla\nactivities in various areas from his Commanders. As a young man, he watched TV and read the newspapers. He received some information of the army activities through radio news, and some from his superior officer, such as his captain. He had heard of some of the anti-guerrilla activities in the red zones35 in the Antioquia area. He had heard of the incident in Tello, San Antonio, where there were intense guerrilla activities and the guerrillas had taken eight towns. He had heard of the massacres in Rio Frio, of October 1993 where human rights violations were committed by the army. By that date, the principal claimant was already at least five years in the service. He had heard about the violations committed by the XXXX Brigade and the fact that those violations caused the XXXX Brigade to be disbanded by the authorities. As pointed out by the Hearings Officer, notorious massacres such as in Rio Frio (1993), Segovia (1996), Mepiripan (1997) and El Aro (1997) should have raised concerns for the principal claimant that the military's involvement in paramilitary atrocities was systematic and it is not plausible that he would not have had knowledge of the reports connected to these incidents.\nThe claimant states that, as far as he was concerned, the Colombian army paid keen attention to operating as an army and avoiding human rights violations. He argued that individual violations by some delinquent personnel cannot indicate that the Colombian army was geared to a single brutal purpose. He stated that according to the polls in Colombia, the Colombian army was the second most respected entity, after the Catholic Church.\nIn my view, the principal claimant's responses establish that he had some awareness of the activities of the army, and the atrocious activities of army personnel. Those activities are documented, and they go back to the years of the principal claimant's early service and during his rise to the rank of XXXXX. He was not an ordinary soldier who merely followed orders, and, what is more, he clearly stated that, while with Mobile Brigade XX, he was a member of the XXXXXXX group in charge of planning operations in XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. He was also involved in the implementation of operations. Therefore, he contributed to the acts and activities of these forces.\nIn addition, with respect to the issue of rank, length of time in the army and opportunity to leave the army, I note that, for many years, the principal claimant served as a XXXXXX which is XXX in rank in the army hierarchy. Later he served as a XXXX, a position which is XXXX in rank in the hierarchy. These are not XXXXX positions, in my opinion. The principal claimant joined the army as a volunteer, and he was under no obligation to remain in the forces during that period of human rights violations. He spent fourteen years with the armed forces, and he did not disengage himself from the armed forces until his family was directly threatened by guerrillas.\nBased on the above, I find that there are serious reasons for considering that the principal claimant, XXXXXXXXXXXXX, has been an accomplice in the activities of the Colombian army, and in crimes against humanity during his service with that army. Accordingly, he falls within the parameters of Article 1(F)(a). He is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\nWith respect to the other claims, and their objective basis, I considered the documentary evidence on the current situation in Colombia. I note that it is stated that members of the guerrilla movements such as the FARC engage in reprisals against persons of certain profiles. Family members of Government or army operatives can become prime targets, as they too are perceived to have political opinions that are opposed to those of guerrillas such as FARC.\nMore significantly, it is stated36 that, in such situations, the Colombian authorities are unable to extend their power and authority in terms of security and the rule of law, and to provide its citizens with adequate protection. It is accepted that the principal claimant, as a soldier, sought protection for the family and that it was not provided.\nFor these reasons, I accept the claims of XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, and XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.\nI reject the claim of XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.\n\"George A.

The claimants claim to be in need of refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nAt the hearing, the claimant was represented by Michael Loebach, Barrister and Solicitor. The Refugee Protection Division was represented by a Refugee Protection Officer, M. Ramoutar, and the Minister was represented by David Cranton, Barrister and Solicitor. The Minister participated in this claim based on Article 1F(a). The Minister alleges that the claimant is complicit in crimes against humanity based on his service with the Department of Administration and Security (DAS).\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant alleges that he worked for XXXXX years for the Department of Administration and Security (the DAS). For the first eight years, he worked as an XXXXX and later with some in-service training, he became an expert with XXXXX. Because of his knowledge and expertise about XXXXX, the FARC guerrillas contacted him and demanded that he collaborate with them by providing instructions about XXXXX to their colleagues.\nHis refusal to collaborate with the FARC resulted in he and his family being targeted by the guerrillas. His wife and he received a number of threatening calls from them. On one occasion on the night of XXXXX, 1999, he was shot and severely wounded by them. Then on XXXXX, 2000, when his wife and their children were driving to XXXXX with their uncle, they were forced off the road by the FARC. As a result, their car smashed against a rock causing severe injuries to their daughter. He talked to his boss at the DAS about these incidents. His boss sympathized with him but did not offer him a bodyguard to protect him.\nANALYSIS\nBoth the issues of exclusion and inclusion were raised during the hearing. The panel will deal with the issue of exclusion first then with the issue of inclusion.\nExclusion:\nArticle 1(F) reads in part as follows:\nThe provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any persons with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:\n(a) he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes;\nThe Federal Court of Appeal, in Sivakumar states that there is \"little, if any, difference\" between \"reasonable grounds to believe\" and \"serious reasons for considering\".1\nBoth standards \"require more than suspicion or conjecture, but something less than proof on a balance of probabilities\" [ibid., \"reasonable grounds to believe\" has been defined as \"a bona fide belief in a serious possibility based on credible evidence\"].2\nCrimes against humanity are defined in Article 7 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, signed on July 17, 1998. It is the latest word on the subject. Crimes against humanity consists of:\n...imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law, torture, other inhumane acts of a similar character internationally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health.\nCanada's Crimes Against Humanity and the War Crimes Act specifically endorses as well as incorporates the definition of crimes against humanity from the Rome Statutes by stating that crimes described in Article 7 are crimes against humanity according to international law (Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act 2000).\nIn this case, the question is whether XXXXX XXXXX is legally responsible as an accomplice for the crimes of murder, torture and enforced disappearances perpetrated by the DAS during his years of service with the DAS.\nLiability of Accomplices:\nThe attachment of responsibility to accomplices is supported by Article 6 of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal (IMT Charter) one of the instruments referred to in Article 1(F)(a). Article 6 of the IMT Charter states:\nLeaders, organisers, instigators and accomplices participating in the formulation or execution of a common plan or conspiracy to commit any of the foregoing crimes [including crimes against humanity] are responsible for all acts performed by any persons in execution of such plan.\nThe principle of complicity of an accomplice has been examined by the Federal Courts in Canada. In Ramirez,3 it was established \"personal and knowing participation\" and a \"shared common purpose\" as being essential requirements for a finding of complicity. The Federal Court enunciated the following test:\nAt bottom, complicity rests..... on the existence of a shared common purpose and the knowledge that all of the parties in question may have of it.\nIn Harb,4 the Federal Courts addressed the concept of complicity by association:\nPersonal commission of crimes is not required. Once the organisation with which Harb was associated has committed such crimes and he meets the requirements for complicity imposed by precedent, the exclusion applies even if the specific acts committed by the appellant himself are not crimes against humanity (para. 11).\nThe Federal Court stated that a simple denial, even if credible,\n.... cannot suffice to negate the presence of a common purpose. A plaintiff's actions can be more revealing than his testimony and the circumstances may be such that it can be inferred that a person shares the objectives of those with whom he is collaborating. (para. 27)\nIn this case, evidence indicates that the principal claimant is a complicit accomplice. He had a long service with the DAS. He had knowledge of its commission of crimes against humanity, although he did not personally commit excludable crimes. He was occasionally directly involved in activities more closely associated with abuses conducted by the DAS in Colombia. The evidence and the commendations set out in the extract from his service record indicate that he had some involvement in a XXXXX 1994 raid, the capture of two persons in 1996, and the neutralisation of a terrorist plan in 1997.5 Since the DAS does not have a limited brutal purpose, complicity must be established by additional indications of the principal claimant's participation in the DAS's crimes.\nDETERMINATION OF COMPLICITY:\nWhether or not the principal claimant is complicit is essentially a factual question requiring evaluation of his particular circumstances.6 The Federal Court has enumerated six factors which should be considered to determine whether an individual is complicit in crimes against humanity.\nThese are listed as follows:\n1. Nature of the organisation;\n2. Method of recruitment;\n3. Position\/ rank in the organisation;\n4. Knowledge of organisation's atrocities;\n5. Length of time in the organisation; and\n6. Opportunity to leave the organisation;\n1. Nature of the Organisation:\nThe DAS was set up in 1962 to organise intelligence against the state's insurgencies.7 The DAS is divided into four main branches: intelligence, protection, investigations, and foreign affairs. The documentary evidence8 indicates that the DAS is included in Colombia's \"security forces\". Although the DAS is an independent organisation reporting to the President of the nation, it also works with the police and the military in Colombia.9\nThe principal claimant did acknowledge that part of the DAS's mandate was to gather intelligence against organisations working against the Colombian Government, and it provided intelligence reports to the nation's President and his advisors who would pass the intelligence information to the military and\/or the police. The principal claimant also testified that the unit he worked for shared technical information with the police anti- XXXXX group, that the last two DAS directors during his service with the DAS, came to work for the DAS from the police, that military officers were seen visiting the DAS headquarters, and at times, the military officers were also appointed as DAS supervisors.\nDirect DAS Involvement in Atrocities:\nThe documentary evidence indicates the DAS's direct involvement in murder, torture and disappearances on a widespread or systematic basis in Colombia. A report by Colombia's Attorney General10 included the DAS as a public institution that committed human rights violations generally and the Minister's disclosures confirm that the DAS has been directly implicated in murder,11 torture12 and enforced disappearances.13\nRegarding murder, the documentary evidence14 indicates the following specific examples of the DAS's involvement in murders:\n1. An armed undercover DAS agent was found with a list of 50 students. He was held responsible for at least one shooting at a university where five students and two professors were shot.\n2. Charges were laid against two DAS agents for the murder of a communist youth leader.\n3. The DAS were found to have a list of members of a political party. One of these members was shot, and others were followed, threatened and shot at.\n4. Regarding enforced disappearances, the DAS is alleged to have participated in some 1700 disappearances since the mid-1970s including some 198 disappearances in the first nine months of 1990 alone.\nThe DAS's complicity in crimes committed by the paramilitaries:\nThe DAS has also been complicit in murder, torture, and disappearance carried out by the paramilitary groups. The DAS has been accused of collaborating with paramilitaries on a number of occasions.\n1. The documentary evidence15 indicates that the Commission of Verification on Urabas report on violence, accused the DAS of aiding and abetting paramilitaries.\n2. The documentary evidence16 indicates that Major Lazaro boasted that he received support from the DAS in his organisation of local paramilitaries.\n3. The documentary evidence17 indicates that the DAS appears to have been involved in human rights violations in Sucre, either directly or indirectly or through complicity with the paramilitaries.\n4. The DAS was implicated when the Colombian military and the police withdrew three days prior to the paramilitary massacre in San Carlos, Antioquia.18\nFurthermore, intelligence sharing is the most common means of the DAS's specific complicity in paramilitary crimes against humanity.19 One example of such complicity is the massacre that took place in Barrancabermeja in May of 1998. In April and May of 1998, the DAS sent intelligence reports to the military and the police in Barrancabermeja, warning of a planned paramilitary massacre. Operating with the DAS's intelligence, the armed forces withdrew from the town, and the paramilitary gunmen, some of whom were reportedly wearing bullet-proof jackets with DAS insignia, entered the town, rounded up the citizens, questioned and terrorised them and murdered or disappeared 30 people. The DAS agents and other security forces made no discernible attempt to prevent the massacre or pursue the gunmen20 and, subsequent to the massacre, the DAS regional director and two DAS agents were punished for failing to prevent the massacre.21 In this regards, a Canadian independent tribunal heard testimony of witnesses of the massacre in May 1999, and the tribunal concluded that the Colombian Government must be held responsible for crimes against humanity committed in Barrancabermeja.22 Public security forces, including the DAS, were held responsible for that incident to have taken place.\nTherefore, based on the evidence adduced, the panel finds that the DAS was involved in some of the atrocities associated with human rights in Colombia.\n2. Method of Recruitment\nThe principal claimant testified that he joined the DAS voluntarily based on his friend's recommendations. He said that he needed employment at the time he joined them. He was attracted to this job because of stable employment with the Government of Colombia.\n3. Position\/Rank\nThe principal claimant was trained in the DAS academy for six months. He graduated with a designation as an XXXXX XXXXX. Later, his title changed to \"secret agent\" and then to \"XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX\".\nInitially, he worked as a XXXXX in the Protection Department where he was assigned to protect high-profile individuals including the Minister of Justice and the XXXXX of El Tiempo newspaper. In 1992, he joined the XXXXX group which, in 1995, was moved to the XXXXX Department. The principal claimant testified that the XXXXX group had 12 to 15 agents, and it was located in the main DAS headquarters in Bogot\u00e1.\nOn XXXXX, 1998, the principal claimant was promoted to the rank of XXXXX XXXXX at the rank of level 9 which he stated was a very low rank. His testimony indicates that he started at the rank of level 3 as a student. He said that the top rank for non-university graduates was level 17. He stated that level 14 is the first rank for Specialized Detectives and level 17 was a rank for Specialized Detectives in charge of a group. In his testimony during counsel's questioning, the claimant indicated that he was in charge of one of the shifts. During re-examination by the Minister's counsel, the principal claimant stated that he worked as a supervisor of a shift when a regular shift supervisor was away on holidays.\nBased on the evidence adduced, the panel is of the opinion that the principal claimant was a middle-ranking member of the XXXXX XXXXX group since he was at level 9 and on several occasions, he filled in as a shift supervisor. The panel is also of the opinion that the claimant was a faithful employee of the DAS, and because he upheld and followed the DAS's principles and mandate, he received constant promotions in his employment. As a result, in his final days with the DAS, he became an occasional shift supervisor.\nIn Sivakumar, the Federal Court, in making connection between rank and complicity stated that:\nIn my view, the case for an individual's complicity in international crimes committed by his or her organization is stronger if the individual member in question holds a position of importance within the organization. Bearing in mind that each case must be decided on its facts, the closer one is to being a leader rather than an ordinary member, the more likely it is that an inference will be drawn that one knew of the crime and shared an organization's purpose in committing that crime. Thus, remaining in an organization in a leadership position with the knowledge that the organization was responsible for crimes against humanity may constitute complicity.\" (para. 10)\n4. Knowledge of Organization's Atrocities\nAt the hearing, the claimant admitted to hearing reports of allegations against the DAS on the television and reading them in newspapers. He acknowledged that, from approximately 1990 onwards, he would hear in the media about investigations of DAS members who had violated human rights. He testified that he frequently saw these reports.\nIn his testimony, the claimant indicated that, at the time of joining the DAS, he had knowledge about the police and the army committing human rights abuses, but he had not heard about the DAS committing such abuses. When asked as to when he became aware of the DAS being involved in committing human rights abuses, at one time he indicated he could not recall. Later he stated that in his first year of employment with the DAS, he did not hear about the DAS committing human rights abuses, but from 1990 onwards he had knowledge about the DAS committing such abuses. He testified that he was specifically aware of reports criticizing the DAS for its role in human rights violations that took place in Barrancabermeja.\nFurthermore, in his testimony the claimant provided one notorious example of crimes against humanity perpetrated by DAS agents from his office when he described the case of Mr. XXXXX, the XXXXX of the Investigations Department's Anti-kidnapping Group. In approximately 1992, Mr. XXXXX, who was well known within the organisation, was sentenced to 55 years in prison for forced disappearances and torture. In his testimony, the claimant admitted discussing this case with his co-workers at the DAS. He said that he knew disappearances were a general problem in Colombia and that he was aware of DAS agents being accused of or being responsible for some disappearance cases.\nThe claimant denied any knowledge of the DAS responsibility for murder and torture. The panel does not believe that the claimant was unaware of the DAS's involvement in murder and torture. He knew Mr. XXXXX was punished for forced disappearances and torture as early as 1992. The DAS was a part of the state security forces involved in murder and torture during the 15 years he worked for them. He testified that he knew about the state's involvement in torture and murder from the TV and newspapers, and he knew about dead bodies appearing daily in Bogot\u00e1's streets bearing the unmistakable signs of abuse and torture.23 He said that the department, which collected these bodies, was in the same building and located adjacent to where he worked.\nBased on the evidence adduced and for above mentioned reasons, and guided by the following case law, the panel finds that the claimant, in this case, had the knowledge, since 1990, that the DAS committed human right abuses. Evidence indicates that he had firm knowledge about the DAS committing human rights abuses, including torture, when Mr. XXXXX from the DAS was sentenced. And after the Barrancabermeja incident in 1998, the claimant had sufficient knowledge about the DAS committing human rights abuses in collaboration with the police, the army and the paramilitaries. He also admitted that human rights violations were addressed by DAS leaders at internal meetings he attended and publicly.\nIn Shakarabi,24 the Federal Court found that professed ignorance of human rights abuses may be found not to be credible. The Court stated that:\nIt is much too simple to say that one is unaware of barbaric actions of an organization in order to try to distance oneself from these barbaric actions. If, as in the present case, an individual lives and works in a country where persons around him are disappearing and where one hears of persons arrested and tortured, it appears to me to be totally unbelievable that one would not have knowledge of what is taking place\". (para. 25)\nIn El-Kachi,25 the Federal Court found that knowledge of activities satisfies the mens rea element required for complicity. The Court cited the accomplice test from Penate stating that:\n...in view of his experiences during 16 years in the SLA and the documentary evidence, the applicant had the knowledge of the nature and scope of the criminal activities in which the SLA was involved. He thus demonstrated personal and knowing participation in the crimes, satisfying the mens rea element.\nThe claimant provided contradicting information in regards to having been given training on human rights abuses. When asked by his counsel, the claimant indicated that human rights information was provided in memos and human rights seminars conducted by DAS leadership. He admitted that he personally attended meetings related to these issues. During subsequent examination by the Refugee Protection Officer (RPO), he stated that he did not attend specific human rights seminars but had \"chats\" with his co-workers and conferences related to human rights. During the Minister's counsel's redirect, the claimant denied attending human rights meetings and claimed he did not know what he was referring to earlier. During his counsel's redirect, the claimant indicated that the essence of human rights related information communicated at the DAS between approximately 1990 and 1998\/1999 was simply that the DAS would not allow human rights violations to take place and whosoever committed such abuses would be tried and punished.\nWhen asked to explain the above contradictions, the claimant could not provide a reasonable response. He indicated that he attended a few meetings where specific cases were not discussed, that lot of things had happened during his 15-year employment with the DAS. He said that he did not remember them exactly, that he did not remember whether his information on human rights violations by DAS members came from news reports or DAS meetings.\nThe panel does not find the claimant's response to be reasonable. In his earlier testimony, he had admitted knowing that the DAS had committed human rights abuses as early as 1990, that he had attended meetings and conferences and had \"chats\" with his co-workers about the DAS committing human rights abuses. As well, he had knowledge about a leader of the DAS being convicted and sentenced for committing human rights abuses. In his testimony, he admitted having knowledge of serious DAS atrocities, to the extent that he had considered quitting the organisation. When asked if he had protested to his superiors regarding the crimes committed by other DAS agents, the claimant admitted that he never thought of raising that issue with his superiors; instead, he focussed on doing his job properly. He then added that he considered himself as a lower-ranking agent, and he did not know if his protests would be taken into account. In Penate,26 the court held that:\n..... a person who is a member of the persecuting group and who has knowledge that activities are being committed by the group and who neither takes steps to prevent them occurring (if he has power to do so) nor disengages himself from the group at the earliest opportunity (consistent with safety for himself), but who lends support, will be considered to be an accomplice. A shared common purpose will be considered to exist.\nBased on the evidence adduced, the panel finds that:\n* From 1990 onwards, the claimant had knowledge about human rights abuses conducted by the DAS.\n* The claimant knew what \"human rights abuse\" meant.\n* He never protested to his superiors in an attempt to prevent the abuse from continuing.\n* He had ample opportunities to disengage himself from the DAS. Although he had thought about quitting the DAS, he did not do so, not even for his own safety after the incident of XXXXX, 1999, when FARC guerrillas shot him for failing to collaborate with them.\n* He embraced the goals of the DAS, and by lending his effective support since 1990, when he first learnt of the atrocities committed by the DAS, he accepted the darker aspects of the DAS operations and international crimes committed by them.\nIn regards to the claimant's allegations that crimes committed by DAS agents were punishable is not consistent with the documentary evidence before the panel. In 1993, the IACHR27 reported that only 20% of crimes were investigated of which 4% ended in conviction, an impunity rate of 99.2%. In 1995, the US Department of State28 reported that 97% of all crimes and a higher percentage of political crimes go unpunished. In 2001, the UK Country Assessment for Colombia29 reported that the impunity rate for political crimes was virtually 100%. Of 2000 forced disappearances over a 15-year period in Colombia, only one case resulted in a military criminal sanction.30 The claimant's wife's testimony describing the situation in Colombia as \"chaos\" appears to be more accurate and genuine. Based on the documentary evidence and the claimant's wife's testimony, the panel finds that since the impunity rate is so high, it is not likely that crimes committed by the DAS would be punishable as the claimant alleges. The panel, therefore, does not believe the claimant's allegations that crimes committed by DAS agents were investigated and guilty agents were punished.\n5. Length of Time in the Organisation\nThe claimant was a DAS agent for 15 years from 1985 to 2001. His PIF indicates that he enjoyed his work and was reluctant to leave because he was only five years away from pension.\n6. Opportunity to Leave the Organisation\nThe claimant, in his testimony, admitted that he could have resigned from the DAS at any time without any risk to his personal safety.\nBased on the evidence adduced, because of his lengthy service with the DAS, his knowledge, since 1990, about DAS committing human rights abuses, and the fact that he did not leave DAS when he could have done so at any time without any risk to his personal safety, the panel finds the claimant to be a complicit accomplice.\nWidespread or Systematic:\nA legal requirement commonly accepted as part of the definition of crimes against humanity is that they must be committed on a widespread or systematic basis (Rome Statute, Art. 7(1)). When considering whether crimes against humanity were committed by the DAS on a widespread basis, the number of DAS agents in Colombia relative to the other security forces were considered. The claimant's testimony indicated that he heard a lot more reports about abuses by the police and the army as compared to the DAS, but acknowledged that the smaller size of the DAS could explain why there were fewer incidents of human rights violations by the DAS. On the basis of per capita\/per member crimes committed by DAS agents was equivalent to those committed by the army and the police.\nThe claimant's testimony indicates that in the year 2000, there were approximately 9000 agents working for the DAS. The Europa World Year Book 2001 indicates that in August 2000, there were 130,000 members of the Colombian army and 95,000 members of the police. Based on this Colombia had a ratio of 14.4 soldiers and 10.6 police officers to every DAS agent.\nWhen records of human rights violations per security force are compared to account for these ratios, the number of abuses committed by the DAS agents is seen to be equally widespread or systematic as those of Colombia's other security organisations.\nFor example:\n1. Insofar as Torture Complaints, in 1991 to 1992, the documentary evidence31 indicates that the DAS had nine complaints against them, while during the same period, the army and the police had 93 and 106 complaints, respectively. Based on an equal number of DAS agents compared to army yields 9x14.4=130 complaints as compared to 93 complaints against the army and 9x10.6=95 DAS complaints as compared to 106 complaints against the police.\n2. A more recent comparison of human rights violations, the documentary evidence32 indicates that in the year 2001, the DAS committed 20 human rights violations as compared to 132 by the army and 97 by the police. Based on an equal number of DAS agents compared to army yields 20x14.4=130 human rights violations by the DAS compared to 132 by the army and 20x10.6=95 human rights violations by the DAS compared to 97 by the police.\nThe documentary evidence33 indicates that enforced disappearances were perpetrated by security forces, including the DAS, on a massive scale during the claimant's term of service with the DAS. The United States Department of State reports 462 torture cases committed by security forces, including the DAS between June of 1995 and October of 1996.34 As demonstrated above, the documentary evidence provides serious reasons for considering that DAS abuses were just as widespread as those of the police and the army when the ratio of personnel is considered.\nAlso, the DAS has been complicit with respect to crimes committed by the paramilitaries. Evidence indicates that the DAS committed human rights abuses in collaboration with the police, the army and the paramilitaries during the Barrancabermeja incident in 1998. The claimant admitted that human rights violations committed by the DAS during this incident were addressed by DAS leaders at internal meetings he attended and publicly.\nCONCLUSION\nThe evidence adduced is compelling and credible that the DAS committed crimes against humanity and that the claimant is complicit in these crimes. The claimant was an active participant of an organisation responsible for widespread or systematic killings, torture and enforced disappearances of individuals and groups considered to be operating contrary to the interests of Colombia; as well, he had knowledge of these crimes. Even if the claimant was never the one to inflict the pain, he was a middle-ranking member of DAS and was aware of the atrocities committed by the DAS for a long time. He had opportunities to leave the DAS after knowing about the atrocities committed by them, but he elected to stay, even after he was shot by the FARC.\nTherefore, based on the totality of the evidence before the panel, the panel finds that the claimant, XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, falls within the parameters of Section F(a) of Article 1 of the Convention, and, as a result, based on Section 98 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, he is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection pursuant to section 97(1a) and 97(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nInclusion:\nThe panel considered the claims of the claimant's wife and his children.\nAgents of Persecution:\nThe agents of persecution in this case are the FARC guerrillas. They identified themselves as the Urban Militias of the FARC guerrillas when they met the claimant for the first time in the first week of XXXXX 1999. Subsequent to this incident, the claimant and his wife received a number of threatening calls from them.\nBased on the foregoing evidence, the panel finds that the agents of persecution in this case were the Urban Militias of the FARC, and they were motivated to harm him because he did not collaborate with them to provide instructions about XXXXX to their colleagues.\nNexus\nThe FARC is one of the two major leftist guerrilla organisations in Colombia. It is a political organisation with a political agenda. Although it is in opposition to the present government of Colombia, when invited, it participates in peace talks initiated by the Government of Colombia. The documentary evidence indicates that:\nPeace talks initiated in 1999 between the government and the main armed opposition group (FARC), Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, collapsed on 20 February...35\nIn this case, the FARC was targeting the claimant because they wanted him to provide them instructions on explosives. The claimant's refusal to collaborate with the FARC is perceived by them as a defiance of their directives. In this case, the claimant is perceived by the FARC to be an opponent to their organisation and their activities in Colombia. Failing to collaborate with the FARC to provide instructions on XXXXX to their members is considered as an opinion against them.\nAs per Ward,36 political opinion is any opinion in which the machinery of the State is engaged. In this case, the FARC is not only an anti-government entity, it also participates in peace talks with the Government, initiated by the Government, and, therefore, the FARC is a component of the \"state machinery\".\nBased on the above reasons, on a balance of probabilities, the panel finds that the claimant not providing instructions about explosives to members of the FARC guerrillas is interpreted to be an anti-FARC imputed political opinion. The panel finds, in this case, that a political opinion was imputed to the claimant, and, therefore, the claimant has established a nexus to the Convention refugee definition.\nObjectively Well-founded Fear\nThough there were credibility problems with regards to the claimant's position concerning exclusion, the panel finds no such problems with his and with his wife's testimony concerning what drove them away from Colombia.\nIn this case, the claimant worked for the DAS, a government security agency in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. He was an expert with XXXXX. He gave courses about XXXXX to individuals who were taking courses to become members of the DAS. The documentary evidence37 indicates that in the case of the FARC, any state official is automatically seen as representing an oppressive regime against whom all means are justified in their revolutionary struggle, including kidnapping and killing of their families. Based on the aforementioned evidence, the panel finds that both the claimant and his family had the right profile to be targets of the FARC guerrillas.\nThe question then arises whether there is a serious possibility that the guerrillas would target the claimants should they return to Colombia. The claimant testified that, should he be returned to Colombia, he will be located by the FARC because they consider him to be their enemy for failing to comply with their orders to provide instructions about XXXXX to their members. The claimant's testimony indicates that the claimant's principles did not allow him to provide instructions about XXXXX to the guerrillas. As a result, upon his return to Colombia, the FARC will initially target him and force him to comply with their demands. Failing to achieve this, they will kidnap and\/or kill his wife and children. His evidence generally agreed with the documentary evidence. For example, he indicated that the FARC had the technology to locate people they sought. The documentary evidence38 indicates that one specific feature of the conflict in Colombia is the high rate of kidnappings, which, in 2001, reached 3,041 persons, an average of 8 per day. Extortion practices, including ransoms and other forced payments are commonplace. The main perpetrators reportedly are guerrilla groups.\nThe most recent documentary evidence,39 not entered at the hearing indicates that the FARC has infiltrated almost all of the organisations in Colombia. The same document indicates that:\n... For the middle and upper classes of individuals who have been victimized by extortion and intimidation at the hands of the guerrillas, it is even more difficult to escape. The guerrillas have sophisticated intelligence-gathering capabilities. They can track one's physical whereabouts through the use of taxi drivers, domestic servants, airlines and travel agencies. They have access to private bank records and credit card activities, and they can track someone down based on their paper trail.\nIn the same document, the associate professor at Stetson University College of Law indicated that members of the FARC, the ELN and the AUC are present in \"nearly all the urban centres of any note in Colombia.\"\nThe same document indicates that the armed groups' capacity to locate and target threatened individuals remains unchanged since Alvaro Uribe Velez assumed the office of President in August 2002. According to the Georgetown University adjunct professor, both the guerrillas and the paramilitary groups often employ highly sophisticated databases and computer networks. An individual who is threatened in one area of the country will not be notably safer by relocating to another. Depending on the nature and reasons for the threat, the victims can be pursued relentlessly. There are countless stories of men and women receiving threats in Bogot\u00e1 or Medellin after relocating from another area and attempting to live anonymously in the big city. Many have been killed after seeking refuge in another part of the country. There are also cases of people leaving the country for a period of months or years, and then being killed after returning. Memories are long and data is systematically recorded and analysed.\nBased on the above documentary evidence, the panel finds that the FARC has the capabilities of tracking down their targets anywhere in Colombia, indicating that there is no viable internal flight alternative for the claimant's family in Colombia. The finds that the claimants have a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of FARC guerrillas should they return to Colombia.\nState Protection\nThe Colombian government authorities have failed to provide adequate protection to their citizens. The documentary evidence indicates that:\nA major internal armed conflict between the Government and the leftist guerrillas, particularly the FARC and the terrorist organisation National Liberation Army (ELN)- as well as right-wing paramilitaries, particularly the terrorist organisation United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), caused deaths of between 5,000 and 6,000 civilians during the year, including combat casualties, political killings, and forced disappearances. Serious violations of human rights were commonplace....40\nThe documentary evidence41 clearly indicates that Colombian authorities have been unable to stem the violence perpetrated by the guerrilla groups and the paramilitaries. The notion of obtaining state protection is made even more unrealistic by the fact that these insurgencies have infiltrated most of the state security organs.\nThe documentary evidence also indicates that even members of the parliament lack state protection in that they are kidnapped by the FARC from the assembly headquarters. The document indicates that:\nOn April 11, the FARC committed a daring daylight kidnapping of 16 members of the Valle del Cauca departmental assembly from the assembly's headquarters in downtown Cali. FARC operatives dressed in army uniforms announced that the building was being evacuated because of a bomb threat and hurried victims into a waiting bus painted in army colors....42\nFurthermore, the documentary evidence indicates that one fifth of Colombia has no state protection whatsoever. The documentary evidence indicates that:\nThreats against local authorities are common and countrywide. The precarious situation of mayors and council members and other municipal authorities is illustrative of the weakness of the state. Roughly one fifth of Colombia's municipalities are without state security presence (i.e. army or police). In many smaller municipalities the limited police presence is no guarantee against threats by illegal actors.43\nAnother document44 indicates that the FARC has bombed police stations including police headquarters in Bogot\u00e1 injuring and killing several civilians and policemen. On May 2, the FARC forces launched an inaccurate gas cylinder bomb at AUC forces in the small town of Bojaya; the bomb struck the town church where about 300 civilians had sought refuge, killing 119 civilians including 45 children and wounding at least 105 others.\nBased on the documentary evidence, the panel finds that state authorities are not capable of protecting themselves against the FARC, other guerrilla groups and paramilitaries, and, therefore, at the present time, they are not capable of adequately protecting the citizens in similar situations as the claimant's family in Colombia.\nTherefore, based on the evidence adduced, the panel concludes that the claimants have rebutted the presumption of state protection and have clearly established that, in their case, the government of Colombia is not able to adequately protect them.\nCONCLUSION\nBased on the evidence adduced and the documentary evidence, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility that the claimant and his family will be persecuted at the hands of the FARC should they return to Colombia.\nEven though the panel finds the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of FARC guerrillas, because there is no balancing as per Arica,45 he is excluded. Since the claimant, XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, is excluded, he is not a Convention refugee nor is he a person in need of protection.\nHowever, the Refugee Protection Division determines that XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX and XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX are Convention refugees.\n\"S.

He claims to fear persecution at the hands of the National Liberation Army (ELN) on the grounds of his pro-government\/anti-ELN political opinion. He also claims that he is at a risk to his life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment at the hands of the ELN, if he returns to Colombia.\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (the second claimant) is a female citizen of Colombia and is the spouse of the claimant. She claims to fear persecution on the grounds of her membership in a particular social group, namely, close family member of the claimant, at the hands of the ELN. She also claims that she is at a risk to her life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment at the hands of the ELN. The second claimant relied on the narrative of the claimant and bases her claim to refugee protection on the claimant's claim.\nAllegations\nThe claimant made the following allegations in the narrative of his Personal Information Form.1\nIn 1999, the claimant's brother, a XXXXXXXXXXXX, was threatened with death by guerrilla and paramilitary groups due to his work with Internally Displaced Persons (IDP's). He was accepted as a landed immigrant through the Embassy of Canada in Bogota as a member of the political refugee class, RS4. Following his departure, the claimant's family began to receive threats from the ELN.\nThe claimant is an XXXXXXX. In 2000, after he started to work for the Government of the Department of XXXX with the XXXXXXXXXXXX, the claimant began to receive threatening phone calls, on approximately a monthly basis, at his office and his home from a representative of the ELN. The claimant was advised that, as a government employee, he was automatically declared a military target. The claimant received threatening letters from the ELN at his office and home, as well as floral arrangements and a note of condolence (\"sufragio\") used by the guerrilla as death threats.\nThroughout 2001, the claimant sought protection from various authorities including the Municipal Office of XXXXXXXXXXX, the Ombudsman's Office (\"Defensoria del Pueblo\"), the Attorney General of the Nation (\"Fiscalia\") and GAULA. GAULA assigned to an investigator to the claimant's case but advised that, due to the intensity of the conflict and the large number of people receiving threats, it was impossible to provide individual personal security. The claimant changed telephone numbers, place of residence, daily routines and travel routes and transferred to a less public position in the\ngovernment. The claimant continued to receive threats from the ELN until he and the second claimant left Colombia in XXXXX 2002.\nAnalysis of the Principal Claimant's Claim\nCredibility\nI find the claimant to be a credible witness. He testified in a spontaneous and unembellished manner and there were no material inconsistencies in his testimony or contradictions between his testimony and the other evidence before me.2 Therefore, I believe the allegations he has made in support of his claim to be true.\nIdentity\nThe claimant's identity as a national of Colombia is established by his credible testimony and the supporting documentation filed, including, a certified true copy of his passport and citizenship card.3\nNexus\nI find that the claimant fears persecution by reason of his political opinion, namely a pro-government\/anti-ELN political opinion. The claimant's pro-government political opinion is established on the basis of his employment by the departmental government of XXXXXXX, Colombia, signalling his support of the established governmental system. The claimant's anti-ELN political opinion is established on the basis of the claimant's stated opposition of the ELN, his refusal to comply with their demands, his association with his brother, XXXXXXXXX, who eluded the demands of the ELN, and the fact that his participation in the established governmental system indicates an opposition to the irregular forces in Colombia, including the ELN. The political nature of the ELN is well established in the documentary evidence.\nPersecution\nThe claimant fears being persistently threatened, kidnapped, physically assaulted, tortured and killed. The type of harm feared by the claimant constitutes persecution.\nWell-foundedness of the Fear of Persecution\nI find that there is a reasonable chance that the claimant will be persecuted if he returns to Colombia for the following reasons.\nThe claimant was persistently threatened with harm and death over a period of a year and a half,4 which is a example of past personal persecution.5 The documentary evidence indicates that the ELN engages in other forms of human rights violations feared by the claimant such as kidnapping, torture and extrajudicial killing.6 There is evidence of a similarly situated person having been persecuted in that the claimant's brother XXXX XXXXXXXX was vigorously threatened by guerrilla and paramilitary groups in 1999 due to his public service work as a XXXXXXXX for XXXXXXXX of displaced families. Based on the evidence that the claimant's brother presented to the Canadian Embassy in Bogota, Colombia, he was admitted to Canada as a member of the political refugee class along with his family.7\nThe claimant possesses a number of profiles, any one of which could result in the ELN persecuting him, according to the documentary evidence on the current political violence in Colombia.\nThe claimant has a particular profile as a former government employee as he was employed by the Government of the Department of XXXXXXXX.8 Documentary evidence indicates that, in addition to elected officials, employees of all levels of government, especially those in positions of responsibility, are persecuted by the ELN.9\nAs a professional XXXXXXXXX10 who owned property,11 the claimant fits the profile of persons generally perceived to belong to a class wealthy, professional and\/or land-owning persons in Colombia. The documents on country conditions in Colombia indicate that the guerrillas kidnap and extort members of the middle and upper classes, both because they are deemed to hold opposing political views and because they are seen as a potential source of funds.12\nThe claimant possesses the profile of an individual who opposed to the methods and objectives of the ELN, both because he personally failed to comply with ELN demands and because he is related to an individual targeted by the ELN. Several letters from the ELN to the claimant indicate that the claimant and his family will suffer consequences if he does not meet their demands13 and the documentary evidence corroborates that persons who do not comply with demands made of them by the ELN are marked for persecution.14 The claimant's brother was targeted by the ELN for his work with XXXXX and after his brother XXXXX fled Colombia, the claimant and other family members were threatened by the ELN because the ELN could not find XXXXX.15 The documentary evidence establishes that relatives of persons who are, or have been, targeted by the ELN, are themselves often persecuted by the ELN because they are deemed to hold the same political opinion as the targeted relative or simply out of revenge against the initial target.16\nState Protection\nIn assessing state protection for the claimant in the current Colombian context, I relied only on the items listed in the September 2003 Refugee Protection Division Package on Colombia that are marked with an asterisk.\nIn Villafranca,17 the Court of Appeal specified that,\n... where a state is in effective control of its territory, has military, police and civil authority in place, and makes serious efforts to protect its\ncitizens from terrorist activities, the mere fact that it is not always successful at doing so will not be enough to justify a claim that the victims of terrorism are unable to avail themselves of such protection.18\nThe type of situation contemplated by the Court in Villafranca, specifically, a situation in which state protection, though imperfect, exists, is not the situation in Colombia today. The Government of Colombia is not in effective control of its entire territory; its military, police, judicial and civil authorities are significantly infiltrated by the guerrilla and paramilitary forces; its efforts to protect its citizens are genuine but are ineffective; and its inability to protect is not limited in scope but rather is so common-place that the citizenry has largely lost faith in the existing protection systems.\nLack of Territorial Control\nThe documentary evidence shows that the Government of Colombia is not in control of its entire territory. According to national and international sources, the guerrillas and paramilitaries have their respective areas of control in rural Colombia19 as well as in numerous urban centers.20 21 Furthermore, a report by the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees indicates that the guerrilla forces were striving to gain increased territorial control of Colombia in approximately 2001-2002.22\nInfiltration of the Military, Police, Judicial and Civilian Authorities\nThe documentary evidence clearly shows that although there are military, police, judicial and civil authorities in Colombia, the guerrilla forces, including the ELN, are increasingly infiltrating these state institutions to the extent that their ability to function purely in the interest of the state is being compromised. Most sources acknowledge that the guerrilla forces have infiltrated the military at the lower ranks and some sources contend that the infiltration extends to the officer corps.23 24 There are also references to the infiltration of police forces by the guerrilla.25 Reliable sources report that the FARC and the ELN have infiltrated at least the local level judiciary, in part by forcing local politicians to appoint judicial officials who are under the influence of the guerrilla.26\nThere is indication of guerrilla infiltration in national ministries including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and in departmental and municipal institutions.27 The\ninfiltrators collect intelligence and influence the awarding of public works contracts and personnel and budgetary decisions. According to expert sources, the guerrillas are running their own candidates in some municipal elections28 and it is estimated that guerrillas control public spending in roughly 20 per cent of the country. In sum, there is evidence of a significant degree of infiltration by the guerrilla in the protection agencies and authority structure in Colombia.\nIneffective Protection Efforts\nThe Government of Colombia makes efforts to protect its citizens; however, its efforts are insufficient to effectively address the vast need for protection against the guerrilla and paramilitary forces. A substantial network of protection apparatus exists, including the National Police, the Armed Forces,29 the Ombudsman's Office (\"Defensoria del Pueblo\"), the Attorney (or Prosecutor) General's Office (\"Fiscalia\"), the Inspector General's Office (\"Procuraduria\") and the GAULA units.\nSince President Alvaro Uribe Velez took office in August 2002, there have been several initiatives to bolster protection provisions largely related to the National Police\nand the Armed Forces .30 However, some recent initiatives, such as the limited state of emergency declaration and the establishment of \"rehabilitation and consolidation zones\", in which movement was restricted and curfews allowed, were found to be illegal.31 The government's Peasant Soldier Program (\"Soldados Campesinos\"), in which rural volunteers are given training in exchange for protecting state held territory, was met by an announcement by the ELN that these volunteers are labeled military targets.32 The Peasant Soldier Program, along with the government sponsored Civilian Informant Network, has been criticized by Amnesty International and the Colombian Commission of Jurists for drawing non-combatants into the conflict instead of protecting citizens.33 Significantly, in the same time period, the ability of the Attorney General's Office (\"Fiscalia\") to investigate and prosecute human rights cases has deteriorated and the Ombudsman's Office (\"Defensoria del Pueblo\") has a diminished capacity to monitor and prevent human rights violations.34\nScope of Inability to Protect\nFinally, the state's inability to protect is not limited in scope. Protection of the population requires that human rights violators are routinely and appropriately punished, and the existence of such punishment factors significantly in the state's capacity to prevent human rights violations from occurring. The documentary evidence emphatically states that impunity for human rights violators is at a critical level in Colombia. Due to a lack of resources, protection for witnesses and investigators, co-ordination between government bodies and, sometimes, obstruction of justice, there is a high degree of impunity for the accused.35 In the case of the ELN, current documents show that the group continues to engage in kidnapping for ransom, detonating bombs in urban centres, blockading regions and municipalities, as well as declaring participants of the government's Peasant Soldier Program, military targets.36 The general conclusion of respected international organizations is that level of violence has remained almost the same since the beginning of Uribe's presidency in mid-2002 as it was in the years immediately prior.37\nSummation on State Protection\nWhether a country is making serious efforts to protect its citizens is a key consideration in assessing whether the requisite level of state protection exists. However,\neven serious efforts taken to protect the citizenry must be viewed in the factual context to ascertain whether those efforts meet the protection needs of citizens in an actual sense. In the context of the current levels of political violence in Colombia, the state protection apparatus simply cannot provide meaningful protection for the many Colombians who are in grave danger of human rights violations, and, thus, protection does not adequately exist. The claimant testified that he approached several state protection agencies,38 and though it was acknowledged that he was in serious danger, the agencies advised him that they were unable to provide him protection39 because the intensity of the conflict and the volume of threats made against citizens made it impossible to provide each individual with protection .40 On the basis of above, I find that the state protection is not available to the claimant if he returned to Colombia and faced persecution.\nInternal Flight Alternative\nI find that there is no internal flight alternative for the claimant for the following reasons. The documentary evidence indicates that the ELN operates throughout much of the territory of Colombia, including all major cities. 41 Although not physically present\nthroughout the entire territory of Colombia, expert sources report that the ELN have highly sophisticated databases and computer networks that are capable of locating targeted individuals anywhere in the country.42 43 Significantly, the ELN, following some years of stagnation or decline, is currently increasing its ranks and armed actions44 and its increased intelligence and communications sharing with the FARC enhances its ability to successfully locate a targeted individual.\nI also base my finding that there is no viable internal flight alternative for the claimant on the advice of The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, specifically, that decision makers not apply the notion of internal relocation alternative when assessing international protection claims against Colombia given the following factors prevalent in the Colombian context.45 These factors include the highly fluid and volatile nature of the conflict, the destruction of socio-economic infrastructure and widespread internal displacement, the inability of the Colombian government to extend their authority to significant areas of the country and the effective communications networks established by illegal armed groups that are capable of tracing and reaching targets throughout Colombia.\nAnalysis of the Second Claimant's Claim\nThe second claimant's identity as a national of Colombia is established by her written testimony46 and supporting documentation including a certified true copy of her passport, citizenship card, and other identity documents47 The second claimant's identity as the spouse of the principal claimant is established by her written testimony,48 the principal claimant's written and oral testimony and supporting documentation, namely, the marriage certificate certifying that the principal claimant and the second claimant are married.49\nI find that there is a reasonable chance that the second claimant will be persecuted by reason of her membership in a particular social group, namely, close family member of the principal claimant, if she returns to Colombia for the following reasons. The second claimant experienced past incidents of persecution in that many of the threats made by the ELN specifically stated that the principal claimant's family members were objects of their threats.50 As the spouse of the principal claimant, who is the primary target of the ELN, the second claimant fits a profile of persons often persecuted by the ELN according to the documentary evidence.51\nConclusion\nI find that there is a reasonable chance that the principal claimant will be persecuted by the ELN by reason of his pro-government\/anti-ELN political opinion if he returns to Colombia.\nGiven the evidence with respect to the second claimant's claim and the positive determination of the principal claimant's claim, upon which the claim of the second claimant is based, I find that there is a reasonable chance the second claimant will be persecuted by the ELN by reason of her membership in a particular social group, namely, close family member of the principal claimant, if she returns to Colombia.\nAccordingly, the Refugee Protection Division determines that XXXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXX are Convention refugees and accepts their claims to refugee protection.

He fears persecution at the hands of a gang of bank robbers whom he believes to be members of the mafia in Costa Rica. The following family members of the principal claimant, all citizens of Costa Rica, base their claims on being members of a particular social group, that being family members of the principal claimant. They are: The principal claimant's wife, XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX (35 years old), and the adult claimants' 4 children, XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX (18 years old), XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX (15 years old), XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX (10 years old) and XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX (7 years old). I have considered if the claimants are Convention refugees or if they face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture in Costa Rica.\nDetermination\nI find that the claimants are not Convention refugees, as their claims do not have a nexus to a Convention ground. I also find that they are not persons in need of protection for the reasons outlined below.\nJurisprudential Guidelines\nThe determinative issue in this claim is state protection. I considered1 whether the Jurisprudential Guides'2 decision TA2-14980 applies in this case and determine that the facts and the evidence regarding country conditions in this case are sufficiently close to those before the panel in RPD decision TA2-14980 because 1) they both deal with Costa Rican claimants seeking protection due to their fear of criminality, and 2) the issue in both is the determination of the availability of state protection for victims of crime. I considered the evidence submitted by the claimant 3. In addition, I considered the April 2003 RPD Information Package, which was not before the Jurisprudential Guide panel. In reaching my decision, I have assessed the claimant's own experiences in the context of the entirety of the evidence.\nAllegations\nThe principal claimant alleges the following: In XXXXX 1998 he witnessed a bank robbery and called the police. The police arrived and the robbers fled with hostages\nand money. The claimant's name appeared in the paper as the person who alerted the police. The day after the robbery the police stationed 2 guards outside the claimant's shop for a 2 week period, to protect him from retaliation, as they believed the perpetrators to be mafia members. One bank robber was captured shortly after the robbery and another one was captured at a later date. Some weeks later the thugs returned and beat and threatened the claimant and demanded $5000.00 as payback from the failed heist. The claimant went to the hospital and the police were called and went to see him in the hospital. The police said they would investigate. The claimant requested protection but was advised that he could not be provided with permanent around the clock protection, as they did not have the resources. The police said they could simply patrol the area on occasion. A week later the perpetrators returned to the claimant's shop and demanded money and beat and threatened him again, and his wife got a threatening call. The claimants did not contact the police or seek any state protection after that attack or at any time subsequently. They moved residences and the claimant came to Canada in XXXXX 1998 after he heard the criminals had been looking for him. The claimant's family members followed him to Canada in XXXXX 1998 and they all made refugee claims. The refugee claims were rejected and the family returned to Costa Rica in XXXXX 2001. In XXXXX 2001 they were threatened again by the same perpetrators and wanted to return to Canada to seek protection but could not afford it. Again, they did not contact the police or seek any state protection because they believed protection would not be forthcoming. In XXXXX 2002 the male claimant returned to Canada, and after being threatened the female claimant and the children returned to Canada in XXXXX 2002, and they all made repeat refugee claims.\nAnalysis\nThe claimant's identities as nationals of Costa Rica are established by certified true copies of their passports4 submitted by Citizenship and Immigration Canada as well as by their testimony.\nThe availability of state protection for the claimants is the determinative issue in these claims. Counsel for the claimant argued that facts in this matter could be clearly distinguished from the Jurisprudential Guidelines (JG) case TA2-14980, as the agents of persecution in the case at bar were members of the mafia and not youth gang members as in the fact scenario in the JG case. I find on the contrary that the analysis in the JG case applies to the cases at bar because it points to the numerous mechanisms available in\nCosta Rica for persons who are victims of crime, such as the claimants before me. I therefore determine that TA2-14980 applies in these cases since the availability of state protection in Costa Rica has been comprehensively analyzed in TA2-14980 and that reasoning applies to the facts of this claim. As a result, I adopt the reasoning in TA2-14980.\nThe documentary evidence reveals that the Costa Rican government is making serious efforts to protect people who are victims of crime, such as the claimants in the case at bar. Furthermore, there are a number of recourses available in Costa Rica for the assessment, prosecution, and the granting of remedies resulting from the failure of the law enforcement agencies to conduct their work.\nIn the case at bar, I accept that the claimants may have been pursued by the persons whom the principal claimant reported as the bank robbers. However, I find that adequate state protection was available to them for the following reasons.\nThe claimant submitted documentary evidence highlighting the fact that the mafia exists in Costa Rica5 and the fact that there exists no witness protection program and, \"while not urgent\", it has been identified as lacking in the Costa Rican criminal justice system.6 Notwithstanding these facts, I find that while there is no witness protection program per se, there is ample documentary evidence before me to conclude that the state authorities in Costa Rica are willing and able to investigate criminals such as those that may have been pursuing the claimants, and are making serious efforts to do so.\nThe claimant said that after he was refused protection he did not return to the police because he thought it would be futile. I find that since the claimant was not satisfied with the police response to his request for protection, that he had recourse to other authorities in Costa Rica. I find that he did not make reasonable efforts to pursue all the avenues open to him.\nFor example, when asked if he went to the Investigative Judicial Police (OIJ) to report the crimes against him, he said that he did not. He said that the OIJ might have intervened if asked. However, he was scared and his only desire was to leave town. Besides, he said, the OIJ was located 80 kilometers from his home. He did not know why he did not go there but in fact they have very few officers and their role is investigation not protection. I find that the state authorities in Costa Rica could not protect the claimants unless they did an investigation, and there is no chance they would investigate if they were not made aware of the problems. I find the claimant's reasons for not pursuing the matter with other state authorities to be unreasonable. I find the onus was on him to search for remedies beyond the single refusal for protection he got from one police office. A claimant must do more than simply show that he went to some members of the police force and that his efforts were unsuccessful. The more democratic the state's institutions, the more the claimant must have done to exhaust all the courses open to him.7 I find that the appropriate course of action taken by a reasonable person would have been to pursue his case through the available authorities, rather than assuming that the process was flawed and take the extreme measure of leaving the country.\nI find that if the claimants did report the subsequent events to the police or to the OIJ, having considered the previous actions of the police and all of the documentary evidence before me, I find that it is likely that the police would have investigated the matter and provided further protection to the claimants.\nFinally, the claimants submitted a psychological report8 that concluded that 10-year-old XXXXX is fearful of the killings in Costa Rica and that this predisposes him to\nthe development of several psychiatric disorders. I find this assessment very concerning for the child and his family. However, I find that while this psychological assessment addresses XXXXX fears and potential risks to him with respect to his mental health, it does not address the availability of state protection in Costa Rica for this family and therefore has little probative value with respect to the determinative issue. In other words, XXXXX fearfulness does not impact on the state's ability to provide protection to him and his family and I cannot give it any weight in the matter before me.\nI considered that Costa Rica 9 is a long-standing, stable, constitutional democracy with an independent judiciary providing effective means to deal with individual criminal cases. With this in mind, and in the context of this claim and the claimants' country of origin, I find that the claimants have not taken reasonable steps to seek protection in Costa Rica. I therefore find the claimants have not rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence of the state's inability or unwillingness to protect them.\nGiven that there is state protection for these claimants in Costa Rica, I find that there is not a serious possibility that they would face persecution, nor is there a risk to\ntheir lives, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture should they return to Costa Rica.\nAccordingly, the RPD finds that XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX and XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection and rejects their claims.\n\"M.

The claimant was notified that matters involving Article 1F(a) of the 1951 Convention have been raised by the claim, in light of his former status as a soldier in the Colombian armed forces.\nAt the hearing on October 27, 2003, the claimant was unrepresented. On that day, at the end of the hearing, he gave oral closing remarks, followed by observations by the Refugee Protection Officer (RPO). Mr. David Cranton participated as the Hearings Officer (Minister's Representative).\nFollowing receipt of the Hearings Officer's submissions on the issues of Article 1F(a), the claimant retained Counsel. Thereafter, post-hearing, documents and further written submissions were received from the claimant's new Counsel, and, as well, from the Hearings Officer, in response to new Counsel's arguments.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant alleges the following. He is seeking refugee protection in Canada because he has been victimized by members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia - Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC). He received death threats from FARC, as he did not comply with their requests, when, as a recruiting officer for the XXX Brigade XXXXXX Unit, in XXXXXX, he was asked to grant military exemptions for some of FARC supporters.\nAt the end of his basic military service, around XXXXX 1991, the claimant was appointed an XXXXX to the newly-conscripted privates. Later, he became a Reserve Officer, with quick promotion to the rank of XXXXXX, as he was among the XXXXX XXXXXX at the end of his mandatory service.\nIn 1993, there was a call by the XXXX Brigade XXXXXXX Unit of XXXXX for Reserve Officers to assist in XXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXXX XXXXXX for the army. The claimant served part-time in this process of administrative XXXXX from 1993 until around XXXX 1996, and later4 from XXXXX 2000 to XXXX 2000.\nThe claimant alleges that in December 1995 he was approached by two members of FARC and given a list of names that FARC wanted to be exempt from compulsory\nmilitary service. He was promised compensation. The claimant immediately rejected the request. However, one week later he was approached by two different members of FARC and he was told that he had to comply or else he would face serious consequences. He alleges that sometime later, he received a call from someone who identified himself as the \"big boss\", and he was told it was his last chance.\nThe claimant did not report these incidents to his superiors or to the Colombian police. He alleges that he was confused and frightened. His fear increased when, on XXXXX, 1996, he learned that his brother had been murdered while driving his (the claimant's) car. He believes that he was the intended target.\nThe claimant left XXXXX and pursued XXXXXXXX studies in Bogota, with a view to becoming a XXXXXXX. He graduated from XXXXXXX school in XXXXXXX 1999, and then did some XXXXXXX training. While awaiting a call up for employment from XXXXXXXXX, he returned to XXXXXXX, and he resumed his volunteer work as a reserve officer with the XXXXXX Brigade XXXXXX office, either in XXXXX 1999 or in XXXXX 2000.\nWhile back in XXXXXXX, around XXXX 2000, he received another call from the \"big boss\" and he was told that FARC was aware that he had returned to the area. He was told that he had one week to leave or he would die. He quickly left Colombia in XXXXX 2000 and went to Spain where he lived for about one year. He arrived in Canada on June 7th, 2001.\nIn her observations, the RPO pointed out that there were areas of discrepancy and inconsistency in the testimony, and it was pointed out that the plausibility of some aspects of the allegations needed to be reviewed.\nDETERMINATION\nAfter careful consideration of all of the evidence, the RPO's observations, and the submissions of Counsel and the Hearings Officer, I am of the opinion that the exclusion provision (Article 1F(a)) of the Act is applicable in this claim and that the claimant is not a Convention refugee. I concur with the conclusion of the Hearings Officer that the claimant comes within the parameters of Article 1F of the Refugee Convention.\nANALYSIS LEADING TO DETERMINATION ON EXCLUSION:\n(i) The law and statutory provisions\nI am guided, primarily, by the decisions in Ramirez,5 Sivakumar6 and Moreno,7 and I note the following.\nIn Ramirez,8 the Court found that the burden of proving that the claimant should be excluded from determination as a Convention refugee is on the party so asserting, rather than on the claimant to demonstrate that he should not be excluded from such status. It held, further, that the test for determining whether there are \"serious reasons for considering\" that a crime has been committed, require less than a balance of probabilities.\nThe Court9 also reviewed the degree of involvement required on the part of the claimant in order to be excluded from Convention refugee status, and found that accomplices, as well as principal actors, may be subject to exclusion. It was held that a person could be considered to be an accomplice, if there is personal and knowing participation in the persecutorial act, and the Court went on to provide examples of this test. It stated10 that\n\"... mere membership in an organization which from time to time commits international offenses will be sufficient for exclusion from refugee status where the organization is principally directed to a limited, brutal purpose, which may, by necessity, involve personal and knowing participation in persecutorial acts...someone who is an associate of the principal offender can never be said to be a mere onlooker...\"\nThe Court11 also looked at the claimant's opportunity to have left the organization earlier, without risk of harm to himself, and the length of time in the organization.\nIn Sivakumar,12 the Court looked at the method of recruitment (voluntarily) in the claimant's organization, the nature of the organization (violence\/killings), the claimant's position\/rank in the organization, including his high level promotions, the claimant's opportunity to leave the organization and the claimant's length of time in the organization.\nIn Moreno,13 the Court further clarified that a claimant can be held accountable where the organization in which he is involved is premised on achieving political or social ends by any means necessary, while still considering that mere membership in the organization involved in international offenses is not sufficient basis on which to invoke the exclusion clause.\n(ii) The claimant's specific role\/activities in the Colombian armed forces that give rise to a consideration of complicity:\nIn this claim the relevant factors for consideration are: the nature of the organization (the Colombian army); the claimant's rank; his knowledge of the atrocities; opportunity to leave the army and period of time spent in the army.\nThe written narrative, and his oral responses reveal that the claimant worked for at least three years as a XXXXXXXX officer with the XXX Brigade XXXXXXXX office in XXXXXX. At the end of his basic army service he was selected among XXXX XXXXX XXXXX soldiers of his group that were being made reservists.\nThe claimant was a 1st class reservist with the rank of XXXXXXXX in the army reserve, and he was one of XXXXX officers selected to assist in the XXXXX work. The XXXXXXXX entailed having interviews with XXXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXX XXX for the army.\nThe claimant did two terms of office with the XXXXXX unit. He worked from 1993 to XXXXXX 1996. On completion of his studies at the XXXXXXXX in 1999 in Bogota, he returned to XXXXXXX and resumed work with the XXXXXXXXXX office, either in XXXXXX 1999 only, or from XXXXXXX 2000 until XXXX 2000.\nNext door to the claimant's office, the XXX Brigade XXXXX unit, there was an office, or army command, of the regular army XXXX Brigade, and there were times when there was dialogue between both offices, when there was a specific need. For example, sometimes, the Commanders of the XXX Brigade army office personally visited the XXXXX office to give a final say as to who was to be XXXXXXX.\nThe claimant was involved in the XXXXX XXXXXX (XXXXX, XXXXand XXXX), for roughly six (6) weeks per year. He stated that an additional six (6) weeks of his time was probably spent in occasional meetings\/sessions on policies. In each XXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX XXXXXX XXXX XXXXXX. However, the final decision on final XXXXX XXXXX XXX XXfor the army was made by the Commander of the army unit to which they were to be assigned.\nThe claimant severed his connection with the army, only after he had allegedly received threatening calls from FARC who sought his assistance in providing military exemptions for their members.\nIn summary, the claimant worked as a XXXXX officer for at least three years, and the evidence does not show that the was under duress to do that. He was a volunteer.\n(iii) The documentary evidence on the Colombian armed forces\nSection 98 of IRPA14 states that persons referred to in Article 1F(a) of the Refugee Convention are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection, and states, in part:\n\"The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:\n\" (a)he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes...\"\nCredible sources cited in the documentary evidence15 state that the Colombian armed forces have been guilty of committing gross human rights violations against the civilian population for decades, before and during the claimant's period of service. One such source16 says the following:\n\"...violations of international humanitarian law- the laws of war- are not abstract concepts in Colombia, but a grim material of everyday life. War bursts into the daily activities of a farm, a village, a public bus, or a school with the speed of armed fighters arriving down a path or in four-wheel drive vehicles. Sometimes armed men carefully choose their victims from lists. Other times, they simply kill those nearby, to spread fear. Indeed, a willingness to commit atrocities is among the most striking features of Colombia's war...the Colombian army teaches its officers the basics of international humanitarian law and makes instructional material available to officers, professional soldiers, and recruits...\n...Nevertheless, after examining hundreds of cases and interviewing many officers, government investigators and civilians who have witnessed violations, Human Rights Watch concluded that the army continues to engage in serious violations of the laws of war, with little apparent will to investigate or punish those responsible. At the root of these violations is the Colombian army's consistent and profound failure or refusal to properly distinguish civilians from combatants...\"\nOther relevant documentary information,17 as cited by the Hearings Officer, shows that the Colombian army has been implicated in murder, torture and enforced disappearances, generally, and during the time of the claimant's service in that army and states as follows:\n\"...the information received by the Special Rapporteur shows that violations of the right to life are continuing to occur on a large scale and that there are no indications that an improvement is foreseeable in the short term. Members of the army, paramilitary groups, the police, and to a lesser extent guerrilla groups are reported to have been responsible for a large number of violations of the right to life...\"18\n\"...during 1990 and 1991 the army launched major offensives against guerrilla forces in several parts of the country. Little or no effort was made to protect the civilian population during these operations...Military commanders routinely claim that unarmed civilians extrajudicially executed by soldiers were guerrillas killed in combat. Blaming the guerrillas is another of the army's usual responses to accusations of human rights violations...\"19\nThe United States Department of State reports20 on Country Conditions in Colombia for the years 1991 and 1993 give the same grim picture and states that members and units of the army and the police participated in a number of human rights violations including extrajudicial killings, disappearances, torture and arbitrary detention, and that the army is reluctant to distinguish between guerrillas and non-combatants during counterinsurgency operations.\nFurther, a Report21 of 1994, prepared by the Inter-Church Committee on Human Rights in Latin America (ICCHRLA) states :\n\"...during its two most recent visits to Colombia, ICCHRLA representatives travelled to several conflicted zones in the country and received reliable reports of the same pattern of violations that have been signalled in the past. These include extrajudicial executions of civilians by military personnel which are later presented as \" guerrillas killed in combat\"; indiscriminate bombing and aerial strafing of communities where the military suspect a guerrilla presence and forced recruitment of civilians who are obliged to dress in military uniforms and act as guides in conflictive zones...\"\nThe role of the Mobile Brigade is particularly relevant in this analysis. In particular, the XXXXX Brigade of the army which, as the claimant testifies, maintained an office adjacent to the XXXXX office where he worked, has committed atrocities.\nA general commentary on the Mobile Brigade is as follows:\n\"...the centrepiece of army strategy is the Mobile Brigade. The Mobile Brigade is conceived as a highly mobile force equipped with weaponry and vehicles suitable for the country's rugged, often densely forested countryside...Mobile Brigades are composed of professional soldiers who volunteer...\"22\n\"...since their creation in 1990 the army's Mobile Brigades have been accused of frequent and serious human rights violations against civilians. These specialist counter-insurgency brigades are made up of professional soldiers...\"23\nThe claimant testified that he was aware of a parallel process of XXXXX volunteer soldiers. Whether he was involved in that particular process or not during his work of at least three years with the XXXXX Brigade XXXXX office, the documentary evidence24 highlights many instances of gross human rights violations by the Mobile Brigades, including XXXXX Brigade of the army, and by Commanders of the XXXXX Brigade of the army. For example, a November 1996 Human Rights Watch Report25 identifies the XXXXX Brigade in XXXXX as one of the units primarily devoted to fighting guerrillas and implicates the Brigade in human rights violations. Several Commanding Officers of the XXXXX Brigade have been accused26 of gross human rights violations and of colluding with paramilitary groups in committing human rights violations.\n(iv)The claimant's\/ counsel's arguments\nThe claimant gave inconsistent testimony about his involvement with the XXXXX office, beyond 1999. However, some very specific questions were asked at the hearing, and the claimant is not correct when, post-hearing, he submits27 through Counsel, that he did not testify that his activities with the XXXXX office went beyond XXXXX 1996.\nCounsel submits, in part:\n\"...from this point in 1996 through XXXXX 1999 the claimant testified that he was a full-time XXXXX student.\nThe Minister, in his submissions indicates that he believed the claimant to have also been involved with the army from XXXXX to XXXXX, 2000, however the claimant denies that he was involved with the army in any capacity other than a social one (he had friends in the army and also played soccer with them). Certainly, information about army work from XXXXX to XXXXX, 2000 is not in the claimant's work history, nor is it contained in his narrative...\"28\nAt the hearing, on October 27, 2003, in his oral reply to the Refugee Protection Officer's (RPO) observations, the claimant acknowledged that there were discrepancies, but only in the dates, and not in the facts. However, when he was specifically asked when did he stop wearing the uniform, he responded that it was in XXXXX 2000, after getting the call. He was then asked, when did he return to the reserve operation, and he responded that he resumed in XXXXX 2000 and that when he received the call, he stopped.\nIn response to an earlier question, however, the claimant stated, as interpreted, that he took a break in 1996 for two years; that he came back in 1999 and got involved for about one month in XXXXX 1999, but that he only got involved in one XXXXX XXXXX.\nIt is clear, therefore, that the claimant had two stints. He participated a second time, after his XXXXX studies, whether it was in XXXXX 1999 or from XXXXX 2000 to XXXXX 2000. And, there is no dispute that the second call from FARC was in XXXXX 2000, while he was in XXXXX, and still officially a member of the army reserve. He left only as a result of the alleged threat from FARC.\nThe claimant stresses that he was not complicit in the armies operation, since he only performed administrative functions and was never a combat officer. He states that there is a vast difference between the XXXXX Brigade XXXXX Unit and the XXXXX Brigade infantry, and that he never participated in the combat and massacres that are attributed to the XXXXX Brigade. Moreover, he says, he knew that the XXXXX Brigade had a good reputation.\nIn his submissions, counsel emphasizes that the claimant's duties as a mere XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX office, and the nature of his job itself, mean that the claimant cannot be seen as an accomplice in the crimes committed by the Colombian army. Counsel also argues that \"volunteer work on a part-time basis does not constitute membership in an organization\",29 and that \"the claimant indicated in his testimony that he was unaware that human rights violations were being perpetrated by the army although he had heard reports of human rights violations perpetrated by guerrilla activities.\"30\nI do not agree with Counsel's submissions in this area. The claimant's testimony, as interpreted at the hearing, is as follows. When asked what did he know of the Colombian army, after graduating, the claimant responded that he knew that the XXXXX brigade had a good reputation. When he was further asked, what did he hear of the Colombian army, he responded that he heard that the Colombian army had been involved in human rights violations; he heard and saw it on TV, but it involved other Brigades. He said that he doubted it at the time because his experience at the XXXXX brigade was that they were decent people, and that what he saw on the TV related to activity in combat zones.\nIn my view, that response establishes that the claimant had some awareness of the activities of the army, and his complicity is established. Even if the final decision on those chosen was left to his senior personnel officer, or to the senior personnel of the army, the claimant was involved in the XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX for the fight. That was the purpose of the XXXXX process in which he was involved. Whether or not, neither he nor any member of the XXXXX brigade XXXXX team was ever in a combat zone, never fired a rifle nor ever met or heard of all of the tainted commanding officers of the Colombian army, they participated in the process. Indeed, the claimant testified that there were times when there was actual direct dialogue with Commanders of the XXXXX brigade army, whose office was next door to the XXXXX office.\nTherefore, it is not plausible that, during his volunteer work, the claimant had no knowledge of the operations and activities of the army, including the human rights violations in the combat zones, nor did he know of the Commanders that have been cited31 as having been guilty of gross human rights violations, as pointed out by the Hearings Officer. The claimant professed no knowledge of these Commanders, except General XXXXX XXXXX.32 He also submits that he was at University and not part of the process, during the period of atrocities attributed to these Commanders. He did\nadmit that he was aware of reports of incidents such as the San Rafael, San Carlos and El Aro massacres. He admitted that crimes attributed to General XXXXX were very much in the news. The fact is that, on the evidence, the claimant did participate with the XXXXX Brigade XXXXX XXXXX after some of these incidents, as he did participate in XXXXX XXXXX, either in XXXXX 1999, or XXXXX 2000. He had knowing participation.\nIn addition, the claimant was asked what influence did the TV news about the army's operation have on him, and his reply was that it determined whom they should XXXXX; that for example, \"XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX it meant that they would not get involved in things that were bad\". Clearly, therefore, the XXXXX XXXXX is an important one for the army, and a person involved, such as the claimant, whether military full-time or part-time, or civilian, is likely to have knowing participation in the army's activities, including its policies.\nCounsel cites Ramirez33 and Cardenas34 and states that the claimant's work as a volunteer does not qualify him as a member of the Colombian army. He states that the claimant cannot be connected to the alleged criminal activities of the Colombian armed forces. Part of counsel's arguments, also, is that the Minister has not provided evidence to confirm that there was widespread awareness by the public regarding human rights violations during the relevant period (XXXXX 1993 through XXXXX 1996). Counsel cites documentary evidence35 which states that part of the negatives of the situation in Colombia is that there has been insufficient public reports in Colombia about the human rights violations perpetrated by all sides, that there is a silence of the mass communications media, and that it is plausible that the claimant was unaware of the instances of violations by the army.\nI do not agree with Counsel's conclusion. The claimant was a 1st class reserve officer with a rank of XXXXX and member of the Colombian army. In addition, on the issue of knowing participation, in my opinion, the Minister properly cites the Court's finding in Bazargan36 in which the Court said:\n\"... in our view, it goes without saying that \"personal and knowing participation\" can be direct or indirect and does not require formal membership in the organization that is ultimately engaged in the condemned activities, It is not working within an organization that makes someone an accomplice to the organization's activities, but knowingly contributing to those activities in any way or making them possible, whether from within or from outside the organization...\"37\nThe Hearings Officer further referred to the Court of Appeal's decision in Ramirez and submits the following:\n\"...Justice MacGuigan went on to establish \"personal and knowing participation\" and a \"shared common purpose\" as the essential requirements for finding of complicity, formulating the following test: \"at bottom, complicity rests... on the existence of a shared common purpose and the knowledge that all of the parties in question may have it\"\"\n...In Harb, a recent Court of Appeal decision, Decary J.A, confirmed that personal commission of crimes against humanity is not required - one can be complicit by association. Once the organization with which one was associated has committed excludable crimes, and the requirements for complicity imposed by precedent are met, the Article 1F (a) exclusion applies even if the specific acts committed by the individual are not crimes against humanity...\"\nFurther, on the issue of the awareness of the atrocities and human rights violations, in my opinion, the claimant cannot be deemed to be unaware of these facts. As cited above,38 these facts have been publicized in the DOS reports, and as well, by credible sources such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the ICCHRLA.\nI have reviewed Counsel's references39 to the case law, and I note the submissions wherein he states that \"even if it is determined that the claimant's volunteer, part-time work for the organization constitutes membership it is submitted that he was no more than a \"mere\" member of the organization and therefore should not be excluded from refugee consideration...\"40\nI find that I must disagree with counsel. In my opinion, the claimant was more than a \"mere\" member. He was an officer involved in the XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX for an army which has been cited as having been involved in widespread or systematic murder, torture and enforced disappearance of guerrillas and civilians. He contributed to the activities. He was one of only four reservists selected to assist in the XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX for the Colombian army in XXXXX. He did that job for at least three years. He did not disassociate himself at any early opportunity and he only left the army, allegedly after his difficulties with FARC. From all credible reports, that army has committed widespread and systematic crimes against humanity, and it was common knowledge.\nCounsel's submissions that there may not have been widespread awareness by the public, including the claimant of the army's human rights violations do not apply to the claimant. He had heard about the violations, according to his oral testimony, and his post-hearing submissions are not accurate.\n(v) The Conclusion\/Findings\nBased on the above, I find that there are serious reasons for considering that the claimant, XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, has been an accomplice in crimes against humanity during his service with the Colombian army. Accordingly, he falls within the parameters of Article 1F(a) and is excluded from protection pursuant to s.98. He is not a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n\"George A.

These are the reasons for the negative decision in this claim.\nThe claimant's two previous claims2 were rejected in March 1999 and January 2001. The first panel did not believe the claimant's identity and the second panel did not believe his story. As the Immigration Act has changed since the claimant's last hearing, I applied the doctrine of res judicata with respect to his claim under section 96 and assessed his claim in regards to sections 97(1)(a) and (b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.3 I considered the new evidence presented in this claim, namely, that the claimant had learned from his father that in December 2001, his younger brother was picked up by the army and has disappeared.\nAnalysis:\nIdentity\/Credibility:\nI will assign the benefit of doubt and accept that the claimant is a Tamil-speaking Muslim from Sri Lanka. However, who exactly he is, is still an issue. Section 106 of IRPA states:\n106. The Refugee Protection Division must take into account, with respect to the credibility of a claimant, whether the claimant possesses acceptable documentation establishing identity, and if not, whether they have provided a reasonable explanation for the lack of documentation or have taken reasonable steps to obtain the documentation.\nI find that in this case the claimant did not provide acceptable documents to establish his identity and that he did not display due diligence in the pursuit of establishing his claim for protection. The claimant has known since receiving his first decision in March 1999 that the birth certificate and postal identity card, which he presented, were not considered trustworthy and persuasive evidence; however until this day he has not made any efforts in order to rectify this situation. Given that the second claim was turned down because of a further lack of credibility, one would expect such a claimant to make a special effort to obtain corroborating documents, however nothing was done. I took into account Rule 7 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules and the \"Commentary\" to that rule, when coming to this finding. Rule 7 states that,\n7. The claimant must provide acceptable documents establishing identity and other elements of the claim. A claimant who does not provide acceptable document must explain why they were not provided and what steps were taken to obtain them.\nI realize that a refugee claimant does not necessarily have to submit corroborating documentation to further a claim, however in this case, the claimant has gone through the refugee process twice and he claims to be well educated with 12 years of formal education. I find for a claimant with such a profile to indicate that his father let him down or to blame his depression for the neglect4 is not sufficient. The claimant showed that he knew for many years that he could not rely on his father to get documentation. However, he did not show that he made any effort to initiate requests from Canada directly to, for example, his school, mosque or the grama sevaka, in order to at least establish his personal identity and his whereabouts during material times. His counsel then suggested that he could go to the Sri Lankan Embassy to get a passport. However, he did not provide trustworthy and persuasive testimony as to why he had not taken this initiative prior to the hearing. I find that the claimant did not provide more documentation both in regards to his identity and his claim for persecution because his claim is not built on the truth.5 Based on the above, I find that I cannot give weight to his new evidence, namely, his unsupported statement that his brother was taken by the army and disappeared in December 2001.\nWould the removal to Sri Lanka subject a young Tamil speaking Moslem to a serious possibility of persecution or to a danger of torture or to risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment?\nAfter perusing the documentation6 in regards to Tamil speaking Moslems and the return of failed refugee claimants this question has to be answered in the negative. In addition, President Kumaratunga, in response to rioting of Moslems and Hindu mobs in Trincomalee has directed the acting Inspector General of Police to issue written instructions to the police stations in the eastern provinces to ensure the security of the Muslim community.7\nDr. XXXXXXXXXX Letter:8\nThis letter indicates that the claimant is depressed and he became emotional during the hearing and started to cry. Even though his state of mind is understandable, after all two of his claims were turned down, however, tears in a refugee hearing are not always signs of the truth of the allegations. I find that this letter cannot be used as corroborating evidence in support of his allegations, as he could as easily have lied to the doctor as he did in his hearings.\nConclusion:\nFor the above reasons, the Refugee Protection Division rejects this claim to refugee protection and finds that the claimant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection within the meaning of sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n\"Elke Homsi\"\nElke Homsi\nDATED at Toronto this 21st day of January 2004.\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - CREDIBILITY -IDENTITY - REPEAT CLAIMS - RES JUDICATA - EVIDENCE - DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE - DOCUMENTATION - IDENTITY DOCUMENTS - STATUORY INTERPRETATION - IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEE PROTECTION ACT - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION RULES - MALE - NEGATIVE - SRI LANKA\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibit R-1, CRDD U97-03942, XXXXX, March 17, 1999 and CRDD M99-09673, XXXXX, January 2, 2001.\n3 Supra, footnote 1.\n4 Exhibit C-3, letter from Dr. XXXXXXXX, August 5, 2003.\n5 Amarapala, Priyanga Udayantha v.

The details are set out in the narrative to the PIF1 and will not be repeated here. There is also a political element to this claim as the XXXXXX family are prominent Socialist members, while the claimant and his family are Democratic Party (DP) members and supporters. This case is not purely based on political opinion, nor is it a traditional blood feud case based on the Kanun of Lek, as I am familiar with in Albanian cases. However the combination of factors including the traditional nature of vengeance in Albania and the political background of the families, establishes that the claimant faces a risk to his life in Albania in the meaning of s. 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).2\nAnalysis\nIdentity\nThe claimant's personal identity is established by a certified true copy of his passport attached to Exhibit M-1 and by the documents in Exhibit C-2 which include his birth certificate, family certificate, and drivers' license. The attestation from the XXXXX Commune3 establishes the fact that his family had a dairy on the property in question. The fact that the property was returned to his family is documented by a certificate of the XXXXXX Commune.4 The DP background of his family as well as his own membership in the DP Youth Forum is established in the documents.5 The certificate from the DPYF6 corroborates the claimant's testimony that a grenade was thrown at his house in 2002 and that the XXXXX family has since taken control of the properties. The claimant has documented all the major elements in his claim. In addition, while some of the information is confused, his statement at the Port of Entry7 was generally consistent with his PIF narrative.\nRisk to Life or Risk of Cruel and Unusual Treatment or Punishment\nThe claimant testified that should he return to Albania he will be subjected to a risk to his life since this was the threat made to him personally by members of the XXXXXX family. According to section 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, a person in need of protection must demonstrate that he would personally face this risk having regard to his own circumstances. I find that the claimant is personally at risk because of the personal nature of the threat made against him. I find that the risk of harm feared by the claimant is not one generally faced by others in Albania.\nStandard of Proof\nI have considered the standard of proof to be applied in assessing the risk of harm under section 97(1)(b). In my opinion, the test is whether the claimant faces a reasonable\nchance or serious possibility of a risk to his life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. The Act is silent as to the appropriate standard of proof to be used in applying s. 97(1)(b) and it seems logical that it should be consistent with the standard of proof for establishing a well-founded fear of persecution under the Convention. Both the Convention ground and this ground deal with a prospective risk of serious human rights violations and the harm contemplated under s. 97(1)(b) is no less serious than the harm to be protected against under the Convention. Further, a claimant who is fleeing from his country because of a serious risk of harm has the same difficulties in proving his case under s. 97 as he would under s.96. Therefore, a claimant should not have to establish the prospective risk to a higher degree of certainty than under the Convention. This argument becomes more compelling in a case like this, where the claimant might or might not have a nexus to a Convention ground depending on how one analyses this claim to determine whether it can meet the rather imprecise criteria for political opinion.8 If it does have a nexus, the claimant would only need to show a lower form of harm (persecution) on the Adjei standard. Otherwise if it were determined that the standard is higher under s. 97(1)(b), the risk to his life must be proven on a balance of probabilities. While I am satisfied that the risk the claimant faces is life-threatening and meets the Adjei test of \"serious possibility\", I would be hard pressed to say whether the risk is at the level\nof 51 percent, in which case the claim succeeds, or rather is merely at the level of 45 percent, and thus must reject the claim.\nIn considering and applying the standard of proof to be applied in this case, I take into account relevant International and Canadian jurisprudence. In Kacaj9 the U.K. Immigration Appeal Tribunal discussed the practical and legal implications of a tribunal using different legal tests when applying different protection legislation in one hearing process. It specifically noted the practical difficulty of applying two legal tests to the same set of facts in a given hearing. It noted that the various expressions used in reference to the legal test for asylum cases, namely \"reasonable chance,\" \"substantial grounds for thinking\", and \"serious possibility\", were taken to refer to the same degree of risk as a \"real risk\". I am aware that there is conflicting Canadian and international jurisprudence on the issue of the standard of proof to be applied in these cases. Similarly, before Adjei10 was decided, there was conflicting international and domestic opinion on the standard of proof to be applied in cases decided under the Refugee Convention, however; Canadian courts ultimately rejected the \"balance of probabilities\" standard in\nfavour of the \"reasonable possibility\" standard:11\nThe \"reasonable possibility\" test is the appropriate compromise between respect for the Convention's commitment to anchor protection decisions in objectively observable risks and the need simultaneously to avoid the establishment of an inappropriately high threshold of concern.12\nIn Thangasivam13 the Federal Court, in deciding a motion to stay the Applicant's removal pending the outcome of his application for leave and for judicial review concerning the Federal decision of the PRRA officer, stated in obiter that a \"balance of probabilities\" standard applies to ss. 96 and 97 of the IRPA. Similarly in Li14 the Court in analysing s.97 found that the \"balance of probabilities\" standard should apply. However, the Court in Tameh15 upheld the Panel's reasoning in applying the Adjei test to ss. 96 and 97. This was a decision dealing directly with the issue of one standard of proof for all three grounds. I also note that the CIC Guidelines issued for Post-Determination Refugee Claimants in Canada (PDRCC) reviews, the precursor of the s. 97(1)(b) provision, set the standard of proof at \"less than a clear probability, or even a balance of probabilities, but greater than a mere possibility.\"16\nI have chosen to follow the Court in Tameh and the panel in MA2-00869 which found that the Adjei test should apply to s. 97(1)(a). Like the panel in MA2-00869, I do not believe that the legislative intent was to make access to protection more difficult for people facing a risk to their lives or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment than for those at risk of persecution, particularly since mistreatment under s. 97(1)(b) can meet the definition of persecution under the Convention. Therefore, I am of the opinion that the standard of proof as set out in Adjei17 as applied to the Convention refugee definition is the standard that should be applied under s. 97(1)(b) and I have applied that standard to the facts of this case.\nRisk of Harm\nI find that there is a serious possibility that the claimant would be subjected personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, should he return to Albania. He has established that he has become a target of the XXXXX family in the context of a blood feud. He has also established that he has been threatened and assaulted on at least one occasion by the XXXXXX family. The documentary evidence discloses that the number of blood feuds has been increasing since the collapse of communism in 1991 and the collapse of the DP government in 1997. According to one article, published in June 1999, a total of 1,800 people were killed and 3,500 persons wounded as a result of blood feuds in the previous three years.18\nState Protection\nThe documentary evidence indicates that the state has taken some steps to alleviate the problems caused by blood feuds,19 however these steps have not been adequate as the number of blood feuds continues to increase. On this point I note that it is the current lack of state control that has led to the increasing reliance on traditional blood feuds to address crime rather than official channels in the first place.20 I find therefore that adequate state protection is not available to the claimant.\nInternal Flight Alternative\nSection 97(1)(b)(ii) requires that the risk be one that would be faced by the person in every part of the country. I have considered whether the risk faced by the claimant is limited to part of Albania and whether there are other parts of the country, reasonably accessible by the claimant, where he would not face a risk to his life. However on the evidence before me I find that there is no internal flight alternative for the claimant. He has testified that the XXXXXX family is powerful and is connected to the ruling Socialist Party. The evidence indicates that those targets of blood feuds that remain in Albania, do so by living in isolation and hiding.21 Therefore I find that the claimant faces this risk in all parts of the country.\nDECISION\nXXXXXXXXX is a person in need of protection and therefore the Refugee Protection Division accepts his claim.\n\"E.

He is seeking refugee protection in Canada because, in Colombia, his life was threatened by members of the guerrilla organization, the ELN (National Liberation Army - Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional).\nAt the time of the first threats, the claimant was attached to the infantry Battalion, XXXXX, and he was involved in investigating the death of his best friend, army Lieutenant XXXXX XXXXX, whom he believed was ambushed and killed by the ELN. He received permission from his army superiors to be personally involved, and his probe included making a report to the \"XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX\".\nThe claimant alleges that the ELN warned him of serious consequences if he did not cease his involvement in the investigation, and he was told to mind his own business. In addition, ELN guerrillas approached the claimant, and asked that he cooperate with them, such as allowing them to carry on their activities in the area without interference. They also sought his cooperation in providing information about the location of the different government army patrols, and he was offered money in return.\nThe claimant rejected the ELN's demands and request, and he told them so. He alleges that, subsequently, he received threatening telephone calls and he was told that he would suffer the consequences. The calls continued even after he was transferred to Bogota in XXXXX 1997, to be with the XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX. He left the army in XXXXX 1997.\nThe claimant alleges, further, that, later in XXXXX 1998, he was kidnapped by guerrillas and taken to a mountain camp. He was tied up and kept in a room. However, he overpowered his guard and escaped. He made it to his aunt's home at XXXXX. From there he travelled to the USA in August 1998. He alleges that, while in the USA, in June 2002, his family in Colombia received telephone calls from the ELN who asked about him, and the caller indicated that he was aware that the claimant was in the USA, and that his address was needed. He alleges that he feared that he could be harmed in the USA, and therefore, he travelled to Canada in July 2002 and made a refugee claim.\nDETERMINATION\nAfter careful consideration of all of the evidence, I am of the opinion that the exclusion provision (Article 1 F (a)) of the Act is applicable in this claim and that the claimant is not a Convention refugee, or a person in need of protection. I concur with the conclusion of the Hearings Officer that the claimant comes within the parameters of Article 1F of the Refugee Convention, and section 98 of IRPA.3\nANALYSIS LEADING TO DETERMINATION ON EXCLUSION:\n(i) The law and statutory provisions\nI am guided, primarily, by the decisions in Ramirez,4 Sivakumar5 and Moreno,6 and I note the following.\nIn Ramirez,7 the Court found that the burden of proving that the claimant should be excluded from determination as a Convention refugee is on the party so asserting, rather than on the claimant to demonstrate that he should not be excluded from such status. It\nheld, further, that the test for determining there are \"serious reasons for considering\" that a crime has been committed, require less than a balance of probabilities.\nThe Court8 also reviewed the degree of involvement required on the part of the claimant in order to be excluded from Convention refugee status, and found that accomplices, as well as principal actors, may be subject to exclusion. It was held that a person could be considered to be an accomplice, if there is personal and knowing participation in the persecutorial act, and the Court went on to provide examples of this test, as follows. It stated9 that:\n\"... mere membership in an organization which from time to time commits international offenses will be sufficient for exclusion from refugee status where the organization is principally directed to a limited, brutal purpose, which may, by necessity, involve personal and knowing participation in persecutorial acts...someone who is an associate of the principal offender can never be said to be a mere onlooker...\"\nThe Court10 also looked at the claimant's opportunity to have left the organization earlier, without risk of harm to himself, and the length of time in the organization.\nIn Sivakumar,11 the Court looked at the method of recruitment (voluntarily) in the claimant's organization, the nature of the organization (violence\/killings), the claimant's position\/rank in the organization, including his high level promotions, the claimant's opportunity to leave the organization and the claimant's length of time in the organization.\nIn Moreno,12 the Court further clarified that a claimant can be held accountable where the organization in which he is involved is premised on achieving political or social ends by any means necessary, while still considering that mere membership in the organization involved in international offenses is not sufficient basis on which to invoke the exclusion clause.\n(ii) The claimant's specific role\/activities in the Colombian armed forces that give rise to a consideration of complicity:\nAfter his basic army training (1993-1994), the claimant voluntarily joined the Colombian army as a sub-Lieutenant and worked primarily in counter-insurgency operations for at least three years (1994-1997). He always liked the military world, from what he had seen in the movies, he alleges. He considered that it would be a good career. He received many notes of commendation (congratulations)13 for assignments accomplished, and when he left the army in XXXXX 1997 for personal reasons, he was XXXXX months away from being promoted to the rank of Lieutenant.\nThe claimant first worked with the Military Police XXXXX in Bogota, from around XXXXX 1994 to XXXXX 1995. There, he instructed soldiers in such areas as the military rules and riot control.\nLater, the claimant accepted a transfer to the XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, a rapid defense mobile unit. He engaged in counter-insurgency operations in the Antioquia region of Colombia, while XXXXX a unit of thirty soldiers. Their work involved area control such as protecting the communities and preventing the guerrillas from setting a presence in the communities. The claimant's base was in XXXXX. However, the Battalion's area of operations included places such as Taraza, Caucasia, El Bagre, Caceres, Barrio Blanco, and Monte Libano. A military presence was needed in those areas and orders came on a daily basis from the Battalion Commanders of the army about what specific areas needed support. Sometimes the claimant and his unit would be away from their base for two or three months on a stretch.\nFrom XXXXX 1997 to XXXXX 1997, the claimant was attached to the XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, whose headquarters was in Bogota. That outfit engaged in counter-insurgency work and was in charge of control of the Meta area, and areas on the outskirts of Bogota. Its purpose was to control the guerrilla deployments.\nThe claimant alleges that he left the army because of the threats from the ELN, and that he was tired of risking his life and that of his family. In response to specific questions from Counsel, the Hearings Officer and the panel member, the claimant testified that, during his army service he did not commit, nor was he guilty of any human rights violations. The men in his charge did not commit any atrocities nor were they guilty of any atrocities.\n(iii) The documentary evidence on the Colombian armed forces\nSection 98 of IRPA14 states that persons referred to in Article 1(F)(a) of the Refugee Convention are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection, and states, in part:\n\"The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:\n\" (a) he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes...\"\nSeveral credible sources in the documentary evidence15 cite the Colombian army with committing gross human rights violations and crimes against the civilian population for decades. Those years include the time immediately before and during the claimant's period of service. One such source16 says the following:\n\"...the army has taught its officers the basics of international humanitarian law and made instructional material available to officers, professional soldiers and recruits...despite these measures, the army continues to commit serious violations, with little apparent will to investigate or punish those responsible. At the root of many violations is the Colombian army's consistent and pervasive failure or unwillingness to distinguish civilians from combatants in accordance with the laws of war...\"\nIt is also stated17 that:\n\"...areas of armed conflict continue to be the scenario of large-scale human rights violations and\nabuses by members of the security forces, paramilitary or \"private justice\" groups often said to cooperate with them, and the armed insurgent groups...\"\nThe United States Department of State Reports18 on Country Conditions in Colombia for the years 1993 to 1997 give the same grim picture. The summary is that members and units of the army and the police participated in a number of human rights violations including extrajudicial killings, disappearances, torture and arbitrary detention, and that the army is reluctant to distinguish between guerrillas and non-combatants during counterinsurgency operations. These are the years prior to the claimant's active army service and during his active army service with the XXX Military Police, the XXXXX XXXXX and the XXXXX XXXXX.\nThe Hearings Officer cited the following other documentary evidence:\n\"...military operations leading to the death of civilians include indiscriminate bombing of civilian settlements and armed incursions into villages during which the victims are said to be killed on the spot or abducted, either to extract information or use them as guides and for intelligence purposes. Often the guerrillas killed during such operations are later presented to the public as guerrillas who died in combat, their corpses being dressed y the soldiers in military clothes, and guns and grenades placed in their hands...\"19\nWhen the claimant opted for voluntary army service at the end of his basic training in 1994, the above documentary evidence was the reality of the situation in Colombia, as it relates to the army, particularly those segments that were dedicated to counter-insurgency operations, such as the claimant's activities.\nThroughout the 90s, there was evidence20 of \"disappearances and political killings\" and during the claimant's tenure with the Colombian army. The claimant's last assignment was with the XXXXX XXXXX. In particular, all of the documentary evidence paint a very negative picture of the operation of the Mobile Brigades, and indicate that they were responsible for serious human rights violations.\nA general commentary on the Mobile brigade is as follows:\n\"...the centrepiece of army strategy is the Mobile Brigade. The Mobile Brigade is conceived as a highly mobile force equipped with weaponry and vehicles suitable for the country's rugged, often densely forested countryside...Mobile Brigades are composed of professional soldiers who volunteer...\"21\n\"...despite the government and military's assertions that Mobile Brigades do not commit systemic abuses, some government agencies and independent human rights groups have documented a broad, consistent, and often shocking pattern of serious violations of human rights and the international covenants governing internal armed conflicts. In sharp contrast to army assertions that the Mobile Brigades are better trained to protect the civilian population and are strictly controlled, Americas Watch believes that spreading terror among civilians is an integral part of Brigade strategy and appears to be tolerated and sometimes openly articulated by Brigade Commanders...\"22\n\"...Mobile Brigades have on repeated occasions failed to distinguish between civilian non-combatants and armed guerrillas, causing avoidable injury and casualty. Frequently, Brigade patrols have forced civilians to walk in front of units to detonate mines or don military uniforms and work as guides...\"23\nThe determinative issue, therefore, is whether the claimant is complicit in this scenario of human rights violations, given his years of service in the Colombian army, his senior rank while there, his knowledge of the atrocities, and the fact that he remained a member of that army and only disassociated himself when he felt threatened by the ELN for rejecting their demands.\n(iv) The claimant's counsel's arguments\nThe claimant alleges that, during his service, he never discharged his weapon nor committed any human rights violations against civilians or guerrillas. He states that he is not aware of any human rights violations committed by the men in his charge against guerrillas or civilians. He contends that they were simply part of the army personnel that provided a military presence in the areas, and there was never a confrontation.\nHe alleges that the military presence was merely to protect the towns, roads and villages against guerrilla infiltration; they only engaged in intelligence work and in dialogue with the civilian population about the presence of guerrillas in the areas, or whether they had seen anything out of the ordinary. They sometimes checked civilians for weapons and questioned them about where they came from or to where they were going. He is not aware of any human rights violations by the XXXXX XXXXX.\nI concur with the Hearings Officer when he characterizes much of the claimant's testimony in this area as being not plausible, and I note the Court's ruling in Faryna v. Chorny,24 on the issue of plausibility.\nCounsel argues that the claimant's testimony given under oath is presumed to be true and cites the court's ruling in Maldonado.25 In addition, in his submissions, counsel argues that the evidence is insufficient to support a finding that the claimant has been an accomplice in crimes against humanity. Counsel contends that the evidence must show that the claimant had knowledge of the crimes committed by the army and that he shared in the organization's purpose in committing them. Counsel cites the ruling in Saridag,26 and submits that in order for the claimant to be excluded, there must be explicit findings as to his knowledge and participation in specific war crimes.\nIn my opinion, there is reason to doubt the truthfulness of the claimant's testimony that he never participated in any confrontations, given that the claimant and his group of soldiers served in counter-insurgency operations for at least two years, in conflict areas of Colombia. It is not plausible that he had no knowledge of the abuses committed by the counter-insurgency units, even if he may never have participated in confrontations. According to the documentary evidence,27 counter-insurgency operations in the conflict areas involved armed confrontations, and there were human rights violations committed by the army. For example, it is said:\n\"...armed confrontations are said to be particularly frequent in the departments of Antioquia, Santander, Norte de Santander, Cesar, Bolivar and Meta. In these areas, the armed forces allegedly continue to apply a counter-insurgency strategy based on the concept of national security whereby everybody who is known or suspected to be linked with the guerrillas is regarded as an internal enemy. According to the information received, in the areas labelled as zonas rojas (red zones) where the insurgents are active and armed confrontations take place, the security forces view virtually all civilians as collaborators of the subversion, an allegation that was denied by members of the armed forces met by the Special Rapporteurs...\"\nCounsel has argued that one should not speculate and infer that the claimant must have participated in any confrontations or must have been guilty of committing atrocities in his work in those areas. Even if I agree with counsel and consider all of the evidence to be credible and trustworthy, I must be guided by the binding case law28 which holds that a claimant can be an accomplice without having committed specific crimes or atrocities, but by his knowing participation in the activities in which are engaged, perpetrators of those crimes and atrocities. What is more, I note that the claimant testified, and the Hearings Officer submits, that the claimant has testified that he had knowledge of abuses committed by the Colombian army, as follows.\nThrough radio news and comments, the claimant had heard comments that the army had been in certain areas and had detained some peasants who had been considered to be guerrillas. Through the army intelligence system, he had heard of some civilian populations giving their support to the guerrillas. He maintained contact with his base through radio contact, while on his own work assignment, and he was aware that guerrillas had been captured by other company units.\nHe had heard of \"bad apples\" in the army, and, as a result, he sought whenever necessary to instruct his men to act within the law and to show respect for the human rights of the population and not to do anything that would give grounds to discredit the army and the population, he alleged.\nThe Hearings Officer has pointed out further, the claimant's testimony that, before he entered the military, he was aware that the army was blamed for numerous atrocities, and that, while in the military, he received news of atrocities for which the army was blamed. Therefore, the claimant had personal knowledge of the atrocities, even if I accept his testimony that he had no personal experience of atrocities, nor committed any.\nCounsel suggests that I consider the Court's comments in Gonzalez,29 where the Court makes a distinction between the applicant, a private soldier, engaged in an action against an armed enemy and thus participating in war, as opposed to committing war crimes or crimes against humanity. Counsel argues that the claimant was not of high rank and that he was under the command of a number of superior officers, and, as such, he did not have a leadership role, nor is there evidence that he received or gave orders to engage in crimes against humanity.\nAs pointed out by the Hearings Officer, the claimant was of sufficiently high rank. He was a sub-lieutenant who was XXXXX months away from being promoted to the rank of Lieutenant. In his duties, particularly with the counter-insurgency operations in the Antioquia area with the XXXXX XXXXX, he XXXX XXXXX X a company of thirty men.\nIn addition, the claimant's term of duty in the Antioquia area is a significant factor to be considered and the Hearings Officer noted that \" ...a November 1996 Amnesty International Report describes the department of Antioquia as \"one of the most conflictive regions of Colombia over recent years... where civil conflict has been particularly intense in several regions...over recent years the northeast of Antioquia has registered numerous politically motivated non-combat killings committed by the security forces and their paramilitary allies and armed opposition groups...the region is described as being the focus of a strong guerrilla presence, both FARC and ELN, and an area of strategic importance to the government as a result of mining interests and the oil pipeline in the area...\"30\nMoreover, I considered the claimant's testimony that his XXXXX XXXXX operated in a \"red zone\", and that he was for a time a member of XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX. I noted the following other documentary evidence:\n\"...the Special Rapporteurs received numerous reports about human rights violations by various military battalions and other units of the security forces based in zones rojas (red zones). However, particular concern was expressed at the activities of the brigades moviles (mobile grigades), established in the recent past. For example, Mobile Brigade No.1 has been operating in the department of Meta and neighbouring Casanare and Boyaca since 1991...These brigades are reported to patrol the country during extended periods, without having a permanent base, and the battalions which normally operate in the region do not consider themselves responsible for their activities. Members of the mobile brigades are said to be accountable for a high number of enforced disappearances, torture and extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions...\"31\nI am of the opinion that, as a XXXXX of a unit of thirty soldiers engaged in counter-insurgency operations in areas such as Meta and other areas of Antioquia, the claimant demonstrated knowing participation in the atrocities, even if neither he nor his unit committed any specific atrocities. In Bazargan32 the Court said:\n\"... in our view, it goes without saying that \"personal and knowing participation\" can be direct or indirect and does not require formal membership in the organization that is ultimately engaged in the condemned activities.- It is not working within an organization that makes someone an accomplice to the organization's activities, but knowingly contributing to those activities in any way or making them possible, whether from within or from outside the organization...\"33\nIn my view the claimant contributed to the army's activities, and he did not leave that situation at an early date. He testified that the process of leaving the army was very simple, especially since he had offered his services voluntarily. He resigned merely for personal reasons, and the evidence does not show that, during his assignments he complained about the widespread atrocities and systematic crimes against humanity of the army, or objected to his superiors regarding these atrocities.\n(v) The conclusion\/findings\nBased on the above, I find that there are serious reasons for considering that the claimant, XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, has been complicit in crimes against humanity during his service with the Colombian army.\nAccordingly, he falls within the parameters of Article 1 (F) (a) and is excluded from refugee protection under s. 98 of the IRPA. He is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. I reject his claim.\n\"George A. Griffith\"\nGeorge A.

In XXXXX 2001, the claimant alleges the worst incident occurred when she was arrested at her home during a security check of Tamils in Colombo. The claimant was taken to the police station where she was interrogated and detained for three hours in a cell. The police suspected that the claimant was assisting the LTTE. The claimant was released after her uncle paid a bribe. The same happened after the July 2001, LTTE attack on the Colombo airport. The claimant alleges that police officers came to her home and questioned her but did not arrest her.\nThe claimant alleges that in XXXXX 2002, two female members of the LTTE attended at her home and attempted to recruit her. The claimant alleges that she refused outright and the LTTE said that they would check back with her again. The claimant fearing forced conscription by the LTTE, left for Canada on XXXXXX, 2002 and filed her refugee claim on September 26, 2002. The claimant alleges that the LTTE attended at her home after she had come to Canada. The claimant fears the army, the police and the LTTE upon return to her country.\nIdentity\nThe claimant's National Identity Card and marriage certificate2 were available at the hearing; therefore, I accepted her identity and nationality.\nCredibility\nI assign the benefit of doubt to the claimant's allegation that she was detained in XXXXX 2001 and interrogated in regards to helping the LTTE. The claimant testified that she was told by the police to leave Colombo and join her husband in Canada. However, after she was released, the police checked her identity on one other occasion, and they did not attend her home again between XXXXX 2001 and when she left Sri Lanka in XXXXX 2002, which is an indication that the security forces were satisfied that she did not pose a threat. In general, short detentions for legitimate law enforcement purposes do not constitute persecution.3 It is also noted that the claimant is not claiming that she left her country because of the detention by the police, even though she is still afraid of them. She alleges that she left because the LTTE tried to recruit her to join their ranks, in XXXXX 2002. I find that the absence of corroborating documentation indicating that the LTTE is actively recruiting members in Colombo reinforces my negative credibility assessment in regards to her reasons for leaving. Recruitment by the LTTE after the unilateral ceasefire in December 2001 is scrutinized and publicized in reports such as the Special Report No. 17,4 or the report in regards to a joint fact-finding mission to Sri Lanka by the Danish Immigration Service and the Research Directorate of the Immigration and Refugee Board.5 They point out that recruitment expanded into government-controlled areas6 and are prevalent in the Batticoloa district and the North and North East of Sri Lanka. The reports also show that parents are sending their children to Colombo7 or areas with a Sinhalese majority,8 in order to be safe. Perusing the documentation both from counsel and the Board's in its entirety, I find the human rights organizations or the press would have made us aware if the LTTE recruitment had expanded into Colombo. The LTTE opened offices in the Northern Islands9 and in Vavuniya, however, there are no reports that they opened offices in Colombo. One newspaper article in our package does shows that several businessmen in Colombo were approached for a \"large contribution\" for the LTTE and threatened with their lives and harm to their families if they failed to comply. The article also mentions that the police refuse to intervene. However, this is one article from a Tamil newspaper, published in the United States of America (USA).10 The allegations in this article are not reflected in any other documents before the panel.\nThe documentation before the panel indicates that the situation for Tamils in Colombo is far from being perfect, however, The United States Department of State (DOS) report11 points out that unlike in previous years there were no reports of the security forces failing to comply with legal protections, including impunity for those responsible for human rights violations. Unlike previous years there were no credible reports that security forces committed extra-judicial killings12 or that disappearances at the hands of these forces took place.13 Torture still does happen, however, and the Attorney General's Office and the Criminal Investigation Unit have established units to focus on torture complaints; these units forwarded 14 cases for indictments this year. An Interparliamentary Permanent Standing Committee and its Interministarial Working Group on Human Rights Issues have begun tracking criminal investigations of torture. In addition, the government also ceased paying fines incurred by security force personnel found guilty of torture and they have been prosecuted under criminal statutes, but none of the cases have come to conclusion.14 There were no reports of arbitrary arrests and detention during that year, including no large-scale arrests of Tamils, and the government released 750 Tamils as part of the peace process.15 The Emergency Regulations were lifted in July 200,116 however a ten-day state of emergency was declared in the beginning of November 2003 by President Kumaratunga, which was called a gross abuse of presidential power by the country's cabinet led by Prime Minister Wickramasinghe.17 There are no documents before the panel indicating that the State of Emergency was extended past the 10 days. By January 2002 most roadblocks and checkpoints in Colombo were dismantled,18 even though they were back on all major roads during the November crisis.19 There are no more registration requirements in Colombo for Tamils.20 The government legalized the LTTE as part of the peace process in September 2002,21 however, LTTE cadres have to register with authorities when travelling in government-controlled territories.22 Perusing the documents before me I am not saying that there is a complete change of circumstances in regards to young Northern Tamils, however, for a young woman, such as the claimant, who has been cleared of any involvement with the LTTE, which is now legal, the panel does not believe that the claimant has good grounds for fearing persecution because she is a young Tamil originally from the North of Sri Lanka.\nWill the claimant's removal to Sri Lanka subject her personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture?\nThe answer to this question is \"No\". The panel notes that the the claimant left the country legally with her own passport, which does not expire until August 10, 2004. Various reports indicate that many returnees to Sri Lanka are simply waved through by security forces at the airport.23\nConclusion\nThe claimant is not a credible and trustworthy witness and nothing else trustworthy was presented to establish the material aspects of this claim.\nTherefore, after having considered the totality of the evidence, counsel's submissions, the relevant statutory provisions and jurisprudence, the Refugee Protection Division rejects this claim. The claimant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\n\"R. Dawson\"\nR.

She described running a XXXXX stand from 1995 until 1999 in Georgetown, Guyana where she faced threats and theft at the hands of Black criminals. She alleged that she was threatened by them not to report these incidents to the police, however she attempted to do so on several occasions but the police refused to take any reports and threatened to arrest her. She fears racial and political violence because she is Indo-Guyanese and as such is perceived as a supporter of the ruling party in Guyana.\nDetermination\nI find that the claimant is not a Convention refugee as she does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Guyana. I also find that she is not a person in need of protection in that her removal to Guyana would not subject her personally to a risk to her life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, and in that there are no substantial grounds to believe that her removal to Guyana will subject her personally to a danger of torture. My reasons are as follows.\nAnalysis\nIdentity\nI find that the claimant has established her personal identity and her identity as a citizen of Guyana through her testimony and with supporting documents, namely, her passport and Canadian Visitor's Visa.3 However, on the issue of identity, s.106 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) and Rule 7 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules go further. The claimant must provide acceptable documents establishing identity and other elements of the claim. If the claimant does not provide acceptable documents, she must explain why they were not provided, and what steps were taken to obtain them. I find that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant is in default of both aspects of Rule 7.\nIn this case, the claimant has not provided any documents to the Board with respect to the fact that she owned a XXXXX booth in Georgetown XXXXX from 1995-1999. This is an essential element of the claim since the claimant alleges that the threats she received from Black criminals occurred while she was operating her XXXXX stand. These threats and criminals stealing her XXXXX is what caused her to make reports to the police, which she alleges were futile. Therefore, the issue that I must address is whether the claimant has taken reasonable steps to secure documents and have them before me at the time of the hearing. When she was asked what efforts she had made to document the fact that she had a stall in Georgetown, she stated that she had taken no steps to secure such documents, as she had not thought of it. Later she said that she had rented the stall from persons who may have left Guyana, however she had made no effort to document this part of her claim. Therefore I find that the claimant has not taken any steps to secure documents regarding her stall, in addition, has not provided any reasonable explanation for her failure to do so.\nCredibility\nFailure to Claim, Delay in Claiming\nThe claimant was in Canada from March 2002 until May 2002 in order to visit her son who is studying in Toronto. During this time she did not make a claim for protection. She returned to Canada on September 9, 2002 yet did not make her claim until October 8, 2002. The claimant was asked to explain why it was, if she was afraid to go back to Guyana, she did so in May 2002 rather than making a claim for protection. Her explanation was that she did not know that the refugee process was open to people from Guyana and only learned about it from a friend on her second trip to Canada. After having made her claim, she learned that her uncle who lives in Canada, had previously made a refugee claim. I do not find her explanation to be satisfactory. The claimant is a high-school graduate, and speaks English fluently. Moreover she has her mother and four siblings who live in Canada as permanent residents. I can see no reason why if she were genuinely afraid to return to Guyana, she would not have made the necessary inquiries regarding the possibility of claiming refugee status in Canada. I find that the claimant's action of returning to Guyana undermines her allegation that she faces a serious possibility of persecution or a serious possibility of a risk to her life in Guyana. Her behaviour is not consistent with the behaviour of an individual in genuine fear for her life.\nWhether the claimant ran a XXXXX stall from 1995 to 1999\nAs stated above, the claimant alleged that she owned a stall in Georgetown Market from 1995-1999. However in the forms that she filled out when she made her inland claim for refugee protection, under \"occupations\" she stated that she was a homemaker in Georgetown, Guyana from XXXXX 1992 until XXXXX 2002.4 When she was asked why she did not indicate that she ran a stall from 1995-1999 in the inland forms, at first she had no explanation. Later she said that she did not know what to put and that she was tired with filling out the forms since she had to wait for a long time to make the claim that day. I do not find this explanation to be satisfactory. As stated earlier, the claimant speaks English fluently and is familiar with filling out immigration forms, having applied for permanent residence in Canada and for Canadian visitor's visas on several occasions. 5 In his re-examination of the claimant, counsel asked her to describe some details about\nrunning her stall, however the details that she was able to provide were general in nature and included the fact that she had to shut down the stall in order to come to Canada in 2002. Again this was another internal contradiction in her evidence about the stall, since she had stated in her PIF and in her earlier testimony that she ran the stall only until 1999. In light of the lack of documentation about the fact that she ran a stall from 1995 until 1999, and in light of her inconsistent oral and written evidence about running the stall, I find that on a balance of probabilities, the claimant did not run a stall from 1995 until 1999. Consequently, I also find that she did not face the threats and harassment as alleged in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the narrative of the PIF as these were tied to her running the stall. I also find that she did not make any reports to police in Guyana since again these alleged reports were tied to the alleged incidents, which occurred while she was operating the stall.\nGeneral Finding on Credibility\nIn light of the above findings, I find that the claimant was generally not a credible witness and make an overall finding of lack of credibility on the part of the claimant.\nRisk of Harm\nWhile I have found that the claimant did not suffer the incidents of harm as alleged in her PIF and oral testimony, I must also consider whether her ethnicity, which in Guyana includes an imputed political opinion, establishes that she faces a reasonable chance or serious possibility of persecution, or whether it would subject her personally to a risk to her life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture. I find, however, that the risk of harm alleged by the claimant is indiscriminate or random such that it is faced generally by others in the country. The claimant fears general levels of crime and violence in Guyana. The documentary evidence indicates that all persons living in Guyana are at risk and that regardless of race, crime victims are targeted due to their perceived wealth.6 I find that the claimant's fear of criminal violence is not linked to her ethnicity or to political opinion.\nI must also consider whether her ethnicity or other factors makes it objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek state protection. The documents indicate that there are concerns about police discrimination but note that \"there is no firm evidence that police responses discriminate against Indo-Guyanese\" and that the problem of slow response to crime is mainly related to the constraints facing the police force.7 The current government is led by the People's Progressive Party\/Civic (PPP), a party supported predominantly by Indo-Guyanese and the president is Indo-Guyanese. Further, while the civil service and defense and police force overwhelmingly were staffed by Afro-Guyanese, the government continued efforts to recruit Indo-Guyanese for the security forces. The government also sponsored various forums for the discussion of racial problems and to promote inclusion, and it supported the work of NGOs that dealt with these concerns.8 Therefore, I find that on the evidence, the claimant's ethnicity does not make it objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek state protection. Accordingly, I determine that the claimant's fear of persecution is not linked to a Convention ground.\nAs noted above, I also considered whether the claimant is a person in need of protection because of a risk to her life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or because she faces a danger of torture. No evidence was adduced that would support a finding that the claimant faces a danger of torture. With respect to a risk to her life or cruel and unusual treatment, I have found that the claimant did not suffer past incidents of serious harm. Moreover, she has not established an identifiable risk that is distinguishable from that of the general population. I find the claimant fears a generalized risk, one that is faced by all citizens of Guyana. Therefore, her claim falls under the exception in s. 97(1)(b)(ii) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nState Protection\nIn the alternative, I find that adequate state protection is available to the claimant. While states are presumed to be capable of protecting their nationals, it was open to the claimant, according to the law, to rebut the presumption of protection with \"clear and convincing\" evidence. I find on the evidence, that the claimant has not rebutted that presumption. The evidence before me is not clear and convincing that the government of Guyana is unwilling or unable to investigate, arrest and punish perpetrators of crime or that Guyana, a democratic state, is not in effective control of its territory and institutions.9 There is evidence that the government is making serious efforts to combat violent crime in Guyana. The president has stated publicly that the fight against crime remained a top priority for his government. The government has funded the purchase of new supplies of arms, ammunition, and protection gear for police, allocated 10% of its 2003 budget to fighting crime and national security, and set up joint army and police patrols in order to capture those responsible for increased criminal activity in areas such as the town of Buxton.10 The documentary evidence indicates that the police have been taking serious steps to get crime under control:11\n\"Since February 2002, the Guyana Police Force issued wanted bulletins for 42 notorious criminals who were wanted for crimes ranging from armed robbery to murder. Most of these criminals have been considered as armed and dangerous. Information available from the police force shows that 25 of the wanted persons have since died. Their deaths have mainly occurred from confrontations with the police and the joint police\/army operations. Seven of the wanted persons have been arrested, while ten are still at large.\"12\nTherefore I find that, even if the claimant faces a risk of harm as contemplated in ss. 96 and 97(1) of the Act, she has not rebutted the presumption of state protection. I find that adequate state protection is available to the claimant.\nConclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Refugee Protection Division determines that XXXXX XXXXX is not a Convention refugee and not a person in need of protection and her claim is rejected.\n\"E.J.

The principal claimant bases her Convention refugee claim on her membership in a particular social group, namely, women in the Philippines subjected to domestic violence. Her daughter bases her Convention refugee claim on her membership in a particular social group, that of a family member. In assessing these claims, I have taken the Gender Guidelines1 into consideration before rendering a decision\nALLEGATIONS\nThe principal claimant alleges that after her husband left her to live with his mistress, she initiated legal proceedings against him and since then has received constant threats from both her husband and his mistress. The daughter alleges that he has beaten her and that he will kill her as a way to get back at his wife.\nDETERMINATION\nThe panel finds that the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection because they have failed to rebut the presumption of state protection.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\nI accept that the claimants are both citizens of the Philippines based on the true copies of their passports provided by Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC)2 and confirmed by the original of the passports provided by the claimants.\nState protection\nA determinative issue in this claim is whether adequate state protection is available and whether it is objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek that protection. If state protection is to be reasonably forthcoming, then the claimant is required to approach the state for protection. The fact that the state does not provide perfect protection is not, in itself, a basis for determining that the state is unwilling or unable to offer reasonable protection in the circumstances of a particular case.3 The claimant has the burden of rebutting the presumption of state protection by presenting \"clear and convincing proof\" of the state's inability to protect.4\nI am also mindful of the principle that international refugee protection is not meant to permit a claimant the opportunity to seek better protection abroad than she would receive at home.5\nI find that the claimants have not rebutted the presumption of state protection, in that they have failed to provide clear and convincing proof of the government's inability to protect women from violence. In arriving at this conclusion, I have considered the documentary evidence in Exhibit R-1, and I find it to be persuasive evidence of the current conditions in the Philippines, as it is based on a variety of independent governmental, non-governmental and humanitarian sources.\nAlthough recognizing that violence against women and in particular, domestic violence, is a serious societal problem in the Philippines,6 I conclude from this evidence that the government of the Philippines is making serious efforts to address the problem of violence against women and that state protection, even though not perfect7 is available for a woman in the Philippines who is subjected to domestic violence.\nThe documentary evidence8 describes the Philippines as a democratic republic with an elected president and bicameral legislature. The President oversees the Armed Forces of the Philippines (the AFP) and the Department of the Interior and Local\nGovernment has authority over the civilian Philippine National Police (the PNP).\nThe government has set up special desks in some 600 police stations where staff members are specifically trained in and sensitized to women's issues.9 According to the US Dos Report10 the government of the Philippines spent an estimated 53 million pesos (equivalent to US $1 million) in 2002 for medical and psychiatric facilities and shelters for women who are victims of violence. While perhaps not a significant amount of money, this output demonstrates the government's recognition of the problem and its efforts to address it.\nThe government has also established a National Commission on the Role of Filipino Women (NCRFW), whose mandate includes advising the President, Cabinet and Congress on policies, programs and laws affecting women.11 The NCRFW has produced documentation to assist women who are victims of domestic violence,12 has participated in projects on violence against women in Philippine society13 and serves as a major link between government and non-governmental organizations on women's concerns.14\nOf particular note is the Women's Crisis Center in Manila,15which is recognized as a pioneer in the area of domestic violence in the Philippines. This centre operates a hot line, provides crisis intervention, counseling and emotional support to victims, as well as temporary shelter. Moreover, staff from the centre are available to accompany battered women to the hospital, to police stations, to lawyers and to court.\nIn June 2002, legislators in Cebu City \"passed the country's first local ordinance that penalizes perpetrators of domestic violence and provides protection to victims. Under this law, witnesses may file complaints as well as victims.\"16\nIn light of the government's efforts to address domestic violence and the principal claimant's own experiences in engaging the mechanisms of the state to deal with her husband, I find the claimants' explanations for not seeking police assistance to be unpersuasive.\nThe principal claimant tendered extensive documentary evidence relating to the criminal case for \"concubinage\" that she brought against her husband in the mid-1990s.17 In a letter dated February 26, 2003, the claimant's former legal counsel explained that,\nConcubinage is a crime defined by the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines, in which a married man cohabits with a woman not his wife. It is penalized by imprisonment ranging from six months and one day to four years and two months ... is also a ground for legal separation...\nThe principal claimant made reference to physical assaults in her affidavit supporting this charge. However, the only documentary evidence she provided relating to physical aggression pertained to the time of their marriage break-up in the early 1990s. It does not appear that she pursued any avenue of redress in respect of the physical aggression either at the time it happened or later. Moreover, she subsequently entered into settlement negotiations with her husband's family, on his behalf, with respect to support for herself and her daughter, and withdrew the charge against him.\nAlthough this evidence is dated, it demonstrates that the principal claimant is not only knowledgeable about the legal avenues available to her, but that she is prepared to pursue them. The principal claimant availed herself of the state mechanisms and the state in turn proceeded to advance her interests. In addition, she was in contact with organizations that could have assisted her in bringing further action against her husband in the event that he continued to be abusive towards her, such as the Women's Crisis Center (the WCC).18\nAccording to Exhibit C-3, the principal claimant went to the WCC in order to obtain assistance with her concubinage case in 1995. The referral letter from this organization does not make note of any physical abuse suffered by her, although the principal claimant alleged that she ran to the WCC because her husband beat her up and that she told them her story. Her evidence on the number of times that she went to the WCC varied from one \"other\" incident to countless times. She indicated initially that the\nonly reason she went to the WCC was for assistance with her case. When asked if she told anyone at the WCC that she had been beaten, she said she did, but that they said nothing to her, implying that the WCC was not helpful when she sought assistance. Only after the role of the WCC was read to her19 did the principal claimant recall one time while her case was going ahead, that the counselors at the WCC asked her to stay at their crisis center and that they advised her to go to the police.\nIt was apparent that the principal claimant's story regarding the involvement of the WCC developed only in response to direct questions and after inconsistencies between her allegations and the documentary evidence were put to her. Given her attention to detail in collecting the documentary evidence to support her claim, the role the WCC plays in assisting abused women, and the significance that such assistance would have been to the claimants' situation, I find the principal claimant's explanation that she was only just recalling all of these experiences after the inconsistencies were identified to be not credible. From this, I conclude that she did not approach the WCC for assistance regarding the alleged physical abuse, and thus did not avail herself of a valuable resource that could have assisted her in accessing the protection of the state in the event she did not wish to do so alone.\nThe principal claimant indicated that on one occasion, when she went to see her husband after they had separated, he raised a stick against her and threatened to kill her. She stated that she went to the Barangay police and reported this incident. Although the principal claimant was not able to obtain a report, she indicated that they not only took the report, but that they went to her husband and warned him against further threats to her. She claimed, however, that it was fruitless to go to the regular police because they would not help her, as she had no money to bribe them. The principal claimant's daughter similarly stated that it would be no use to go to the Barangay or the police because her father had connections and would still want to kill her.\nI find these claims fail because the claimants made little to no effort to avail themselves of the protection their own state had to offer. On those occasions that the principal claimant did seek state intervention, the evidence demonstrates that it was forthcoming. Moreover, both claimants stated that because they didn't think the police would help them, they never sought protection from that source. I find it objectively unreasonable for the claimants to make this assumption, particularly given the active assistance for victims of domestic violence from women's groups in the Philippines.\nI find, based on the documentary evidence referred to above, and the favourable experiences that principal claimant had in accessing state intervention in the past, that it was not reasonable for the claimants to have made no effort to seek protection from their own state.\nAs a result, I conclude that the claimants have not rebutted the presumption of state protection. Accordingly, their claims for protection as Convention refugees must fail.\nConsolidated grounds\nThe claimants did not adduce independent evidence to base a claim on danger of torture or risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. Since I have found that adequate state protection is available to the claimants, their claims must also fail on these grounds.\nCONCLUSION\nFor these reasons, these claims are rejected.\n\"Laurel Croplye\"\nLaurel Cropley\nDATED at Toronto this 3rd day of February, 2004.\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - WOMEN REFUGEES - DOMESTIC VIOLENCE - GENDER - PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP - GENDER-RELATED PERSECUTION - STATE PROTECTION - FEMALE - NEGATIVE - PHILIPPINES\n1 Guidelines on Women Fearing Gender-Related Persecution, November 25, 1996.\n2 Exhibit M-1.\n3 Milev, Dane v.

In addition to fearing Macedonians generally, he also fears a person named XXXXX, an ethnic Macedonian whom he knew from school and who beat the claimant in XXXXX 2001 in Bitola, his hometown. The claimant lived in Sturga, Macedonia (an ethnic Albania majority area) from XXXXX 2001 until he left for Belgium in XXXXX 2001. He returned from Belgium in XXXXX 2002 and in XXXXX 2002 he lived in Sturga until he left for Canada in XXXXX 2002. The claimant does not allege any incident of harm while he lived in Sturga, Macedonia. While he lived in Sturga, he visited Bitola from time to time to check on the family property with no problems. The only incident of harm he alleged occurred in Bitola was when three persons, including XXXXX, beat him in XXXXX 2001. This incident occurred in the context of general rioting that occurred during that time period.\nDETERMINATION\nI find that the claimant is not a Convention refugee, as he does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Macedonia. I also find that he is not a person in need of protection in that his removal to Macedonia would not subject him personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, and in that there are no substantial grounds to believe that his removal to Macedonia will subject him personally to a danger of torture. My reasons are as follows.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\nThe claimant presented a number of original documents, which include his original Macedonian passport (seized by Canada Immigration).2 He testified in the Albanian language. On the basis of the documents presented and his testimony I find that the claimant has established his personal identity, his citizenship and his ethnicity.\nRisk of Harm\nThe claimant testified that he feared general conditions throughout Macedonia. When asked for specific examples of current problems for ethnic Albanians, the only examples he gave pertained to Bitola. When asked what he fears in Sturga, he said that he simply does not feel safe there as an Albanian since Macedonia is a small country and \"anything can happen\" and that while there is no war going on currently in Macedonia, one could happen at any time. He also indicated that as an ethnic Albanian he would have difficulty finding a good job. When asked about his cousins who currently reside in Macedonia, he testified that he did not know of any physical harm that has come to them since he came to Canada. Other than a message that the claimant allegedly received from XXXXX through an ethnic Romanian neighbour in Bitola in XXXXX 2002 there is no evidence that XXXXX is interested in harming the claimant; nor was there any attempt by XXXXX to harm the claimant while he lived in Sturga from XXXXX to XXXXX 2002.\nBased on the claimant's own evidence, he has not discharged his burden of demonstrating that there is a reasonable chance or serious possibility that he would be harmed in Macedonia, particularly in Sturga; nor has he provided any evidence of undue hardship to him in living in Sturga, which would go beyond the usual hardship of relocation.\nWhile I have found that the claimant has not discharged his burden of demonstrating that he is personally at risk in Macedonia, I must also consider whether his ethnicity or religion in the current political context of Macedonia establishes that he faces a reasonable chance or serious possibility of persecution or whether it would subject him personally to a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Macedonia. I find however that there is no serious possibility that the claimant would be subject to such harm in the event of his return there. No evidence was adduced with respect to a risk of a danger of torture.\nThe documentary evidence indicates that contrary to the claimant's assertions, the Macedonian government has taken significant steps to redress the real or perceived wrongs of the Albanian minority. Significantly, the Ohrid peace agreement, signed on the 13th August 2001, appears to grant ethnic Albanians many of the greater civil rights that the rebels say they have sought. Tensions in the divided communities have eased since the NATO forces arrived. The documentary evidence also indicates that partly out of concern that a security vacuum may be created after the departure of the NATO troops currently deployed in Macedonia, on the 18th September 2001 Macedonia's Security Council backed a plan that would see a small NATO mission remain in the country. The mission's primary purpose would be to collect rebel weapons. In a series of reforms aimed at addressing some of the issues raised by the rebel leaders, Parliament approved a new constitution on the 16th November 2001. This new constitution broadened the rights of ethnic minorities, as called for under the peace plan. By November 2002 the new parliament, which came out of elections mandated under the Agreement, had voted in favour of a new multi-ethnic government.3 The reforms are intended to decentralise the government and to grant ethnic Albanians jobs in the public service, above all in the police force, reflecting the one third they represent of the population of two million in the former Yugoslavia republic.4\nThis is not to suggest that the peace accord has been universally accepted or completely implemented. The panel notes that the Peace Accord was intended to redress years of historic, systemic discrimination and cannot be expected to be immediately implemented. Nonetheless, taken as a whole, the panel finds that the documentary evidence suggests that the government of Macedonia is committed to keeping the peace and to honouring the terms of the peace accord and ensuring peace and stability for all its population despite the existence of extremist elements noted by counsel. The political changes that have taken place in Macedonia since the signing of the Peace Accord in August 2001 are fundamental and cumulative and constitute sufficient and durable changes, such as to render the claimant's fear unreasonable and therefore without foundation.\nCONCLUSION\nFor these reasons the claim of XXXXX XXXXX is rejected.\n\"E.J.

I have also considered if he faces a danger of torture upon return to Costa Rica.\nThe claimant fears persecution in Costa Rica at the hands of a violent gang whom he denounced to the police in XXXX 2003 when he witnessed them robbing his friend's store. He alleges he was subsequently beaten up and threatened with death by some of the gang members and they put his car on fire. He came to Canada in XXXXX 2003 to seek protection. Since he came, his family had to re-locate in Costa Rica, as a man had come looking for the claimant. At no time after the initial denunciation did the claimant report the threats to the police or any other state agencies in Costa Rica because, he claims, protection would not be forthcoming.\nJurisprudential Guidelines\nThe determinative issue in this claim is state protection. I considered1 whether the Jurisprudential Guides'2 decision TA2-14980 applies in this case and determine that the facts and the evidence regarding country conditions in this case are sufficiently close to those before the panel in RPD decision TA2-14980 because 1) they both deal with Costa Rican claimants seeking protection due to their fear of criminality, and 2) the issue in both is the determination of the availability of state protection for victims of crime. In addition, I assessed the April 2003 RPD Information Package3 which was not before the Jurisprudential Guide panel. The claimant did not submit any additional documentary evidence. In reaching my decision, I have assessed the claimant's own experiences in the context of the entirety of the evidence.\nDetermination\nI find that the claimant is not a Convention refugee, as his claim does not have a nexus to a Convention ground. I also find that he is not a person in need of protection for the reasons outlined below.\nAnalysis\nThe claimant's identity as a national of Costa Rica is established by a certified true copy of his passport4 submitted by Citizenship and Immigration Canada as well as his testimony.\nI adopt the reasoning in RPD decision TA2-14980 as that reasoning, which has been comprehensively analyzed, applies to the facts of this claim and the availability of state protection for this claimant is the determinative issue in this claim.\nIn the case at bar, I accept that the claimant was being violently pursued by gang members. However, I find that state protection was available to the claimant in Costa Rica had he pursued it.\nWhen the claimant originally contacted the police to report the gang, they arrived 3 hours after the perpetrators had been chased away by a group of taxi drivers with baseball bats. Four police officers arrived and one of them took a signed statement from the claimant and his friend the store owner, which included a description of the robbers. The claimant believed the police officers were dismissive of the complaint because, they said, there are so many similar cases and the gang members all look alike, for example. After the claimant was beaten and threatened by the gang, he did not return to the police because he feared greater reprisal from the gang members. He further stated that the police in Costa Rica are not helpful and in very few cases do they take action.\nI find that while the police did arrive late in the first instance, it appears that they took the denunciation seriously as they did take a signed statement. I find that the onus was on the claimant to return to the police when the gang targeted him as one cannot get protection unless one asks. I find that the claimant's statements about the inability of the police to protect him are not supported by the documentary evidence.\nThe documentary evidence reveals that the Costa Rican government is making serious efforts to protect people who are victims of crime. Furthermore, there are a number of recourses available in Costa Rica for the assessment, prosecution, and the granting of remedies resulting from the failure of the law enforcement agencies to conduct their work.\nA claimant is required to approach his or her state in situations such as this one in which protection might reasonably be forthcoming. Further, I find that the claimant should have returned to the police to report the attacks against him. I find that if the claimant was not satisfied with the police handling of the initial matter that he had recourse to the office of the Ombudsman. He said that he did not go to the Ombudsman because they rarely take effective action. Again, I find that the documentary evidence does not support this conclusion.\nI find the appropriate course of action taken by a reasonable person would have been to pursue a complaint through the available authorities, rather than taking the extreme measure of leaving the country.\nI considered that Costa Rica is a long-standing, stable, constitutional democracy5 with an independent judiciary providing effective means to deal with cases of criminals. In the context of this claim and the claimant's country of origin, I find that by not pursuing state protection, the claimant has not discharged the onus of presenting clear and convincing proof of the state's inability to protect him.\nGiven that there is state protection for this claimant in Costa Rica, I find that there is not a serious possibility that the claimant would face persecution, nor is there a risk to his life, a danger of torture, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment should he return to Costa Rica.\nAccordingly, the RPD finds that XXXXXXXXXXXX is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection and rejects his claim.\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - PERSON IN NEED OF PROTECTION - RISK TO LIFE - CRIMINALITY - STATE PROTECTION - MALE - NEGATIVE - COSTA RICA\n\"M.

XXXXXXXXX) for refugee protection. The claimant is a 25-year-old citizen of Jamaica from XXXXXXXXXXX. The claimant fears crime and violence in Jamaica.\nI am satisfied that the claimant is a citizen of Jamaica and that he is who he says he is by reason of a certified copy of his Jamaican passport,1 which is contained in our file.\nThe claimant's testimony of past events going to the basis of his alleged fear is contained in the narrative to his Personal Information Form2 (PIF) and was given orally by the claimant during the hearing. For the purposes of these reasons, I do not repeat the contents of all of that here. However, I have considered all of it. I have also considered counsel's submissions and all of the documentary evidence before me. Furthermore, I have considered the claimant's level of education.\nIssues for determination:\n1. Does a claimant who advances a claim for protection on the grounds of risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment need to demonstrate a subjective fear of the risk in order to be granted protection?\n2. If a subjective fear is required, can a substantial delay in claiming protection negate that fear and therefore defeat the claim?\nIssue 1 - Subjective fear and s.97(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)\nIt is established beyond doubt in Canadian refugee law that subjective fear is a necessary element of a claim for protection as a Convention refugee. The language of s.96 of IRPA makes this clear, and so does Canadian jurisprudence.3 By contrast, the language of s.97(1)(b) does not make use of the term \"fear\".4 Does it follow from this difference between the two sections that fear is required to succeed as a Convention refugee, but not as a person in need of protection on grounds of risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment?5 I do not think so.\nFirst of all, current principles of statutory interpretation favour a contextual approach over a literal approach. For this reason it is necessary to examine the entire statutory context in which this issue arises. This includes both the substantive provisions which guide protection determination, and the procedural provisions which govern how the determinations are made. In terms of substance this means looking beyond the differences in the language of s.96 and s.97 to examine the statutory context and the legislative intent. Here the context is set out in Divisions 1 and 2 of Part 2 (Refugee Protection) of IRPA. In terms of process this requires examining the role of the Refugee Protection Division in determining claims for refugee protection. The procedural context is set out in Part 4 (Immigration and Refugee Board) of IRPA.\nA. Substantive Context:\nThe Act grants only one status - refugee protection - regardless of whether a claimant succeeds as a Convention refugee or as a person in need of protection. In addition, the Act imports the principles of exclusion from the Refugee Convention so that they apply not only to claims made pursuant to s.96, but to claims made pursuant to s.97 as well.6 Division 2 sets out a procedural code governing a range of aspects, including referral, eligibility for referral, suspension of eligibility, and cessation and vacation of protection. Again, all of these provisions apply, regardless of whether the claim is made pursuant to s.96 or s.97.\nWhat is the legislative purpose in creating a single status and a single procedural code in relation to Convention refugee claims and claims for protection? In my view it is grounded in a fundamental underlying principle, namely that Canada's protection is surrogate protection. This is established in Ward in the context of a claim made for protection as a Convention refugee,7 but it applies equally to claims made pursuant to s.97. The Supreme Court has recognized this by establishing that a claimant must first seek the protection of their own state before coming to Canada to claim protection, unless it is objectively unreasonable for the claimant not to have done so.8 The concept of state protection is integrally linked to the existence of a subjective fear on the part of any claimant. Why? Because there has to be a reason that is particular to the individual, and that motivates the individual to abandon their own country, such that the person arrives on Canada's doorstep asking for protection, rather than seeking the protection of their own state. It simply defies logic to suggest that a person who is seeking Canada's protection need not show a fear of persecution or a fear of risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. If they have no subjective fear, why are they asking for Canada's protection in the first place?\nIn Ward the Supreme Court of Canada recognized the fact that a claimant's subjective fear is tied to lack of state protection. The Court adopts the following statement from Goodwin-Gill:\n\"Fear of persecution and lack of protection are themselves interrelated elements. The persecuted clearly do not enjoy the protection of their country of origin, while evidence of the lack of protection on either the internal or external level may create a presumption as to the likelihood of persecution and to the well-foundedness of any fear.\"9 [Emphasis added.]\nIn other words, it is implicit in any claim for Canada's protection - whether on Convention grounds or on grounds set out in s. 97 - that the claimant has a fear and that it cannot be addressed through protection from the claimant's home state. Any other approach makes no sense: Why is a claim being made if the claimant fears nothing?\nIn relation to the substantive provisions raised by this question, I conclude that a subjective fear is a necessary element of any claim made pursuant to s.97. Reading the words of s.97(1)(b) in the context of those sections of the Act which deal with protection, I conclude that:\n* Divisions 1 and 2 of Part 2 of the Act establish Canada's surrogate protection obligations;\n* Canada's surrogate protection obligations only come into play if there is a failure of state protection in the claimant's country of origin; and\n* The assertion of a failure of state protection by the claimant must first be triggered by a subjective fear which the claimant asserts cannot be adequately addressed by the state in the claimant's country of origin.\nThese principles apply whether or not the claim is made on the grounds of the Refugee Convention, on the grounds of the Convention Against Torture or the grounds in s.97(1)(b).10\nB. Procedural Context:\nIn order to have a complete grasp of the issue, it is also necessary to look at the context in which these decisions are made. The intent of Parliament as to how the Refugee Protection Division is intended to function is clearly not an overriding consideration in interpreting those provisions of IRPA which create substantive rights to Canada's protection. However, where there is ambiguity or uncertainty in the wording of the Act, it is of assistance to consider the Act in its totality, and this includes the procedural dimension. To begin with, Parliament decided to confer the authority to decide claims for refugee protection made in Canada solely on the Board,11 an administrative tribunal.\nIn doing so, the legislation specifies:\n162 (2) Each Division shall deal with all proceedings before it as informally and quickly as the circumstances and the considerations of fairness and natural justice permit.\nA range of other provisions make it clear that the Division must organize and conduct its proceedings in a way which balances fairness which efficiency, so that it can perform as a high-volume human rights tribunal.12 It follows from this that provisions of the Act which affect the operation of the Refugee Protection Division should, where possible, be interpreted in a manner which is consistent with the way Parliament intended the Division to function, namely simply, quickly and fairly.\nIn interpreting ss.96 and 97, the Division examines certain common elements in each case that comes before it: a claimant who is a foreign national or a stateless person comes before the Board seeking Canada's protection on the grounds that their country of citizenship or country of former habitual residence cannot protect them from a serious form of harm. An interpretation of ss.96 and 97 which makes subjective fear a necessary component of the former provision, but not the latter, would require the Division to launch two separate inquiries within the same hearing in order to test the credibility of the claimant's story, one (the s.96 inquiry) which includes and -- based on the Division's long experience in this area - focuses largely on the claimant's subjective fear, and another (the s.97 inquiry) which looks at all aspects of the same facts, but without regard to whether or not the claimant is believable in asserting that they fear a prospective harm. This is a prescription for longer, more cumbersome hearings and lengthier reasons for decision. The issue of subjective fear explored below demonstrates the inconsistency and inefficiency of such an interpretation of the Act.\nBy contrast, an interpretation which recognizes that subjective fear is a necessary element of both ss.96 and 97 allows the Division to examine the essential elements of a claim in a single inquiry. This enables the Division to conduct a more focussed hearing and to provide more focussed reasons. Not only does the latter interpretation allow the Division to balance fairness and efficiency in any individual case, it also allows the Division to manage its entire operation in a manner which is consistent with its statutory mandate as an administrative tribunal.\nBoth the substantive aspects of IRPA and the procedural context in which protection claims are adjudicated favour an approach to s.97 which makes subjective fear a necessary element of any such claim. For these reasons I conclude that s.97 requires an examination of the claimant's subjective fear.\nIssue 2 - Delay and subjective fear\nThe importance of subjective fear as a necessary element of a successful claim - whether on the grounds of the Refugee Convention or on the grounds in s.97(1)(b) - becomes especially clear when considering a delay in making a claim for protection. In the case of claims based on the Refugee Convention, the jurisprudence is evolving to recognize that a lengthy delay in making a claim can, of itself, be a sufficient basis to conclude that a claimant lacks subjective fear.13 The Federal Court has held that reasoning supporting this approach is equally applicable to claims based on s.97(1)(b)14 - again, the principle of surrogate protection applies to both grounds. The actions of a claimant who delays substantially in seeking protection on any ground invite the question of whether the claimant really has anything to fear, and therefore whether Canada's surrogate protection obligations should be engaged.\nThe danger in reading out the requirement of subjective fear in claims made under s.97(1)(b) become obvious in cases where there is a long delay in claiming. Would it make any sense to say that a delay of three years in making a claim under the Refugee Convention can fail because there is no subjective fear, but the same claimant who delays three years before making a claim under s.97(1)(b) can expect to have that delay ignored by a decision-maker because subjective fear is not required by s.97(1)(b)? The absurdity in that position is obvious.\nThe anomaly is especially striking when the very facts on which a Convention refugee claim is rejected, because a subjective fear is lacking, are then reconsidered under the s.97(1) grounds, and the findings on the claimant's lack of subjective fear are treated as inconsequential. Was s.97(1) intended to extend protection to failed Convention refugee claimants whose claim would otherwise have a nexus to a Convention ground but whose behaviour belies a fear of serious harm? The panel thinks not.\nWhether a claim is made on Refugee Convention grounds or on s.97 grounds, delay is a factor. Furthermore, a lengthy delay can be determinative of the fact that the claimant has no subjective fear. The importance of delay has to be assessed on a sliding scale. As Member Aulach indicated in RPD TA0-16602 (Espinosa),15\n\"The importance that one gives to this \"relevant\" element of delay depends on the circumstances of the case. The more inexplicable the delay, the greater the probability that subjective fear is absent. Sometimes the circumstances are such that the element not only is relevant but assumes a decisive role. In these circumstances, delay in making a refugee claim can be a decisive factor in turning down a claim...\"\nThe Refugee Protection Division (RPD) needs to look at the behaviour of the claimant because it is a linchpin of the subjective component of a claim for refugee protection. Since claimants rarely admit to a lack of subjective fear, the subjective component would be virtually bereft of meaning if the claimant's behaviour which was inconsistent with a fear of serious harm was ignored. If that fear is absent, one needs to know why. If no apparent reason is found, then the absence of fear may indicate an absence of risk of harm to the individual concerned.\nIn RPD TA3-0495516 Member Berry outlined four critical factors relevant to the assessment of the claimant's explanation for delay in seeking protection:\n* The length of delay;\n* The nature of the harm feared;\n* The efforts made to legalize one's status and what triggered them; and\n* The reasonableness of the claimant's explanation for the delay.\nIt is reasonable to conclude that the longer the delay and the greater the degree and imminence of harm alleged upon return, the more compelling the explanation should be in order to qualify as reasonable. A lack of effort to legalize one's status and the making of a claim as a last resort further undermine the alleged fear of harm and the professed need for protection.\nThe principles outlined in these two RPD decisions provide a guide to deciding claims where there has been a lengthy delay in claiming on any ground of protection. If the claimant's explanations for the delay are reasonable, given all the circumstances, then the delay in claiming is explained satisfactorily. If not, then the RPD may conclude that the claimant does not in fact have a subjective fear.\nIn this case, the delay in claiming is substantial.\nThe claimant delayed over three years in making his refugee claim: he arrived in Canada in April 2000, but did not claim until August 2003. During that period, the claimant admitted that he had no status in Canada. The claimant also testified that he did not make a refugee claim until after he was arrested by Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC).\nWhen asked to explain why he did not make a refugee claim or take steps to regularize his status in Canada earlier, the claimant testified that he felt safe and secure in Canada and that he did not know how to go about doing it.\nI do not find this to be a reasonable explanation. The claimant also testified that the first time he asked anyone about how he might go about taking steps to remain in Canada was in the year 2002. It seems to me that if the claimant truly feared harm in Jamaica, once he arrived in Canada in April 2000, he would not have waited until 2002 to simply ask a question of a plan as to how he might go about remaining in Canada. I also infer from the fact that the claim was not made until after the claimant was arrested that protection was not a priority for the claimant.\nGiven the length of the delay and the claimant's failure to provide a reasonable explanation, I am drawing an adverse inference as to the claimant's subjective fear. Given the length of the delay, I am finding, based on that one factor alone, that the claimant does not have a subjective fear of harm.\nGiven that the claimant does not have a subjective fear of harm, the Refugee Protection Division rejects the claim and finds that the claimant is not a Convention refugee and not a person in need of protection within the meaning of sections 96 and 97 of the Act.17\nFurthermore, for that same reasons, given the fundamental lack of evidence of the existence of a subjective fear, the Refugee Division finds that there is no credible basis for the claim.\n\"Joel A.

He left Costa Rica on XXXXXX 2004 and arrived in Canada the same day. He claimed refugee status upon arrival. He alleges he will be subjected to harm at the hands of a man with whom he exchanged motor vehicles, who subsequently threatened him, should he return to Costa Rica. His wife and two children remain in Costa Rica.\nHis Personal Information File (PIF) was filed on 19 March 2004. The claimant was scheduled to attend an Assignment court hearing for 10 May 2004 (the notice to appear was sent on 26 April 2004). The claimant failed to appear on 10 May 2003 so consequently a \"show-cause\" abandonment hearing was set for 26 May 2003 (the notice to appear for this matter was sent to the claimant on 10 May 2003).\nThe claimant appeared at the \"show cause\" hearing. When asked why he failed to appear on his original hearing day he said he got lost on the way to the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) premises.\nDecision\nThe claimant's claim is abandoned.\nReasons\nI find that the claimant was unable to show-cause why his case should not be abandoned.\nThe claimant alleges that he got lost on the way to the IRB to attend his hearing. When asked if he attempted to contact the IRB by telephone to explain his dilemma he said he tried to but he only got a voice message. When asked if he attended in person when he eventually found the Board he replied that he only found the Board today. When asked how he managed to find his way to the Board today he said a friend showed him. When asked the full name of this friend he replied that he only knew him as \"XXXXX.\" The claimant was given ample opportunity to add any other comments or explanations. None were forthcoming.\nI do not accept the claimant's explanation for missing his hearing as credible. I find the claimant lied about being unable to find the Board. I find that were that true a claimant could reasonably be expected to have made efforts to contact the Board by telephone or by letter or in person to explain his absence at his hearing. I find that the claimant's action in not attending his hearing reveals an unconcerned and lackadaisical attitude towards prosecuting his claim, which ultimately belies his allegations of being a Convention refugee or a person in need of refugee protection.\nThe claim is abandoned.\n\"Lois D.

XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX and XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX) is a 27-year-old citizen of Iran and the Netherlands who claims to be a Convention refugee or person in need of protection in reference to both countries of nationality. In Iran he suffered because of his father's affiliation with the former regime of the Shah, and in the Netherlands he has been threatened by officials of the Iranian embassy following his refusal to traffic drugs on their behalf, under his trading company.\nCHRONOLOGY OF THE CLAIM AND SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS\nAccording to the claimant's Personal Information Form (PIF) signed December 18, 2001,1 he is a citizen of Iran and only Iran and resided in that country exclusively from birth until he came to Canada. Two years after he signed the PIF and nearly a year after he had sworn to its veracity at his refugee hearing, but before the panel had rendered a decision and was thus functus, the claimant admitted in an interview with a Citizenship and Immigration Enforcement Officer that he is also a citizen of the Netherlands.2 He said that he left Iran in 1988, made a successful asylum claim in the Netherlands, and lived there until he came to Canada and made a refugee claim inland on September 18, 2001. A resumption of the hearing was held to address this new evidence.\nOriginally his claim against Iran was based on a series of personal incidents that began four years after his father's departure from the country around 1993. In the PIF, he states that the Shah of Iran had appointed his father to be XXXXX of the city of XXXXX in 1974. Shortly after the Islamic revolution his father resigned the position. He was then arrested as part of an investigation of former XXXXX but received lenient treatment because of his early resignation. Upon being released from detention after just one week, his father was required to report to government security officials regularly and he was barred from government employment. Private employers refused to hire him because of his ties to the former regime. According to the PIF, the family experienced on-going discrimination, harassment and persecution for this reason and, as a result, when his father left Iran he made a successful asylum claim in the US. The claimant's brother and sister later immigrated to the US and his mother was in the process of doing do so around the time the claimant signed his PIF in Canada.\nThis had been the claimant's evidence at the first sitting of the hearing on December 12, 2002. However, at the resumption on February 2, 2004, he testified (as he had already told the Citizenship and Immigration Enforcement Officer), that he left Iran years before his father, in 1988. He suggested that he had departed first because, being the first son, he was even in greater danger than his father.\nAs originally stated in the PIF, the most serious consequences for the claimant of his father's past political association started in XXXXX 1997 when he got into a fight with a government agent who was harassing an unknown woman and improperly enforcing the regime's Islamic dress code. When he was taken into custody, the authorities found out about his father's history with the Shah's regime and this was an aggravating factor in their mistreatment of him. The claimant's evidence is that he was imprisoned for a period of 40 months among political dissidents and tortured repeatedly. His personal journals and essays were seized from home and he was accused of collaborating with his father abroad.\nHis mother eventually obtained his release in XXXXX - XXXXX 2000 upon payment of a very large bribe. The claimant went into hiding until he was smuggled to Turkey in XXXXX 2001 and then flew from Istanbul to Vancouver a month later. According to his PIF he traveled on a photo-substituted Israeli passport, although it appears he identified the passport as Italian to Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) at the port of entry.\nWhen the claimant ultimately admitted to the Citizenship and Immigration Enforcement Officer that he had been living in the Netherlands all that time, not in Iran, he suggested that he had been arrested, detained and tortured in 1997 during a return visit to Iran. However, at the resumption of the hearing, he testified that all of the incidents described in the PIF took place before he left the country in 1988.\nAs for the claimant's activities in the Netherlands, his new evidence is that he was the owner and operator of an import-export business that conducted trade with Iran. He testified that he launched the business in XXXXX after the Iranian border opened up following the election of President Khatami and in the process he consulted the Iranian embassy in the Netherlands. Within a short period of time, officials from the embassy asked him to obtain drugs in Iran to be carried by diplomats to the Netherlands. When he declined their offer, they started making threats toward him, beginning in 1997, and in late 1998, they sent seven men to beat him up. Over the ensuing two years until he came to Canada, Iranian embassy officials would call him occasionally to chat about his business; he considered these calls threatening because of the \"tone\" and the implication that he was being watched. This made him fear for his life anywhere in Europe because of the presence of agents of the Islamic Republic, so he decided to make a refugee claim in Canada where it would be more difficult for them to reach him.\nAccording to the claimant's PIF, dated December 18, 2001, he did not have a valid Iranian passport. Yet he produced a photocopy of just such a document at the resumption of the hearing, issued in the Netherlands on XXXXX, 1996, and said the original was at his home in North Vancouver. By reference to stamps in the passport, he confirmed that he traveled back to Iran (using that passport) four times: in XXXXX 1998, XXXXX 1999, XXXXX 2000 and XXXXX 2000, without incident. (Significantly, there was no record of a trip in 1997) The claimant himself brought up the fact that all of these trips occurred after he had received the threats from Iranian embassy officials in the Netherlands and explained that he had first gone as the agent of the Iranian government, with the agreement of the embassy, to broker a deal to import XXXXX from the Netherlands. In this context, he cultivated a faction in the government of Iran that would have defended him if he got into trouble while visiting the country.\nThe claimant testified that, on the surface, he may not be in imminent danger if he was to return to Iran, but he would not be able to live a \"normal\" life there because if he ever got into trouble his father's history would put him in danger.\nAt the resumption of the hearing, the claimant said that he came to Canada as a visitor in 1993 and looked into the possibility of immigration. Although he met the requirements, he learned that the process would take almost a year. A consultant named Hilal Bangash advised him it was better to go back (to the Netherlands). In 2002, she represented the claimant at the first sitting of the hearing, although in the meantime his PIF had been prepared with a lawyer, Martin Jones, and another lawyer, Brenda Wemp, was counsel of record for several months leading up to the first sitting.3\nAt the outset of the proceeding on December 12, 2002 the claimant amended his PIF to show that his real surname is XXXXX XXXXX or XXXXX XXXXX. This is the surname that appears on the Iranian identity documents he provided,4and it is also the surname of his putative father in the US.\nISSUES\nInitially, the following issues were identified in the claim against Iran: personal identity; credibility; objective basis; subjective fear relating to his failure to claim elsewhere (in the US) and the apparent short delay in making a claim in Canada; destruction of documents (the putative false passport); and a second nationality or exclusion under Article 1E if it emerged that he has status in the US like other family members. Among the issues arising from the revelations concerning incidents in the Netherlands, canvassed at the resumption, were: credibility and state protection. The new evidence also had a bearing on the subjective and objective well foundedness of his claim against Iran.\nANALYSIS\nPersonal Identity\nUltimately, the Refugee Protection Division takes no issue with the claimant's identity as XXXXX XXXXX or the evidence that he is both a national of Iran and the Netherlands, although there are serious reasons to doubt that the US citizen, XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, is his father and a former associate of the Shah.\nThe Refugee Protection Division emphatically does not accept the claimant's excuse for failing to tell the truth about his dual nationality to Canadian government officials, over a period of nearly two full years. He testified that it was an open secret in the local community that he is a Dutch citizen - but he withheld the information from the Canadian government on the advice of Hilal Bangash who warned him that Canada would send him back to the Netherlands. The Refugee Protection Division has no reason to doubt the claimant's damaging allegations concerning the immigration consultant. However, the Refugee Protection Division finds that this does not absolve the claimant of his responsibility to tell the whole truth to officials of the country he is asking for protection.\nMoreover, as noted above, the claimant had the benefit of counsel by two successive highly respected lawyers after he made his refugee claim and thus the opportunity to discuss with each the wisdom of Hilal Bangash's guidance. It is reasonable to expect that either one of them would have assured him that if he made a refugee claim against his second country of nationality, he would not be returned there unless it were finally decided after lengthy and multifaceted due process that it was safe for him to do so. Also, the claimant himself could have figured out the parallel between his Iranian nationality and claim against Iran and his Dutch nationality and the corresponding opportunity to say what harm he faces there.\nFurthermore, the Refugee Protection Division finds, on the balance of probabilities, in addition to hiding his Dutch nationality, the claimant also withheld from examination certain originals of Iranian documents relating to his personal identity. At the first sitting of the hearing, he provided just one original Iranian identity document -- his problematic military discharge card5 -- there are only copies and translations of the rest of the documents in evidence, including an Iranian identity booklet; high school diploma; some photos of his father; a few of the claimant's XXXXX; the Shah's order of his father's appointment; his parents' divorce decree; and a couple more documents about the claimant's XXXXX activities. He tried to suggest that his father mistakenly took all the other originals back home with him to Seattle.\nAs soon as the claimant reported this at the beginning of the hearing, the Presiding Member directed him to contact his father in Seattle and ask him to send the originals by courier. Since the documents had not arrived by end of the day when the hearing was adjourned, the claimant was given additional time to provide these originals for examination. Nothing of the kind was received in response by the due date or in the ensuing months.\nLastly, on this issue, the Refugee Protection Division finds that the claimant has not provided a satisfactory explanation for the discrepancy between the name he consistently gave to Canadian authorities - XXXXX XXXXX - and the surname that appears on his putative Iranian identity documents - XXXXX XXXXX or XXXXX XXXXX - which is also the surname of the naturalized US citizen he alleges to be his father.6 Paradoxically he says he never used the second surname in Iran, whereas on the face of the documents the opposite is true: this was his name in Iran but he has not used it in Canada (or, it now appears, in the Netherlands either).7 Since there is no dispute that he deceived Canadian authorities about his Dutch nationality, it is reasonable to assume he has done the same in respect of his real surname. During the interview with the Citizenship and Immigration Enforcement Officer he was asked how much of his original PIF was honest, and he replied, \"Probably just my name,\" perhaps forgetting for the moment that he had amended that information.8\nAs a result, the Refugee Protection Division draws an adverse inference as to the credibility of the alleged relationship between the claimant and the man identified as XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, his putative refugee father in the US whose supposed appointment by the former Shah of Iran thirty years ago still places the claimant at risk in Iran.\nOverall Credibility\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Refugee Protection Division finds that the claimant has failed to provide sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish his claims to refugee protection, either with respect to Iran or the Netherlands, under any of the grounds afforded in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). The claimant's credibility has been fatally damaged by the fact he wilfully deceived Canadian authorities as to most basic elements of his life and experience: his nationalities and his whereabouts before coming to Canada. He made an oath to tell \"the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth\" at the first sitting of the hearing, only to tell a pack of lies - by his own admission.9 The Refugee Protection Division finds that he has continued to fabricate his evidence in alleging threats by Iranian agents and embassy officials in the Netherlands.\nClaim Against Iran\nThe Refugee Protection Division finds it is not credible that the arrest, detention, assault and torture the claimant allegedly experienced over a period of more than 40 months in Iran could have occurred alternatively: starting in XXXXX 1997 (per the narrative statement in his PIF); or before he left the country in 1988; or during a return visit in 1997.\nThe pre-1988 timeframe is inconsistent with the allegation that the Iranian authorities accused him of collaborating with his father \"who was then known to be abroad\" and that they questioned him about why he had not departed Iran with his father.10 (Supposedly this is what grievously aggravated their mistreatment of him.) His evidence now is that his father did not go abroad until 1993. The timeframe of his alleged imprisonment in Iran, originally given in the PIF as XXXXX 1997 to XXXXX or XXXXX 2000, has now been discredited by the claimant's admission that he was residing in the Netherlands during that whole time. And the alternative suggestion that this all happened on a return visit to Iran the same year is inconsistent with the length of the alleged detention (more than three years), and it is not supported by the claimant's examination of entry stamps in his own Iranian passport (there being none for 1997). It is also at odds with his oral testimony that when he first went back to Iran he cultivated a faction of the Islamic regime to ensure he would be protected if things went wrong. Moreover, it is reasonable to expect that if the claimant had been arrested, detained and tortured by the Islamic regime during a trip in 1997, for some shorter period of time, he would not have returned just for the sake of doing business on four more occasions in 1998, 1999, and 2000. On the balance of probabilities this detailed and graphic account of arrest, detention and torture, is simply untrue.\nConsidering the claimant's admission that he visited Canada previously and looked into the possibility of immigration (but considered it would take too long), in all likelihood the claimant fabricated the story as the basis of a refugee claim against Iran in order to use the refugee system to circumvent proper immigration procedures.\nThe Refugee Protection Division finds that the specific allegations of cruel and unusual punishment or treatment, torture, and persecution that form the basis of the claim against Iran have no foundation in reality. .\nCorrespondingly, there are serious reasons to doubt that the claimant's putative father was ever discriminated against by the Islamic regime for association with the former Shah or that his profile in that regard was such that he would have been perceived as a political opponent some twenty years after the Revolution, especially to the degree that his son would be imperilled on his account upon return to Iran. This is the lynchpin of the claim to refugee protection against Iran under all of the grounds in Sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).11\nSupposedly his father is now an American citizen and resides in nearby Seattle. In the alleged circumstances, this individual should have been able to provide first-hand corroborative evidence, not only of his XXXXX appointment by the Shah in 1974, but his subsequent resignation and brief imprisonment after the Islamic revolution and the requirement that he report weekly upon release. If his son had endured such vile treatment at the hands of the Islamic regime in large measure because of him and he helped make the arrangements for his son's escape from Iran,12 it is reasonable to expect that he would have actively supported his son's refugee claim in Canada.\nHowever, this has not been the case. As noted above, the claimant's putative father apparently has not responded to the Presiding Member's direction to forward the originals of various documents in evidence so they could be examined.13 While this individual gave his consent for the IRB to check his status in the US, it was open to him to obtain and provide the entire contents of his own US \"A\" (Alien) file and in particular his putative application for asylum and the reasons for its acceptance. If reliable and trustworthy, such information could have gone a long way toward providing at least an arguable basis for his son's derivative claim.\nInstead, what is in evidence (apparently from the claimant's father) is a poor quality photocopy of a putative letter from the US Department of Justice Asylum Office that grants him asylum effective XXXXX, 1993; a photocopy and translation of a letter from the Shah of Iran dated XXXXX 1977 (not 1974 per the PIF) appointing him to the executive of XXXXX County; photocopies of various photographs purportedly showing him carrying out his civic duties and a photograph of the family when the (two) children were young, oddly enough posed in front of a Christmas tree - the claimant testified this was taken at a Christmas party in France at the institute where his father got a doctoral degree.14\nThe Refugee Protection Division gives no weight to the Shah's appointment confirmation given the discrepancy in dates and since it bears no royal (or other) official insignia. Similarly, the Refugee Protection Division accords no weight to the photographs of the man performing civic duties, for example, cutting a ribbon, watching young men parade, etc. because there is no way to identify him as the claimant's father. Had this individual attended the hearing and provided his own Iranian identity booklet, for example, such identification could have been possible. As for the putative grant of asylum, the Refugee Protection Division finds this photocopy is not reliable or trustworthy evidence. On its face, it appears to corroborate the claimant's statement in the PIF that his father requested asylum in approximately 1993 in Seattle. However, there is no independent trustworthy evidence that this individual's route to US citizenship began with an asylum claim.\nAfter the first sitting of the hearing, the IRB received the results of the status check of the claimant in the US under his supposed hyphenated surname and its different spellings. The Refugee Protection Officer made written application to disclose this information under the provision in the Refugee Protection Division Rules and the Presiding Member accepted it into evidence.15 Minister's counsel and counsel for the claimant (Hilal Bangash) were given the opportunity to make additional submissions but none were received from either party.\nThe US response is that there is no immigration record for anyone using the same name(s) as the claimant. But more importantly the record provided from the US immigration file concerning the claimant's putative father fails to verify that he made a request for asylum in Seattle in 1993 as alleged by the claimant and as stated in the putative letter from the US Department of Justice. What the record does indicate is that XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, born in Iran, initiated an immigration application of some sort (the asylum request form I-589 cited in the letter is not indicated in the official record) on XXXXX, 1993. But apparently the application was made abroad because, although the procedure was finalized on XXXXX, 1993, he is shown to have entered the US on XXXXX, 1995 at Seattle and simultaneously his status changed. If nothing else, the clear contradiction here is that he entered the US a year and a half after the putative letter addressed to him in Seattle dated XXXXX, 1994 granting asylum. The Refugee Protection Division prefers the objective information provided by the US government and finds, on the balance of probabilities, that the photocopy of the letter supposedly concerning the claimant's father's asylum matter in the US has been fabricated for the purposes of the instant refugee claim.\nConsidering the adverse inference already drawn above in the analysis of personal identity from the discrepancy in the claimant's evidence as to whether in actual fact he has the same surname as the naturalized US citizen XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, coupled with this individual's lack of cooperation in the proceeding, the Refugee Protection Division finds that the claimant has failed to establish that he is indeed his father, or that he was ever perceived by Iranian authorities to have been associated with the regime of the former Shah of Iran through an appointment made thirty years ago.\nThis finding further undermines - if that is possible -- the credibility of the claimant's assertion at the second sitting of the hearing that he would not be able to live a normal life in Iran because, if he ever got into trouble, his father's history would put him in danger.\nIn addition, according to the objective country information,16 monarchists like the group, XXXXX XXXXX, that allegedly helped both the claimant and his putative father to flee from Iran are not taken seriously now by the Islamic regime because they do not pose a political threat. All active and militant monarchists left Iran during the 1980s and are mainly in Europe and North America. The only activities of the few remaining monarchists are small private gatherings where people remember the time of the Shah with nostalgia. They no longer have an audience in the Iranian population. Accordingly, the government is not interested in pursuing any Iranian with monarchist affiliations, as long as they do not engage in anti-regime activities and avoid making public statements about their monarchist ideology.\nThe claimant's evidence is that his putative father did not get involved in political activities after the Revolution, nor did he himself, although supposedly he wrote about his religious beliefs in personal journals and essays that the authorities seized from his home when he was in prison - evidence found above not to be credible.\nMoreover, one report states there is no evidence of any pattern of action by the regime today against Iranians simply because at one time they were middle-level or low ranking functionaries of the Shah's bureaucracy.17\nIn light of this authoritative information, there does not appear to be an objective basis for the claim against Iran. Even if there was once some foundation for it, perhaps in immediate aftermath of Islamic Revolution in 1979, the claimant's own evidence is that he has long since cultivated allies in one of the factions of the Islamic regime who would protect him if he got into trouble. By this means he would be able to avail himself of state protection if he were to return to Iran, which is rare for Iranian refugee claimants fearing persecution by government officials.\nLastly, there is the matter of the claimant's voluntary re-availment to Iran after supposedly having been granted asylum in the Netherlands.18 His evidence is that he contacted the Iranian embassy as long ago as 1996 to get a new passport, acted as a business agent for the Iranian government, and returned to Iran (using his Iranian passport) four times between 1998 and 2000. He testified emphatically that this was only possible after President Khatami was first elected, but he thought that this had occurred in 1995 or 1996, while the documentary evidence shows it was in 1997.19 This means the claimant approached the Iranian embassy in the Netherlands well before the unpredicted election of Mohammed Khatami as President.\nThe Refugee Protection Division notes that the claimant became a naturalized citizen of the Netherlands in 1994, according to his oral evidence. This means he would have been eligible for a Dutch passport if he had wished to travel, and thus did not need to apply for an Iranian one. Moreover, his choice of business in the Netherlands is anomalous since presumably an import - export business between the Netherlands and Iran would require some contact with the feared Islamic regime. The Refugee Protection Division finds that the claimant's evidence about his alleged reticence to contact Iranian officials is not credible, given the date his passport was issued. Moreover, the nature of his business and fourfold re-availment in 1998, 1999, and 2000 demonstrates a profound lack of subjective fear, which is a necessary element of the definition of a Convention refugee under Section 96 of the IRPA.\nBy the same token, there is no credible evidence or argument that anything bad happened to the claimant during these four trips. (As noted in the analysis above, he suggested to the Citizenship and Immigration Enforcement Officer that the series of incidents beginning in XXXXX 1997 of arrest, detention and torture described in the PIF had still occurred, despite his residence in the Netherlands at the time, but on a trip to Iran instead, the same year. This allegation has been discredited in the analysis above.) However, as the passport entries serve to indicate, the fact that he encountered no problems in the course of these trips is strong evidence that if the claimant were removed to Iran he would not face a risk to life or risk of cruel or unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture, under Section 97 of the IRPA.\nTaking all the evidence into account, the Refugee Protection Division finds that the claimant has failed to establish that he would face a serious possibility of persecution or a risk to life or risk of cruel or unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture if he were to return to Iran once more. His claim to be a person in need of protection under both Section 96 and 97 of the IRPA has no merit.\nClaim Against the Netherlands\nSince the claimant has not provided a satisfactory explanation for having deceived Canadian authorities about his Dutch nationality for nearly two years, while simultaneously asking for Canada's protection, the Refugee Protection Division finds, on the balance of probabilities that the substance of his belated claim against the Netherlands is not credible. It is a total fabrication and purely expedient.\nEven in its particulars, the alleged basis of the claim is incredible. Most notably, his allegation that Iranian embassy officials proposed in 1997 that he traffic drugs from Iran for them is fundamentally at odds with the rest of his evidence that he is suspected of being a political opponent of the regime because of his family background. In that context, it is implausible that Iranian embassy officials would have found him to be sufficiently loyal and trustworthy to involve him in secret criminal activities that could have had dramatic political and diplomatic repercussions if revealed.\nMoreover, the claimant contradicted himself during oral testimony at the resumption of the hearing, first saying clearly that they asked him to provide the drugs and then, when asked by the Presiding Member whether he was a recognized drug dealer in the Netherlands, trying to suggest that he was not supposed to supply the drugs, just do \"research.\" He was vague about what that meant, but seemed to suggest it would have entailed locating illicit sources of drugs in Iran for the smuggling operation. Here again, if the claimant is being truthful that he was not a known drug dealer, it is not credible that the Iranian embassy officials would look to a novice living outside Iran to do that job. Supposedly at that stage he had only acted as the agent of the Iranian government to XXXXX XXXXX for export from Europe to Iran. Furthermore, the claimant's own testimony is that he was an unlikely choice because he worked in the Netherlands to encourage young people to avoid drugs and his activities were reported in the newspapers.\nAs well, there is a fundamental inconsistency in the claimant's allegation that Iranian embassy officials were threatening him and sending men to beat him up and telephoning him with implied threats over his refusal to traffic drugs, while simultaneously he was able to make repeated trouble-free trips to Iran for unrelated business purposes. There is no evidence that his entry to Iran was ever impeded or that he was even questioned by the security forces.\nFinally, if the claimant made an asylum claim against Iran in 1988 and this is how he came to be a citizen of the Netherlands, the Refugee Protection Division finds it is objectively unreasonable that he did not, once again, seek the protection of his host country when Iranian embassy officials and government agents allegedly harassed and threatened him upon his refusal to traffic drugs for them. During his interview with the Citizenship and Immigration Enforcement Officer, he was asked why he did not report the matter to the police. He did not answer the question directly and only stated, rhetorically, that in Holland a child molester gets free and \"there is no law there, believe me.\" His statements at the resumption of the hearing were similarly vague: it would have been a \"waste of time\" to talk to anyone about his problem and in Holland \"they won't do anything unless something happened.\"\nThe burden of showing a state's inability to protect rests with the claimant and is discharged only if he provides clear and convincing evidence of the state's inability to protect.20 Absent a complete breakdown of the state apparatus, nations are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens and the claimant was by then a citizen of the Netherlands.\nThe Refugee Protection Division finds in general there is little justification at this stage for Canadian authorities to \"believe\" anything the claimant says, even under oath. His failure to treat the matter seriously is perfectly congruent with the fact that his claim against the Netherlands is without foundation. The Refugee Protection Division finds that claimant's vague pronouncements do not constitute clear and convincing evidence of the Netherlands' inability to protect him against local representatives of the government of Iran and do not discharge the burden of proof on him as a Dutch citizen.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Refugee Protection Division finds that the claimant has failed to provide sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish that he has a well founded fear of persecution in the Netherlands, his second country of nationality, under Section 96 of the IRPA, or that his removal to the Netherlands would subject him personally to a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture, at the hands of representatives of the Iranian government, under Section 97 of the IRPA. In this case, the overall negative credibility assessment and the specific adverse findings with respect to the Netherlands on the issues of credibility and state protection are determinative of the claim under all of the provisions of the IRPA.\nExclusion Under Article 1E\nIn relation to the claimant's evidence in the PIF and at the first sitting of the hearing, previous Minister's counsel Gordon Starr conceded in written submissions that there is no basis for exclusion and the claimant cannot avail himself of the protection of the US based on his father's status in that country. The Refugee Protection Division finds that Article 1E of the UN Convention does not apply in the absence of evidence that the claimant has resident status in the US.\nNo Credible Basis\nIn rejecting this claim to refugee protection, the Refugee Protection Division finds that there was no credible evidence on which it could have made a favourable decision. The claimant's evidence is without merit and there is no credible basis for his claims against Iran or the Netherlands.21\nDETERMINATION\nFor all the reasons above the Refugee Protection Division finds that the claimant has failed to provide sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish his claim to refugee protection in reference to either of his countries of nationality under Section 96 of IRPA.\nThe Refugee Protection Division also finds that the claimant has failed to provide sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence that he would be subjected personally to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture or to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, under Section 97 of the IRPA.\nAccordingly, the Refugee Protection Division determines that XXXXX XXXXX (a.k.a. XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX and XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX) is not a Convention refugee or person in need of protection. Furthermore, there is NO CREDIBLE BASIS for his claim.\n\"Barbara Hodgins\"\nBarbara Hodgins\nFebruary 11, 2004\nDate\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - EVIDENCE - CREDIBILITY - DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE - DOCUMENTATION - IDENTITY - SUBJECTIVE ELEMENT - CREDIBLE BASIS - MALE - NEGATIVE - IRAN - NETHERLANDS\n1 Exhibit 1.\n2 Exhibit 11.\"Application to Reopen (sic)\" and attachments, dated December 5, 2003.\n3 Hilal Bangash was retained by the claimant in September or October 2002.\n4 Exhibit 3.\n5 Minister's counsel Gordon Starr notes in his written submissions made after the first sitting of the hearing the inconsistencies in the evidence related to this document.\n6 The USINS printout for this individual is at Exhibit 10 and his personal documents are in Exhibit 6.\n7 The identity page of his Dutch passport gives his name as XXXXX XXXXX.

He claims refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nALLEGATIONS\nHe alleges that in 1992 he first enlisted in the U.S. Navy at the age of 18. He served for four years in the nuclear program and, following a series of promotions, received an honourable discharge in 1996, two years in advance of the estimated duration of his service. He had decided to leave the military in order to attend school and had a good experience in the military up to this point.\nIn the year 2000, he re-enlisted in the U.S. Navy.2 He had advanced and received promotions on a regular basis and was ahead of schedule in his intended service.\nProblems began to occur for the claimant around XXXXXX, 2001. He was asked to do a preventative maintenance system (PMS) check on some life jackets. There was a personality conflict between he and his immediate superior and between he and the more senior officers in the Chain of Command. Specifically, he ran into difficulty with the Damage Control Officer, XXXXX.\nExhibit 2.2 is a \"Report and Disposition of Offenses,\" which took place around this time. The claimant was charged with \"failure to obey a direct order,\" which originated from this PMS check on XXXXX, 2001. The claimant brought his documents with him when he left the U.S. in XXXXX of 2001. A hearing called a \"Captain's Mast\" took place regarding the allegations.\nThe sentence that the claimant received after his hearing, was a 45-day \"restriction,\" which means that he was required to stay on the boat. He also received 45 days \"extra duties,\" which included manual labour and a \"suspended bust,\" which is a temporary reduction of rank. This sentence was rendered and took effect immediately on the Captain's Mast date, which was XXXXX, 2001.\nThe sentence was imposed pursuant to UCMJ Article 107. The claimant says that he does not know what the maximum penalty could have been for this charge. He also indicated that he paid a fine, which was not reflected in the disposition report.\nAround this time the claimant suffered from sleeping disorders, knee problems, depression and anger. He was placed on light duty by the ship's doctor. As the pressure from his colleagues increased and accusations regarding poor personal hygiene and other matters were raised, the claimant became distraught and left the ship on Friday, XXXXX 2001, when he was finished his sentence.\nThe claimant testified that he \"blanked out\" on the weekend that he left the ship. He does not recall anything that happened during the course of that weekend. On Monday morning at approximately 6:00 or 7:00 a.m., approximately one to two hours before he was due back on the ship, he called his Chain of Command, the OS1, and told him that he was ill and unable to return to the ship. The OS1 started yelling at the claimant and told him that if he did not return to the ship he would be charged with further offences.\nThe claimant had somehow visited a doctor over the course of that weekend, although he does not recall having done so. He did, however, have a doctor's note in his possession which told him to stay home for three days. This note was in writing. He does not know where he got it and he was unable to produce it at his refugee hearing.\nThe claimant believes that if he had returned on that Monday morning in time to meet his 8:00 a.m. deadline, he would have been harassed by the Chain of Command and yelled at some more. If he was late, he would be charged with six further counts for missing the time, and if he did not come back for the three days as recommended by the doctor, he would face further problems and more charges.\nHe testified that each count has its own penalty and it is up to the captain what penalty to impose. He indicated there could have been more restrictions, further reductions in his rank and a further forfeiture of pay. He did not say that he was facing the risk of torture or risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, although in submissions counsel alleged that the treatment he could receive would amount to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. I will have more to say about that below.\nAround mid- XXXXX 2001, the claimant came to Canada and brought with him the Report and Disposition of Offenses and his Navy Identity Card, which he submitted to Citizenship and Immigration Canada when he made his refugee claim.\nWhile the claimant is confused about some of the facts, he did testify in a fairly straightforward manner, and appear to comprehend the nature of the refugee proceedings. A designated representative was appointed to assist the claimant.\nDETERMINATION\nI find that the claimant is not a Convention refugee in that he does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in the United States. I also find that the claimant is not a person in need of protection in that his removal to the United States would not subject him personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment and, in that there are no substantial grounds to believe that his removal to the United States will subject him personally to a danger of torture.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\nThe claimant's identity as a national of the U.S. is established by his testimony and the supporting documentation filed.\nCredibility\nI have found the claimant to be a credible witness to the extent that he was able to elucidate the panel with respect to the facts of his case. I believe what he has alleged in support of his claim insofar as the allegations relate to facts, which can be proven. However, there are instances where the claimant speculated or drew conclusions not born out by the evidence.\nThe claimant was confused about some of the facts in the case. For example, the CIC Notes filed3 indicate that the claimant visited Canada in March, April and May of 2001. On at least one of these three dates, the claimant was confined to the ship and could not have travelled to Canada. He realized that this was the case when he was testifying but could not explain why there was a discrepancy. He indicated he had been in Canada in March and April in his Notification of Claim to be a Convention Refugee.4\nHarm Feared: Is It Persecution?\nThe first question for the panel to resolve is whether what the claimant describes is persecution. The claimant alleged that should he return to the United States, he would be subjected to the following harm namely, degrading comments, fellow officers and military personnel getting him into trouble, having his bed torn apart, finding metal shavings in his bed, being ostracized by his colleagues, getting no support from his seniors, being unfairly targeted for his personal hygiene, which he has a difficult time maintaining, being forced into displaying his anger, which he has a difficult time controlling, and so on.\nI find that the harm allegedly feared by the claimant does not constitute persecution. Persecution has been defined as a sustained or systematic violation of fundamental human rights. I find that the harm feared does not violate a fundamental right.\nIn view of my finding that the harm feared does not amount to persecution because it does not violate a fundamental right, I also find that the harm feared cannot amount to a risk to life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or to a danger of torture, as the harm envisaged in all of these instances necessarily constitutes a violation of a fundamental right. To be considered persecution, the mistreatment suffered or anticipated must be serious. I find that the incidents complained of may amount to discrimination or harassment, but they do not amount to persecution.\nThe mistreatment suffered or anticipated by the claimant includes matters which are within the ambit of the U.S. Navy to control. Spending \"a lot of time in the brig (military jail)\" and being subjected to harassment and ostracism of his colleagues does not amount to persecution. In my view, the claimant would be permitted to mount a defence to any charges alleged, despite his fear that this would not be available to him. He would, in my view, also be permitted to call medical evidence to confirm the fact, if it does in fact exist, that he is clinically depressed, nervous, angry and has a medically certifiable mental illness. I do not know whether a\nphysician would make this determination but, if the claimant is in fact mentally ill, this could certainly be assessed by a physician or psychologist and presented to a military tribunal.\nIn view of my finding that the harm feared is not serious, I also find that the harm feared does not amount to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment and punishment or to a danger of torture as the harm envisaged in all of these instances must necessarily be of a serious nature.\nCruel and unusual treatment or punishment, although not defined in the Act, has been described as \"punishment or treatment that violates our sense of fundamental justice or shocks the conscience.\"5 Torture constitutes \"an aggravated and deliberate form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\"\nI have also considered whether the acts of discrimination or harassment alleged may cumulatively constitute persecution or whether the repeated incidents of discrimination or harassment in the past may lead to a serious possibility of persecution in the future. I find that the repeated acts of harassment feared by the claimant do not amount to persecution because the treatment does not amount to a violation of a fundamental right and because the harm feared is not serious.\nTo constitute persecution, the harm feared must occur with repetition or persistence or in a systematic way. I find that the harm complained of amounted to a few isolated incidents arising from one act and that, given all of the circumstances, there is no serious possibility that it will recur.\nThe claimant alleges that the prosecution awaiting him in the United States by the military tribunal constitutes persecution for a Convention reason. He alleges that he is a member of a particular social group as a military deserter. The claimant alleges that the law under which he is being prosecuted violates basic human rights and that the penalty he would suffer is disproportionate to the objective of the law and that the punishment constitutes persecution. He also alleges he would suffer extra-judicial punishment in that a military tribunal is not subject to the same rules as a criminal court, including a lack of due process.\nThe UNHCR Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status6 is instructive in this regard. The claimant is alleging that he is a refugee because he would suffer disproportionately severe punishment for the military offence on account of his membership in a particular social group, and perhaps also, an account of his race as an Angle-Saxon. He alleges that Officer XXXXX is an African American and that he was targeted as a result of racism.\nI do not find, on the evidence before me, sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence that this is so. In addition, I do not find that the claimant has properly defined the social group to which he belongs as envisaged by the Immigration Act or the Geneva Convention.\nIn certain cases, the type of military action with which an individual does not wish to be associated is condemned by the international community as contrary to basic rules of human conduct. In these cases, punishment for desertion or draft evasion could, in the light of all other requirements of the definition, in itself be regarded as persecution. However, the claimant must advance religious convictions, which are genuine and demonstrate that such convictions are not taken into account by the authorities in his country in requiring him to perform military service.\nThe claimant has not advanced any evidence of a religious conviction or a moral reason of conscience to not obey his superior officers. I do not find that the claimant has invoked genuine reasons of conscience to exempt him from military service, which could offer an explanation for his refusal to follow the Chain of Command.\nThe claimant presents as a person with a mental illness. However, a medical report was not filed as part of his hearing. I am basing my assessment simply on my observations of the claimant's demeanour during the hearing. Because of this mental illness, if one exists, the claimant may be discriminated against by the U.S. Navy. However, in my view, at most this is discrimination and not persecution for a Convention ground.\nI note that the claimant was promoted a number of times while in the Navy and it is clear to me that there may be a personality conflict between he and his direct superiors in this, his second tour of duty. However, he has not demonstrated that the discrimination or harassment is systematic in any way, in the U.S. military.\nBecause I am sensitive to the fact that the claimant may have a mental illness, with respect to the issue of delay, I have relied upon the UNHCR Handbook, paragraph 210:\nIt will, in any event, be necessary to lighten the burden of proof normally incumbent upon the applicant and information that cannot easily be obtained from the applicant may have to be sought elsewhere, e.g. from friends, relatives and other persons closely acquainted with the applicant or from his guardian, if one has been appointed.\nXXXXX XXXXX testified that the claimant was confused about his status in Canada and Mr. XXXXX was not aware that the claimant had filed a refugee claim. I am satisfied that the reason for the claimant's delay in making a claim is not at all related to his subjective fear but is more related to the nature of his mental condition, which at times causes him to be confused.\nWhat is the claimant likely to face upon return to the United States? To answer this question, I have reviewed the documentary evidence filed in the claim.\nAccording to the Manual of Courts-Martial, Article 85, paragraph 9, the offence of desertion includes the case of a person who remains absent from his unit, organization or place of duty with intent to remain away there from permanently.7\nThe document goes on to discuss the maximum punishments for desertion and indicates that they vary based upon the circumstances. For example, where the person has attempted or completed desertion with intent to avoid hazardous duty or to shirk important service, the maximum punishment would be dishonourable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for five years.\nIn situations where the desertion is for other reasons and the person is captured involuntarily, the maximum punishment is dishonourable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for three years.\nWhere, however, desertion is for other reasons than those already mentioned and the person voluntarily surrenders, the maximum punishment is dishonourable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for three years.\nThe claimant's counsel submits that the claimant may face death upon return because, since his desertion, the United States government is at war. The Manual of Courts-Martial, Article 85, indicates that the maximum punishment for desertion during a time of war is death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct.8 I do not find that this section of the Courts-Martial Act applies to the claimant since his desertion took place long before September 11, 2001 and long before war was declared on Iraq.\nThe claimant was asked what he believes would be the sentence he would be facing, given the number of charges that may be laid against him. He indicated that, because of the fact there were multiple charges, he might be facing eight years in the brig. If this is indeed the sentence that the claimant faces, I do not find that the sentence is persecutory, in the circumstances.\nState Protection\nThe claimant must approach his state for protection if state protection is reasonably forthcoming.9 The claimant has the burden of rebutting the existence of state protection with \"clear and convincing proof of the state's inability to protect.\"10\nThe claimant has failed to rebut the presumption that his state is willing to protect him from rogue military officers if, in fact, this is what he faces upon return. If the military is discriminating against the claimant because he is, in fact, mentally ill, he is entitled to raise this as an explanation for his past behaviour. If he feels that he has been unfairly treated by the United States Navy, he has the option of a civil action against the military available to him.\nThe United States is a democracy with a highly sophisticated justice system with checks and balances such as those envisaged by the Federal Court of Appeal in the decision of Satiacum.11\nIn the absence of exceptional circumstances, Canadian tribunals must assume a fair and independent judicial process in a foreign country. In a democracy such as the United States, with a free and independent judicial system, it would be necessary to impeach substantially the relevant jury selection process or the independence and fair mindedness of the judiciary.\nThe decision of Satiacum was considered with approval in Ward. After completing its analysis of Satiacum, the Supreme Court explained further the purpose of the presumption of a state's ability to afford protection in these words:\nAlthough this presumption increases the burden on the claimant, it does not render illusory Canada's provision of a safe haven for refugees. The presumption serves to reinforce the underlying rationale of international protection as a surrogate, coming into play where no alternative remains to the claimant. Refugee claims were never meant to allow a claimant to seek out better protection than that from which he or she benefits already.\nIn Kadenko12 the Court of Appeal revisited the issue of state protection and set out the refugee claimant's burden of proof in terms of the level of democracy in the country in question.\nOnce it is assumed that the state has political and judicial institutions capable of protecting its citizens, it is clear that the refusal of certain police officers to take action cannot, in itself, make the state incapable of doing so. When the state in question is a democratic state, as in the case at bar, the claimant must do more than simply show that he or she went to see some members of the police force and that his or her efforts were unsuccessful. The burden of proof that rests on the claimant is in a way directly proportional to the level of democracy in the state in question. The more democratic the state's institutions, the more the claimant must have done to exhaust all of the courses of action open to her or to him.\nThe issue, therefore, is whether Mr. XXXXX has advanced \"clear and convincing\" evidence to rebut the presumption of state protection in the United States. The fact that Mr. XXXXX has experienced difficulties with certain military officers in the United States does not make him a Convention refugee.\nWith respect to risk to the claimant's life or the risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, I find that the treatment that the claimant fears is not inhuman or degrading, nor does it rise to the level that it is cruel and unusual treatment. The treatment that the claimant describes is not premeditated, applied for hours at a stretch and causing, if not bodily injury, intense physical and mental suffering. Degrading treatment has been described as arousing in its victims\nfeelings of fear, anguish and inferiority, capable of humiliating and debasing them and possibly breaking their physical and moral resistance.13\nI find that the treatment feared by the claimant is not cruel and unusual treatment because it is not so excessive as to outrage standards of decency and surpass all rational bounds of punishment. The test is one of proportionality: Is the punishment grossly disproportionate to the inherent seriousness of the offence?14 Is the punishment so demeaning that all human dignity is lost?15\nI find that the punishment alleged by the claimant is not cruel and unusual. Is it torture? Torture is distinguishable from other forms of harm on the basis of the severity of the pain or suffering inflicted. Torture constitutes an aggravated and deliberate of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\nThe term \"torture\" is reserved for deliberate treatment causing particularly cruel suffering, namely, acts by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted.16 I find that the severity of the pain or suffering inflicted does not constitute torture.\nCONCLUSION\nWhether the claim is framed under the Convention refugee sections of the Act or the risk of torture or the risk to life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, the outcome is the same. There is no evidentiary basis for the claim under IRPA.\nFor the reasons given, and upon consideration of the whole of the evidence, the Refugee Protection Division determines that XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX is neither a Convention refugee as defined in section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act nor a person in need of protection as defined in section 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. For these reasons, his claim is rejected.\n\"Paulah Dauns\"\nPaulah Dauns\nMarch 10, 2004\nDate\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - MILITARY SERVICE - DESERTERS - CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION - PERSECUTION - PROSECUTION - DISCRIMINATION - HARASSMENT - MALE - NEGATIVE - USA\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibit 2.2, Armed Forces Identity Card, issued XXXXX, 2001, after claimant advanced to the E-5 status: petty officer, second class.\n3 Exhibit 2.1.\n4 Exhibit 2.1.\n5 R. v.

She claims she has a well-founded fear of persecution based on political opinion and membership in a particular social group. She also fears a risk to her life, a risk of cruel and unusual punishment or treatment, and a danger of torture. Specifically, the claimant, who worked for a major family planning office for 20 years, fears beatings, arrest, false charges, detention and possible death because she convinced the daughter-in-law of a prominent person to have an abortion.\nThe Minister's Representative argues the claimant should be excluded under section 98 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (Act)1 and Article 1F(a) and (c) of the Refugee Convention because of her participation in forced abortion in furtherance of family planning goals.\nThe issues in this case are whether the claimant should be excluded under section 98 of the Act and, if not, whether the claimant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection under sections 96 or 97 of the Act.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant worked for the XXXXXXXXX Company from 1978 to 2000 and, from 1980 to 2000, she was the office manager of family planning. According to the claimant, under the family planning laws, with a few exceptions, women were not allowed to have more than one child. The claimant said, prior to 1985, several women at the XXXXXXXX Company had extra births. The company faced significant fines for those extra births. However, the claimant says, beginning in 1985, she was able to offer more incentives and, from 1985 to 2000, there were no out-of-plan births at the XXXXXX company. The company employed approximately 8000 people. When the claimant left the company there were approximately 3800 female employees. The claimant was in charge of the enforcement of the family planning regulations for all these women. She had ten assistants who reported to her.\nThe claimant said, starting in 1985, every woman at the XXXXX company who became pregnant contrary to the family planning regulations agreed to an abortion. Almost always this occurred within the first three months of the pregnancy. The claimant says she never \"forced\" any woman to have an abortion; rather she used arguments, education and financial incentives. She said personally she did not agree with the strict one-child-policy and felt women should have a right to have children. However, she recognized that overpopulation was a problem in China that affected the social economy. She said she was just following orders, as family planning was the only way to limit the problems of overpopulation.\nIn May 2000, the claimant discovered that XXXXXXXXX, the daughter-in-law of the general manager of the XXXXX company, was six months pregnant. XXXXXXX already had a daughter and was not entitled to have another child, but she and her husband wanted to have a son. XXXXXXXX had stayed home from work on sick leave for two months to avoid detection. The claimant said no one at the XXXXX company had previously managed to remain pregnant for so long without detection. Once the claimant discovered XXXXXX was pregnant, she visited her at home every other day for three to six hours at a time to try and persuade her to have an abortion. Her assistant, XXXXXXX, accompanied her on most visits because the claimant says it was easier when there was a second person there. After about a month, the claimant persuaded XXXXXX to have an abortion and the abortion was performed when XXXXXXX was about seven months pregnant. The claimant went to the hospital with XXXXXXXX for the abortion. It was determined the child would have been a male. The claimant said she saw the aborted fetus and it was fully-formed. The claimant says she later found out XXXXXXXXX father-in-law, the general manager of the XXXX company, was getting a false medical certificate that would have allowed his daughter-in-law to have the second child, but he did not get that document in time to prevent the abortion. The claimant never saw that document, nor was she aware of it at the time of the abortion.\nThe claimant says she suffered significant consequences for persuading XXXXXXXX to have an abortion. The windows at her house were broken. She was badly beaten on several occasions. The police would do nothing to help her. She was dismissed from work. She was forced to put her fingerprints on an anti-Communist poster. The PSB (Public Security Bureau) were pursuing her. She complained to the City and Provincial Family Planning authorities and the People's Complaints Department, but they would not assist her. Finally, the claimant paid an agent to leave China and come to Canada. Since she has been in Canada, she has discovered the PSB want to question her about charges that she was embezzling public funds. The claimant says these are false charges. The claimant fears continued physical attacks and no police protection, arrest, detention and imprisonment on false charges if she returns to China.\nDETERMINATION\nI find the claimant is excluded by virtue of section 98 of the Act and Article 1 F(a) of the Refugee Convention, as I find there are serious reasons for considering that she committed a crime against humanity. In the alternative, I find the claimant is not a Convention refugee and is not a person in need of protection, as I do not accept her story of alleged persecution or serious harm. I find she has not rebutted the presumption of state protection.\nANALYSIS - EXCLUSION\nForced abortion\nI find the claimant \"forced\" XXXXXXX to have an abortion by relentless and extreme psychological pressure and threats. The claimant admits she put considerable pressure on XXXX XXXXX to have an abortion, but she says she did not \"force\" her to have the abortion. She said she did not take XXXXXX to the hospital until she agreed, and she would not have allowed the abortion to proceed if XXXXXX had changed her mind.\nThe Minister's Representative says the claimant forced XXXXXXX to have an abortion through the extreme psychological pressure she placed on her for a month. The Minister's Representative also says the claimant admitted in her interview with an Immigration Officer that she forced women to have abortions and sterilizations.\nThe claimant entered Canada on XXXXX, 2001, and made her refugee claim in October 2001. The Declaration of the Immigration Officer who interviewed the claimant on October 18, 2001, using a certified Mandarin interpreter, indicates the claimant provided background information; she said she was \"very serious in carrying out her duties and had done a lot of enforcing, e.g. forced abortions and sterilization\"; the worst case was in August 2000 when she \"forced\" the daughter-in-law of the general manager of the XXXXX company to have an abortion when she was seven months pregnant; and she then suffered significant consequences for her role in that abortion including being beaten up by four men and receiving serious wounds, all her windows were broken, she was threatened by the woman's husband, she was suspended from her job, and her husband was suspended from his work at the same employer.2\nThe Declaration of the Immigration Officer is dated January 9, 2002 - although it concerns an interview on October 18, 2001. It is not a document made under oath. It is not obvious from the face of the Declaration how this information was recorded at the interview and how the accuracy of the information was checked when the Declaration was signed in January 2002. However, the Declaration has much information that is accurate and, generally, I accept that the information set out in the Declaration is a reasonably accurate reflection of the information provided by the claimant at the interview on October 18, 2001. That information contains two clear references to forcing women to have abortions. At one point in the hearing, the claimant denied she said that at the interview. Later, when asked by her counsel if she recalled what she said at the interview or just what is true, the claimant said she is not quite sure. Thus, not surprisingly, she does not remember exactly what she said at the interview on October 18, 2001. However, she says she told the truth to the Immigration Officer and it is not true that she forced any women to have abortions.\nI have considered whether the words \"forced\" and \"pressured\" (or \"convinced\" or a similar word) could have been used interchangeably, either by the claimant or by the interpreter or in the Immigration Officer's record of the interview. However, the interpreter, Mr. XXXXX XXXXX, has interpreted at many Refugee hearings and I am confident he would appreciate the significant difference between those two words in this context. I am also satisfied an Immigration Officer would appreciate the difference between the words \"forced\" and \"pressured\" in this context. Thus, on a balance of probabilities, I do not think that either the interpreter or the Immigration Officer would casually or mistakenly use the word \"forced\" if the claimant had said \"pressured\", or some similar word. Therefore, I am satisfied the claimant said she \"forced\" women to have abortions. However, I do not necessarily conclude that the claimant meant she physically dragged women off to have abortions without any indication from them that they agreed to the process. She seems to have meant \"forced\" in the sense that she put such extreme pressure on them that they \"agreed\" to an abortion that they would not otherwise have agreed to. The claimant had the position and authority to apply this pressure effectively. I find this use of the word \"forced\" in the interview would reflect the claimant's perspective on the process - these were not situations where women freely consented to an abortion, but rather situations where women were forced to consent. That also would be consistent with current country documentation that indicates, increasingly, family planning officials, and especially those in urban areas, are not physically dragging women off to have abortions against their will, but are using a range of incentives, disincentives, psychological pressure and threats to achieve their family planning goals.3 Counsel referred to this as the modern approach to family planning in China.\nAt the hearing the claimant says she never \"forced\" any women to have an abortion. However, she admits she knew XXXXXXXX was six to seven months pregnant, she and a co-worker visited her every other day at home, and they stayed for three to six hours each time to try and persuade XXXXX to have an abortion. She told XXXX if she did not have an abortion she and her husband would lose their jobs at the XXXX company - which were well-paid jobs, they would lose their house, they would be fined, they would not be able to register their second child in their Household Registration - which would mean the child would not have the usual rights to education, and XXXXXXX would be arrested. The claimant says all these threats were true, except the last one, but she added it toward the end to put additional pressure on XXXXXX to have the abortion, even though the claimant knew XXXXXXXX would not be arrested if she did not have an abortion. The claimant says she added this threat because timing was becoming very critical, as XXXXXXXX would soon get to the point where it would be too late for an abortion. Hence, the claimant and her co-worker increased their contact with XXXXXXXXX and the pressure they put on her to have an abortion. The claimant says she and XXXXXXX were at XXXXXXXX house for six hours on the final day before XXXXXX finally \"agreed\" to the abortion. The claimant immediately took her to the hospital and the abortion was performed the same day. XXXXXXXXX husband had been at home at the start of that day when the claimant arrived, but he had gone to work. He opposed the abortion, and the claimant speculated that when he went to work he was confident his wife would not consent to the abortion. The claimant did not contact him once XXXXXXX \"agreed\" to the abortion. She says she asked XXXXXXX but she did not want to contact her husband.\nI find, when the claimant now says she never \"forced\" any woman to have an abortion, she is using it in a more limited sense than she did at her initial interview. The claimant now means she never physically dragged a woman to the hospital for an abortion. However, I find the extreme pressure exerted on this woman to have an abortion when seven months pregnant amounted to \"force\". The claimant lied to XXXXXXXXXX about being arrested in order to pressure her. The claimant was clearly an older and experienced person in a position of authority, and XXXXXXXXXX would not have known the claimant was lying about the threat of arrest and loss of liberty. After a full month of extreme and unrelenting pressure and threats at her home from two women, XXXXXXXXXX finally \"agreed\" to go with the claimant to have an abortion. The claimant said she had visited XXXXXXXXXX at least fifteen times.\nThe claimant's threats amounted to taking away the livelihood of the family, imposing fines they would not be able to pay, forcing them out of their home, removing the claimant's liberty, and saying the child would not be registered. I find, given the claimant's position and authority, and the relentless pressure she put on this woman, the claimant \"forced\" XXXXXXXXXX to have the abortion, in the sense that, on the last day, XXXXXXXXXX was under such duress that she felt she had no choice but to agree to the abortion. The claimant says she used arguments and incentives to get women to agree to abortions. However, she made no mention of incentives, in the sense of additional benefits, in this case. Rather, everything was a threat to remove what XXXXXXXXXX already had and threats that the child would not be entitled to normal education and social benefits. I find these threats were not incentives, as they did not offer any additional benefits. Rather, they were serious threats to her physical and economic well-being. Most of these threats were real, in that these consequences could and likely would occur if she had the baby. I find this left her virtually no choice about having an abortion. When the claimant added the threat of arrest, it appears XXXXXXXXXX finally realized she had no choice. It was the abortion or her liberty. She would not even call her husband before going for the abortion, even though they obviously had decided together to have this baby. The claimant added the final, improper, threat for exactly that reason - to force XXXXXXXXXX to agree to an abortion. There was no other purpose for that additional threat.\nBased on this information and the above analysis, I find the claimant \"forced\" this woman to have an abortion. I also find, on a balance of probabilities, she forced other women to have abortions as well. She said this at her interview with the Immigration Officer. When she now says she did not \"force\" any women to have an abortion, she means she did not drag them off for an abortion. However, I find, at the time of the interview she was using the word \"forced\" in the same way I am here - to include situations when a woman \"agrees\" to an abortion after extreme, unrelenting psychological pressure and threats.\nCrime Against Humanity - Law\nCounsel for the claimant made oral and written submissions on this issue. Counsel argued that forced abortion is not a crime against humanity and cited the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Finta:4\n... for example, robbery without the additional component of barbarous cruelty is not a crime against humanity... To convict someone of an offence when it has not been established beyond a reasonable doubt that he or she was aware of conditions that would bring to his or her actions that requisite added dimension of cruelty and barbarism violates the principles of fundamental justice (para. 227, emphasis added).5\nCounsel also argued, while the Federal Court decision in Cheung6 found forced sterilization constitutes persecution for the purposes of protection, that is not authority for the proposition that forced abortion or sterilization is a crime against humanity under article 1F(a) of the Refugee Convention. Counsel also said the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Chan7 said there is no persecutory intent on the part of the Chinese government in their one-child-policy; rather, it is necessary to examine the method of enforcement of that policy to ascertain whether there is persecution. Counsel argued that because the activities of the Chinese birth control committees were not intended to have a persecutory intent, they cannot amount to an intentional act of \"barbarous cruelty\" that is required to make them crimes against humanity under Article 1F(a).8\nThe Minister's Representative said victims of forced abortions are recognized as Convention refugees in Canada, pursuant to Federal Court decisions, and the Act cannot be used to protect both victims and perpetrators. The Minister's Representative also said forced abortion is an inhumane act that causes great pain and suffering.\nThe relevant part of Article 1F(a) of the Refugee Convention, as set out in the Schedule to the Act is as follows:\nF. The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:\n(a) he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes;\nClear authority on this issue is found in the Federal Court decision in Yang.9 There, the CRDD (Convention Refugee Determination Division) found there were serious reasons for considering that the claimant had committed a crime against humanity, and thus was excluded from the definition of a refugee by Article 1(F)(a) of the Refugee Convention. This was based on the claimant's participation in the enforcement of China's family planning policies through forced abortions and sterilizations. In dismissing the judicial review of the CRDD decision Evans J. stated:\nThere is no doubt that a person who is a willing participant in a forced sterilization or abortion cannot be a refugee by virtue of article 1F(a).\nMr. Justice Linden in the Federal Court decision in Cheung10 found that forced sterilization constitutes persecution, and is in clear violation of human rights:\n... the forced sterilization of women is a fundamental violation of basic human rights. It violates Articles 3 and 5 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and is a serious and totally unacceptable violation of her security of the person ... forced sterilization subjects a woman to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment ... there are few practices that could be more intrusive and more brutal than forced sterilization ... I have no doubt, then, that the threat of forced sterilization can ground a fear of persecution within the meaning of Convention refugee under the Immigration Act.\nEarlier in the decision, Linden J. A. referred to \"forced or strongly coerced sterilization\". I interpret that to mean he equated the two in his decision. I find the statements made by Mr. Justice Linden in Cheung about forced sterilization apply equally to forced or strongly coerced abortion.\nBased on the decisions in Yang and Cheung, I find that forced abortion is a crime against humanity for the purposes of Article 1F(a) of the Refugee Convention. I am satisfied that the test for a crime against humanity is an act of barbarous cruelty that shocks the conscience. I find that forced abortion involves barbarous cruelty and is contrary to human dignity, and constitutes a crime against humanity, even if committed against only one person.\nCrime Against Humanity - Analysis of this case\nI find there are serious reasons for considering the claimant committed a crime against humanity - both in regard to the forced abortion of XXXXXXXXXX and the forced abortions of other women at the XXXX company. These forced abortions were carried out in pursuance of a policy that had widespread and systematic application in China for many years and was targeted at women. I find the claimant's role in implementing the family planning regulations in this way is a serious reason for considering she committed a crime against humanity. She put such extreme pressure on XXXXXXXXXX that, when was seven months pregnant, she went along with the claimant to have an abortion, even though she had been clearly and resolutely opposed to the abortion.\nI find the claimant has no defence to her involvement in this crime. The claimant had been nominated for this position by her leader at the XXXX company as she was a good worker. She said it was not a promotion, although she said she received more pay. Previously, she had been a purchasing clerk at the XXXXX company, and this job was the office manager of family planning with ten assistants reporting to her. Clearly it was a promotion that she accepted.\nThe claimant remained in the position for twenty years. She said she was good at her work and enjoyed it. She won several awards for her \"outstanding achievement\".11 She said her boss liked having her in this position. From 1985 to 2000 she had complete success with no out-of-plan births. Clearly she was very good at this job and applied herself to it conscientiously and energetically.\nThe claimant says she did not agree with the strict enforcement of the one-child-policy, but she was just doing her job, as it was her duty. She said she could not leave the job because her boss wanted her to be there and it was not possible to just transfer or quit. At one point she said she could not quit because of her pension. The claimant said sometimes her assistants would not do very well in their position and would be transferred to another department. I do not accept that the claimant could not have left the job much earlier if she strongly disagreed with putting extreme pressure on women to have abortions and sterilizations. Like some of her assistants, if she had not done a good job, her boss likely would have transferred her elsewhere. I do not accept that she could not have quit and looked for other work if she was really opposed to the strict enforcement of the one-child-policy. This was a good paying job with much authority. The claimant took a lot of pride in her work. Clearly, she had no intention of leaving that job until she says she was forced to leave. She may not have been able to get another job with as much authority or remuneration, but that is no defence to remaining in this job for so long if she was actually opposed to some of the enforcement activities. Moreover, not only did she not leave the position, but she continuously engaged for many years in strong pressure tactics that clearly had effective results in the enforcement of this policy.\nThe family planning office was involved in matters other than abortions and sterilizations. The claimant said she was responsible for the health of all the women who worked at the XXXXX company, and this included regular checkups for various potential health problems. As well, many family planning activities did not involve abortions or sterilizations, but counselling and provision of birth control assistance. However, I find the claimant actively participated in forced abortions - both with XXXXXXXXXX and with other women. This is how the claimant achieved a perfect record of no out-of-plan births for fifteen years.\nCounsel for the claimant said that exclusion does not apply in this case because the Minister has not established the requisite mens rea to find the claimant has committed a crime against humanity. I find there is no real issue of mens rea here. The claimant directed this department and was fully aware of all its activities. She was clearly involved in the abortion of this woman and other abortions. She said she went to the hospital with all women who were having abortions. In the matter of XXXXXXX, the claimant was the one who applied the extreme and relentless pressure for a month. The claimant made threats, including the threat of jail. The claimant took XXXXXXXXXX to the hospital for the abortion and waited for it to be done. The claimant ensured it was performed as she saw the aborted fetus. Thus, while the claimant did not actually perform the abortion, she was a knowing and wilful participant in the process. She clearly was complicit. Her actions for the whole month were directed toward one end - an abortion. There was no other purpose to those actions. She ensured it was carried out. I find she clearly participated directly, knowingly and wilfully in this forced abortion.\nWith respect to counsel's argument about no persecutory intent, the Supreme Court of Canada in Chan said China's one-child-policy in itself has no persecutory intent. The Court did say methods of enforcement could be persecution. That is what happened here. The claimant was involved in enforcement of the policy and the methods she used were clearly intended to force women to have abortions. I agree she did not do this for the purpose of being cruel. She was doing it to enforce the one-child-policy. However, I find that acting for a valid political or social goal is not a defence for people who commit, or are complicit in the commission of, acts of barbarous cruelty or serious violations of human rights in pursuing those goals.\nIn conclusion on this issue, I find that forcing a woman to have an abortion is a crime against humanity and the claimant forced XXXXX, and others, to have an abortion. I find her participation was direct, knowing and wilful. Therefore I find there are serious reasons for considering the claimant committed a crime against humanity. Therefore, I find she is excluded by section 98 of the Act and Article 1(F)(a) of the Refugee Convention.\nANALYSIS - INCLUSION\nI am satisfied the claimant suffered some consequences after forcing XXXXXXXXXX to have an abortion. There are country reports that indicate that people involved in the harsh enforcement of the family planning regulations have experienced backlash from people whom they have persecuted.12 However, I do not accept the claimant's evidence about the extent of the consequences she faced or may face in the future. I find her evidence lacked credibility on some of these matters.\nThere are several problems with the claimant's story of serious persecution after XXXXXXXXXX had the abortion. First, I find she is unable to provide a satisfactory explanation as to why the general manager would have such a change of attitude toward her. The claimant had a very good relationship with her employer for at least twenty years. She had been promoted into her position in 1980, and since 1985 had maintained a perfect record of no out-of-plan births. She felt she could not leave this position because her employer wanted her in this position as she performed it so well. In this case the claimant was doing exactly what she had been doing for the past 15 years - successfully \"convincing\" women to have abortions. XXXXXXXXXX was not permitted to have another child. The claimant performed her job and \"convinced\" XXXXXXXXXX to have an abortion. Yet, for some reason, her employer suddenly turned on her.\nWhen asked why, if she did not \"force\" XXXXXXXXXX to have an abortion, her father-in-law would turn on the claimant, the claimant said she did not know. However, she said he was very powerful and used his connections to have the PSB refuse to assist her and pursue her on false charges, and to have the City and Provincial Family Planning offices and the People's Complaints Department also refuse to assist her when she made complaints about being persecuted.\nI can understand why XXXXXX husband may have been angry and may have caused trouble for the claimant after the abortion, although the claimant said she and XXXXXXXXXX continued to get along fine after the abortion. However, the father of this potential son may have realized the claimant had \"forced\" his wife to have an abortion and he wanted some revenge. But that does not explain why the claimant's employer also turned on her and why the police would take no action in response to these alleged assaults on her and her property and instead would participate in pursing the claimant on false charges.\nThe claimant thinks the general manager of the XXXX company turned on her because she convinced his daughter-in-law to have an abortion. However, the general manager would have been well aware of the success of the claimant's pressure tactics, but there is no evidence he interfered in any way with the claimant's activities during that month. If the general manager was so powerful that he could subsequently have the claimant fired and use his influence to cause the PSB to investigate her on false charges and cause the City and Provincial Family Planning Offices to abandon her, it seems likely he also would have had the power to stop the claimant from exerting such extreme pressure on his daughter-in-law to have an abortion. I find it is not plausible that the general manager would do nothing in the circumstances until after the abortion, and then be able to exert such wide influence, including on organizations outside the XXXX company, in a personal vendetta against the claimant.\nI also find it is not plausible, on a balance of probabilities, that the family planning authorities in the City and Province would just abandon the claimant, after 20 years of good performance, for performing her job on this occasion.\nThe claimant says she later learned the general manager was getting a medical certificate that would allow his daughter-in-law to have a second child. That medical certificate would have falsely indicated the first child was not normal, as in that situation the couple would be permitted to have a second child. I find it is not plausible the general manager would take steps to get a false medical certificate, and yet apparently make no effort over the period of a month to try and restrain the claimant in the performance of her duties. Also, it is not clear why the general manager would wait so long to get a false medical certificate if he was trying to prevent an abortion. Finally, it is not clear why XXXXXXXXXX would consent to the abortion if she knew her father-in-law was getting a false medical certificate. I find the story about this false medical certificate does not stand up to analysis. On a balance of probabilities, I find this part of the claimant's story is not plausible and hence not credible.\nCounsel suggested, that in pursuing the claimant so vigorously, the general manager was really trying to protect himself and deflect any investigation of the out-of-plan pregnancy away from him to the claimant. Counsel suggested the general manager was trying to cover up the fact he had obtained a false medical certificate, so he put the attention on the claimant. I find this is mere speculation. The claimant did not put forward this theory in her evidence, even though counsel asked her a clear, and leading, question about it. I have already found the story about the false medical certificate is not credible, so a key factual component of counsel's theory is missing. Further, since the general manager never produced the false medical certificate and the abortion proceeded, it is not clear why he had to deflect attention from himself in any investigation. On a balance of probabilities, I find this theory is speculative and not supported by the evidence. It does not provide a reasonable explanation for why the general manager would try to cause the claimant so much harm for doing her job.\nThe claimant also relies on a letter from her assistant, XXXXXXX, to show that she is being framed and persecuted for doing her job.13 There is a significant problem with this letter. In the letter, XXXXXX says she was demoted to a cleaning position, and then provides information about the investigation into the claimant's case and the actions of the general manager, his son and the PSB. XXXXXX is very critical of these people and very supportive of the claimant. Amazingly, the letter from XXXXXX was sent by airmail in an envelope that shows the XXXXXXXX Company and XXXXX for the return address. If this letter had been intercepted or returned for any reason and opened by someone at the XXXX company or at the PSB, where the general manager is alleged to have strong connections, XXXXXX would have put herself at great risk. I find it is not credible that XXXXXXX would make such strong accusations in a letter, and then send it in an envelope with her name and the XXXX company name on the outside of the envelope, if the general manager of the company and the PSB were involved in serious retaliation or persecution against the claimant. Thus, I find, on a balance of probabilities, the fact that XXXXXXX felt safe enough to send this letter as she did indicates the general manager and PSB are not pursuing the claimant.\nThe claimant relies on a number of other documents to support her claim of persecution. However, since I find her basic story of persecution by the general manager and the PSB is not plausible, I put little weight on most of these documents. As with XXXXXXX letter, I find the claimant is able to get unreliable supporting documentation. This includes two Writs of Summons - which are very general and do not set out any alleged offence,14 the letters from her husband - who is clearly an interested person,15 the two Approvals for Disciplinary Action at her former employment - both of which merely indicate the firings are for absence from work,16 and another Writ of Summons - which also is very general and does not set out any alleged offence.17 The claimant also provided medical records that indicate she had been struck and wounded and received continuing medical treatment.18 I think it is possible that XXXXXXXX husband could have retaliated against the claimant and had some people attack her. This is consistent with country documentation that indicates recently, in some instances, people who have been enforcing family planning regulations through forced abortions and sterilizations have experienced significant backlash from the recipients of that enforcement. However, even if XXXXXXXX husband did retaliate against the claimant, I find that by itself is not persecution or serious harm for the purposes of section 96 or 97 of the Act. Rather, it is criminal activity by an individual. That raises the issue of state protection.\nI find the claimant has not presented clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption of state protection. I am not satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the PSB are improperly pursuing the claimant. She says the PSB did not deal with her complaints of being assaulted and they are pursuing her on false charges. However, in her statement to the Immigration Officer, provided on October 18, 2001, the claimant made no mention of her problems with the PSB, nor to signing an anti-government poster, nor to a Summons, nor to the need to go into hiding.19 All of that information was added later in her Personal Information Form. The claimant is a very intelligent, articulate woman who gave her evidence freely and in great detail at the hearing. The fact that her statement to the Immigration Officer referred only to problems with private individuals, and not to problems with the PSB, casts serious doubt on her story of persecution by the PSB. That is a crucial omission, because if the claimant was having problems with only private individuals, she would need to explain why she had not sought protection from the authorities or the police. Only later did she add this important aspect of her story. Her counsel said the main purpose of the immigration interview was to ascertain how she got to Canada. Thus, he says it would have been out of place for the claimant to talk at length about her persecution in China. However, I find the claimant did provide details about her persecution in China. In her PIF she indicated that when she received the summons from the PSB, she went into hiding and took steps to leave China. Thus, the involvement of the PSB was apparently critical to her decision to leave China, yet she made no reference to that in her interview with the Immigration Officer.\nI find the claimant has failed to provide sufficient credible evidence to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the public authorities or PSB are pursuing her. As a result, even if some people were causing trouble for the claimant, I find these were the actions of private individuals. The country documentation about China indicates it has a functioning police force. I find the claimant has failed to provide clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption of state protection.\nSur Place\nCounsel also argues the claimant has been placed at risk by the inquiries made at the claimant's former workplace in China by CIC during this hearing.20 However, since I do not accept the claimant's story that she is being persecuted by her employer with the cooperation of the PSB, I find these inquiries did not increase her risk.\nCONCLUSION\nI find there are serious reasons for considering the claimant has committed a crime against humanity contrary to Article 1F(a) of the Refugee Convention. Therefore, pursuant to section 98 of the Act, I find XXXXXXX is not a Convention refugee and is not a person in need of protection.\nIn the alternative, I find the claimant has failed to produce sufficient credible evidence to show there is a real possibility she faces persecution on any Convention ground, or a risk to her life, or a risk of cruel and unusual punishment or treatment, or a danger of torture if she returns to China. She has failed to produce clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption of state protection. Therefore, I find XXXXXXX is not a Convention refugee and is not a person in need of protection under sections 96 or 97 of the Act.\n\"Thomas H. Kemsley\"\nThomas H.

His father was murdered on XXXXX, 1998 by his own uncle's adopted son, XXXXX (spelled XXXXX in the PIF), who was a member of the GIA and is currently in prison serving a 25 year term for the crime. The claimant's cousin, XXXXXXXX, was born in the same place in Algeria as the claimant, just a year earlier, but like the whole paternal side of the claimant's family, he resides in France, using a different official spelling of the surname. They acquired French nationality in XXXXX 1981.2 XXXXX forwarded identity documents for the claimant while he was in detention in Canada for six weeks pending the determination by Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) of his eligibility and investigation of security concerns.\nThe family lived on XXXXX in the borough of XXXXX, in the province or XXXXX of XXXXX, about XXXXX km. east of the city of XXXXX. After the claimant graduated with a degree in XXXXX from the University of Algiers at XXXXX in the city of Algiers, he took a XXXXX job in Libya to avoid compulsory military service. He had obtained a passport earlier in 1991 and had several more days left on his student deferral and thus was able to leave the country legally. With great reluctance, according to the PIF, he went back to Algeria in XXXXX 1996 when the Libyan government advised him his services were no longer required and his visa would not be renewed.\nUpon his return the claimant discovered a civil war was raging in which young men were being arbitrarily conscripted for both the army and for local militia groups, \"Auto Defense,\" organized by the government. He took safety precautions but decided to apply for post-graduate study abroad. His cousin in France, XXXXX, had promised to lend him the money. He was accepted by a university in Ukraine and left Algeria in XXXXX 1996 to get visas in Tunisia. This time he had to bribe an acquaintance in the border police in order to depart, since he had not served in the military.\nUpon arrival in Poland, however, he learned that XXXXX could not immediately provide the expected level of financial support and was disdainful of study in Ukraine, and the claimant considered that he would have to spend the first year just learning the language. So instead of going to Ukraine he decided to travel to Switzerland and make a refugee claim. According to his oral testimony, he took a taxi on the way to Switzerland and easily crossed the border into Germany. But the taxi driver thought he was a Turk and drove him straight to a police station where he was detained. After being fingerprinted and photographed and his passport seized, the claimant told his story and found out that it would not be possible to make a claim in Switzerland. According to the PIF, he was offered the choice of making a claim in either Germany or Poland, but the German police recommended the latter because it was easier and quicker. His oral evidence is that the German police explained that since he arrived through Poland he had to be returned there to make his refugee claim. Two days later he was escorted back to Poland and, although the German police handed over his file, he was put in jail and Polish officials said they knew nothing about a claim in Germany. He was given the choice of waiting for two months while the information was verified or agreeing to deportation to Tunisia. He chose the latter and arrived in Tunisia in XXXXX 1997.\nThe claimant's father persuaded the claimant to return to help on the family XXXXX with the promise to ask for an exemption for him from military service in light of the fact that his brother XXXXX had been conscripted. The GIA was known to be active in the area but XXXXX XXXXX was relatively calm. One night about six months after his arrival, a group of GIA members, including XXXXX, came to visit his father. They asked the claimant where he had been for the past seven years and he told them about Libya. While in the PIF he says merely that they were impressed, according to his oral evidence the GIA accused him of indoctrinating people with Occidental ideas and being un-Islamic and the claimant countered with a philosophy lesson about the life and death of a state and cast the GIA in a flattering light. He understood that the XXXXX was a place they came to from time to time for relaxation.\nFollowing that encounter, the claimant was asked on two occasions to courier envelopes between the XXXXX and XXXXX, and felt he had no choice but to cooperate. His father explained that they were forced to assist this way in lieu of paying the GIA taxes, \"Zaket.\" As a solution, his father agreed to move into the town of XXXXX XXXXX because the GIA would not come there. However, in order to buy another house, the claimant's father needed to call in a loan he had made to XXXXX. When he was unsuccessful he threatened to go to the police, according to the PIF. On XXXXX, 1998 XXXXX came to the XXXXX and struck and killed his father with an axe. The police came and arrested him, and at the funeral, the closest Auto Defense group promised to protect the family's home and XXXXX.\nAbout a year later, the GIA came to see the claimant and their Emir told him they were looking for new followers. Because he had been in Libya they had confidence in him and it was also important to recruit him as a Berber. He pretended to agree with them but said he would need time to get some money together for his mother's support and then he would join them. One GIA member pointed a rifle and bayonet at him, but the Emir intervened and asked for whatever money he had. The claimant gave them some XXXXX dinars. Before the men left, according to the PIF, they said he had better not be deceiving them. He testified that they said, prepare for the next time.\nOver the next two weeks the claimant sold all the XXXXX and XXXXX and left for Algiers. He spent a couple of weeks there and moved on to XXXXX, a calm part of Algeria near the XXXXX border, where he knew somebody with a XXXXX. But he stayed there for only a month because in early XXXXX 1999 there were two incidents, one in which the police killed terrorists and another in which terrorists killed people.\nSo he left Algeria again and stayed in Tunisia until XXXXX 1999 when he traveled to Thailand, since it was easy to get a visa. He made one attempt to come to Canada in XXXXX 2000 but was intercepted at the airport in Beijing when his document was found not to be genuine and he was told to leave China. He made a refugee claim at the UNHCR in Thailand in XXXXX 2001 and waited almost a year but before he had received a decision he tried to come to Canada once more. This time he succeeded with the use of a false Dutch passport in the name of XXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX but destroyed it on the plane. He made a refugee claim at the Vancouver airport on December 24, 2001.\nISSUES\nThe issues identified in this claim included: personal identity; credibility; subjective basis; previous claims elsewhere in Germany\/Poland and at the UNHCR in Thailand; re-availment in 1996 and 1997; objective basis; state protection; and Internal Flight Alternative (IFA).\nAccording to the PIF, the claim is based on the Convention ground of political opinion, under Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).3 Counsel argued that, in the alternative, the claim is based on the consolidated grounds under Section 97 as a person in need of protection.\nFor his part the claimant clarified that he does not face persecution on account of his Berber ethnicity and he is no longer liable for military service in Algeria owing to a new law that was passed - evidently a reference to the clemency or regularization granted to men over age 27 beginning in XXXXX 1999 (just when he left the country).4\nANALYSIS\nPersonal Identity\nThe Refugee Protection Division finds the claimant has failed to provide sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish that XXXXX XXXXX is his true personal identity.\nIn part this is because the reliability of all of the claimant's identity evidence is tainted by the fact that he alleges a history of falsifying documents to enter and leave countries, including the use of false passports on two separate attempts to enter Canada illegally. He boasted that the German police were impressed by the ease with which he breached border security in that country. In order to bolster his misrepresentation of himself as XXXXXXX XXXXXXX, the holder of the Dutch passport he used in XXXXX 2001, the claimant says he made fake entries in the address book and wrote travelogues in the notebook found in his possession upon arrival.5\nThe claimant has provided a few original documents to corroborate his identity as XXXXX XXXXX, such as three versions of an Algerian birth certificate (two in French, one in Arabic) and two Information Sheets, the latter bearing identical photographs. But as the forensic analyst at CIC observed, these particular documents lack security features.6 Moreover, they were sent from France, not Algeria, by the claimant's putative cousin, XXXXX XXXXX, with no explanation as to how they were obtained or by whom.7\nThe President of the University of Algiers sent a copy of XXXXX XXXXX \"Interim Graduation Diploma\" issued XXXXX, 1992,8 directly to Canada's mission in Algiers with a covering letter confirming its authenticity.9 Having received these documents, CIC apparently only needed to have the cousin in France provide the corresponding original student card (as had been offered) in order to release the claimant from detention.10 However, the card was not translated until the hearing, and the Refugee Protection Division notes that it is in the name of XXXXX XXXXX (spelled the same way as the paternal family in France which was the result of an official change of name when the claimant's uncle served under the flag of France during the Algerian war).11 Moreover, the translation indicates this card was issued by the University of XXXXX, not the University of Algiers.12\nPhotocopies of various other identity documents have been provided, such as a partial copy (six out of twenty-eight pages) of XXXXX XXXXX expired Algerian passport issued XXXXX, 1991. This document shows two Libyan residence visas, for 1994 and 1995. The claimant's brother XXXXX in Algeria is identified as the sender of copies of two Libyan records of employment for XXXXX XXXXX.13 The problem is that only one of these documents, pertaining to the academic years 1991\/92 and for 1992\/93, lists the same passport number as on partial passport itself XXXXX. The other, for the period covering the next three academic years, XXXXX 1993 to XXXXX, 1996 indicates a different passport number (XXXXX). This turns out to be the number the claimant gives in the PIF for an Algerian passport he did not even obtain until XXXXX, 1996.\nIn her oral Observations the Refugee Protection Officer (RPO) noted that there are two documents which taken together indicate on their face that the claimant was living in Algeria during the time of the alleged murder of his father, in XXXXX 1998, and the visit a year later by the GIA when they tried to forcibly recruit him and asked for money. One is a medical certificate of good health issued at XXXXX on XXXXX, 1998, according to the translation of the date by the hearing interpreter,14 and a validation of his Libyan Driver's License. The claimant testified that he obtained the medical certificate in order to apply for an Algerian driver's license (supposedly that's why the photograph is attached), and in order to expedite the process he got the Libyan Embassy in Algiers to issue him the Validation of Libyan Driver's License, on XXXXX, 1998.15 These documents could have been probative evidence of his residence there if the claimant had actually obtained a new driver's license in Algeria, since he listed this type of identity document as one of the most important to prove identity in every day life in Algeria. However, he testified that he stopped the application process because he found out that financially it was not easy to buy a car. That is a dubious answer but, in any event, there is no Algerian driver's license, and as a result, the Refugee Protection Division can give little weight to the only two documents issued to the claimant between XXXXX 1997 when he allegedly arrived back from Europe and XXXXX 1999 when he left for Asia. It is also worth noting that this photograph shows the subject clean shaven although the claimant testified that he wore a moustache during this period (in contrast to the members of the GIA who had full beards).\nWhat is also questionable about the assortment of documents provided is how they could have been so readily available if, as the claimant testified, his mother told him while he was in Algiers, that all the contents of their home on the XXXXX had been destroyed and burned -- and \"they\" had left word on the walls that they would find him.\nThe other two key identity documents used by citizens of Algeria according to the claimant are the Algerian Identity Card and a valid passport. The claimant has provided neither to corroborate his identity as XXXXX XXXXX. He testified that \"maybe\" his Algerian Identity Card is Algeria and probably his family did not mail it to him because it is expired. The Refugee Protection Division finds this is not a satisfactory explanation since he obviously recognized the importance of this particular document. It was the only one of the three documents accessible, and he could have specifically requested that it be sent.\nAs for an Algerian passport, the claimant states in the PIF that the one issued in 1996 from the Algerian Embassy in Libya, which he used to go to Poland and Germany and to countries in Asia, was \"lost\" in Thailand. However, he testified that he lived in an apartment with a girl in Thailand and put the passport behind the heater (which was never used). One day he returned to find her gone and she had taken all of his belongings. This hardly fits the description of it being \"lost.\"\nSince that passport would have expired on XXXXX, 2001, according to the PIF, the claimant was asked at the hearing whether he had approached the Algerian Embassy in Ottawa to obtain a new one. He was clearly alarmed by the idea even though he has both legal status in Canada as a refugee claimant and a work permit, both conditions that would have to be met, according to him. There is no evidence or argument that the Algerian government is an agent of persecution in his claim, and the claimant would have been painfully aware from his detention that his personal identity was in doubt.\nThe Refugee Protection Division finds under Section 106 of the IRPA and Rule 7 of the RPD Rules that the claimant has not made reasonable efforts to obtain acceptable documentation establishing identity by failing to request the putative Algerian Identity Card from his family members in Algeria or to apply for a new passport since he has been in Canada.16\nWhile the claimant was in detention in Canada, CIC received word from the German authorities that a subject by the same name and place of birth (XXXXX, Algeria) was intercepted on XXXXX 26, 1997 along the German\/Polish border.17 Later, Interpol confirmed that the claimant's fingerprints matched that of the subject processed for violation of the German Immigration (Aliens) Act in 1997. \"However, legitimate particulars are unknown.\"18 Thus the claimant has used this identity before. Such corroboration would stand in his favour were it not for the fact that his evidence about the events leading up to his encounter with the German police appears very far-fetched.\nThe claimant demonstrated that he is knowledgeable about Algeria, its history and geography, especially the area of the country where the family still owns its XXXXX. But he also presents as an intelligent, resourceful and well educated individual and this information would not be difficult for him to master for the purposes of his refugee claim.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Refugee Protection Division finds that more likely than not there is an actual person named XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX whose tombstone data fit the alleged facts, and who graduated from the University of XXXXX in XXXXX, as the XXXXX of that university has confirmed to Canadian authorities directly. However, the claimant has failed to provide sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence that this is his true identity. And the fact that all the members of the whole paternal side of his putative family are nationals of France gives rise to the possibility that the claimant may be as well. This would certainly help account for the fact that most of his documents were sent from there.\nThese negative findings are determinative of the claim for protection under both Section 96 and 97 of the IRPA. However, out of an abundance of caution, the Refugee Protection Division will address several of the other issues below, on the presumption that the claimant is who he claims to be.\nCredibility\nThe Refugee Protection Division finds there are serious reasons to doubt the truthfulness of core elements of the claimant's story of forcible recruitment by the GIA in Algeria.\nThe material discrepancy between the description in the PIF and his oral evidence about the reception he was given by the GIA during their first encounter in 1997 undermines the credibility of his allegation that this meeting ever happened and weakens the argument that there is any imputed political opinion behind the GIA's supposed threats to recruit him.\nAs the RPO pointed out in her examination and in her oral Observations, the objective information in evidence is that the Islamists in Algeria, including the GIA, do not use force to recruit their members. Two specialists are reported as saying that forced recruitment would lead to a high rate of desertion and adversely affect combat effectiveness. GIA recruits must be ideologically committed to the cause.19\nMoreover, as the RPO also addressed, the claimant does not fit the profile of a typical member of the GIA. According to an expert at the University of Algiers who commented in XXXXX 1997, this would be a young man in his twenties, single, unemployed, with little education and a poor knowledge of French and Arabic.20 Another authority on the armed groups has commented that as of XXXXX 2000 the armed groups were still recruiting among young people and at that time the profile of GIA members was of young people at the fringes of society, unemployed youths or former delinquents, and the majority of them had no political culture.21\nCounsel argues in her written submissions that, \"Surely the GIA would not be averse to having an educated member in their midst.\"22 With due respect, however, she has not provided any evidentiary basis for that argument. There is objective information that the GIA is composed of semi-autonomous groups each controlled by local emirs.23 So it might also be that an emir's power would be threatened by recruiting to the ranks an educated and worldly man like the claimant.\nThe claimant's evidence about the GIA's extortion of money is somewhat more plausible and consistent with the documentary evidence. While some killings by armed groups relate to opposition to the authorities and the amnesty program that began in 1999, some of their activities are criminal rather than political such as turf wars between rival groups, revenge banditry, land grabs, committing robberies or operating protection rackets. The GIA also kidnap women for servitude and rape.24\nHowever, the claimant has provided only two documents issued in Algeria at the time to corroborate the allegation that he returned to Algeria from Europe in XXXXX 1997 and lived and worked on the XXXXX near XXXXX XXXXX until about six weeks prior to his departure for Asia in XXXXX 1999. As the Refugee Protection Division has found above, these deserve little weight.\nThe very day the hearing started, the claimant provided a handwritten letter, which he says comes from his mother in XXXXX, Algeria.25 The courier waybill indicates it was sent by his brother XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX (again, the spelling used in France). However, the claimant testified his mother is illiterate, and it follows that she could not have written the letter. Since XXXXX XXXXX mailed the letter, it would seem plausible that she dictated to him, but the claimant said he was unsure and did not think it was a man's handwriting. This supposed uncertainty is not credible given that the claimant has a conversation with her when he requested the letter.\nFurther indications that this letter is not reliable or trustworthy evidence of the claimant's interactions with the GIA are found in the discrepancies between the contents and the claimant's oral testimony. (It is more consistent with the version of events in the PIF.) For example, the claimant testified that his mother told him after they had left the XXXXX and he was in Algiers, that their home had been ransacked and all the contents burned and a threatening message written on the wall for him. Yet there is no mention of this important incident in his mother's chronicle.\nThere were also discrepancies in the claimant's evidence concerning the events leading up to his father's alleged murder. But, in any event, this murder by XXXXX, an adopted member of the extended family, does not appear to have had anything to do with his involvement in the GIA. The claimant indicated he was a new member and supposedly the dispute was over repayment of a long-standing loan, although the claimant failed to mention the loan in any of his interviews with CIC. Presently XXXXX is safe behind bars serving a lengthy prison term for the crime and therefore poses no danger to the claimant.\nFinally, the claimant testified that his refugee claim with the UNHCR in Thailand had the very same basis as this claim in Canada. He described the fact that he completed an application like the PIF, supplied photographs, attended an interview and was given a card with a number. He abandoned the claim owing to the long wait for an answer, since his status in Thailand was insecure, and because he had researched Canada on the Internet and through associates and preferred to come to this country.\nHe testified that he does not have the UNHCR card and did not think to ask any one of the lawyers who have represented him to contact the UNHCR in Canada to try to obtain corroboration of his claim. The Refugee Protection Division draws an adverse inference as to the credibility of the allegation that he made a previous refugee claim on the same basis, as a result of his failure to make efforts to obtain corroborative evidence, as that evidence is reasonably available\nOverall, the Refugee Protection Division finds that the claimant has failed to provide sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence that he would be the target of retribution or forcible recruitment by the GIA and thus there would be a serious possibility that he would be persecuted by reason of his political opinion if he were to return to Algeria.\nObjective Basis\/ Consolidated Grounds\nThe documentary evidence26 shows that in the early and mid-1990s the GIA made specific threats against many categories of people thought to be anti-Islamic, such as the security forces and, government employees. In a later stage, its targets were intellectuals, journalists, lawyers, artists and foreigners. Following that, during another stage, the attacks were aimed at the general infrastructure of the country, such as bridges and railways. By 1998, it was the general population. The types of attacks committed now include apparently indiscriminate killings in massacres and with small bombs. They also ambush victims by mounting fake roadblocks. The violence takes place primarily in the countryside and smaller towns as the security forces have largely forced the insurgents out of the cities. The total number of GIA members in the country is unknown but estimates vary between several hundred and several thousand. Approximately one thousand members surrendered to the Algerian authorities under the terms of the Civil Concord.\nAccording to the same source, in the year 2000 more than 50 % of the attacks were carried out in areas west of Algiers, mainly in the provinces of Medea, Ain Delfa and Tipaza -\nwhere the claimant's family XXXXX is located. Meanwhile the situation in the cities of Algiers and Constantine was relatively calm, although the GIA was still active in the surrounding region.\nThis objective information shows that if the claimant faces a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment at the hands of the GIA, it is a risk faced generally by other individuals in or from that country - including his brother XXXXX in XXXXX XXXXX and his brother XXXXX XXXXX in Algiers. Furthermore, if he were to find the incidence of violence in Tipaza province intolerable, the claimant could move to the city of Algiers, which is relatively calm. He attended university there and in 1999 upon leaving the XXXXX, he went there seeking refuge.\nTherefore the Refugee Protection Division finds that his claim to be a person in need of protection under Section 97(1) (b) is not objectively well-founded. As Minister's counsel argued in her oral submissions, there are no substantial grounds for believing that the claimant would be subjected to a danger of torture since there is no evidence of harm by the state.\nFinally, on the question of whether he would be subjected to such mistreatment for the mere fact of his removal to Algeria as a failed refugee claimant, the Refugee Protection Division finds there is not a serious possibility of that.\nAccording to information obtained in Algeria by a counselor of the Canadian Embassy, European countries remove hundreds of \"deportees\" yearly, and their diplomats and the local UNHCR office say there has never been any problem encountered by these persons, to the best of their knowledge.27 If the deportees did have serious difficulties, the embassies expect their relatives would complain.\nThe UNHCR has not called for a ban on the return of rejected asylum seekers. At a seminar in 2001, a UNCHR representative stated that one should seek guarantees of safety and be reluctant to return rejected applicants in the cases where the exclusion clauses have to be applied.28\nConsidering this objective information, the Refugee Protection Division finds there are no substantial grounds for believing that if the claimant were removed to Algeria he would be subject to a danger of torture or a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nDETERMINATION\nFor all the reasons above, the Refugee Protection Division finds that the claimant has failed to provide sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish his personal identity. In the alternative, he has failed to provide sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to prove essential elements of his story. Furthermore, he does not meet the definition of a person in need of protection under Section 97 because the risk he would face from the GIA would not be faced by him in every part of the country and it is a risk faced generally by other individuals in and from that country. Accordingly the Refugee Protection Division determines that XXXXX XXXXX is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\n\"Barbara Hodgins\"\nBarbara Hodgins\nApril 26, 2004\nDate\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - EVIDENCE - DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE - IDENTITY - DOCUMENTATION - FALSE DOCUMENTATION - IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEE PROTECTION ACT - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION RULES - STATUTORY INTERPRETATION - CREDIBILITY - POLITICAL OPINION - PERSON IN NEED OF PROTECTION - RISK TO LIFE - RISK OF CRUEL AND UNUSUAL TREATMENT OR PUNISHMENT - GENERALIZED RISK - NOT FACED GENERALLY BY OTHER INDIVIDUALS - MALE - NEGATIVE - ALGERIA\n1 Exhibit 1.1, signed March 14, 2002, as amended at the hearing.\n2 Exhibit 9, pp. 28-29.

Mr. XXXXX is a 36 year-old citizen of the United States of America. He seeks refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\n[2] I have considered the claimant's testimony, and the other evidence filed in the claim, which was heard over the course of several hearing days. The claimant was not represented by counsel, however he had the assistance of his friend XXXXX XXXXX, throughout most of the proceedings. Mr XXXXX also filed documentary evidence and made submissions on behalf of the claimant.\nSUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE\n[3] The claimant alleges he is a Convention refugee because he has a well founded fear of persecution on account of his imputed anti-government political opinion. He is claiming that a federal prosecution against him is \"selective prosecution with political motivation\". He is also claiming to be a person in need of protection because he faces a danger of torture as defined in Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture,2 and because he personally faces cruel and unusual treatment or punishment and a risk to his life.\n[4] By way of background, it is important to be aware of the history behind Mr. XXXXX claim for protection. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA)3 is a US federal statute providing that marihuana is a Schedule I drug.4 Schedule I drugs are recognized by federal authorities as having no medicinal value. Persons charged under federal law are not given the benefit of the \"medical necessity\" defence afforded those charged under state law.5\n[5] In California, a new Act was passed in 1996 called the Compassionate Use Act (CUA).6 Under the CUA a medical user or his\/her \"primary caregiver\" in California, is permitted to grow and possess marihuana with a medical note or verbal recommendation. No amounts are proscribed in the statute nor can amounts be prescribed by a doctor. There is no central state registry at present, although a new Bill which came into force in January 2004, may change this.7 Accordingly, California's Compassionate Use Act directly conflicts with the federal Controlled Substances Act.\n[6] It is safe to say that the state of the law was and continues to be in flux as regards the medicinal uses and abuses of cannabis as the cases wind their way through the US courts, and must therefore be viewed as evolving. There was one witness other than Mr. XXXXX who testified in these proceedings, Mr. Panzer, Mr. XXXXX criminal defence attorney, who also testified at Mr. Kubby's hearing. He stated that federal agents targeted cannabis dispensaries. He represented one such dispensary.8 The Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative (OCBC) was formed to grow and dispense marihuana to approved medical users under the auspices of the City of Oakland. The federal government Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) charged individuals with federal offences, who were distributing under the auspices of the City of Oakland. XXXXX XXXXX, who was a XXXXX in Mr. Kubby's case,9 had been deputized by the City of Oakland to grow for third party patients. He found himself charged by the DEA for activities he believed were sanctioned by state law.\n[7] The US government sued to enjoin The Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative arguing it violated the CSA's prohibition on distributing and manufacturing or possessing with intent to\ndistribute, a controlled substance. The OCBC was unsuccessful in its defence of distribution for \"medical necessity\", a term used in the Compassionate Use Act. The Ninth Circuit Court recognised the existence of the defence of \"medical necessity\" for caregivers, however that decision was appealed to the US Supreme Court, which overturned the decision.\n[8] Justice Stevens, speaking for the Court, held:\n...this case does not call upon the court to deprive all such patients of the benefit of the necessity defense to federal prosecution, when the case itself does not involve any such patients.\" [Emphasis in original]10\n[9] The net result of the US Supreme Court decision in this hallmark case was to preclude cannabis clubs from dispensing to third parties. The decision was rendered May 14, 2001, before Mr. XXXXX came to Canada, and before the new charges against him were filed in federal court. It is clear from the decision of the US Supreme Court that there is no ambiguity in the Controlled Substances Act: \"medical necessity is not a defense to manufacturing or distributing marijuana.\"11\n[10] Following this ruling, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on May 24, 2002, upheld the DEA's right to enforce the federal CSA even within states with medical exemptions for marihuana use. This cleared the way for the DEA to crack down on cannabis dispensaries in California, which they clearly did. Raids of caregivers became more frequent because the DEA believed that traffickers were hiding behind these clubs. Both Mr. XXXXX and Mr. XXXXX were growing for third parties, and were therefore vulnerable to federal prosecution.\n[11] Mr. XXXXX has been charged federally with a variety of marihuana charges, and he feels these charges are politically motivated. In XXXXX 2002, after his arrival in Canada, Mr. XXXXX was charged by federal authorities in San Francisco, California, with various drug offences including cultivation of marihuana, conspiracy to manufacture marihuana, and maintaining a place for the purpose of cultivating marihuana. On XXXXX, 2002, the United States District Court issued a warrant of arrest on these charges.12\n[12] Mr. XXXXX suggests that he is being \"selectively prosecuted\"13 for his political beliefs and marihuana advocacy, on behalf of sick and dying medical marihuana patients. Mr. XXXXX claims that he is a \"person in need of protection\" because he fears the consequences of conviction, which, if he is incarcerated, would find him imprisoned. He submits that the prison conditions he will be forced to live in, amount to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\n[13] In addition to his allegations about prison conditions, Mr. XXXXX alleges in his Personal Information Form (PIF), 14 if he were returned to the United States and incarcerated, he would be denied adequate medical care, which would place him personally at risk to his life.\n[14] In short, Mr. XXXXX is alleging that the prosecution against him is \"politically motivated persecution . . . by US federal and state authorities\"15. It was Mr. XXXXX understanding that the Compassionate Use Act16 permitted a third party (in this case, Mr. XXXXX through a compassion club) to possess and cultivate marihuana, to help bona fide medical marihuana patients with their ailments.17\n[15] Holding a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of California in XXXXX, Mr. XXXXX has worked as a nurse's aid in various residential settings, as a counsellor and caregiver in several institutions for people who were developmentally disabled.18 Through his work he learned about the potential benefits of cannabis in certain medical contexts. For example, he witnessed its benefits with AIDS and cancer patients. He saw that cannabis helped dying patients to live far longer than medical practitioners had anticipated, and he attributed their longevity to the use of cannabis.\n[16] He saw cannabis help patients with nausea, pain, and to stimulate their appetite. He thought there was an enormous untapped potential for assisting numerous sick and dying patients with their ailments. He therefore opened a cannabis dispensary\/distribution centre that had been closed, called CHAMP (Californians Helping Alleviate Medical Problems).19 Investing his own money, he renovated and stocked the dispensary with cannabis inventory and officially reopened CHAMP in XXXXX of 1998. While the dispensary was under his control he alleged he provided cannabis to sick and dying patients qualified to use cannabis pursuant to the CUA. He maintained that he only provided cannabis to those who had medical problems and considerable documentation to confirm their medical condition and need for cannabis.\n[17] In order for a patient to obtain cannabis from CHAMP, the patient was required to present a notarized physician's recommendation (prescriptions by doctors were expressly forbidden by the CUA and subsequent jurisprudence arising from its implementation), valid identification, and a release of medical information so that CHAMP could verify with the doctor that the information was correct. CHAMP did not provide cannabis free, because there was a cost to the dispensary to produce the cannabis required, which was subsequently covered off by the patient. In some instances, donations from non-governmental organisations (NGO) such as churches, would pay on behalf of the patients. William Panzer confirmed that \"caregivers\" could be reimbursed for costs and this would not be considered a \"sale\".20\n[18] Sonoma Narcotics Enforcement showed up at Mr. XXXXX XXXXX address to discuss CHAMP's cultivation of marihuana. Mr. XXXXX was arrested and charged on XXXXX, 1999 with his co-director, XXXXX XXXXX.21 He was released on bail pending trial. Approximately 2000 patient files were found between Mr. XXXXX home and CHAMP offices combined.22 Prosecutors were seeking one year in jail time, if Mr. XXXXX was convicted.\n[19] Mr. XXXXX ran CHAMP from XXXXX 1998 to XXXXX 1999 (when he was arrested), making enough money to hire and pay approximately thirty employees and volunteers.23 He had been growing around 1000 plants in a variety of places, for patients. He alleges that in order to press Mr. XXXXX into a plea bargain on these charges, the DEA also charged his spouse XXXXX XXXXX and his employee and CHAMP XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, with drug charges. They later dropped the charges against Ms. XXXXX prior to trial. The claimant was acquitted of all charges.\n[20] The year before his trial, he XXXXX another dispensary called the Harm Reduction Centre (HRC) in San Francisco. It was smaller but ran on the same principles as CHAMP and continued to run after the claimant was acquitted of state charges. Mr. XXXXX attempted to close down the HRC when he left for Canada, but XXXXX XXXXX a friend and XXXXX, allegedly cut the locks and continued to run the business despite the fact that the claimant had closed the HRC. HRC was busted after the claimant arrived in Canada, and Mr. XXXXX was arrested, and the claimant was charged federally.\n[21] Mr. XXXXX takes the position he never had possession of the plants seized subsequent to his departure from the US. He testified that he had changed the locks, removed all of the plants and records, and informed the landlord of his departure. When the DEA found the plants in XXXXX 2002 that resulted in the outstanding federal charges against him, Mr. XXXXX alleges he had severed his relationship with the HRC and CHAMP.\n[22] The claimant came to Canada in January 2002. In XXXXX 2002, he was charged in Canada with drug charges arising out of a grow operation at his home, for his personal use. Mr. XXXXX has never applied for, nor has he obtained, a Health Canada medical exemption. At the time of his arrest in Canada, he was made aware of outstanding federal drug charges against him in the US.\nPROTECTION GROUNDS CLAIMED\nConvention Refugee (IRPA Section 96)\n[23] Mr. XXXXX is claiming to be a Convention refugee24 on the basis of his political opinion and his membership in a particular social group: those who grow cannabis for patients in the US (also referred to herein as \"medical marihuana patients\").\n96. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,\n(a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or\n(b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.\nPerson in Need of Protection (IRPA Section 97)\n[24] Mr. XXXXX also claims to be a \"person in need of protection\"25 because he alleges that his life is at risk, if he returns to the United States.\n[25] Section 97 provides:\n97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\n(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or\n(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care..\n[26] Finally, he asserts that he fears a risk of torture pursuant to section 97(1)(a).\nWEAKNESSES IN THE EVIDENCE\n[27] Mr. XXXXX testified to his advocacy work going back to 1996, however in his PIF he does not mention this work, which included being a medical marihuana activist, and work on a variety of political campaigns. In addition, although Mr. XXXXX testified that he has a medical necessity for marihuana, he has not filed medical evidence to support this need, nor has he applied for a Health Canada exemption while in Canada. In his submissions, he conceded that he has not made the claim that his life would be in jeopardy if he was denied cannabis while in jail.26 This is in direct contradiction to his evidence filed in the PIF. He says that he chooses to use marihuana, but does not claim a medical necessity. This was not clear from the PIF and other documentation filed.\n[28] Mr. XXXXX is alleging he is innocent of the charges in the US in that he had closed the HRC and had nothing more to do with the plants seized there and on his premises. Those plants, he alleges, belonged to XXXXX XXXXX and to Mr. XXXXX. He did not mention this in his PIF, a significant omission, in my view. If this is so, an able defence attorney in the US ought to be able to mount a defence to the charges, on this basis. Mr. XXXXX claims he is destitute and cannot afford bail and\/or to mount a defence in the US. The US criminal laws are obligated to follow due process, and require that Mr. XXXXX be provided with a public defender, if he cannot afford a lawyer. I am not persuaded by his argument that in order to mount a defence, he has to incriminate himself, and then cannot avail himself of the \"necessity\" defence. If he is innocent because the marihuana seized at the HRC was not his, there would be no need to argue \"medical necessity\". His allegations in this area are circuitous and illogical.\n[29] I also find problematic Mr. XXXXX attempt to surreptitiously enter the country. He flew to Canada by plane in XXXXX 2001, initially. He was questioned at Vancouver airport and made to empty his pockets, by Canada customs officials.27 Later in testimony, he said his run-in was with US custom officials at the Blaine border crossing.28 He testified it was his belief that US and Canadian border officials were working together and that his name was on a \"list.\"29 XXXXX 2002 he drove with his wife until they were close to the Canada\/US border, then he took a cab back to Seattle and his spouse Ms. XXXXX entered Canada without him. She had $10,000 US in her possession at the time she entered Canada.\n[30] The claimant then flew to Boundary Bay, a small airport, to avoid a second questioning by border officials. He was carrying $13,000 US hidden in his pants. He had also transferred $6,000 US to a Canadian account, at the time he was under investigation in the US. He said this was so that US officials could not seize his money.30 His entry into Canada was suspicious to say the least.\n[31] In addition, he blames omissions in the PIF and inconsistencies among the PIF, the CIC notes31 and his testimony, on his Canadian lawyer retained to help him file a refugee claim.\n[32] There are some fairly significant credibility concerns therefore. However, credibility concerns aside, it is clear on the evidence that Mr. XXXXX is facing federal charges in the US, and that Mr. XXXXX was tried on similar charges, convicted and sentenced to one day in jail. These facts are not in dispute.\nISSUES RAISED BY THE CLAIM\n[33] The determinative issues in this claim are first, whether the claimant has a well founded fear of persecution and second, whether he has rebutted the presumption that the United States is capable of protecting him from any persecution alleged. In addition, I will canvass whether he has rebutted this presumption vis-\u00e0-vis any possible risk to his life, or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or whether there is a potential danger of torture.\nCREDIBILITY\n[34] There are some credibility concerns, as set out above. Notwithstanding this, I am of the view that whether or not Mr. XXXXX is being truthful about the allegations is irrelevant to the outcome. There is nothing blatant on the face of the record that would cause me to conclude Mr. XXXXX was lying. He came across as sincere throughout his hearing. I will accept for the purposes of my analysis that the events as alleged by Mr. XXXXX, occurred in the way that he has described them. Notwithstanding this, I find much of Mr. XXXXX stated fear of persecution, and risk of harm is, nonetheless, speculative.\n[35] There is no evidence that Mr. XXXXX would receive any greater sentence if convicted of his outstanding charges, than XXXXX XXXXX received when he was convicted of cultivating marihuana for medical patients. Mr. XXXXX sentence was a one-day jail sentence.32 In addition, I find it noteworthy that Mr. XXXXX was only sentenced to one day in jail despite the federal probation department's recommendation that he receive a twenty-one month sentence. There was public condemnation by several high-ranking state officials about the charges against Mr. XXXXX, and appeals to the judge including from California's Attorney General William Lockyer asking for maximum leniency in Mr. XXXXX case.\n[36] This case demonstrates that federal courts are likely to deal fairly with persons caught between federal and state laws on medicinal marihuana, at least in some circumstances.\n[37] In the midst of all the legal wrangling lies the fate of many sick and dying patients. I have tremendous sympathy for the uncertainty suffered by Mr. XXXXX as a result of the ambiguity the CUA has engendered. California Senate Bill 420, which has recently come into force, is the state's attempt to clarify its intent under the CUA and it has been both hailed and criticized by medical marihuana activists.33 Mr. XXXXX submits, on behalf of the claimant, that I should regard Bill 420 with a critical eye. I have read the Bill and believe it has clarified many of the ambiguities in the CUA, that are of concern to this panel.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[38] The heart of this claim lies with the issue of state protection. It is a hurdle that Mr. XXXXX has been unable to vault. Mr. XXXXX needs to demonstrate, through \"clear and convincing\"34 evidence, that his state is unwilling or unable to protect him from the risk of harm. I find that adequate state protection was available to the claimant in the United States. In coming to this decision, I adopt my reasoning in the decision of Steven Kubby, et al. v. M.C.I. (RPD VA2-01374), Dauns, November 17, 2003, commencing at paragraph 154 of the decision, regarding the availability of adequate state protection to similarly situated persons in the United States. The availability of state protection in the United States has been comprehensively analyzed in the Kubby decision. My reasons for adopting the relevant finding in the Kubby decision is that the facts and the evidence regarding country conditions in this claim are sufficiently close to those before me in the Kubby case.\n[39] In addition, most of the same country documentation was filed by the Refugee Protection Officer in both cases. The Minister's country documentation was identical in all material aspects in both cases, and a full transcript of the evidence in Mr. Kubby's claim was filed in Mr. XXXXX claim, as was a copy of Mr. Kubby's decision.35 While there are factual differences between the two claims, they are not material to my decision which is founded exclusively on the issue of state protection.\n[40] In finding that adequate state protection was and will be available to the claimant, should he return to the United States, I have assessed the claimant's own experiences in the context of the entirety of the evidence. The claimant has not availed himself of the protection of his state when there is a clear onus upon him to do so, as set out in the jurisprudence in this area of the law.36\nSUMMARY\n[41] The claimant is wanted on criminal charges and is accordingly a fugitive from justice, not a refugee fearing persecution. The claimant has the burden of demonstrating his state is unable or unwilling to protect him from the harm feared, whether that harm arises on account of one of the enumerated grounds, or as envisioned in section 97(1) of IRPA. While the elements necessary to establish a claim under section 97(1) are not identical to those necessary to establish whether a person is a Convention refugee under section 96 of IRPA, as noted by the Court in Bouaouni37 the Board must review whether there exist reasons for refugee protection under section 97(1) that may not be sufficient to determine the claimant is a Convention refugee. I have considered Mr. XXXXX claim in light of all three protection grounds, and have considered the jurisprudence that pertains to the analysis of state protection vis-\u00e0-vis his risk of harm. I have concluded that there is nothing in this claim whether documentary or otherwise for establishing a \"risk\" for the claimant pursuant to section 97(1). Likewise, there is no evidence the claimant faces of danger of torture as envisioned in Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture.38\n[42] Whether the claim is framed under section 96 or section 97(1) of the Act the outcome is the same, since an analysis of state protection is necessary to the determination of refugee protection generally.\nDETERMINATION\n[43] Accordingly, I find that XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX is not a Convention refugee, as he does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in the United States. I also find that the claimant is not a person in need of protection in that his removal to the United States would not subject him personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, and in that there are no substantial grounds to believe that his removal to the United States will subject him personally to a danger of torture. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the claim for refugee protection of XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX is hereby rejected.\n\"Paulah Dauns\"\nPaulah Dauns\nMay 7. 2004\nDate\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - POLITICAL OPINION - PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP - MEDICAL TREATMENT - MEDICAL EVIDENCE - PERSECUTION - PROSECUTION - STATE PROTECTION - MALE - NEGATIVE - USA\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Article 1 of the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment of Punishment (the \"CAT\"), Can.

The couple's younger daughter, XXXXXXXXXXXXX, aged 3, also a minor claimant, was conceived during a brief reconciliation after the divorce but her father did not acknowledge the child as his. A separate ground for the claims is that in Israel children are the victims of explosions and it is not a safe country.\nThe claimant is the Designated Representative for the minors.\nSUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS\nAccording to the claimant's Personal Information Form (PIF),1 she was born XXXXX XXXXX in the Crimean Republic of the former USSR, and is of Russian Jewish nationality. She immigrated to Israel in 1990 with her mother and sister under the Law of Return. In 1994, she married XXXXX XXXXX, and in 1995 they settled in the city of XXXXX and he joined the police force.\nHer husband began to drink heavily and to abuse her physically when he was drunk starting in 1996. After XXXXX was born, he would often disappear from the house and when he was home would drink and threaten to strangle the child if she was not quiet. Often he would shove them out of the house because the child was interfering with his sleep. During this period he had lovers and made no attempt to hide them.\nFollowing an argument in XXXXX 1997, she made a complaint against him at the police station but the officer convinced her to retract it because this would cause her husband to be fired and they had no other means of survival. When he found out she had gone to the police, he became very angry and beat her up and threatened to kill their daughter if she ever went again. To prove his point, he slaughtered their cat, put it on the porch and said he would do the same thing to her and her daughter. After that, the claimant left home with XXXXX but a week later learned she could return because her husband had gone to live with his lover.\nShe filed for divorce and six months later, on XXXXX, 1998, they were divorced. The claimant got custody of XXXXX and her former husband was not given visitation rights. Until 1999 they barely saw one another although a few times he came over drunk and tried to start fights, but each time friends or neighbours who were visiting her would take him away. At the end of 1999 they got back together again because he had straightened himself out and promised not to drink anymore. For several months he was the model husband and father. At the beginning of 2000, she told him she was pregnant. At first he reacted well but later started drinking again. He would yell that the baby was not his and he had no intention of supporting it. Then in XXXXX 2000, he locked XXXXX in a bathroom and beat the claimant on the stomach trying to cause a miscarriage. She left him and when she gave birth to XXXXX on XXXXX, 2000, she did not name him as the child's father.\nIn 2001 when they were not at home, her former husband came around, very drunk, wanting to see the children according to the neighbours. When she returned she found he had broken all the dishes, turned the house upside down and taken almost all of the photographs and valuables. The following year, in XXXXX 2002, he came to the house, quite drunk, after the children were asleep. When she did not let him in, he broke the door down and when she grabbed the phone and threatened to call the police he smashed the phone and started to beat her. Neighbours heard her screams and managed to lead him away. Finally, in XXXXX 2002, a friend was walking XXXXX home from kindergarten when her former husband abducted the child and took her to his parents' house and told his mother she was going to live with him. His mother was not happy and called the claimant's sister who together with her husband and two friends brought XXXXX back.\nAfter this incident, the claimant went to see a lawyer about getting a restraining order against her former husband to prevent him from seeing the children and coming to their house. But the lawyer's fee was unaffordable to her as a single mother who did not work and had two children to support. The lawyer also told her that even if the court issued the restraining order it would have to be enforced by the same police force where her former husband served. This would not guarantee her safety.\nShe could not continue to live in fear for their lives so made the decision to leave the country. Friends in Canada helped with the cost of the plane tickets and the claimants arrived on XXXXX, 2002 in Toronto. After a week they traveled to Vancouver and two months later, on XXXXX, 2002, they made claims to refugee protection inland.\nAccording to an amendment to the PIF made at the hearing, the claimant married XXXXX XXXXX, a Canadian citizen, on XXXXX, 2003 and their son was born on XXXXX XXXXX, 2003. At the time of the hearing her new husband had a sponsorship application in progress.\nShe claims that in Israel her former husband is a constant threat to her and the minor claimants and he has weapons in his possession. During her interview with the Immigration Officer, she said the second reason for making the refugee claim is that she does not want to live in a country where children are the victims of explosions, and it is not a safe country in which to live.2\nISSUES\nThe following issues were identified: personal identity; credibility; subjective basis, especially with respect to the delay in making a claim in Canada; objective basis; Internal Flight Alternative (IFA); and state protection. It was recognized that given the nature of the alleged persecution, the Chairperson's Guidelines for Women Refugee Claimants fearing Gender based Persecution (Gender Guidelines)3 apply in this case.\nAs set out below, the Refugee Protection Division finds that the determinative issues are credibility and subjective basis and, had the evidence of spousal abuse been found to be credible (which is was not), state protection.\nPersonal Identity\nThe claimants arrived in Canada using Israeli passports and were admitted as visitors since visas were not required. Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) seized their passports when they later made refugee claims.\nWhile the claimant has provided her own birth certificate she has not provided the same for the minors. As the analysis below indicates this is cause for concern, especially in the case of XXXXX because apart from her passport, which contains minimal biographical information, she is undocumented. XXXXX is referenced in the divorce documents, which also show that the claimant has legal custody of her.\nThe claimant presented her Israeli identity card to the Immigration Officer but this document was not seized and the claimant failed to bring it to the hearing for examination or provide a translation of its contents. As outlined below, she also appears to have deliberately withheld from Canadian authorities the supplement to the identity card, which would contain detailed information about her children, marital status, address and so forth.\nHowever, the Refugee Protection Division believes there is no reason to doubt the authenticity of the claimants' Israeli passports and finds these documents are sufficient to establish their respective personal identities for the purpose of the refugee claims.\nCredibility\nThe Refugee Protection Division finds there are serious reasons to doubt the truthfulness of the claimant's allegations that she was the victim of spousal abuse or that her elder daughter was the victim of abduction, by her former husband. There are numerous discrepancies in her evidence for which she did not have an acceptable explanation and she was not a credible witness. More likely than not, she has fabricated the basis of the claim in order to use the refugee system to circumvent proper immigration procedures.\nFacts of Marriage and Divorce Established\nDuring the hearing ,the Refugee Protection Officer (RPO) drew attention to a number of anomalous features of the divorce certificate dated XXXXX, 19984 and its attachment, the divorce agreement drawn up on XXXXX, 1998,5 that could undermine the reliability and trustworthiness of both documents. The claimant was questioned about these. For example, according to the translation, the court decision states that the couple was married in Israel by civil marriage while there is objective information that couples cannot get married in a civil court in Israel.6 The claimant testified that they did not have a wedding in Israel so their marriage was not acknowledged until they sent their papers to Paraguay (the other option was Cyprus) and received a marriage certificate from Paraguay. (She did not have the marriage certificate in her possession at the hearing although she had indicated in the PIF that she was expecting to receive it.) The claimant could not explain the legal reference to a civil marriage but said she was represented by a lawyer in the divorce proceeding. However, her explanation of the circumstances of the marriage is supported by objective information from the same source that indicates couples of different religions (as is the case here) must marry outside the country and then they may register as a married couple upon return.7\nIn addition, the RPO pointed out that the husband's identity number is different on the two court documents. The claimant said it must be a mistake. The RPO also questioned why a Rabbinical court would have dissolved a civil marriage, but the claimant maintained that her marriage had been recognized in Israel and she had to get a divorce through a religious court. She said it was sufficient for there to be one Jew in the couple. This appears to be borne out in the documentary evidence, which cites several reports that Rabbinical courts have sole jurisdiction over marriage or divorce in Israel.8 The RPO also asked her to explain why a section of the original Hebrew version of the divorce agreement was crossed out.9 To this the claimant had a full and forthright answer in effect that the section pertained to access by the father of the child on the Sabbath and religious holidays but because her husband was not Jewish (and she is) and thus he could not teach their daughter how to celebrate properly the judge asked him to consent to waive such access and he did and the section was crossed out.\nMoreover, the claimant has given consistent evidence - to the Immigration Officer in making the claim, in the PIF, and in oral testimony - that she was divorced from XXXXX XXXXX on XXXXX, 1998, and the court documents bear this out.\nThe Refugee Protection Division finds that the claimant has established the alleged fact that she was married to this man and divorced from him and the minor claimant, XXXXX, is the child of that union. Their daughter, XXXXX, born in XXXXX 1996, is specifically identified in the Divorce Settlement.\nBeyond that, however, the Refugee Protection Division finds there is insufficient credible evidence to support any of the claimant's allegations of spousal abuse, particularly following the divorce, or of the brief reconciliation that led to her former husband also fathering her younger daughter, XXXXX, or his abduction of XXXXX (supposedly to coerce the claimant into getting back together) shortly before the claimants left for Canada.\nSpousal Abuse during the Marriage\nThe Israeli court documents indicate that the claimant's divorce was amicable and make no reference to verbal and physical abuse or drunkenness on the part of her husband. The claimant testified that her husband wanted a divorce and paid the entire cost of the process himself because he wanted to marry someone else and subsequently he did live with another woman and had two children by her. This appears to be at odds with the level of violence and acrimony she now alleges in her refugee claim.\nThe claimant's evidence that her former husband was a police officer in their city serves as her blanket rationalization for not having made an official complaint against him for the spousal abuse after a fellow police officer allegedly dissuaded her from doing so in XXXXX 1997 because her husband would be fired. However, the claimant has not provided any corroborative evidence of this material alleged fact, despite specific direction on the screening form disclosed by the RPO fully eight months before the hearing.10 She testified that she has no photographs of her husband in police uniform and that most of the time he was in plain clothes. She claims to have asked everyone in Israel to find a photo of him to no avail and asked her friends who were with him in the police to get a document but such documents are not issued for police officers, not even their personal telephone numbers. Allegedly she contacted the same police officer she had spoken to about her husband's abuse in 1997 because she remembered seeing photographs of her husband in uniform at the station, but the officer said he could not find them. Her sister sent along a photograph of a man and a woman in Israeli military uniforms but because this had no relevance or probative value it was not accepted into evidence under the Rules for late disclosure.11\nThe Refugee Protection Division believes it is reasonable to expect that if the claimant's former husband truly was a police officer in the city of XXXXX in Israel she would be able to provide some kind of corroborative evidence of his position, and that she would take all possible steps because this fact is so crucial to her alleged need for international refugee protection from his abuse. The evidence suggests, for example, that she could have sought the cooperation of the divorce lawyer, or the government agency that was aware her former husband was in default on child support payments. The Refugee Protection Division finds the claimant has not discharged the onus on her under section 106 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) and Rule 7 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules, and draws an adverse inference as to the credibility of all of her allegations of her former husband's verbal and physical abuse that form this basis of her claim.\nFurthermore, in the PIF the claimant states that when her former husband found out she had gone to the police in XXXXX 1997 he was so angry that he threatened to kill their daughter if she went again, and to prove the point, he slaughtered their cat. After that, she filed for divorce, which was granted six months later. During the claimant's prior interview with the Immigration Officer, she had indicated this incident happened in 1998 but otherwise said much the same thing. However, by contrast, she testified at the hearing that her former husband killed their cat and made the death threat sometime after the divorce and she could not remember how long afterward. The Refugee Protection Division finds it difficult to believe that if her former husband really had slaughtered their cat to emphasize a death threat while they were still living together she would recall the circumstances in a consistent manner. The Refugee Protection Division finds this important discrepancy further undermines the credibility of her claim that the alleged spousal abuse began during the marriage and her initial complaint to the police provoked a death threat from her former husband.\nSpousal Abuse after the Marriage including Child Abduction\nThe claimant reported to the Immigration Officer that in 1999 she and her former husband tried to live together but when he found out she was pregnant he beat her up and that was the end of it. They went their separate ways. She made no reference to any of the continuing harassment alleged in the PIF, notably that he entered the house in 2001 and vandalized the contents, or broke into her home in XXXXX 2002, and that he abducted their daughter in XXXXX 2002.\nYet the claimant testified that her former husband's abduction of XXXXX was the incident that caused her to leave Israel in XXXXX 2002. She was given an opportunity to explain this omission in particular because of the significance of the alleged abduction to her departure and its relatively recent occurrence. Her reaction was to shrug and say that she did not tell the story in so much detail at that time and was telling things that were less significant and more significant. The Immigration Officer had made the comment at the end of the interview that, \"the client stated she had nothing further to add.\"12 When this was drawn to her attention, she sighed and said there were 20 incidents like that. The Refugee Protection Division finds the claimant's response does not satisfactorily address her omission of this pivotal incident at the time she made her refugee claim, and draws an adverse inference about the credibility of the claimant's allegations of abuse following the divorce in XXXXX 1998 or that her daughter XXXXX was abducted by her former husband.\nThe claimant says that her former husband beat her when she was pregnant with XXXXX because he did not believe he was the father. The Refugee Protection Division also has suspicions, in part because the claimant has not provided the child's birth certificate or other objective evidence to corroborate her allegation that she did not officially name XXXXX XXXXX as the father due to that violent attack. She claims that the proof lies in the different validity terms of her daughters' respective Israeli passports.\nHer evidence is that in Israel, despite the fact that she had legal custody of XXXXX, she would either have had to get her former husband's permission to take her daughter out of the country or apply to the court. But she \"got a bit lucky\" because he was in hiding to avoid making child support payments with the result that the passport office could not reach him by mail. So the government issued only a one-year international passport for XXXXX (apparently without the required application to court in lieu of the father's permission). But because there were none of these complications in the case of XXXXX, hers is a four-year international passport.\nThe claimant has not provided any objective information about the Israeli passport procedures for minors and the Refugee Protection Division has difficulty believing that court documents proving the claimant's divorce and legal custody of the XXXXX would have been insufficient. The Refugee Protection Division does not accept that the different validity terms of the minors' passports is proof that XXXXX XXXXX was named the father of one but not the other.\nIt is apparent that the claimant has deliberately failed to provide Canadian authorities with the \"supplement\" to her laminated Israeli personal identity card that according to the documentary evidence contains such personal information as her place of residence, civil status, name of spouse, identity number of spouse, and place of residence.13 She claims to have only brought with her to Canada the identity card (seen by the Immigration Officer).14 Allegedly \"by coincidence\" she left the supplement in a purse in Israel and it was lost in the mail along with photographs and other documents when her sister sent it to her later. This is simply too convenient, given the value of this document. She has not offered any evidence that she or her sister initiated a postal search for the missing mail or that she applied for a replacement when she realized it was lost.\nCoupled with this, she did not bring her original identity card itself to the hearing and said she did not know where it was and maybe the children played with it and destroyed it. She explained that she did not realize its importance, which is not reasonable because this is part of her official Israeli identity document, and the fact that the Immigration Officer made a certified copy should have signaled its importance for the purposes of her refugee claim. The Refugee Protection Division could only speculate why the claimant would withhold the original identity card from further scrutiny and not supply a translation of it, and mislead the Board about the loss of the supplement.\nSubjective Basis\nConsistent with the claimant's lack of credibility regarding the basis of her claim is the two-month delay between her arrival in Canada, on XXXXX, 2002, and when she and her daughters finally claimed refugee status in Vancouver, September 4, 2002. Considering that she allegedly fled Israel to seek international protection for herself and her daughters against her abusive former husband, it is reasonable to expect that she would have made the claim at her earliest opportunity, which would have been at Pearson International Airport in Toronto, the port of entry. According to her oral evidence, she had friends in both Vancouver and Toronto who knew her situation and helped finance her travel.\nThe claimant did not have a satisfactory explanation for the delay. She said that she did not know the law and whether she had enough grounds to ask for refugee status and during the interval her friends asked around. The Refugee Protection Division finds it is reasonable to expect that her friends in Canada could have done the necessary research before she arrived or within short order. How to claim refugee status and who is eligible is information that is publicly available, as are the Gender Guidelines.\nSeen in the context of the negative credibility findings above, the fact that the claimant became pregnant within five months of making her refugee claim and married the Canadian father of her son a year afterward, on XXXXX, 2003, and that he made a sponsorship application, indicates, on the balance of probabilities, that she claimed refugee status to circumvent proper immigration procedures, not to obtain Canada's protection from her former husband in Israel.\nState Protection\nIt is worth noting that the claimant, had she been a credible witness, would not have succeeded in rebutting the presumption of state protection in Israel.\nAccording to the PIF, after XXXXX was abducted she went to see a lawyer about getting a restraining order against her former husband but did not go through with this because she did not have enough money to pay the fee and also it would have been enforced by her former husband's police department and thus not guarantee her safety anyway. However the claimant testified that she was receiving government assistance in lieu of his support payments and it is reasonable to expect that she would have sought additional government aid for this purpose if her life and those of her children were at risk. Moreover, as the RPO pointed out in her oral Observations, she did find enough money to leave the country instead.\nThere is comprehensive information in evidence on the incidence of violence against women in Israel and the law, services available, and police attitudes.15 It shows that in recent years the government has progressively made stronger efforts to address the problem of widespread domestic violence, and to protect the victims and raise public awareness. In 1998, Israel adopted a sexual harassment prevention law and due to the public outcry at light sentences imposed on abusive men, legislation mandating minimum sentencing was enacted at the beginning of 1999. In March 2000, the Equality of Women law was passed, prohibiting domestic violence. A recent amendment to the Penal Code has recognized the Battered Women's Syndrome acknowledging a woman's right to defend herself. In late 2000 three women were murdered by their husbands and this prompted the Prime Minister to allocate the equivalent of nearly $16 million (CDN.) to a prevention plan including hiring more crisis intervention counsellors, emergency hotlines, a treatment program for children who have witnessed violence, an emergency centre for children and a hostel for abusive men.\nIn 2001 new legislation granted additional benefits to battered women living in shelters or in some other place of hiding. This provides that a battered woman who has gone into hiding for at least three months and has begun divorce proceedings is eligible for state assistance which includes an education grant, housing assistance, and preference for child day-care acceptance.\nPolice receive some training in the handling of domestic violence and pinpoint the main source of failure in their efforts as the \"conspiracy of silence within the domestic cell,\" according to one police chief. Still, in 2001, a total of 20,931 complaints of \"assault against women\" were filed and that year 3,129 husbands were arrested for attacking their wives, 2,501 restraining orders were issued against husbands and 643 women were treated in shelters.16\nThe claimant's evidence is that she approached the police in Israel for protection only once, at the station where her then husband was employed, and the officer there persuaded her to retract her complaint. The Court of Appeal in Kadenko17 has ruled that:\nOnce it is assumed that the state (Israel in this case) has political and judicial institutions capable of protecting its citizens, it is clear that the refusal of certain police officers to take action cannot by itself make the state incapable of doing so...\nWhen the state in question is a democratic state...the claimant must do more than simply show that he or she went to see some members of the police force and that his or her efforts were unsuccessful. The burden of proof that rests on the claimant is, in a way, directly proportional to the level of democracy in the state in question: the more democratic the state's institutions, the more the claimant must have done to exhaust all the course of action open to him or her.\nSection 97\nThe Federal Court has ruled that a negative credibility determination under section 96 of the IRPA is not necessarily determinative of a claim under section 97. In this case, the negative credibility assessment with respect to the allegations of spousal abuse and child abduction are also determinative of the fact that upon removal the claimants would not be subjected personally to a risk to life or risk of cruel or unusual treatment or punishment at the hands of the claimant's former husband.\nWhen the claimant was interviewed by the Immigration Officer, she mentioned that the \"second reason\" she was making a refugee claim was that she did not want to live in a country where children are the victims of explosions, and that Israel was not a safe country. She did not include this in the PIF or mention it at the hearing. However, the Refugee Protection Division believes that this ground should be assessed under section 97.\nAccording to the US Department of State Report for 2002, there was a sharp increase in suicide bombings, shootings and other acts of terrorism by Palestinian groups or individuals in the country and the Occupied Territories, which resulted in the deaths of least 469 Israelis that year.18 However tragic these deaths and the sense of insecurity they instilled, they must be viewed in relation to the fact that the country's population is approximately 6.4 million, including Israeli settlers in the Occupied Territories. Thus, the probability of the claimants becoming victims of this violence is extremely low and would not even meet the minimum standard of proof in refugee law, more than a mere chance or a serious possibility.\nMoreover, the reports of individual incidents show that these suicide bombings and car bombings are random and indiscriminate. It cannot be said that the terrorists even target Jews alone because Arab Israelis make up approximately 20 percent of the general population.\nThe Refugee Protection Division concludes from this that the claimants' removal to Israel would not subject them personally to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment from terrorist attacks. The degree of that risk does not meet the required standard of proof, and it is faced generally by other individuals in or from that country.19\nThere is no evidence or argument that the claimants would be subjected personally to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture.\nThe Refugee Protection Division finds that the claimants do not meet the definition of persons in need of protection.\nDETERMINATION\nFor all the reasons above, the Refugee Protection Division finds that the claimants have failed to provide sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish that they would face a serious possibility of persecution or a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment at the hands of her former husband and the minors' father, XXXXX XXXXX. Upon removal to Israel they would not be subjected personally to a risk to their lives or to cruel and unusual treatment of punishment from terrorist attacks.. No evidence or argument has been advanced that the claimants' removal would subject them personally to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture. Accordingly, the Refugee Protection Division determines that XXXXX XXXXX, XXXXX XXXXX, and XXXXX XXXXX are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.\n\"Barbara Hodgins\"\nBarbara Hodgins\nSeptember 22, 2004\nDate\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - WOMEN REFUGEES - GENDER - PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP - GENDER-RELATED PERSECUTION - DOMESTIC VIOLENCE - CREDIBILITY - STATE PROTECTION - DELAY - SUBJECTIVE ELEMENT - FEMALE - NEGATIVE - ISRAEL\n1 Exhibit 1.1, claimant's Personal Information Form (PIF), signed October 10, 2002.\n2 Exhibit 2, Statutory Declaration of XXXXX XXXXX, Immigration Officer, dated September 4, 2002.\n3 Guidelines Issued by the Chairperson Pursuant to section 65(3) of the Immigration Act, IRB, Ottawa, November 25, 1996, as continued in effect by the Chairperson on June 28, 2002 pursuant to section 159(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n4 Exhibit 3.1.\n5 Exhibit 7.\n6 International Women's Rights Action Watch, report on Israel at pages 100-135.

XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX (\u201cthe associated claimant\u201d) is a 43 year-old citizen of Vietnam. They are friends, whose claims have been joined. They bring their claims for refugee protection pursuant to sections 961 and 97(1)2 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).3\n[2] The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, through her representative, is opposing their claims for refugee protection. It is the Minister\u2019s position that both claimants are persons referred to in section 98 of IRPA (and the Schedule) and should therefore be excluded from the definition of Convention refugee as outlined in section 96 of IRPA. Further, they should not be found to be persons in need of protection as outlined in section 97(1) of IRPA. The Minister is of the opinion that both claimants ought to be excluded pursuant to article 1F(b) of the Convention.4\n[3] Article 1F(b) reads as follows:\nF. The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:\n(b) he has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee.\n[4] Section 98 of IRPA states:\n98. A person referred to in section E or F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\n[5] Because no person within the scope of Article 1(F) can qualify for refugee status, a review of the claimant\u2019s case must first be conducted with reference to Article 1F.\n[6] Ms. XXXXX is referred to as the \u201cprincipal claimant\u201d and Ms. XXXXX is referred to as the \u201cassociated claimant\u201d.\nSUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE\n[7] This is a complex case in which a substantial amount of evidence was tendered by the claimants, the Minister\u2019s representative, and the Refugee Protection Officer. The claim was heard over five days, and several witnesses testified. Both claimants testified.\nOther Witnesses Called Included\nProfessor Ian William Townsend-Gault, Director of the University of British Columbia (UBC) Centre for Asian Legal Studies;\nXXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, the principal claimant\u2019s Canadian sister;\nMs XXXXX XXXXX, Counsellor and Consul, Canadian Embassy, Hanoi (by telephone);\nXXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, the principal claimant\u2019s brother-in-law (married to her sister XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX);\nXXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, Vietnamese criminal lawyer (by telephone).\n[8] Thirty-two Exhibits were filed and marked in these proceedings.\n[9] There are many persons concerned with the claim of Ms. XXXXX, in what was often a confusing interrelation of family members allegedly involved in what has been characterized as an \u201cinternational drug smuggling family.\u201d A family tree was provided by an Immigration Officer (IO) at Exhibit 26. It has been reproduced below for ease of reference.5\n[10] There are two very distinct claims as between the claimants, however there are connections in certain areas.\nTHE CLAIM OF XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX\n1. Allegations of XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX\n[11] Ms. XXXXX was married to XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX on XXXXX, 1981. They have two children: a daughter XXXXX XXXXX, 23 years, and a son XXXXX XXXXX, 19 years. The principal claimant\u2019s daughter continues to reside in Vietnam, with her husband, a police officer and their two children.6 The principal claimant\u2019s son is now in Canada. Ms. XXXXX husband was allegedly executed in 2001 in Vietnam. The principal claimant gave birth to a third child in Canada, XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, while awaiting her refugee hearing.\n[12] The principal claimant and her husband were well off by Vietnamese standards. They owned the XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, which they acquired in 1992. They also set up a pawnshop in 1993, also called XXXXX XXXXX, after their son. They lived upstairs from the pawnshop at XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX Street. The principal claimant alleges that she ran the pawnshop. They loaned out money to clients in what was allegedly a legitimate business, taking assets as collateral. They had significant foreign contacts and decided there was an opportunity to establish a restaurant in Hanoi. XXXXX XXXXX Restaurant opened in 1995 and XXXXX XXXXX Restaurant in 1996, both in Hanoi. We have evidence that XXXXX XXXXX Restaurant existed as a business, but not that it was owned by the principal claimant.7 The principal claimant and her husband became very successful, employing approximately seventy employees.\n[13] In 1994 or 1995, the pawnshop loaned money to frequent borrower, Ms. XXXXX. Initially Ms. XXXXX gave the principal claimant the deed to her home as collateral, and later, once she had established a business relationship, collateral was no longer required. She borrowed a significant sum, allegedly for her business, which the principal claimant believed to be a XXXXX importing business from Laos to Vietnam.\n[14] Ms. XXXXX was arrested for drug trafficking along with approximately twenty others. It was alleged that she was involved in an international drug smuggling ring with connections in Laos and other countries. Witness lawyer XXXXX testified that this was a \u201cbig case\u201d, a \u201clong case\u201d and a \u201cserious\u201d case.8 Ms. XXXXX was found guilty and sentenced to death, which was later reduced to a life sentence. Her boyfriend, XXXXX XXXXX (no relation to the principal claimant) was also convicted and sentenced to death. The principal claimant alleges that XXXXX was actually a \u201ccorrupt undercover narcotics police officer.\u201d9\n[15] In 1997 the date for XXXXX execution was drawing near. It is the principal claimant\u2019s theory that XXXXX attempted to have his sentence commuted from death by firing squad, to a life sentence. In order to achieve this, he allegedly lied to authorities and named individuals he said had been involved in this drug smuggling ring. He named the principal claimant as being involved in the drug trade. The principal claimant alleges she was framed and that she was never involved with the drug trade.\n[16] According to the principal claimant, on the strength of this death row accusation and nothing else, the police issued a Warrant for the principal claimant\u2019s arrest. The principal claimant alleged further that Ms. XXXXX \u201cin open court denied the truth of [her boy friend]\u2019s allegations\u201d10 against her. She apparently said, again in open court, that the principal claimant had no knowledge of the \u201ctrue purpose for which the money was being used.\u201d The principal claimant alleges that the police likely knew she was innocent and issued the Warrant in the hopes of extorting funds from her.\n[17] The principal claimant was out of town as these events unfolded. On XXXXX, 1997, upon her return from her trip, rather than go home first, she apparently went elsewhere, and by a fortuitous and remarkable coincidence, was informed by an employee that the police were looking for her. She was told that the police were at her home and that her house had been sealed, so she did not return to her home.\n[18] The principal claimant alleges that she formally learned what the charges against her were, when she read an INTERPOL Warrant, filed in these proceedings.11 According to the Warrant issued XXXXX, 1997, she is charged with international drug trafficking. She denies the charges and says the allegations are totally false. The principal claimant was told there were drug charges against her, while she was still in Vietnam, however she alleges that she did not receive any details until she came to Canada, in 2002.\n[19] When she learned of the charges against her while she was still in Vietnam, the principal claimant allegedly wanted to turn herself in, to sort out the charges, because she claimed she was innocent and this would have been obvious to police. However, she was allegedly advised against doing this by friends who said that if she did turn herself in, she would be executed for drug trafficking.\n[20] The principal claimant went to the home of her friend XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, the associated claimant. Ms. XXXXX took her in and allegedly hid the principal claimant from the authorities for what turned out be five years, until they left Vietnam in 2002. Ms. XXXXX common law husband, XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX did not initially object to this arrangement. Ms. XXXXX husband knew where she was and visited her on occasion, while she was in hiding. She alleges she has not seen or communicated with her children since she went into hiding in XXXXX 1997.\n[21] The principal claimant\u2019s son, XXXXX XXXXX, who now lives in Canada, initially told Canada Immigration (CIC) that his father was deceased and his mother was a widow.12 Later, at another interview, he told CIC that both of his parents had been killed in a motor vehicle accident in Vietnam.13 He produced death certificates for both parents.14 In another interview, the principal claimant\u2019s son told CIC that his father was killed in 2000 for selling drugs. He said the death certificates were given to him by his guardian.15\n[22] Contrary to what his mother had testified, he testified that he had spoken to his mother three years previously (2001) by phone. He told the officer that his mother would call him every three months, and at least once a year. He said that he talked to his mother approximately ten times between 1997 and 2002.16\n[23] The principal claimant testified that unbeknownst to her, her sister had arranged for her friends XXXXX who lived in Russia, and XXXXX who lived in Germany to call the principal claimant\u2019s children pretending to be her. She alleges that her sister asked these two people to call her son and pretend to be Ms. XXXXX, his mother. She alleges that she did not know about this until during her hearing when she read what her son had told CIC.17\n[24] On XXXXX, 1997, the principal claimant\u2019s husband XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX was arrested for drug trafficking. The principal claimant read about this in the newspaper, as she was allegedly not able to leave the associated claimant\u2019s house. The principal claimant believed the police arrested her husband in an attempt to draw her out of hiding. Her husband filed many letters of appeal, declaring his innocence, to no avail. He was tried in a highly publicized trial, and he was convicted of drug trafficking.\n[25] Evidence was tendered from Mr. XXXXX the lawyer who represented Mr. XXXXX in the Court of Appeal, that his appeal was denied. XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX testified in these proceedings that Mr. XXXXX was eventually executed. The principal claimant alleges that she first learned of her husband\u2019s execution from her family, when she arrived in Canada.\n[26] The principal claimant allegedly lived in the attic of Ms. XXXXX home. Ms. XXXXX common law husband XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX and her daughter XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX (who is now 19 years old), lived in the same house. According to the evidence, the principal claimant was a virtual prisoner in Ms. XXXXX home. She never left for any reason. She remained in hiding for five years.\n[27] Two years later, in 1999, Ms. XXXXX common law husband began to be very abusive toward the two women. He began to beat Ms. XXXXX. He began to threaten the principal claimant, telling her that he would go to the police to disclose her whereabouts if she did not give him sexual favours. When she refused to comply, he allegedly raped her repeatedly.\n[28] When Ms. XXXXX became aware of what was happening between her spouse and the principal claimant, she was told by XXXXX that he would go to the police and report to them that Ms. XXXXX was harbouring a fugitive \u2013 a crime she believed would net her the death penalty, upon conviction.\n[29] The principal claimant Ms. XXXXX allegedly became pregnant after these multiple rapes by XXXXX. She knew she would have to leave her hiding place to give birth to the child. She decided she would attempt to go to Canada where her sisters lived. The principal claimants devised a plan to leave Vietnam together. They arranged for fraudulent travel documents and tickets. They purchased photo-substituted Australian passports.\n[30] The principal claimant left Hanoi on or about XXXXX, 2002. She allegedly travelled by bus to Thailand, wearing a disguise, arriving in Bangkok XXXXX, 2002. Ms. XXXXX joined the principal claimant a few days later. They apparently had to await further \u201cwork\u201d to be done on their Australian passports, and therefore waited for four months to leave for Canada. It was never established what type of \u201cwork\u201d would be required that caused such a lengthy delay. However, they apparently had to remain for four months in Thailand, working to support themselves. On XXXXX, 2002 they travelled to Myanmar by plane where they remained for six days.\n[31] From Myanmar they travelled to Canada via Taipei. They made their refugee claims upon arrival at Vancouver International Airport (VIA) on September 20, 2002.\n2. Identity\n[32] Ms. XXXXX identity as a national of Vietnam has been established by her testimony, and the documentary evidence filed, namely, an INTERPOL Warrant bearing her photo and her fingerprints,18 and a false Australian passport in her name.19 In addition, Ms. XXXXX has never denied her identity or her Vietnamese nationality. She testified in Vietnamese and all witnesses who testified on her behalf did so confirming they knew Ms. XXXXX and confirmed details of her life in Vietnam. She entered Canada using a fraudulent Australian passport bearing her true photograph and her son, XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX name.20\n[33] I am satisfied she is a national of Vietnam and of no other country.\n3. Allegations of the Minister\n[34] It is the theory of the Minister that there are serious reasons for considering that Ms. XXXXX has committed serious non-political crimes in Vietnam. The basis for this theory is the existence of an Interpol Warrant from Vietnam that details the crimes she is alleged to have committed. The Minister obtained additional details regarding the drug trafficking transactions over the period of several years.21\n[35] Ms. XXXXX has never denied the existence of the Red Circle Notice.22 She confirmed its existence the moment she arrived in Canada. She told an immigration officer that she was wanted in Vietnam for drug trafficking23, which the Minister submits adds weight to the documents provided by the Vietnamese authorities.\n[36] In addition, the Minister submits that the information filed in these proceedings confirms that Ms. XXXXX and her husband were drug traffickers and he was executed for this offence, and she is wanted for the same offence, and therefore went underground.\n[37] The Minister submits that the principal claimant is closely aligned with many of the key players in the infamous drug smuggling ring convicted in 2000. Some were her customers, and some were her family members. In particular, the evidence with respect to XXXXX XXXXX, a customer of Ms. XXXXX (like Ms. XXXXX), points to the principal claimant\u2019s complicity. According to the Vietnamese authorities, XXXXX XXXXX was involved in drug smuggling with Ms. XXXXX.24\n[38] Mr XXXXX stated that XXXXX XXXXX was one of 20 individuals involved in a major drug trafficking trial and that he too was executed. Ms. XXXXX confirmed he was a customer of hers and likely gave a statement to the police implicating her. She has no evidence of this, and the Minister submits she is speculating.\n[39] The Minister\u2019s counsel submits that there is ample evidence that the principal claimant is not credible, that she has committed the crimes alleged, and that she is a wanted international drug trafficker. He submits that she should therefore be excluded from refugee protection.\n4. Adequacy of the Minister\u2019s Notice\n[40] Counsel argued at the hearing and in final submissions that the specifics of the alleged drug smuggling or other criminal acts were never clearly articulated in the documents provided by Minister\u2019s counsel.\n[41] He claimed, on behalf of his clients, to be uncertain what exactly was being alleged against his client Ms. XXXXX. He argued that the Minister has had months to marshal evidence against his clients, but they have failed to do so.\n[42] Specific acts of trafficking are outlined in the Warrant and supplementary material filed. The Notice of Intention to intervene filed by the Minister in these proceedings met the essential requirements IRPA. It indicated the basis of the intervention, the relationship to Article 1F(b), and detailed why the Minister believed she should be excluded from the definition of Convention refugee. It also attached a copy of the Red Circle Notice, the Vietnamese Warrant for Arrest, and the supplementary information used to obtain that Warrant. It also included a photo and fingerprints of the principal claimant and named family members and clients.\n[43] The opinion that the principal claimant should be excluded was based in part on her statements at the Port of Entry and in her Personal Information Form (PIF).25 She acknowledged that she was wanted by the police in Vietnam for what she alleged were bogus drug charges.\n[44] In my view, the Notice of Intention26 clearly meets the requirements of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and while it does not reach the level of disclosure necessary in a criminal prosecution, it is not required to.\n[45] I am only obliged to find there are \u201cserious reasons for considering\u201d the principal claimant ought to be excluded from refugee protection due to the commission in Vietnam of a serious non-political crime. The issue is whether the Minister has complied with Rule 25(3). The Notice must state the facts and the law on which the Minister relies. The claimant is entitled to such notice so she can know the case against her with sufficient particularity to mount a \u201cdefence\u201d. Whether the facts alleged by the Minister meet the standard or not is at the core of the claim. I find that the documentary evidence filed by the Minister is sufficiently detailed for the claimants to know the position of the Minister and her reasons for that position.\n5. Findings of Fact\n(a) What is the crime alleged?\n[46] The crime the principal claimant is alleged to have committed is international drug trafficking. There is sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence in the Minister\u2019s evidence to support these allegations.27\n[47] The Red Circle Notice28 is based on a Warrant of Arrest issued by the Vietnamese government.29 That Warrant outlines the charges, gives the principal claimant\u2019s correct date of birth, addresses, nationality, and details of the allegations. The Warrant itself, was issued based upon the information provided by the Ministry of Interior\u2019s General Department of People\u2019s Police. It gives a full page of details regarding the allegations of drug trafficking, and names the principal claimant and several of her family members and customers.\n[48] The principal claimant has not persuaded me that false charges have been laid in her case. Her husband was convicted after a trial, and the conviction was later upheld on appeal. I have taken into consideration the evidence of lawyer XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX (that the case against Mr. XXXXX was not strong),30 and am nonetheless not persuaded that false charges were laid against the principal claimant.\n[49] Ms. XXXXX is wanted on a Red Circle Notice from INTERPOL that sets out that she is wanted for drug trafficking. The evidence is that the drug being trafficked is heroin. The crime of heroin trafficking equates in Canada to Article 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.31 Section 5(2) reads as follows:\nTrafficking in substance 5(1) No person shall traffic in a substance included in Schedule I, II, III or IV or in any substance represented or held out by that person to be such a substance.\nPossession for purpose 5(2) No person shall, for the purpose of trafficking, of trafficking possess a substance included in Schedule I, II, III or IV.\nPunishment 5(3) Every person who contravenes subsection (1) or (2)\n(a) subject to subsection (4), where the subject-matter of the offence is a substance included in Schedule I or II, is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for life. (Emphasis added)\n[50] Diacetylmorphone (Heroin) is found in Schedule I at item (10). Therefore, a conviction for trafficking in heroin in Canada has a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.\n(b) Did the principal claimant commit the crime alleged?\n[51] In order to assess whether there are serious reasons for considering that the claimant has committed the crimes alleged, an understanding of who INTERPOL is and their jurisdiction, is instructive.\n[52] INTERPOL\u2019s mandate is to promote international police co-operation among its member countries in solving international crime. This is done through the exchange of criminal intelligence with its member states. The mission of the Asia and South Pacific Sub-Directorate of INTERPOL is \u201cto support ... crime fighting activities by providing quality operational and administrative services on a daily basis through a regionally based geopolitical structure.\u201d The Sub-Directorate\u2019s Goals include the following:\nTo address regional crime issues;\nTo provide adequate support on regional and national levels;\nTo make relevant regionally-based information available;\nTo increase relevant information exchange with regions; and\nTo increase the flow and exchange of information related to the specialized crime areas.32\n[53] Vietnam has been a member of the International Police Organization (INTERPOL) since November 1991.33 The co-operation and collaboration between Vietnam and INTERPOL since 1991 was described in late 2002 as \u201cefficient and practical,\u201d involving the exchange of over 20,000 pieces of information \u201crelated to individual criminals and organised gangs involved in drugs, smuggling and other crimes\u201d.34\n[54] The INTERPOL Warrant for Ms. XXXXX was issued in 1997, and she has been of interest to the police at least since that time. It alleges that the countries the principal claimant has likely visited are: China, Cambodia, Canada and the US. It alleges that Ms. XXXXX is a member of a \u201cdrug trafficking gang\u201d in China, Canada, and elsewhere and that several of her relatives have been arrested in Vietnam for drug trafficking. It says she has fled the country. 35\n[55] An \u201cUrgent Warrant of Arrest\u201d was issued by \u201cFirst Deputy Chief of CID, (Criminal Investigation Division) Security General, Department of the Interior. It lists the principal claimant\u2019s addresses at No XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, XXXXX XXXXX District, Hanoi, and XXXXX XXXXX Rd. A letter went to INTERPOL in Ottawa, Canada on XXXXX, 1998 because it was believed, presumably, given their information, that the principal claimant had ties to Canada. In fact, her two sisters and other family members were here.\n[56] This document implicates the principal claimant and XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, as \u201cdangerous drug traffickers\u201d involved in \u201ctransnational drug trafficking\u201d from Vietnam to Canada and US for \u201cdecades\u201d.36 The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) have been co-operating with the Vietnamese police on this case, since 1992, although the Minister\u2019s counsel has been unable to provide further information. We know that XXXXX XXXXX has not been arrested, but that XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX was arrested in 1991 in Los Angeles37 and that XXXXX XXXXX, a Vietnamese Canadian was arrested for drug trafficking in Canada in 1993 and is likely related to the group.\n[57] The principal claimant submits that she will not get a fair trial in Vietnam because the process of investigation and interrogation of detained persons in Vietnam demonstrates the government\u2019s willingness to use torture or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, to elicit confessions. She argues that the statements made by detainees, including those who have allegedly pointed the finger at the principal claimant, cannot be relied upon. The principal claimant\u2019s allegation is that the government of Vietnam has a vested interest in prosecuting and convicting her in order to execute her as the last of the group of twenty persons accused of drug trafficking in 1997. She alleges they will rush to judgment without due process.\n[58] The principal claimant argues that this evidence, buttressed by general country conditions documents, confirms her position that she will not get a fair trial, she will be tortured upon capture, and detained without regard to international human rights. Accordingly, she urges me to offer her refugee protection.\n[59] Counsel argues that the Minister must establish that the \u201cconfession\u201d by XXXXX was voluntary and the failure to do so must result in a finding that there is insufficient evidence to justify criminal charges in Vietnam. Mr. XXXXX allegedly pointed the finger at Ms. XXXXX. Mr. XXXXX faced execution, therefore had a vested interest in having his sentence commuted from the death penalty to a life sentence. Therefore, given these factors, the submissions goes, it would be dangerous to rely upon Mr. XXXXX evidence to find there are serious reasons for considering that Ms. XXXXX has committed a serious non-political crime.\n[60] There is no evidence to support the principal claimant\u2019s contention that the Warrant was issued based on the word of an informant. In fact, the supplementary information provided suggests that Ms. XXXXX family has been of interest to the Vietnamese police for \u201cdecades\u201d long before the jail house informant allegedly pointed the finger at her.38\n[61] In short, we do not need to rely solely on a jailhouse informant\u2019s death row accusation, if this is in fact the source of Ms. XXXXX problems, as she asserts. Counsel\u2019s argument is therefore not persuasive.\n[62] Moreover, it was the evidence of the lawyer Mr. XXXXX, that Ms. XXXXX did not stand up in court and absolve the principal claimant of involvement in the trafficking case39. He was at the courthouse \u2013 the principal claimant was not. I therefore prefer his evidence to hers.\n[63] Given the level of detail in these documents, I find there are serious reasons for considering the principal claimant has committed criminal acts and that she was involved in a large-scale drug trafficking operation, and has been for years.\n6. Analysis Regarding Exclusion Pursuant to Article 1F(b)\n[64] A significant body of law has developed over the years with respect to exclusion and how Members hearing cases where the Minister is alleging the claimants are excluded from refugee protection, should deal with the evidence. Several factors must be considered in arriving at a determination: whether the crime is political, serious, and whether there are serious reasons for considering the claimant has committed the crimes alleged.\n(a) Is the Crime Political?\n[65] The seriousness of the crime must be weighed in light of the political nature of the crime. In the case at hand, there is nothing political about the charges of drug trafficking. The motivation of the principal claimant when the crime was allegedly committed was non-political. Despite this, the principal claimant alleges that there are political motives behind the charges, however she has not produced any evidence, other than her unsupported allegation, that this is so. She testified it was her belief the police in Vietnam may have charged her in order to extort funds from her, which she said is common. Her allegation is unsupported and does not rebut the credible and trustworthy evidence of the Minister that she was involved in drug trafficking. Her allegation that the charges were falsely laid is not supported by any credible and trustworthy evidence. I do not find any evidence to suggest a political motive when the charges were laid against the principal claimant, or in the surrounding circumstances.\n[66] The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Handbook40 and the courts have analyzed at length, the \u201cpolitical crime exception\u201d rule.41\nAlthough the concept of \u201cpolitical crime\u201d is not normally thought of as known to Canadian criminal law, in two respects at least, the laws of Canada recognize that the consequences of an otherwise criminal act may vary if that act can be characterized as political.\nThe \u201cpolitical offence\u201d exception is thus applicable only when a certain level of violence exists and when those resorting to violence are seeking to accomplish a particular objective such as to bring about political change or to combat violent political opposition.\nThe nature and purpose of the offence require examination, including whether it was committed out of genuine political motives or merely for personal reasons or gain, whether it was directed towards a modification of the political organization or the very structure or the state, and whether there is a close and direct causal link between the crime committed and its alleged political purpose and object. The political element should in principle outweigh the common law character of the offence, which may not be the case if the acts committed are grossly disproportionate to the objective, or are of an atrocious or barbarous nature.42\n[67] There is insufficient evidence, other than the principal claimant\u2019s assertion, of a political motive by the police in Vietnam, when they laid these charges against the principal claimant and her family members. The principal claimant is indirectly suggesting that I assume another person implicated her to protect himself. Other than the principal claimant\u2019s indirect assertion, which I find is not credible; we have no evidence that this is so. In fact there is evidence to the contrary.\n[68] The principal claimant argues she does not fit the profile of a drug trafficker because rather than bribe her way out of trouble; she went into hiding and became destitute. There is insufficient evidence, she argues, that she benefited from drug money. However, this ignores that we have more than simple conjecture in the evidence adduced. There are court documents, police statements, testimony of her husband\u2019s lawyer, and so on. There is much more evidence pointing to a criminal past, than away from one.\n[69] Whether we analyze the facts from the point of view of Ms. XXXXX or her alleged persecutor, I can find no political opinion in the acts alleged. Therefore, I have concluded there is no political motivation behind the actions of the government of Vietnam in the laying of criminal charges against the principal claimant or in the issuance of the Warrant.\n(b) Is the Crime Serious?\n[70] I must be satisfied that the crime in question is \u201cserious\u201d. In Chan43 the Court ruled that drug trafficking offences in Canada could not lead to exclusion under Article 1F(c). The Court made reference to the fact that drug trafficking is a serious non-political crime and goes on to find in obiter that where a crime results in greater than a ten-year sentence, it can be presumed to be a serious crime.\n[71] The UNHCR Handbook44 is instructive in this regard.\n151. The aim of this exclusion clause is to protect the community of a receiving country from the danger of admitting a refugee who has committed a serious common crime. It also seeks to render due justice to a refugee who has committed a common crime (or crimes) of a less serious nature or has committed a political offence.\n155. Minor offences punishable by moderate sentences are not grounds for exclusion under Article 1F(b) even if technically referred to as \u201ccrimes\u201d in the penal law of the country concerned. (Emphasis added)\n[72] The maximum penalty for trafficking in heroin is life imprisonment. This clearly puts a conviction for this activity into the \u201cserious\u201d category, as envisioned in Chan.45 This is not a \u201cminor offence punishable by a moderate sentence\u201d.\n[73] I find as a fact that the crimes alleged are serious.\n[74] Finally, I must be satisfied that the crimes in question were allegedly committed prior to the person entering the country of refuge, which is not in dispute.\n[75] I have also considered whether I must balance the seriousness of the crime, and the fear of persecution as the UNHCR Handbook suggest I must.46 The Court of Appeal in Malouf47 clearly held there is no balancing or proportionality test between the seriousness of the principal claimant\u2019s conduct, and the alleged fear of persecution.\n(c) Are There Serious Reasons to Consider That the Principal Claimant Has Committed A Serious Non-Political Crime?\n(i) Onus of Proof\n[76] The parties agree that the onus is on the Minister to establish there exist \u201cserious reasons to consider\u201d that either or both of the claimants have committed a serious non-political crime. The Federal Court has defined \u201cserious reasons to consider\u201d as less than the civil standard of balance of probabilities but more than mere speculation.48\n[77] There must be a finding that the principal claimant committed a crime in order for the exclusion clauses to apply. The courts have been clear that there is no requirement that the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) be convinced the principal claimant was convicted in her country. It does not in fact, require any outstanding charges in the country of origin, for exclusion to apply.49 A person\u2019s admission is sufficient to establish exclusion. Moreover, had the principal claimant been charged, convicted and served her sentence, exclusion would not apply.50\n(ii) Serious Reasons for Considering\n[78] There is sufficient evidence before the panel to find there are serious reasons to consider that Ms. XXXXX committed a serious non-political crime. There is the previously mentioned INTERPOL Warrant, detailing why she is wanted in Vietnam. In addition, there is her husband\u2019s conviction for trafficking. She is considered to be the accomplice of her husband. Ms. XXXXX provided more detailed information following her discussion with the INTERPOL agents, including information of drug trafficking transactions over the period of many years, or perhaps decades.\n[79] In addition, the documents provided by the Minister\u2019s counsel make a compelling argument that the principal claimant\u2019s roots to international trafficking are tied to her family.\n[80] The documents also confirm that where, like here, the person is out of the country when the Warrant is to be executed, a procedure must be followed. An official of the court or police cannot issue an arrest Warrant unless the Prosecutor has signed off its issuance. Second, the Public Prosecutor supervises the action of the court and the police, and third, for those outside of the country, the government of Vietnam asks INTERPOL\u2019s assistance to help detain and perhaps to extradite.51\n[81] I do not think it necessary to set out in detail the criminal activities alleged, such as the time, place, methods, goods or people affected, which are included in the many documents filed,52 and the testimony of the witnesses.\n[82] I am of the view that the INTERPOL Warrant is trustworthy. The principal claimant has been unable to explain why the government would falsely accuse her of international drug trafficking. The principal claimant\u2019s husband was convicted after a trial. The principal claimant declares herself to be innocent yet chose to stand by while her husband went to trial. She allegedly believed her husband was wrongly arrested in her place. Her husband may not have had the defences available to him that were available to her, had she been tried in his place. For example, she was the lender of the money, not her husband.\n[83] We will never know whether the outcome might have been different had she come forward when she was under suspicion. What we do know is that there is a Red Circle Notice for the principal claimant that has been confirmed by a Canadian diplomat in a face-to-face meeting with INTERPOL police.\n[84] Counsel for the principal claimant argues that there is a presumption of innocence afforded accused persons, at least in Canada. The Warrant is therefore simply an allegation of wrongdoing without real effect until a conviction has taken place.\nThe presumption of innocence cannot apply to the issuance of the documents initiating criminal proceedings because this presumption is inconsistent with an allegation of wrongdoing. One does not issue a warrant for arrest of a person without a reasonable belief that the person has committed a criminal offence.53\nThe Board was entitled to presume the warrant for the appellant\u2019s arrest was issued in the belief that she was guilty of misconduct but it does not apply so as to prevent the Board from taking the Chinese state\u2019s belief in her guilt into account in deciding if there are serious reasons to consider that she committed the crime with which she is charged.54\n\u2026The Board was entitled to consider that it named the appellant, it referred to a specific criminal offence, as well as the time and place when the offence was alleged to have been committed, and stipulated a maximum sentence. All of those details could reasonably lead the Board to give the warrant a certain amount of weight.55\n[85] It is the evidence of Ms. XXXXX, XXXXX Counsellor at the Canadian Embassy in Hanoi, that Ms. XXXXX was involved in drug trafficking going back to 1988, and that her activities\ncontinued until at least 1995.56 Counsel urges that I give no weight to the INTERPOL Warrant, and submits that Ms. XXXXX evidence is problematic. He argues the Warrant is based upon unproven facts.\n[86] The Minister arranged for an investigation of Ms. XXXXX activities by the Canadian Embassy staff in Vietnam. Ms. XXXXX understood her task to be to question witnesses in the area of Ms. XXXXX home and businesses, and to speak with the INTERPOL offices. The Vietnamese police at the INTERPOL offices would have likely been unwilling to disclose information about Ms. XXXXX to Ms. XXXXX, without a legitimate purpose. Ms. XXXXX formed the opinion that she must disclose Ms. XXXXX whereabouts in Canada, in order to obtain more information about why Ms. XXXXX was wanted by the INTERPOL offices.\n[87] It would have been preferable for Ms. XXXXX not to disclose the fact that Ms. XXXXX was in Canada, however, I find that Ms. XXXXX was sensitive to the concerns of privacy and asked and provided only as much information as she felt was required to obtain the necessary information. It is regrettable that she disclosed the principal claimant\u2019s whereabouts. However, I find that her evidence is relevant, probative, obtained without jeopardy to the principal claimant, and provided in a timely manner. As such I am relying upon it to assist in my determination of the claim.\n[88] Ms. XXXXX met with the INTERPOL police, armed with a copy of the INTERPOL Warrant. The evidence demonstrates that the INTERPOL police are Vietnamese police assigned to the INTERPOL office, which is a separate office from the local authorities. While communications are said to be confidential, the fact is the INTERPOL police are charged with the duty of tracking alleged criminals or offenders, who have fled the jurisdiction. In this way, the INTERPOL offices deal not only with international policing forces, but local ones as well. Ms. XXXXX, as a new Consul to the Canadian Embassy, and with limited experience in the area of immigration (although with a lengthy record of employment in the foreign service) disclosed to the INTERPOL police that Ms. XXXXX was in Canada. She did not disclose the principal claimant\u2019s actual whereabouts in Canada.\n[89]\nI have read and prefer the documentary evidence provided by the Minister, which I find is very persuasive and thorough.57 The evidence suggests that the justice system in Vietnam, while very different from Canada\u2019s is not a system that necessarily convicts on fabricated evidence. Evidence of country conditions generally, including the evidence of Mr. XXXXX regarding what took place at Mr. XXXXX trial and appeal, do not provide sufficient doubt about the surrounding circumstances, such that I would question the validity of the INTERPOL Warrant and the evidence upon which it is based. The combination of factors which have not been satisfactorily addressed by the principal claimant, is what makes the Minister\u2019s case so strong.\n[90] Given the number of drug-related convictions in the principal claimant\u2019s immediate family, there are serious reasons for considering the principal claimant committed the offences detailed in the INTERPOL Warrant.\n[91] Justice Kelen in Xie58 held that the IRB is entitled to consider an international Warrant in deciding whether there are serious reasons for considering that the principal claimant has committed a serious non-political crime.\n[92] I am therefore satisfied there are serious reasons for considering the principal claimant has committed a serious non-political crime, and nothing she has alleged in her own defence justifies a different finding.\n[93] Therefore, on the totality of the evidence adduced by the Minister opposing the principal claimant\u2019s claim for refugee protection, I find that XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX is a person referred to in section 98 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (and the Schedule). She is therefore, excluded from the definition of Convention refugee or person in need of protection, as outlined in sections 96 and 97(1) of IRPA. The principal claimant is excluded from all three protection grounds available to refugee claimants, pursuant to Article 1F(b) of the Geneva Convention.59\nThe Xie Decision60\n[94] Having concluded that Ms. XXXXX is excluded from the definition of Convention refugee, should I now go on to deal with whether she has a well-founded fear of persecution? In Xie, the Court had this to say about the Refugee Protection Division\u2019s jurisdiction:\n\u201c\u2026the Board, having found that the exclusion applied, went on to consider whether the applicant was at risk of torture upon her return to China. In my view, the Board exceeded its mandate when it decided to deal with the appellant\u2019s risk of torture upon return with the result that the Minister is not bound by that finding. Once the Board found that the exclusion applied, it had done everything that it was required to do, and there was nothing more it could do, for the appellant. The appellant was now excluded from refugee protection, a matter within the Board\u2019s competence, and was limited to applying for protection, a matter within the Minister\u2019s jurisdiction. The Board\u2019s conclusions as to the appellant\u2019s risk of torture were gratuitous and were an infringement upon the Minister\u2019s responsibilities.\u201d (Emphasis added)61\n[95] The facts in Xie are also similar to those in the present case. The Xie case involved a Red Circle INTERPOL Warrant, which alleged embezzlement, a crime with a maximum penalty of death. In Xie, a letter was filed by the Canadian Embassy in Beijing from China\u2019s Public Security Minister outlining the charges against Xie, and confirming that the Canadian consulate in Guanzhou had advised the Public Service Branch, by letter, that the claimant had made a refugee claim in Canada. They did so in the process of seeking verification of the criminal charges against her in China.\n[96] Counsel submits that the principal claimant faces a very real danger of torture should she return to Vietnam and this \u201ctrumps\u201d the Minister\u2019s application for exclusion. I disagree. The Board is not required to balance the principal claimant\u2019s crimes, real or alleged, against the risk of torture, upon her return to the country of origin.62 The court in Suresh63 prohibited the removal of an individual to a country where there is a risk of torture, in the absence of\n\u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d. It does not require Canada to grant that individual a right of entry as a refugee or person in need of protection.\n[97] The Refugee Protection Division is charged with dealing with issues of entry into Canada, and not removal from Canada, which is the mandate of the Minister at a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) interview. The balancing process required by section 7 of the Charter64 would then take place as part of the PRRA application, which would have the effect of staying the removal order.\n[98] Mr. Justice James Russell in A.C.,65 dealt with the issue of torture and how it impacts an analysis of a claim for refugee protection. In that case, the claimant was convicted in absentia in Bangladesh for his alleged role in a bloody coup in 1975. He was sentenced to death by firing squad. The words of the Court are instructive.\nBehind this Application in my opinion lies a justifiable fear that, if returned to Bangladesh the Principal Applicant at least, could face torture and death. The issue will need to be confronted directly if a decision is made to deport him. The Panel, however, was fixed with considering the status of the Applicants. Within the narrow context of a Decision on refugee status alone, and bearing in mind that the panel only had to conclude that there were \u201cserious reasons\u201d for considering that the Principal Applicant had committed a serious, non-political offence, I believe the panel made no reviewable error.66\n[99] I cannot therefore assess whether the principal claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution in Vietnam, since to do so would be an infringement upon the Minister\u2019s responsibility. Applying this reasoning to the sur place claim (set out below), I find that I have no jurisdiction to deal with this aspect of the claim since the sur place argument relates to the principal claimant\u2019s fear of persecution.\nTHE CLAIM OF XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX\n1. Allegations of XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX\n[100] The associated claimant was married once in 1983 to XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX (no relation to the principal claimant) while she was working in Russia. They had one child together born in 1985. They were divorced in 1990 and she was granted custody of their daughter XXXXX and had possession of the matrimonial home, a small, three-story structure in Hanoi \u2013 the house in which the principal claimant allegedly hid.\n[101] In 1991 she met XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX who helped her recover money she had loaned to someone. They began to live in a common-law relationship in XXXXX 1991.\n[102] She met the principal claimant on a trip to a pagoda in 1993 or 1994. They became very good friends and socialized regularly. She describes the principal claimant\u2019s restaurant as \u201cfancy\u201d and frequented by foreign guests.67 In 1997 when the principal claimant\u2019s troubles began, she went to Ms. XXXXX home. According to Ms. XXXXX, Ms. XXXXX was allegedly very afraid to return to her own home because the police were looking for her.\n[103] Although Ms. XXXXX was afraid of what might happen to her for harbouring the principal claimant, she acquiesced and permitted Ms. XXXXX to stay with her. She confirmed the principal claimant stayed in a small attic room hidden from view for five years, and never left the house. She did all of the shopping, cooking and cared for Ms. XXXXX.\n[104] She alleges that when XXXXX began to hit her, he also began to sexually assault the principal claimant. The associated claimant did not blame her friend for these sexual acts; rather, she sympathized with her. She realised XXXXX was very dangerous and that she had to leave him. When she confronted him, he told her he would report her to the police for harbouring Ms. XXXXX. Believing she could be executed for this act, it was decided that she and Ms. XXXXX would leave Vietnam.\n[105] She left her daughter with her common-law spouse, and the two claimants left Vietnam, making their way to Canada to seek protection. The associated claimant testified that she is in touch with her daughter.\n2. Identity\n[106] Ms. XXXXX identity as a national of Vietnam has been established by her oral testimony and the documentation filed, namely a birth certificate,68 an Australian passport,69 and an identity card.70 She entered Canada using a fraudulent Australian passport, bearing her true name and photograph.71 I am satisfied she is a national of Vietnam and of no other country.\n3. Allegations of the Minister\n[107] The Minister is of the opinion that the associated claimant should be excluded pursuant to Article 1F(b) by virtue of her activities in harbouring Ms. XXXXX for five years as well as her participation in helping Ms. XXXXX escape Vietnam. She is therefore an \u201caccessory after the fact\u201d.\n[108] Article 23(1) of the Criminal Code of Canada72 reads:\nAccessory after the fact\u2014An accessory after the fact to an offence is one who, knowing that a person has been a party to an offence, receives, comforts or assists that person for the purpose of enabling that person to escape.\n[109] The three requirements for a person to be convicted of this crime include: the person must have knowledge that a crime has been committed; the person must show a desire to help the delinquent escape; and the person must engage in a positive act of omission to aid him in making his escape. 73\n[110] The Minister argues that it is clear from Ms. XXXXX evidence, if I find her evidence is credible, that she fits all three of the above requirements.\n[111] Mr XXXXX argues further that since section 463(a) [(the penalty section for section 23 (1)] of the Criminal Code of Canada74 carries a maximum penalty of 14 years, it falls within the \u201cserious non-political crime\u201d definition set out above.\n4. Exclusion pursuant to Article 1F(b)\n[112] There is insufficient evidence that the authorities in Vietnam are interested in the associated claimant. We do not have a Warrant for her arrest, or any information to suggest that she is wanted by INTERPOL or the Vietnamese authorities for harbouring Ms. XXXXX, or for any other reason.\n[113] I find that Ms. XXXXX should not be excluded pursuant to Article 1F(b) by virtue of her activities for allegedly harbouring Ms. XXXXX for five years as well as her alleged participation in helping Ms. XXXXX escape Vietnam, because I am not persuaded she did in fact harbour Ms. XXXXX or help her escape from Vietnam. The story is implausible in my view and this, together with the other credibility concerns, has caused me to conclude the story is concocted.\n[114] In addition, there is no evidence of criminal charges in Vietnam. This fact alone suggests there is reason to doubt the fact that Ms. XXXXX was in hiding for several years in Ms. XXXXX attic.\n[115] There is insufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to find her excluded. Therefore, there are no serious reasons for believing that the associated claimant committed a serious non-political crime.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution (Inclusion)\n[116] Ms. XXXXX testified that she was concerned that Mr. XXXXX was a \u201cdangerous man\u201d. She alleges he is very violent, that he raped Ms. XXXXX on a number of occasions and she was concerned for their personal safety. She testified that she overheard him ordering people killed and witnessed a stabbing.75 She said her boyfriend was highly connected and acted with impunity.76 She described him as \u201cchief\u201d77 and or \u201cleader\u201d78 of a criminal gang \u2013 a \u201cgangster\u201d.79\n[117] I find it noteworthy that none of this is mentioned in her Personal Information Form (PIF)80 or in her interview with Canada Immigration at the Port of Entry.81 In addition, at the hearing for the first time, we learned that her boyfriend was actually allegedly married to another woman,82 and that he travelled back and forth between her house and his.83 These are critical details that were not part of her claim at the Port of Entry,84 or in her PIF.85\n[118] In addition to these significant omissions in her evidence, there are plausibility concerns with her story. Is it reasonable that she would she leave her vulnerable young daughter in the care of this violent, murderous, sexual assaulting predator?86 The associated claimant was asked about this in the hearing. She replied that she had hoped her father or brother would keep her daughter safe, although she admitted that she had made no provision for this.87\n[119] Is it reasonable she would not have asked her brother, a police officer, for assistance with her boyfriend?\n[120] Is it plausible, given her boyfriend\u2019s violent personality and police connections, that Ms. XXXXX would apply for a Vietnamese passport in her own name and go through a police clearance to obtain it, one week before her departure, rather than use her falsely obtained Australian passport as Ms. XXXXX did?88\n[121] The fact that Ms. XXXXX obtained her own passport, visited her parents, and arranged to leave the country are contrary to her claim of a fear of reprisals from her gangster boyfriend with high connections and her alleged fear she could face the death penalty for harbouring Ms. XXXXX Is it plausible her boyfriend would not have reported her to the police? Why has he not gone to the police if his threat to report the two women\u2019s activities was a real one? Mr. XXXXX could have reported her activities to the authorities if he is so inclined, given his apparent police connections. Apparently, he is not so inclined. I think it is reasonable to assume that if criminal\ncharges of any kind have been laid against the associated claimant, we would have had evidence of this in the hearing.\n[122] The Immigration Officer who interviewed the associated claimant noted the contradictions in both claimants\u2019 information when they were asked questions about their travel to Canada, and other aspects of their refugee claims.89\n[123] I have considered the Chairperson\u2019s Gender Guidelines,90 because the associated claimant has alleged she has a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of her membership in a particular social group, as a woman.\n[124] Because of the credibility concerns noted above, I find her evidence is patently unreliable and have therefore concluded there is insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence upon which to make a finding that the associated claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution.\n[125] Even if I accepted the associated claimant did in fact harbour Ms. XXXXX this would make her a fugitive from justice, nothing more. She alleges that she is afraid she will be arrested for harbouring Ms. XXXXX. Rather than remain in Vietnam to see whether charges ever materialized, she fled. What she fears is prosecution for the violation of a law of general application, and not persecution for a Convention ground.\n[126] I do not believe she is being truthful with the Board and therefore do not believe what she has alleged in support of her claim.\n[127] The onus of proof is on the claimant to establish a well founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason, or that there are serious reasons for believing she is otherwise at risk. She has not established on reliable evidence that what she fears is persecution, or a risk to life, or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or of torture.\nSur Place Claim\n[128] Concern was expressed that an article published in The Asian Post on October 10-23, 2002 referred to the two claimants. Counsel accuses the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, or her delegate of releasing this confidential information about these claims to The Asian Post.91\n[129] He further asserts that it is \u201cwell-known that that [sic] Vietnamese government has spies in Vietnamese communities overseas, including in the one [sic] in the Lower Mainland\u201d.92 Counsel for the claimants has advanced no evidence that the Vietnamese government has spies in the Lower Mainland and he has had many months to do so, if such evidence was available. Counsel is attempting to lead evidence through his submissions.\n[130] The claimants were not named in this article, which was written two years ago. No repercussions or fallout from this article has been demonstrated. The claimants could have brought such evidence and it would have been considered along with the other evidence in the claim. Moreover, the information about this case is known only to the parties since the hearing was held in camera.\n[131] Counsel accuses the Minister of breaching the confidentiality of these proceedings, without a scintilla of evidence to support this assertion. The claimants\u2019 families could also have released this information to The Asian Post. I refuse to speculate about how this information found its way into the newspaper. The claimants have had two years to produce evidence that this article has come to the attention of the authorities in Vietnam. They still have family members and friends there who could have provided evidence that the authorities knew about the article and there were problems as a result. They have not provided any evidence that this has occurred.\n[132] I do not know whether the Vietnamese government has spies in Vancouver. This is conjecture on the claimants\u2019 part. There is simply no credible evidence before this panel to conclude there is a sur place claim.\n[133] Therefore, there is insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to find the associated claimant is a Convention refugee. Whether the claim is framed pursuant to section 96 or section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the outcome is the same. There is insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence upon which to found a claim for refugee protection.\nDETERMINATION\n[134] Pursuant to section 98 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, I find the principal claimant XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, is a person referred to in section F of Article 1 of the Geneva Convention. She is therefore not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. Her application for refugee protection is therefore rejected.\n[135] The associated claimant XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX is not a Convention refugee, as she does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Vietnam. I also find the associated claimant is not a person in need protection in that her removal to Vietnam would not subject her personally to a risk to her life, or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, and in that there are no substantial grounds to believe that her removal to Vietnam will subject her personally to a danger of torture. Her application for refugee protection is therefore rejected.\n[136] For the reasons given, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the associated claimant is a person referred to in section F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention.\n\u201cPaulah Dauns\u201d\nPaulah Dauns\nDecember 23, 2004\nDate\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - EXCLUSION CLAUSES - ART. 1F(b) - SERIOUS NON-POLITICAL CRIME - DRUG TRAFFICKING - CREDIBILITY - FEMALE - NEGATIVE - VIETNAM\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), S.C. 2001, c. 27.

He seeks refugee protection because he worked as a government official in Algeria and this makes him the target of armed Islamic groups in his country while, on the other hand, he is wanted by Algerian authorities who suspect that because he left his government job he went to join armed Islamic groups in the mountains. Now they would also be suspicious of the fact he has lived abroad for a long time. In addition, he claims to be a refugee on religious grounds because when living in Taiwan he became a Christian convert and as an apostate he would be in danger from Muslim fundamentalists and others in Algeria. Also his fundamental human right to freedom of religion would be violated by the clandestine way he would be forced to practice Christianity if returned to Algeria.\nWhile visiting the US in 1998-99 his one-year visa expired and he made an affirmative asylum claim because he did not want to return to Algeria or Taiwan. Believing that his claim had been rejected he returned to Taiwan in late XXXXX 2001 and only found out in Canada, when he obtained a copy of his official US file, that he had been granted asylum just a few days after his departure.\nSUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS\nAccording to the claimant's original Personal Information Form (PIF),1 he was born in the city of XXXXX in Algeria, and lived and worked there continuously, between 1963 and 1994, except for the fou-year period when he earned a certificate to be a XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX in the city of Algiers. He was employed by the city of Constantine in a position of this kind from XXXXX 1991 until his departure from Algeria in XXXXX 1994.\nAs a civil servant he was assigned to work at the polling station in the first round of the 1991 elections. The FIS (Islamic Salvation Front) protested that the election was not fair and there was talk that there would be recriminations against government officials if the FIS came to power. Although the FIS won the election, the president dissolved parliament and a military government took power and cancelled the election result.\nThe government seized the Islamic University and Mosque under construction in Constantine; XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX. Many people were loyal to the FIS and made threats on the walls of the building and there were bomb scares. He received anonymous calls at home. He asked his employer to be reassigned but was refused because all of the other workers wanted transfers too. The civil conflict worsened with the terrorists killing people and the government arresting everyone they suspected of being terrorists. The economic situation was very grim and the government was diverting all available funds for security uses. The risk of investigation was severe and if one was to resign from a government job they would automatically be suspect as a terrorist.\nAmid this chaos the claimant prepared to leave the country and assembled all the documents he needed for a visa. In XXXXX 1993 on his way to Algiers the bus he was riding was stopped at a roadblock by people wearing camouflage clothes, armed with machine guns. In this encounter he lost his backpack that carried all his belongings, life savings and identity documents. He borrowed money and tried to obtain new documents. By XXXXX 1994 he had organized things and found a way to get a French visitor visa, and so he left for France.\nHowever, the claimant found it hard to survive in France and could not get his visa renewed. So he obtained a visa for Taiwan where a female friend of his lived. They married in 1995 and he finally obtained a temporary resident visa valid for three years. In Taiwan the claimant experienced problems with the language and culture and documents, as well as racial discrimination.\nIn 1998 he got a chance to go America. He wanted further training that would help him support his family, and an American pastor whom he had met in Taipei had encouraged him to go to learn more about his new religious faith. The claimant was baptized on XXXXX, 1997 and states in his PIF that he has been a practicing Christian since then.\nWhen his US visa expired he did not want to return to Algeria or Taiwan and sought some advice. His counsel advised him to apply for asylum. He states in the PIF that his application was rejected on the grounds that he still had temporary residence in Taiwan and after he received a letter from the INS (US Immigration and Naturalization Service) of their intent to deny his application, he went back to the Republic of China in XXXXX 2001. There his situation was complicated by the expiration of his residence visa, and his wife getting pregnant for a\nsecond time, even though they were not on good terms. By the time he received a one-year visa extension, until XXXXX 2002, he and his wife were already divorced - he gives the date of the divorce as XXXXX 2001 in the PIF. He had no other way but to leave the country when the residence visa expired. He learned about Canada and tried to apply for a visa but it was refused without a reason.\nThe claimant went to Thailand where he bought a French passport and then destroyed his Algerian passport in order to carry just one with him on the trip. He flew via Hong Kong and arrived in Vancouver on XXXXX, 2002.\nIn the original PIF, the claimant states that he was mistreated by Canadian immigration authorities. Specifically, he was kept for extended periods in solitary confinement and interrogated by Immigration, the RCMP and CSIS (Canadian Security Intelligence Service). He was isolated and not given access to a lawyer until XXXXX, 2002. He was detained for one month even after he had established his identity and was shocked at this treatment.\nIn an amendment to the PIF signed on August 6, 2003, the claimant lists his sister XXXXX as residing in Bern, Switzerland rather than in Constantine, Algeria and provides details of his work history in France, Taiwan, and Thailand. He also lists other travel destinations including Malaysia and Hong Kong and various places in China. His amendment to the narrative statement includes further allegations of mistreatment by Canadian officials when he made his refugee claim at the Vancouver International Airport (VIA).\nANALYSIS\nISSUES\nThe following issues were identified: personal identity; Christian religion; credibility; subjective basis related to his previous claim elsewhere (US) and re-availment; agents of persecution; objective basis and change of circumstances; and Internal Flight Alternative (IFA). The claimant's alleged Christian conversion was recognized as a sur place claim.\nIn counsel's submission, the evidence that raises the issue of re-availment is in the excluded port of entry notes and therefore cannot be considered in the determination of the claim. The Refugee Protection Division has found there is no other evidentiary basis for the issue.\nExclusion of Port of Entry Notes\nCounsel made oral application at the outset of the hearing to have certain port of entry notes excluded from the evidence before the Board: Schedule 1 - Background Information, dated XXXXX, 2002; CSIS examination notes dated XXXXX, 2002; statutory declaration of the Immigration Officer, XXXXX XXXXX, dated XXXXX, 2002; and four pages of notes included in the XXXXX, 2003 disclosure by Minister's counsel. On the basis of the claimant's affidavit dated XXXXX, 2003, and an amendment the claimant had made to his PIF the same day, counsel argued that Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) had violated the claimant's rights under sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (Charter).\nAccording to the affidavit and the PIF amendment, the claimant was mistreated by Immigration and other Canadian officials the day he arrived at the Vancouver International Airport (VIA) on a flight from Hong Kong on XXXXX, 2002, between 10:00 and 11:00 a.m. and in the days that followed. He had already been told by airport security prior to boarding his plane in Hong Kong that there was a problem with his passport - described elsewhere in his PIF as a French passport in the name of XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX that had been improperly obtained.\nAt VIA, I was referred to an examination room. I told the officer there that my passport was fraudulent and that I wished to seek safety in Canada. When I told the officer that I was from Algeria, he said to sit and wait. Throughout the course of the day, I was interrogated by many different people. Some with guns, some with suits and dark glasses, a woman, and one man with a leather jacket and a gun. They asked me questions about my travel, my opinions, and often joked and insinuated that I was a terrorist. I was searched, handcuffed and put in a cell at different times. My jacket was taken from me, and I was cold. I was prevented from sleeping, and even from lying down. I was given only a vegetable sandwich and a juice box to eat. I was threatened. I was terribly afraid.\nLater in the day, I met with Immigration Officer XXXXX XXXXX. She would ask me questions and then would be called away. Late in the night of XXXXX XXXXX, 2002 and into the early morning of XXXXX XXXXX she asked me more questions, the answers to which she typed on a compute. I later learned that these questions and answers given were the same as those found on Schedule 1 and Officer XXXXX declaration. I knew that it was close to midnight because there was a clock on the wall and because Officer XXXXX and her supervisor complained repeatedly about how late it was getting and were pressuring me to finish.\nAs I was completely traumatized by the treatment I had received throughout the course of the day I have no recollection of being told that\nI had a right to a lawyer. I do remember at one point in time, after Officer XXXXX had completed filling out answers on the computer that I has handed the phone and told a lawyer was on the line. Because I had been mistreated for so long I did not believe the person I was speaking to was a lawyer, but rather that it was some kind of trick or game that was being played on me. All the lawyer said was \"don't worry, be good, do what they say.\" A few minutes afterwards I was told by Officer XXXXX supervisor that I would be detained. I was never told the reason for my detention.\nI was similarly treated over the next three days, but did not see a lawyer until Monday, XXXXX, 2002, just shortly before my first detention hearing.2\nEssentially counsel argued in light of these allegations that the claimant had not been subjected to the kind of \"routine\" secondary examination at the port of entry, which was the benchmark for the Supreme Court's findings in the lead case, Dehghani.3 The court had ruled in 1993, concerning the appellant's arrival in Canada in 1989 without valid travel or identity documents, that an examination by an immigration officer for refugee screening does not constitute detention within the meaning of section 10(b) of the Charter, and the principles of fundamental justice cited in section 7 of the Charter do not include a right to counsel during such questioning.4\nIn counsel's submission, the physical restraint and psychological compulsion the claimant describes in the affidavit and PIF amendment was anything but \"routine.\" He surmised that the people with guns must have been RCMP officers or agents of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), since Immigration officers do not carry firearms. He emphasized that the claimant had been kept in a \"holding cell\" intermittently over a period of approximately twelve hours from the time he was referred for secondary examination and he was taken downstairs to the airport detention centre to stay overnight. In his opinion, even the questioning exceeded what was necessary to determine whether the claimant was eligible to make a refugee\nclaim and admissible to Canada, the twofold statutory requirement. He also argued that the claimant's examination was not routine because a CSIS officer had participated in the Immigration Officer's interview.\nBoth the claimant and the Immigration Officer, XXXXX XXXXX, testified about what had happened at the port of entry during the claimant's secondary examination. Officer XXXXX had also made a brief statutory declaration in writing.5 Their respective evidence was contradictory on key alleged facts in the claimant's PIF amendment.\nFor her part, Officer XXXXX stated that she recalled and had in the meantime verified that the RCMP was not involved with the claimant's secondary examination, although there were RCMP officers in plain clothes questioning someone else at the time. A CSIS officer who wore a suit and glasses (not dark glasses) did sit in during her interview of the claimant on XXXXX XXXXX and questioned him the following day while she took notes. She testified that airport policy prohibits firearms on the premises by anyone, including US immigration officers who normally are armed. She did not handcuff the claimant herself and could not remember anyone else doing so until he was taken downstairs to sleep in a different facility at the airport, the B.C. Holding Centre, whose policy requires that those being transferred from the CIC area be handcuffed. She noted that complaints about the cold are common but the commissioner supplies blankets upon request. She denied that she or anyone else made jokes or comments to the effect that the claimant was a terrorist. Officer XXXXX was aware from the file that two other Immigration officers had spoken to the claimant before she came on duty: one was a member of the disembarkation team who brought him from the airline gate to the CIC area and placed him in a line-up and the other was the officer at the counter to whom he stated his claim to refugee status and how he planned to obtain his genuine identity documents.\nOfficer XXXXX described in detail the steps she had taken to inform the claimant of his legal right to counsel (through a French interpreter by telephone) at 22:25 hours on XXXXX, 2002, approximately five hours after she had been given his file and started the interview. She explained her annotations on the Notice of Rights6 that the claimant had signed when the Schedule 1 examination was completed and she received approval by the Senior Immigration Officer to detain him for identity purposes - to allow him further opportunity to obtain his own identity documents. She testified that in her belief he had fully understood that he has the right to counsel because he signed this document; otherwise she assumed he would have said something as he had been very vocal throughout the examination and had asked a lot of questions. As to the delay of a couple of hours between the time the claimant was administered his Charter rights and actually had the chance to talk to a lawyer by telephone, Officer XXXXX explained the procedure is for her to leave a message and once the legal aid duty counsel has picked it up and arranged to have an interpreter by telephone he or she calls back and speaks to the refugee claimant. According to her evidence, the claimant took this call at 00:35 hours on XXXXX, 2002. There appeared to be no dispute in oral testimony that while awaiting the return call from Legal Aid, Officer XXXXX was busy preparing her paperwork and did not resume questioning the claimant.\nOfficer XXXXX was a very credible and guileless witness while the claimant was not. In this area of his oral evidence, he was vague and repetitious and kept suggesting that he had been so traumatized and afraid at the port of entry that he could not remember the details of what had happened. The Refugee Protection Division prefers Officer XXXXX evidence of what took place at VIA during the secondary examination over the claimant's dramatic account in the amended PIF.\nMore specifically, the claimant's admission at the hearing that he had the benefit of a lawyer at every single stage of his previous asylum claim in the US casts doubt on his explanation that because of \"cultural\" differences he did not know about the concept of a right to counsel and therefore did not even think to ask the legal aid duty counsel on the telephone his name or how to get in touch with him again. Objective information about the justice system in Algeria also discredits the notion of a cultural factor because it shows that, following the French model, defendants have the constitutional right to legal counsel in the claimant's own country.7 With this national background, if the claimant really thought he was being treated like a criminal upon arrival in Canada, he should have been prompted to seek legal assistance.\nThe lack of credible evidence of physical or psychological mistreatment or verbal abuse at the port of entry undermines the claimant's allegation that as a consequence he thought it was a trick when Officer XXXXX had handed him the telephone and said it was a lawyer he could talk to about his situation. In addition, Officer XXXXX testified that she expressly informed him of the reason for his detention, as required under the Charter. Even if he had trouble understanding what she meant, however, it is difficult to believe that the claimant would not have grasped that the basic reason for his detention was because he needed to prove his true identity to Canadian authorities, since he was fully aware that the French passport he had used to come to Canada was fraudulent and he had not yet succeeded in efforts to obtain his own identity documents, initially from Switzerland.\nAs to the proposition that the claimant was formally detained when he was physically placed in a separate room for intervals during the secondary examination process, Officer XXXXX pointed out this so-called \"holding cell\" is in reality a room for one person with windows and a washroom, which does not have bars. In her description of it, this small individual waiting room is distinctly different from the detention centre downstairs at VIA. Although the room has a surveillance monitor and the door is locked to restrict access to public areas in the airport, the other waiting area for women and children either making refugee claims or awaiting removal from Canada is also locked as a matter of routine for the sake of public safety and security purposes. Access by refugee claimants to the nearby baggage area and airport exits is necessarily restricted until decisions on admissibility are made.\nMoreover, the credibility of the claimant's allegation that he regarded this room as a \"cell\" and thought he was treated like a \"criminal\" throughout the day is undermined by his failure to make a complaint to the legal aid lawyer later that night, or to have duty counsel raise the matter at his first detention hearing.8 (Counsel submitted that the Immigration Division could not grant him a remedy, only the Refugee Protection Division was in a position to do so - by excluding the port of entry notes. However, the Refugee Protection Division does not accept that such a fine legal point would reasonably have occurred to the claimant on his own and stopped him from voicing his grievance about his alleged mistreatment.) As it was, in his original narrative statement of the PIF signed January 6, 2003 the claimant alleged that he was isolated and kept for extended periods in \"solitary confinement\" and not given access to a lawyer until XXXXX, 2002 - the latter allegation is disproved by Officer XXXXX documented oral evidence.\nIn summary, the claimant provided insufficient credible evidence to distinguish his experience from that of his forerunner, the appellant Abdul Rassoul Dehghani, in 1989. The reason the Refugee Protection Division allowed the application to exclude the specified port of entry notes was decidedly not that the claimant had been mistreated by Immigration officials at the port of entry, or denied the right to counsel at the point Officer XXXXX recommended and her supervisor decided to detain him. Rather it was that he should have been advised of his right to counsel as soon as the CSIS agent indicated to Officer XXXXX that he was going to join her in interviewing the claimant.\nAccording to her oral evidence, this was the first time Officer XXXXX had had a CSIS agent present during a secondary examination of a refugee claimant and her supervisor failed to instruct her that this circumstance may amount to a constitutional detention under the Supreme Court ruling in Dehghani and that she should advise him of his Charter rights. Yet the CIC manual for Port of Entry examinations states the following:\nThe right to counsel depends on what transpires after the foreign national is first subject to examination\n* if a foreign national is being examined and the examination does not go beyond what is required to establish admissibility the foreign national is not entitled to legal counsel;\n* if the examination becomes very lengthy and exhaustive yet not beyond what is required to establish admissibility the foreign national is not entitled to legal counsel. The officer may, however, give consideration to allowing the foreign national to acquire legal counsel;\n* if the foreign national is not retrained in any way but advised to come back the next day for further examination (A23), then they are not detained and there is no right to counsel;\n* if a foreign national is being held for a lengthy period of time and is subject to questioning by other agencies such as the RCMP or CSIS, then this may constitute detention and the foreign national should be notified of their right to counsel;\n* if restraining devices are used or the foreign national is placed in a holding cell, even temporarily, then an officer should inform the foreign national of the reason for the detention and of their right to counsel;\n* if the foreign national is detained overnight in a detention facility, the foreign national shall be advised of their right to counsel once the decision to detain has been made by an officer.9 (Emphasis Added)\nOfficer XXXXX testified that although she knew about the court decision in Dehghani she was not aware of this detailed interpretation in the CIC manual and does not recall whether it was in the edition of the manual in use when she was trained. In reference to the point highlighted above, her belief was that the secondary examination can, as a matter of routine procedure, be conducted as a \"joint interview\" by the Immigration officer and a CSIS agent if the circumstances warrant.\nThe Refugee Protection Division notes that the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) makes no provision for the secondary examination to involve anyone other than an authorized Immigration officer.10 That is not to suggest that participation by CSIS in the interviews is necessarily inappropriate. On the contrary, the Refugee Protection Division accepts the argument made by both Minister's counsel and the RPO in oral submissions on the application that among the objectives of the IRPA is the promotion of international justice and security by denying access to Canadian territory to persons, including refugee claimants, who are security risks or serious criminals.11 The conditions that constitute inadmissibility are spelled out in detail in the IRPA and include areas where CSIS could apparently be of assistance in the Immigration officer's fact-finding.12\nHowever, the presence of CSIS at the secondary examination did not arise in the facts in the case of Dehghani. The Refugee Protection Division believes it is reasonable to assume that the direction in the CIC manual for port of entry examinations reflects a considered legal opinion by the Department that the contemporary practice of conducting joint interviews with CSIS during the secondary examination could well be distinguishable in law from the Supreme Court ruling. In the absence of a definitive legal interpretation of this practice by the courts, however, the manual states only that when a foreign national is subject to questioning by other agencies such as CSIS, this \"may constitute detention,\" leaving open the possibility that the courts could eventually rule either way, that direct involvement by CSIS does or does not go beyond the routine immigration processing defined in Dehghani, as conducted in the post-September 11, 2001 context, under the newer legislative framework of the IRPA. Still, the instruction in the CIC manual leaves little room for discretion on the part of the Immigration officer in stating that in this situation the foreign national should be notified of the right to counsel. (It is not quite as strong as the word \"shall\" applied in the event of overnight detention in a detention facility, but categorical nonetheless.) The Refugee Protection Division regards this instruction as the Department's practical way to manage the risk of possible misapplication of Dehghani in the present day.\nIt is of no relevance that the CSIS agent simply sat in but asked no questions during the first day of the secondary examination, XXXXX, 2002, only the following day when the joint interview continued. In light of Officer XXXXX testimony that the CSIS agent could have asked questions from the start, this meant the claimant was \"subject to questioning\" by CSIS at all times during the secondary examination.\nThe Refugee Protection Division found there were grounds to exclude the specified port of entry notes in Officer XXXXX failure to follow the direction in the CIC manual (notwithstanding her lack of awareness), which appears to reflect that Department's legal opinion that the direct involvement of CSIS may take the secondary examination of a refugee claimant beyond that which the Supreme Court in Dehghani established to be routine. Exercising a similar abundance of caution, the Refugee Protection Division allowed counsel's application and excluded from evidence the information that may have been obtained at the port of entry through a breach of the claimant's Charter rights and not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.\nHaving already decided that the claimant should have been informed of his right to counsel on the basis of the participation of CSIS in the secondary examination, it was not necessary for the Refugee Protection Division to make a finding as to whether or not the accommodation where the claimant was intermittently held is a \"holding cell\" for the purposes of the CIC manual or constitutes detention under section 10(b) of the Charter.\nPersonal Identity\nThe Refugee Protection Division finds there are serious reasons to doubt the reliability and trustworthiness of the claimant's documents that indicate his personal identity to be XXXXX XXXXX, a national of Algeria and only Algeria. There is ample evidence to show that he has used this identity in Taiwan and the United States before coming to Canada but whether it is his true identity (and he alone assumed it) is still in question.\nOne general cause for concern is the ease with which the claimant talked about obtaining fraudulent documents for himself. In the PIF he notes that he \"found a way to get\" a French visa in 1994 that allowed him to leave Algeria and live in France for a while. In oral testimony he described how in 1998, with the aid of a former colleague of his sister XXXXX, in Geneva, who had transferred and was then working in the Algerian Embassy in Tokyo, he was able to pay someone to have a fake paper issued saying he was a resident of Japan. Allegedly this in turn allowed the Embassy to issue him a new Algerian passport since residence in Japan was a requirement (and there was not an Algerian Embassy in Taiwan). However, in 2002, with the expiration of his residence visa in Taiwan and his divorce pending, he needed a \"good\" passport to travel to Canada so went to Thailand and \"bought\" a French passport.13 This evidence is at odds with the indignation the claimant expressed at times in the hearing when the authenticity of his identity documents was challenged.\nThe Refugee Protection Division finds that the copy of the claimant's putative Algerian passport issued in 1998 in Japan merits little weight because of his convoluted story of how it was improperly obtained and the fact the claimant has not produced the original. He testified that in Bangkok he threw away this genuine Algerian passport (despite all the effort to obtain it), after getting the fraudulent French one. Supposedly he was advised not to travel to Canada with both in his possession and he did not know anyone in Taiwan with whom he could have left it for safe-keeping - which is dubious given his evidence that he had resided in that country for more than four years, in two different places. The Refugee Protection Division draws an adverse inference as to the reliability and trustworthiness of this identity document from the claimant's failure to produce the original, without a reasonable explanation, for examination by Canadian authorities.\nFurthermore, his evidence that the issuance of this Algerian passport was dependent on him being a resident of Japan is inconsistent with the fact that the copy plainly shows his domicile as being in Ilan in Taiwan, Republic of China.14 In addition, his original PIF gives the whereabouts of his sister, XXXXX, as Constantine, Algeria, while his oral evidence about her in the context of this passport is that she is employed by the XXXXX XXXXX in Geneva and has lived in Europe for a long time. The claimant tried to suggest that he made an error in the PIF because he thought the information was all about him, but this is not credible. The question that asks the claimant to list relatives and indicate their place and country of residence was interpreted to him when he prepared the PIF and he had the benefit of legal counsel.\nAt a resumption of the hearing the Presiding Member asked the claimant in reference to the copy in the US record whether he had only one Algerian passport and, for once he answered in a spontaneous forthright manner, words to the effect, \"Of course, I had just one. This is the passport I left my country with.\" When the Presiding Member pointed out that was not his prior evidence, the claimant quickly corrected himself and testified that he wanted to say it was the passport he left the US with. What had precipitated the question was the claimant's inconsistent evidence as to the expiry date of the 1998 passport - the copy in the US record indicates it was XXXXX, 2003 while he had informed an Immigration Officer this passport had expired in XXXXX 2002.15\nThe documents that the claimant ostensibly obtained from Algeria, sent via his sister in Switzerland, are of dubious probative value partly because he was not able to specify in advance which they were likely to be, and said he had asked his family to send whatever documents they could find in his name.16 Yet it is reasonable to expect that the claimant would have known the sort of identity documents he left behind in Algeria, particularly because according to the PIF, in XXXXX 1993, shortly before he had left Algeria he lost all of his belongings, life savings, and documents, including his passport, ID, and driver's license, to armed rebels at a roadblock on his way to Algiers, in an area \"famous for rebels of the GIA and GIS.\" He states that he tried to get new documents but it was very difficult, almost impossible (without saying what the problem was), but managed to do so.\nThe main Algerian identity documents that have arrived in Canada to prove his identity were issued on their face during the period XXXXX 1993 - XXXXX 1994. They include: a National Identification Card issued XXXXX, 1993; 17 a \"replacement\" Driver's License issued XXXXX, 1993; 18and a duplicate military exemption card issued XXXXX, 1994. 19 There is also an International Driver's Permit dated XXXXX, 1994 (which strangely enough the claimant must have left behind when he departed);20 and even a pay stub issued XXXXX, 1993.\nAccording to the report of the forensic analysis by CIC,21 the claimant received two other employment records written in French, one a translation, dated 1988 and 1991 respectively, from different ministries of the Algerian government referencing his duties in construction. Similarly the report of the forensic analysis includes a copy of an extract from the birth registry in Constantine that appears to have been issued XXXXX, 2002 just after the claimant arrived in Canada (the date is very faint on the CIC copy). These three documents were not tendered directly in the refugee claim nor were the originals presented for examination at the hearing (although it is possible they were seized by CIC and were no longer in the claimant's possession). The CIC analyst did not assess their authenticity because the employment records were not considered identity documents and the birth certificate contained no security features.\nLastly, the claimant provided his putative Voter's Card issued on XXXXX, 1990,22 which bears a stamp indicating that the holder voted in June 1990. According to the objective country information there were local elections in June 1990 in Algeria, and the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) won a landslide victory in all major cities. However, the claimant states in his PIF that he worked at a polling station in a national election in 1991, and in that context it is reasonable to expect that his voter's card would be stamped for that election too. The card does not bear a photograph or the holder's signature.\nConsidering all of this evidence, the Refugee Protection Division finds that little trust can be placed in the documents obtained by the claimant while he was in detention in Vancouver to establish his personal identity and afterward to bolster that identity. More likely than not the subsequent story in the PIF about the confiscation of previous documents by rebels at a roadblock has been concocted to provide a justification for the clustered dates of issuance and pristine physical condition of the main identity documents submitted.\nIt emerged in the course of testimony that the claimant's father had worked in France his whole life. Initially the claimant said his father had French citizenship and did not want it at the time, then immediately amended this to say it was possible for him at the time (before 1973 when every Algerian working in France was eligible) but he did not want it. This new evidence raises questions about the claimant's possible status in France.\nIn his written submissions, counsel points out that a transcript of the claimant's final detention hearing23 indicates the Minister was satisfied as to Mr. XXXXX identity on the basis of far fewer documents than have been entered in evidence in the instant proceedings. That fact is of no particular relevance to the assessment of this issue in the refugee claim since the claimant is subject to a separate onus under section 106 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) and Rule 7 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules to provide documents establishing identity that are acceptable to the Board and, if not, to provide a reasonable explanation for the lack of documents or to have taken reasonable steps to obtain the documentation. A Member of the Refugee Protection Division is not bound by the findings of a Member of the Immigration Division.\nIn the end, the Refugee Protection Division finds that the claimant has not provided sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish his personal identity or that he is a national of Algeria and only Algeria. However, in the particular circumstances the Refugee Protection Division believes it would be prudent to assess other central issues on the premise that he is the person he claims to be.\nCredibility - Christian Conversion \/ Muslim Apostasy\nThe Refugee Protection Division finds the claimant's alleged Muslim apostasy and conversion to Christianity is, on the balance of probabilities, not a genuine matter of religious conviction or belief on his part. Rather this is a conversion of convenience that serves as the basis for not just one claim to refugee protection but two - previously in the US24 and now in Canada.\nThere is no issue that the claimant attended the XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX Christian Church in Taipei, Taiwan, went through an instruction program, received baptism, and attended services at that church for a while. The claimant's original Certificate of Baptism dated XXXXX, 1997 and signed by the American pastor there at the time, XXXXX XXXXX, forms part of his US record,25 and the photograph on it resembles the claimant, although he is wearing a full beard (as on his Alien Resident Certificate from Taiwan).26 However, in a subsequent e-mail from the former pastor, who now resides in California, XXXXX XXXXX in retrospect, \"looking back at the events that followed,\" believes that the claimant was not ready for baptism, although he had gone through instruction and appeared to be so.27 Mr. XXXXX states that, \"XXXXX deceived us both,\" referring to himself and the claimant's Moroccan friend known by his adopted Christian name, XXXXX XXXXX.\nHis motive has always been to find some way to get into a western country. He attended church for a few months, but then stopped coming.28\nHe goes on to describe briefly the mutual verbal abuse that plagued the claimant's marriage to a Taiwanese woman and how he had counselled both of them until the claimant dropped out of sight and never came back to the church. He states:\nMy blunt opinion is that XXXXX is a liar and will say whatever it takes to get what he wants. That is my opinion based on many conversations with him. I personally would not trust him or could not recommend him to most anything, except that he repent.29\nCounsel submits that the reader is left to speculate (and indulges in doing so) as to the reasons Mr. XXXXX believes he and XXXXX XXXXX were deceived. The claimant for his part tried to suggest that the former pastor was bitter because he had rejected his advice in the marriage counselling and that while he did not attend the XXXXX church again in Taipei, he went to others, including one with a congregation from the Philippines.\nThe Refugee Protection Division gives full weight to this character appraisal by XXXXX XXXXX because it carries the wisdom of hindsight, so important in evaluating religious commitment, and evinces appropriate Christian values.\nRather than obtain a copy of the original baptismal certificate from his US attorney or from the US INS to support his refugee claim in Canada, the claimant had another sent by facsimile on August 21, 2003 from the current pastor of the XXXXX church, XXXXX XXXXX.30 In a subsequent letter that followed inquiries by Minister's counsel, Pastor XXXXX confirms that this document was issued but it was on the basis of information provided by church members who knew the claimant, not by reference to church records or personal acquaintance.31 Thus the new \"baptismal certificate\" is downright misleading -- it does not clarify Pastor XXXXX role or the circumstances and does not even name the other pastor (who left Taiwan in 2001) who had in fact baptized the claimant.\nIn an email to Minister's counsel from XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, a Migration Integrity Officer at the visa section of Canadian Trade Office in Taiwan, Ms. XXXXX reports on a conversation with Pastor XXXXX, whom she knows personally, about how this baptismal certificate came to be issued. She writes,\nHe was contacted by XXXXX who desperately wanted a proof that he had been baptized and provided pastor XXXXX with the date of said baptism...pastor XXXXX gave him what he asked for.32\nThe Refugee Protection Division regards this as prime illustration of how the claimant manages to get what he wants, as XXXXX XXXXX has observed.\nIn Vancouver the claimant has found support from a minister, Reverend XXXXX XXXXX, and XXXXX XXXXX, who holds a Master's Degree in Divinity and operates a charity hostel, both of whom are associated with the XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX Church in Vancouver, which the claimant reportedly attends. Each provided a written testimonial,33 and testified briefly at the hearing. Both attested to the claimant's religious conviction and his involvement in the life of the congregation.\nMeaning no disrespect, the Refugee Protection Division gives their evidence little weight in the assessment of this refugee claim. It is reasonable to assume that members of an evangelical church such as this would not be inclined to cast a critical eye upon or deliberately test the faith of anyone who professes to be a Christian and wishes to participate, perhaps especially a refugee claimant who declares he has converted from Islam and demonstrates fluency in the Christian language and prayer in the conservative evangelical tradition (as Mr. XXXXX put it). On the balance of probabilities, experience will prove that they too have been deceived by the claimant.\nMoreover, despite the close relationship Reverend XXXXX has with the claimant, he could not remember whether he knew the claimant had lived in the US. Still, he expressed no surprise that the claimant had not attended church in the US because he did know of his estrangement from Pastor XXXXX and the church in Taiwan. The Refugee Protection Division finds that the apparent fact Reverend XXXXX was unaware of the previous asylum claim in the US based in part on Christian conversion is further evidence of the claimant's duplicity.\nAs to the claimant's admission that he did not attend church services or take Bible classes or seek out other Christians in the US during his sojourn of XXXXX months, the Refugee Protection Division finds this behaviour makes a mockery of fact that in part he had allegedly gone to the US with the encouragement of Pastor XXXXX to learn more about his religious faith,34 and that he was at the same time pursuing an asylum claim on the basis of his conversion to Christianity. This evidence also contradicts the statement in the PIF that he has been a devout Christian since his baptism in 1997 and, \"I have been regularly attending Church and learning about Christ where ever I have been.\"35\nHe testified at the hearing that he once sought help from a church in the US because he did not have social assistance and was told to come back on Sunday. He took this response to be a rebuff but the comment could also reasonably be interpreted to mean that he was welcome to attend the church services on Sunday and ask for charity in that setting. He says he practiced Christianity while in the US by reading his Bible on his own, but that would seem to defeat the stated purpose of his visit, as he could have done this in Taiwan.\nFinally, the claimant was given several specific opportunities during his examination at the hearing to explain how he came to have a Christian conviction. Each time he was extremely evasive in his answers and wound up not having addressed the question. Similarly, he testified that he had explicitly renounced Islam but this is cast in doubt by his explanation that he did so by pledging not to have any other God. Again, this answer was evasive since it is a generally recognized fact that Muslims also worship God (called Allah) and this \"renunciation\" would only be meaningful if they are not the same God.\nThe Refugee Protection Division concludes that the claimant has failed to provide sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish that he is a Muslim apostate who has become a Christian and this religious conversion would subject him to a serious possibility of persecution and of a danger of torture and a risk to life and risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he were to return to his country of Algeria.\nCredibility \/ Objective Basis \/ Change of Circumstances - Target of Islamic Groups and Arrest by Government\nAllegedly the claimant fears persecution and would be subjected personally to a risk to life and a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Algeria by armed Islamic groups because he would be perceived by them as a government employee, a member of a particular social group they still target. The Refugee Protection Division finds there is insufficient credible evidence that he was personally of interest to Islamic groups in 1993-94 before he left Algeria, let alone that he would be upon return in 2004, a decade later.\nLeaving aside the negative findings on the claimant's identity and his Algerian nationality, and assuming for the sake of analysis that the claimant was indeed a government employee in Algeria during the civil conflict at that time, the credibility of his allegation is undermined by the fact that the rebel group that stopped him and others at a roadblock in XXXXX 1993 let him go physically unharmed, even after checking his identity documents and thus potentially learning that he was a government employee, indeed a particular government employee whose official duties related to XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX in Constantine. According to his description of the incident in the PIF, this was a violent and potentially deadly encounter. In addition to checking IDs and asking questions and taking personal valuables, the rebels threatened everyone with machine guns.\nMuch has happened in the ensuing decade to reduce any potential threat to the claimant's life from armed Islamic groups. Most importantly, the claimant did not continue to work as an\nAlgerian government employee - he vanished. According to the documentary evidence,36 the approaches of the armed Islamic groups have evolved and changed over time, from initial targeting of certain categories of people, to indiscriminate attacks on civilians and infrastructure, and on to include criminal rather than ideologically-motivated activities, such as \"turf wars\" between rival groups, revenge banditry, land grabs, robberies and protection rackets.\nThe Civil Concord Law of 1999 led to an amnesty for members of these groups who had not personally committed murder, rape and bombings. Only two groups turned down the plan from the start and continue to operate, the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) and the Salafist Group for Preaching (or Call) and Combat (GSPC). Even so their numbers are greatly reduced, and vary from several hundred to several thousand. Estimates of the number who surrendered under the amnesty range from 4200 to 7000. The armed wing of the FIS,37 which the claimant referred to in his PIF and US asylum application, engaged in a ceasefire in 1997, and declared an end to their guerrilla struggle in 1999. They took advantage of the amnesty and disbanded in January 2000.\nAccording to the most recent reports in evidence, the violence by armed Islamic groups currently takes place primarily in the countryside and smaller towns as the security forces have largely forced the insurgents out of the cities, except in the strongholds of the groups. The authorities are in control of the vast majority of their territory and engage in ongoing anti-terrorist operations.\nIn the mid 1990s the GIA made specific threats against many categories of people who they considered anti-Islamic. More recently, the types of attacks have included apparently indiscriminate killings in massacres and with small bombs, and ambushing intended victims by mounting fake roadblocks. In the dangerous areas that remain, government officials and security forces and their families are still targeted but of course the actual risk has diminished greatly because of the smaller numbers of members. Although some networks are said to still exist in Algiers and Constantine - both are cities where the claimant has lived and worked or studied - the situation there was relatively calm at the time the documentary information in evidence was produced.\nThus, in regard to this basis of the claim to refugee protection, the Refugee Protection Division finds that the claimant has provided insufficient credible evidence to establish that he was once at real risk from armed Islamic groups by reason of him being a government official. A decade on, his claim is no longer even well-founded on a strictly objective basis. As a result of the amnesty and the success of the Algerian security forces, the strength of the armed Islamic groups has been reduced and their geographic scope restricted, such that there is not a serious possibility that the claimant would be subject to persecution or personally face a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment by their hand, if he were to return to Algeria.\nAccording to the PIF, the claimant is also afraid that the Algerian government would arrest and torture him upon return due to suspicions he is a terrorist because he left a government job in 1994 and his subsequent absence could be interpreted to mean he joined the armed Islamic groups in the mountains. Supposedly a friend he contacted who is with the Algerian police told him in late 1995 that he was being sought by the authorities for exactly this reason and threatened to arrest the claimant himself if he were to return.\nThe Refugee Protection Division finds this alleged basis of the claim is not credible. Despite his statements about the friend's inside knowledge that he was wanted by the police in 1995 and his assertion that the cause for suspicion was his departure from the government job, the claimant did not give a categorical answer when he was asked if the police had ever suspected him (while he was still in Algeria) of being a member of an armed Islamic group; his answer was, \"Not that I know of.\" Moreover, if he realized this was a possible consequence, it is reasonable to expect that he would have called his employer when this leave of absence expired and ensured that the Algerian government was not left with the wrong impression of his whereabouts and activities. Supposedly he was aware at the time that his departure could raise suspicions but he did nothing to allay them. It does not make sense that a decade (of inaction) later he fears there would be sufficiently serious consequences that he needs Canada's protection. Moreover, the Refugee Protection Division reasons that the amnesty granted by the Algerian state to thousands of confirmed members of the armed Islamic groups demonstrates a certain tolerance in the interests of achieving peace that would similarly work in the claimant's favour. On the balance of probabilities, however, this basis of the claim to refugee protection is also a fabrication and the claimant is not wanted by the Algerian authorities on suspicion of his involvement with armed Islamic groups because he left his government job in 1994.\nAt the hearing the claimant added a twist to this allegation and said that the fact he has been out of the country for so long would be viewed with suspicion by the Algerian authorities. The Refugee Protection Division notes that according to a 1998 report by an academic at the Centre for Middle Eastern and Central Asian Studies in Australia,\nAlgeria is a country of hundreds of thousands of migrants and expatriates, and movement by its citizens is not in itself cause for concern or for state suspicion. Should the state have information on returning asylum seekers, especially those with no history of political opposition, Islamic affiliation, or criminal activities, some irritations, I should imagine (would) be expected. Asylum is not always about politics; it has economic motivations. This latter category does not necessarily invite state suspicion or retaliation. I see no problem with Algerian seekers of asylum, which more often than not are motivated by economic concerns, returning home without being retaliated against by the state.38\nThere is no evidence before the Board that the claimant has engaged in any political or criminal or terrorist activities in his ten years abroad that would raise concerns. His new allegation is no more credible than the rest.\nSection 97\nThe Federal Court has ruled that negative credibility assessments that are determinative of claims to refugee protection under section 96 of the IRPA may not necessarily be determinative under the consolidated grounds in section 97. In this case, the Refugee Protection Division finds that the adverse credibility findings above are all relevant and determinative of the enumerated risks in respect of the alleged bases of the claim.\nIn particular, the claimant's alleged Christian conversion has been found not to be genuine - his baptism in Taiwan and his church attendance in Canada are a sham. If he were removed to Algeria, more likely than not he would discontinue the pretense of being a Christian and thus he would not be perceived as a Muslim apostate or a Christian. While the name, XXXXX XXXXX, was published in the Directory of the XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX Church of Vancouver in XXXXX 2003,39 there is no evidentiary basis to believe this association would come to the attention of people in Algeria who might be inclined to harm him. According to the country information, the Government follows a de facto policy of tolerance by not inquiring into the religious practices of individuals, and conversion is not illegal under civil law.40\nFinally, as to the treatment of returned rejected asylum seekers, the most detailed documentary evidence is as follows:\nTwo country reports in 2001 stated that European countries returned hundreds of such persons to Algeria either under formal agreements or on a case by case basis. One stated that applying for asylum abroad is not regarded by the Algerian authorities as a political act. An Algerian has no need to fear persecution on return solely on the grounds of submitting any asylum application. Western countries do not regard the overall situation in Algeria as a reason not to deport rejected non-suited asylum seekers and other, inadmissible, persons to that country.\nThe other report stated that while none of the countries concerned appears to have carried out a formal study of what happens to 'deportees' they all believe they would have heard had persons who were returned to Algeria encountered serious difficulties. 'Deportees' sometimes contact the embassies concerned to sort out administrative matters relating to the time they spent in the country and none have ever complained of their treatment by Algerian authorities upon their return to Algeria. It could also be expected that relatives of 'deportees' would in some cases make it known if a person had suffered at the hands of the Algerian authorities but there has been no incident of this sort ever brought to the attention of the embassies concerned. The UNHCR office in Algiers and the Algerian Foreign Ministry both reported that persons returned to Algeria do not encounter problems.41\nExclusion Under Article 1 E of the Convention\nAccording to the claimant's complete US INS record in evidence, he was informed in a letter dated XXXXX, 2000 of the intent to deny his asylum claim because he had not provided evidence of persecution in Taiwan, the country of last habitual residence where he had lived from XXXXX 1994 to XXXXX 1998, or proof that he was unable to return to Taiwan and had been denied citizenship on the basis of being an Algerian, or that he was getting a divorce from his wife. He was allowed to provide new rebuttal evidence within sixteen days. His attorney submitted rebuttal evidence and arguments in a letter dated XXXXX, 2000 and supplemental information on immigration and nationality law in Taiwan.\nWith that issue satisfied, the final decision by the US INS made a year later, on XXXXX, 2001 was to grant asylum status to XXXXX XXXXX. There is a notation to this effect on the first page of the Asylum Application form,42 and an undated letter on the file said to attach a completed I-94 Arrival Departure Record indicating he had been granted asylum as of XXXXX, 2001 for an indefinite period.43 A copy of an I-94 form stamped to this effect is also on the file.44\nBut the claimant alleges that by then he had already left the US to return to Taiwan, after he learned of the intent to deny his claim. He testified that the reason he left was that his work permit was going to expire at the end of XXXXX 2001 and he had not received a response to his application to renew it and in light of the intent to deny he thought it would not be renewed, in which case he did not want to live illegally in the US. Supposedly he was unaware of the process underway and thus did not know of the rebuttal that had been sent by his lawyer (nearly a year before), but rather took the notice of intent to deny his claim as final. He had asked his lawyer about his right to appeal but she was not hopeful and indicated she would do that on her own and he did not need to be there. The claimant's evidence is that several months after he went back to Taiwan he applied for a US visa to return, having in mind that he would pursue an appeal.\nThere is some corroborative evidence that XXXXX XXXXX left the US in late XXXXX 2001. A printout from the US INS computer system obtained and interpreted by the IRB Research Directorate indicates a departure date of XXXXX 2001 is listed there.45 In addition, XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX at the visa office in Taipei had checked with her American counterparts and confirmed that XXXXX XXXXX had been granted a US visa and had left Taiwan and entered the US on XXXXX, 1998. He had overstayed his visa (which expired XXXXX, 1999) and only left on XXXXX, 2001 to return to Taiwan. On XXXXX, 2001 and again the following day he applied for another US visa but was refused both times because he had overstayed his previous visa. Information she obtained from the entry-exit bureau of Taiwan confirmed those dates.46\nThe problem for the claimant is that the acceptance letter from the US INS states that if he planned to depart the US he had to obtain permission to return before leaving. In that event he would be issued a Refugee Travel Document. If he did not obtain permission - and the claimant testified that he did not obtain such a document before he left - he could be unable to re-enter or be placed in proceedings where he would be required to establish his asylum status.\nAs well there is a section on, \"Departing the U.S. before a Final Decision,\" in the Affirmative Asylum Procedures Manual, provided by the RPO.47 It contains detailed information on the elaborate due process afforded to applicants who were not in the US at the time of the asylum approval.\nIf it is determined that the applicant was not in the United States at the time of the asylum approval, INS lacked jurisdiction to approve asylum and the prior grant of asylum must be rescinded. However, the actions to take after rescission will depend on whether the applicant received advance parole or not, whether the applicant traveled back to the country of feared persecution, and whether the absence from the US affects the applicant's substantive claim.48\nCounsel provided supplementary information from different sources after the hearing.49\nHowever, the Refugee Protection Division finds there is contradictory evidence as to whether the claimant was in fact out of the country when his US asylum claim was finally approved and therefore that his status has been rescinded.\nFirstly, the claimant lacked credibility as a witness concerning his motivation for leaving the US and his knowledge of the process underway in his asylum claim at the time and the protections he still enjoyed. In comparison to the importance of potentially receiving asylum status, he has not given a very compelling reason why he would have abandoned his asylum claim before receiving a final decision, to return to Taiwan (where allegedly he was the victim of racial discrimination). Moreover, he had only to ask his attorney to be assured that, work permit or not, he would not have been living illegally in the US provided his asylum claim and any subsequent appeal were still pending. His professed ignorance of the asylum process is at odds, for example, with his precise description of the format and directions for use of the entry and exit document issued by US INS upon arrival, apparently the I-94 form, and generally the way he has actively prosecuted his refugee claim in Canada. As Officer XXXXX XXXXX had observed at the port of entry, the claimant asked a lot of questions.\nFurthermore, the US INS record reveals that he launched a divorce action in a Los Angeles court in early XXXXX 2000,50 which would appear to be aimed at addressing one of the deficiencies noted in the notice of intent to deny his claim dated XXXXX, 2000, and he also made a declaration that he had approached the Taiwan Information Agency in Los Angeles on XXXXX, 2000 and a supervisor reviewed his residence visa in the passport and told him that he could not return to Taiwan.51\nThe claimant's testimony also raised doubts as to his credibility because, despite the precision he evinced above on the Los Angeles airport exit procedures and his apparent acute awareness of the expiry date of his US work permit, he was unable to specify the exact date he supposedly left the US. In fact, he testified that he exited the US on XXXXX, 2001 but when the omission of this information in the PIF was drawn to his attention for comment, he said that he did not recall exactly the date but did recall being in Taiwan for his birthday on XXXXX, alone in the hotel. (For what it is worth, the claimant's putative birth date is XXXXX, 1963.)\nHe had stated in the PIF that he was not given any reason for the refusal of his apparent subsequent application in Taiwan for a Canadian visitor visa (CVV) at the end of XXXXX 2001. When asked about this, he was vague and evasive and demonstrated a lack of familiarity with the details of that application. Yet the visa officer's notes clearly indicate that the requirements were communicated to the applicant in person and he was told that failure to comply would mean refusal of the visa - out of four supporting documents that were necessary the applicant had supplied just two.52 Once the contents of the visa officer's notes were spelled out to him at the hearing, however, the claimant improvised explanations as to why it would not have been feasible for him to supply the missing documentation. Furthermore, the claimant testified that when he applied in Taiwan for a new US visa he said it was to return to pursue an appeal in his asylum claim, but the most detailed information available on the two visa applications contains no reference to any asylum claim in the US.\nThe evidence is that the applicant for the CVV was holding an Algerian passport in the name of XXXXX XXXXX. The claimant alleges that the US INS only made a copy of his passport and did not seize the original when he made the asylum application, and that he had traveled on it back to Taiwan. However, his dubious oral testimony raises the possibility that someone else was using this Algerian passport in Taiwan in XXXXX 2001 - which the claimant categorically denied - and perhaps the claimant himself did not leave the US on XXXXX, 2001.\nSecondly, the US INS records that show this departure date of XXXXX, 2001 (or XXXXX, 2001 as rendered in Taiwan) make no reference to the fact that this same individual had made an asylum claim in the US. This is true of both the computer printout obtained by the IRB Research Directorate and the information provided by the American Trade Office in Taipei. The omission of this critical piece of information is most glaring in the latter case which records only that XXXXX XXXXX had overstayed his visa in the US.\nConversely, the complete US INS record for the asylum applicant XXXXX XXXXX contains no information about his putative departure on XXXXX, 2001 - despite his oral evidence that he supposedly traveled on the same Algerian passport that is copied in the US INS record and that when he left he showed officials, in addition, two US documents: the (then expired) work permit and the US INS entry and exit form - apparently a reference to the I-94 form - which he always carried from the time he entered the US. He said the officials removed a part of the form when he left. (As noted above, the claimant denied that he possessed a Refugee Travel Document giving him permission to leave.)\nOnly the US authorities can sort this out and determine objectively whether the claimant was or was not in the country when his asylum claim was approved on XXXXX, 2001. If they have already done so, they are not telling the Immigration and Refugee Board. After the sitting of the hearing on December 15, 2003, the Presiding Member directed the RPO to ask the IRB Research Directorate to contact the US Embassy in Ottawa and \"request a definitive statement from the US authorities as to whether the grant of asylum to the claimant on XXXXX, 2001 is still valid and the claimant would be allowed to re-enter the country to enjoy the benefits of that status.\"53 Minister's counsel, without prior consultation with the RPO or Presiding Member, sent a parallel inquiry to the US Embassy, which took as established fact that the claimant had left the US on XXXXX, 2001. The Presiding Member asked her to withdraw the request because the way it was worded could compromise the probative value of the reply and separate inquiries could complicate and delay a response. Minister's counsel agreed to do this. However, the Americans have told the IRB Research Directorate that they will not provide the information to the IRB, because unlike CIC, the IRB does not have a formal agreement with the US regarding information sharing.54\nAt a minimum, a refugee claimant must be able to return to and remain in the putative Article 1E country before this provision can be invoked to exclude him from Convention refugee status. As the RPO puts it in her written submissions, in the absence of further evidence, it appears the United States should not be considered an Article 1E exclusion country in this case.\nDETERMINATION\nFor all the reasons above, the Refugee Protection Division finds that the claimant has, without a reasonable explanation, failed to provide sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish his personal identity or the fact that he is a national of Algeria and only Algeria. In the alternative, the Refugee Protection Division finds he has failed to provide sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to prove that he has undergone a religious conversion from Islam to Christianity and thus would be subjected to a serious possibility of harm in Algeria by that reason, or on any other alleged bases of his claim to refugee protection. The Refugee Protection Division finds there is not a serious possibility that the claimant would face persecution for any of the enumerated grounds under section 96. Nor is there a serious possibility that removal to Algeria would subject him personally to the dangers and risks set out in the consolidated grounds under section 97.\nWhile XXXXX XXXXX, a citizen of Algeria, was granted asylum status in the US on XXXXX, 2001, there is insufficient evidence to allow the Refugee Protection Division to determine - even assuming the claimant is this individual - whether he was present in the US at the time and has the right to return to and remain in the US.\nAccordingly, the Refugee Protection Division determines that XXXXX XXXXX is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\n\"Barbara Hodgins\"\nBarbara Hodgins\nOctober 18, 2004\nDate\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - EVIDENCE - ADMISSIBILITY - PORT OF ENTRY - DETENTION - RIGHT TO COUNSEL - CANADIAN CHARTER OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS - FUNDAMENTAL JUSTICE - IDENTITY - DOCUMENTATION -DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE - IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEE PROTECTION ACT - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION RULES - STATUTORY INTERPRETATION - CREDIBILITY - RELIGION - RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION - POLITICAL OPINION - EXCLUSION CLAUSES - ART. 1E - RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF A NATIONAL - RIGHT TO RETURN - RIGHT TO REMAIN - MALE - NEGATIVE - ALGERIA\n1 Exhibit 1.1, signed January 6, 2003.\n2 Exhibit 1.3, amended answer to question 41 of the Personal Information Form (PIF).\n3 Dehghani v.

On that same day, the panel rendered its oral decision and reasons. This is the written version of that oral decision and reasons.\nORAL DECISION AND REASONS\nI have had an opportunity to consider all the evidence in this claim by XXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX for refugee protection and I am now prepared to render a decision. This claim is being heard under the provisions of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (Act)1 to determine firstly, under section 96, if the claimant is a Convention refugee or secondly, under section 97(1), if he is a person in need of protection.\nAt the conclusion of these reasons and once they have been transcribed into writing, the written version will be sent to the claimant, to his counsel and to counsel for the Minister. Those written reasons may be edited for grammar, syntax, spelling, punctuation and general readability. They may also include references to applicable statutes and case law.\nIn coming to this decision, I have considered all of the evidence: the claimant's Personal Information Form (PIF),2 his oral testimony, the materials from Canada Immigration, the materials filed by his counsel, the materials filed by the Refugee Protection Officer (RPO), the materials filed by the Minister's counsel, along with the oral submissions of both counsels.\nThe Minister appeared on the basis that they had reasonable grounds to believe that the claimant was excluded under Article 1F(a) of the Schedule of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.3 In this regard, the Minister has the onus in regard to exclusion. The claimant has the onus under inclusion to provide sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to find there is a \"serious possibility\"4 for considering that he has a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason or is a person in need of protection. The\nMinister's onus is to establish sufficient evidence to find there are:\n... serious reasons for considering that: (a) he [the claimant] has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes.5\nIn considering this claim, I am now going to tell the claimant what conclusions I have reached and then I will explain why I have done so. Firstly, I have determined that the claimant is not excluded from consideration for protection. However, I have also concluded that the claimant is not a Convention refugee nor is he a person in need of protection. I am now going to explain why I have come to those decisions.\nThere were a number of relevant issues in this claim. The issue of credibility applies to both the inclusion and exclusion aspects. While testimony that is given under oath is presumed6 to be true, there may be valid reason to doubt its' truthfulness. In my view, there were more than sufficient grounds to find that regarding this claim, a significant portion of the claimant's evidence was not credible or trustworthy. There were numerous inconsistencies, omissions, implausibilities and contradictions in the claimant's evidence. Overall, as to much of the claimant's evidence, I found it lacked \"rationality and common sense\".7\nThe Minister's representative filed a large amount of documentary evidence8 to allege that the claimant was active during the 1980s in the DGSE (Directorate General of State Security), which committed gross human rights abuses. The claimant was an enlisted member of the DGSE during that time. As I said earlier, the burden of proof to establish \"serious reasons for considering\" that international offences have been committed is the responsibility of the Minister's counsel.\nLet me say that the claimant came to Canada with a valid Nicaraguan passport9 and I accept that he is a citizen of Nicaragua and of no other country.\nIn dealing with exclusion, the Minister's counsel intervened some time ago on the basis that the claimant's activities with the DGSE meant that he was excluded from consideration. During this hearing, Minister's counsel also raised for the first time that the claimant's activities in support of the FUAC, the Andres Castro United Front, also provided grounds for excluding him. In my view, the Minister is bound by the basis on which they have intervened. It is not sufficient, in the course of a hearing, to raise new grounds and then suggest that exclusion may apply to those grounds.\nIn the case of Moreno,10 the Federal Court of Appeal set out the standard of proof as follows:\n... one well below that required by either the criminal law (\"beyond a reasonable doubt\") or the civil law (\"on a balance of probabilities\" or \"preponderance of evidence\").\nIn another decision,11 the Federal Court of Appeal stated that both of these standards:\n... require something more than suspicion or conjecture, but something less than the balance of probabilities.\nNow, much of the claimant's evidence was evasive, unresponsive and unclear about his activities as a member of the DGSE. The claimant today provided two documents12 from the government of Nicaragua, issued in the XXXXX of 2002, which simply provided confirmation that he worked at that organization in the 1980s, specifically from XXXXX 1981 XXXXX, 1989 \"in the position of XXXXX. under the Department General of State Security.\nHowever, in my view, the claimant (and the credibility aspect played importantly into this) failto provide a consistent statement as to what his activities were in the DGSE. His version varied from his interview with Canada Immigration, to his PIF and to his testimony. Because there were so many examples, I am only going to provide some of the concerns that I had.\nFirst of all, the claimant (in his PIF and in his interview with Canada Immigration) provided different dates as to when he was in the DGSE. Surely he could remember exactly what year he joined and for how long he served. Initially, in his interview and PIF, he said that as early as 1987, he was no longer working there. First of all, I found that seriously damaged his credibility.\nAs well, his duties in this organization, his training there, and what happened in that organization were equally lacking in credibility. For example, in his interview with Canada Immigration, he said he was sent two times in the mountains to fight, in 1982 and 1984. He said that there were two or three times in which there was an exchange of gunfire between themselves and the Contras.\nIn his Schedule 1, Background Information13 document that he completed for Canada Immigration, he said the following: \"During the war, I was involved in combat situations on numerous occasions throughout Nicaragua.\" [emphasis added] In his PIF, there was no mention that he was ever engaged in combat. In his oral testimony, he said he was sent out once, but he was never involved in combat.\nIn answer to many of these concerns, the claimant would say either that he could not recall or he would change his testimony. For example, today and for the very first time, the claimant alleged that he had twice been convicted of insubordination while he worked for the DGSE. No such information was provided in his interview with Canada Immigration. He only amended his PIF today to allege that it had occurred. Why was that not mentioned previously? In my view, the claimant was attempting to evade allegations that he was involved in any human rights abuses or other activities once the Minister had raised intervention. This was an attempt by him to show that he was actually on the outs with the leadership of the DGSE. In fact, he went so far today as to say that he was even considered a dissident from 1986, when he told his superior that he did not agree with him. Again, this information was never previously provided.\nWhat were the claimant's duties while he was in the DGSE? Was he involved in military training? Was he in the military or not? He gave inconsistent and contradictory evidence in various forums. Today, for example, he said that he was given a pistol but all he was taught to do was to assemble and disassemble it. However, in his earlier interview with Canada Immigration, he said he was trained to use weapons and he gave (as examples) the names of rifles and machine guns, such as Galil, FAL, M16s, AK47s.\nI just found all of the claimant's evidence to be completely evasive concerning his involvement with DGSE, in my view. He alleged that he had been twice charged with insubordination and spent two months in jail, a month on each occasion, in 1985 and 1986. He said he was demoted from the Chief of XXXXX to be simply a XXXXX XXXXX and he was considered to be a dissident. Because this was never mentioned before, I found it completely lacked credibility.\nWhen I look at the Minister's documents, there were a lot of documents about the DGSE. However, one factor I noted was that vast majority of those documents were either issued by the United States government or by its subsidiary institutions or by persons supportive of the United States government during the 1980s and even into the 1990s. The documentary materials tell us very clearly that the United States government, from the very earliest part of the 1980s, had an ongoing campaign to overthrow the Sandinista government of Nicaragua. Those documents that emanate from the United States government (or similar other sources) are not impartial documents. They emanate from a body that has an interest in the outcome of the proceedings. In my view, the materials prepared by or on behalf of the United States government or by its supporters in the United States have little or no credibility as a basis for me to consider their contents as worthy of serious consideration. They are not independent and they are not impartial.\nThere are a few materials from independent and impartial sources, such as Americas Watch and Amnesty International among others. Those documents give a considerably different view than the documents produced by the United States authorities.\nIn my view, contrary to what the United States government was attempting to portray, I consider that the documents clearly show that right up to the present day, institutions of the United States government are still attempting to interfere in Nicaraguan affairs. They have an ongoing campaign to ensure that the Sandinistas do not even return to power in a democratic way. Some of the documents even relate the U.S. Government's attempts to influence the last elections held in Nicaragua. More importantly, in their actions during the 1980s and early 1990s, the U.S. government et. al. were consistently attempting to portray the Sandinistas, both as the government of Nicaragua and associated bodies, in the worse possible light.\nThere was a civil conflict in Nicaragua. One side was supported by the United States, both militarily and financially. There were abuses that were committed on both sides in that conflict. However, from the materials (and looking particularly at the materials from Americas Watch and Amnesty International), I do not find that the DGSE was a body that was principally directed to a \"limited brutal purpose.\"14 It would be illogical for me to suggest that a state is not entitled to have security forces to obtain intelligence and assist the state (and other institutions of the state) to repel an invasion or to stop other armed forces attempting to overthrow the government of that state.\nAt most, what the documents indicate is that the DGSE was an organization (and I might say its successor organization does still exist) \"which from time to time has committed international offences.\"15 It would be difficult, during a time of war, to suggest that there are not abuses that are committed. In my view, the evidence is lacking that the DGSE was an organization with such a \"limited, brutal purpose\". In my view, the claimant's employment in that organization certainly does not indicate that he was involved in activities that might equate to crimes envisaged by Article 1F(a).\nIn my view, the claimant was so lacking in credibility that it was impossible for me to conclude what he was doing there and what his activities were in the DGSE. It was not clear whether he was or was not involved in activities that might even have assisted some human rights abuses. However, on the evidence before me, I certainly do not find that the claimant's membership in the DGSE or the evidence on the DGSE itself would lead me to conclude that the claimant should be excluded from consideration for protection.\nI note as well that the claimant subsequently obtained visas from the United States government and travelled to the United States on several occasions in the 1990s. Surely, if the United States government did not consider that the claimant's past activities (and I am certain that they would be well aware of his past activities on behalf of the DGSE) to be such that they would bar him from entering the United States, that is a further indication for me to not find the claimant was excluded from consideration.\nAccordingly, I find that the Minister has not met the onus to provide sufficient evidence for me to conclude that this claimant was excluded from consideration for protection under sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nHowever, after having said that I do not find the claimant's evidence to be credible as far as his activities in the 1980s are concerned, I will go further and say that the lack of credibility followed the claimant's evidence thereafter. For example, the claimant said today that he had attended university in 1983 and 1984, but that was not mentioned in his PIF. In fact, in his PIF, he indicated that he did not attend university until 1988. The claimant's evidence also lacked credibility because his activities were unclear after he left the DGSE. He said that in 1991, two persons that he knew from the DGSE came to him and forced him to pay money to them on behalf of the FUAC, the Andres Castro United Front. The FUAC can be seen from the documents as an organization that had a rather spotty existence during the 1990s. It was composed of former Sandinista supporters or members of the military. As a group, they were subsequently seriously affected by the state security forces, which undertook actions to defeat them and appear to have done so.\nHowever, the claimant's evidence about his involvement with the FUAC was equally unsatisfactory. The claimant initially testified that he paid the FUAC two to three hundred dollars twice a month on a salary of one thousand dollars a month. I pointed out to him that in his interview with Canada Immigration, he said then that he paid them three to four hundred dollars per month on a salary of three to four thousand dollars. The claimant then became evasive and testified that he did not make a thousand dollars a month as that was actually his base salary. He said that he made much more than that and also said that he paid the FUAC two to three hundred dollars a month. He was not even consistent about that evidence.\nIn any event, the claimant said that he paid the money, from approximately 1991 until the XXXXX of 1999, because these individuals (or the FUAC) would have killed him and his family if he had not paid. I found it completely implausible that these individuals, allegedly the leaders of the FUAC, would come to the airport in Managua twice a month for some eight years to collect money from him. I find it even more implausible that the claimant was out of Nicaragua on numerous occasions during those years, but at no time did he attempt to make a refugee claim until he notified Canada Immigration (in the XXXXX part of 2002) that he wished to do so. This also raised concerns with the claimant's evidence because, in his PIF (question 21), he was asked to state what trips he had taken in the last ten years, including any previous trips to Canada. I pointed out to him that in his PIF, he had not mentioned his trip to Canada in 2000, when he was here for some six months.\nThe claimant was in the United States on a number of occasions as well during those times, both with and without his family. In my view, based upon the threats to kill him and his family, it was completely implausible that he would then continually return to Nicaragua, on at least one occasion with his family and by himself on a number of occasions. In my view, all of this evidence is not credible or trustworthy and I put no reliance upon it.\nThe question of state protection was also brought up. The claimant made no mention in his PIF, or in his interview with Canada Immigration, that he had ever approached the Nicaraguan authorities at any level to seek protection from the FUAC. However, the claimant testified today that from 1996 to 1998, and again in 2000, he went to the police on about seven occasions. In fact, he said that he went repeatedly to the chief of police in Managua to seek assistance. He said the police did not help him. They simply told him to move or said that they were afraid to take action against the FUAC because it was too dangerous for them to do so.\nHis PIF (question 41) required him to set out if he had sought protection and if not, why not. The omission of that information was another damaging aspect against the claimant's credibility. I find it implausible and inconceivable that the claimant, after he had finished his job at the XXXXX and had told these individuals he could not pay them any more, would come to Canada in 2000, stay here for some six months, and would then return again to Nicaragua. In fact, the claimant had initially mentioned in his PIF that he continued to work at the XXXXX until 2001 and gave no other employer after that date. His PIF was then amended to say that he had finished his work with the XXXXX earlier and had then worked in a laboratory. However, I could not conceive of why he would return to Nicaragua if he had already told these people he could no longer pay them and they had threatened to kill him and his family.\nThe claimant returned again to Canada in XXXXX 2001. Although he alleged that he had left Nicaragua in fear (according to his PIF), he did not make a refugee claim. His excuse for not doing so was that he was arrested and charged with soliciting for the purpose of prostitution in Vancouver in the XXXXX of 2001. (Surprisingly, that information was not mentioned in his PIF when he later filled it out.) It was not until some 15 months after had returned to Canada that he first notified Immigration he wished to make a refugee claim.\nThe numerous times that the claimant returned to Nicaragua, his failure to make a claim when he was here in 2000, and the delay in making a claim after he returned here (from XXXXX 2001 until the XXXXX part of 2002) are all indicative of a lack of subjective fear. In my view, he did not provide a satisfactory explanation for any of these instances in which he failed to seek protection when he had the opportunity to do so. In my view, they seriously damaged the credibility of his allegations that he was ever threatened by the FUAC. In addition, I find it inconceivable that the claimant would have left his family alone in Nicaragua after they also had been threatened to be killed if he did not pay the money to the FUAC.\nI noted further that the claimant did not mention in his PIF that he was in hiding before he left Nicaragua. However, according to his interview with Canada Immigration, since he stopped paying the FUAC in XXXXX 2002, he said then that he was in hiding and lived with different members of his wife's family. However, when I asked the claimant if he was living at his house before he came to Canada on the last occasion, he said he was. So, was he living in hiding (he did not mention that he was living in hiding in his PIF) or was he living at home and came to Canada for other than protection reasons? Was that why no claim was made? Did an intervening criminal charged delay him making a claim until he finally did so in the XXXXX part of 2002?\nOverall, there was a complete lack of credible or trustworthy evidence to find that this claimant had any problems of any kind in Nicaragua. In my view, he left Nicaragua and came to Canada for reasons unrelated to any of the protection grounds set out in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, whether in section 96 or in section 97.\nAs I say, those are just some of the concerns that I had with the claimant's evidence. Let me just give a couple more concerns. According to what the claimant told Canada Immigration about part of his duties in the DGSE, he said: \"I just watched houses abandoned by the XXXXX family. We watched houses so people would not enter.\" That information was never mentioned in his PIF or in his testimony. The claimant also said that he had not resigned earlier (or asked for a discharge) from the DGSE. In his testimony, he said that Lenin Cerna, the head of the DGSE, had told them in a meeting that anyone who asked for a discharge would be \"disappeared\". Asked what the claimant meant by disappeared, he said \"assassinated\". That allegation was never mentioned in his PIF or in his interview with Canada Immigration. Again, I found those allegations to be completely lacking in credibility because they were never mentioned previously.\nIn my view, the lack of credible or trustworthy evidence leads me to conclude that there was no credible or trustworthy evidence to find that this claimant was either a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. There was no Convention ground that I can find to be applicable in his case because of the lack of credible or trustworthy evidence.\nI am aware that a negative credibility determination under section 96 (having determined the claimant is not a Convention refugee) is not identical in dealing with section 97. The elements necessary to establish a claim under section 97(1) are not identical to those necessary to establish whether a person is a Convention refugee under section 96.16 However, in the case at hand, when I have considered the negative credibility determination, along with all of the evidence, personal and documentary, I found there was no foundation for establishing any personal \"risk\" for this claimant under section 97(1) of the Act.\nIn conclusion, let me say the following: I have determined that the Minister has not established sufficient evidence to find that the claimant was excluded from consideration under Article 1F(a). I have also determined that the claimant is not a Convention refugee and is not a person in need of protection.\nHowever, in my view, the lack of credible or trustworthy evidence leads me to conclude that there was no independent or credible evidence, documentary or otherwise, that would support a positive determination of this claim for refugee protection. Accordingly, I find there is \"no credible basis\"17 to this claim.\nIn conclusion, I determine that the claim for refugee protection of XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX is rejected.\nThis concludes my decision and the reasons for it.\n\"I.W.

The claimant also participated in the Shia uprising fostered by the US in the wake of its victory in the 1991 Gulf War. He has a lengthy criminal record in the United States, where there is an outstanding warrant for his arrest.\nSUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS\nAccording to the claimant's Personal Information Form (PIF)1 as amended at the hearing, he is a Shia Muslim, who was born and lived in the town of Hilla. He has just five years of formal education having helped his father sell XXXXXX in the market from the time he was around ten years of age. His father still resides in Hilla with his other family.\nIn XXXXX 1991, at sixteen years of age, the claimant fought in the Shia uprising that was quickly crushed by Saddam Hussein's troops. His father was imprisoned but the claimant, his mother and four siblings fled to the American-controlled area in the south. From there they were relocated to the United Nations refugee camp in XXXXX, Saudi Arabia, where they lived for three and a half years. In XXXXX 1994 the family was resettled in the US.\nThe claimant became a permanent resident of the US in 1996 but owing to criminal convictions his green card was taken away and he was not allowed to apply for citizenship. His mother, three brothers and a sister are all American citizens.\nIn his answer to question 37 of the PIF, the claimant lists nine prior convictions in the state of Washington. He says that he was ordered deported from the US in 2000 but because of the danger in Iraq he was given a \"Withholding of Removal.\" Then in XXXX 2002, the US Immigration and Naturalization Service sought to reopen the ruling on the basis of his new criminal convictions. According to the narrative statement in the PIF, his fear of being returned to Iraq was the reason he came to Canada on February 5, 2003. At the hearing he denied that was a fugitive from justice.\nAt the time the claimant completed his PIF, the Saddam Hussein regime was still in power in Iraq and his claim was based on the fact he is a Shia Muslim who participated in the 1991 uprising. He stated that his father had been released from prison but the government continued to persecute him.\nAt the hearing held after the Saddam Hussein regime had been overthrown, the claimant asserted that his participation in the 1991 Shia uprising in Hilla continues to be a reason he would be at risk in Iraq. Speaking for him on this point in her submissions, counsel for the claimant argues that the former dictator's loyalists and former members of the Ba'ath Party remain a force and the rival Sunni Muslims are now a disaffected and hostile minority of the population.\nHe also claims a new sur place basis due to the fact that two of his brothers, XXXXX and XXXXXX, have returned to Iraq to assist the US military forces as Arabic interpreters and there is great resentment toward this occupation and the Americans generally. This family association and his long-term residency in the US are factors that would make it dangerous for him to go back. He testified that his older brother XXXXXX had recently visited their father in Hilla, and afterward his father was told that if his son came again he would be killed.\nThe claimant's evidence is that the residents of Hilla would identify him with the Americans because they know the details of his family's history and association with the US, yet Hilla is the only place where he could live given the social structure in Iraq.\nISSUES\nThe following issues were identified: personal identity, including religion as a Shia Muslim; credibility; objective basis and change of circumstances, and related compelling reasons; Internal Flight Alternative (IFA); previous claim elsewhere (US grant of refugee status in XXXXX 1994 and the defensive asylum claim to stay removal in XXXXX 2000);2 generalized risk under the Risk to Life ground in section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA);3 and possible exclusion under Article 1E (permanent residency in the US) and under Article 1F(b) for serious non-political crimes, specifically burglary in the 2nd degree which the claimant is accused of having committed on XXXXX, 2003, in the state of Washington.\nANALYSIS\nPersonal Identity \/ Shia Muslim\nThe claimant provided the original and a translation of his Personal Identity Card issued in Iraq in 19904 and documents proving that he and other members of his family were accepted as refugees and resettled in the US.5 With the claimant's consent, the Research Directorate of the IRB obtained his electronic record from the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services in Washington.6 Earlier, when the claimant was arrested by the RCMP soon after his arrival in Canada in February 2003 and finally revealed his true identity, Canadian Immigration officials conducted background checks with their US counterparts and found that he had an extensive file. All of this evidence corroborates the claimant's personal identity.\nHe states in the PIF that he is a Shia Muslim and at the hearing he satisfactorily answered questions about his religion.\nThe Refugee Protection Division finds that the claimant has satisfied the issues related to personal identity.\nBeyond these essential findings of fact, the Refugee Protection Division has not assessed the claimant's inclusion claim for refugee protection since it is not necessary for a determination of his claim to refugee protection. Even if he were found to be a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection under the consolidated grounds, the analysis below shows that he is excluded from enjoying Canada's protection under Article 1F (b) of the UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees7 and is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection pursuant to section 98 of the IRPA.\nExclusion Under Article 1E\nMinister's counsel conceded at the final sitting of the hearing that he has no information from the US that the claimant would be allowed to go back to face charges. The claimant testified credibly that he lost his permanent resident status in the US and the judge told him that if he left the US he would not be able to return. He failed to attend the last proceedings in the US on XXXXX, 2003 and the judge found that as a result he had abandoned any and all claims for relief from removal.8 In light of this, at the conclusion of the oral examination at his refugee hearing in Canada, the Refugee Protection Division removed this exclusion issue and indicated that the parties need not address it in written submissions. The Refugee Protection Division is satisfied that the claimant no longer has the right to return to and remain in the US, which at a minimum, would have to be established before the claimant could be excluded under Article 1E. He has lost permanent resident status in that country as a result of his criminal behaviour.\nExclusion Under Article 1(F) (b) For A Serious Non-Political Crime\nThe police in Washington State initially accused the claimant of committing the offences of burglary in the 1st degree and possession of stolen property (computer equipment) in the 2nd degree on or about XXXXX, 2003.9 For reasons that are not clear from the US documents, the Prosecuting Attorney ultimately charged him with the crime of burglary in the 2nd degree, that he entered and remained unlawfully in the (XXXXX Clinic) building with intent to commit a crime against a person or property therein.10 On XXXXX, 2003, a judge in the Superior Court of Washington for King County found that \"probable cause exists to believe\" that XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX committed this offence and ordered that a warrant be issued for his arrest.11\nAre there \"serious reasons for considering\" that the claimant committed this crime?\nWhen the claimant was confronted at the hearing with the detailed information in the police report of the XXXXX, 2003 incident from Washington State, he denied any involvement. He suggested that the police probably got his name off the computer from his previous convictions, rather than reading his name on a Washington State identity card and the vehicle registration as they had stated. He also denied having previously committed a burglary in 2002 for which he was convicted and suggested that he was falsely accused because he had associated with the wrong people and was charged along with them. He denied having made a confession to police for one of his crimes, which appears in evidence,12 and explained he had pleaded guilty on his attorney's advice even though he had done nothing wrong. He did acknowledge that the list of all his earlier criminal convictions included in the US court documents is correct,13 despite the fact that it is rather more extensive than his own list in the PIF.\nThe claimant was evasive in his answers on the exclusion issue and generally avoided taking responsibility for any wrongdoing in the US. He was also very suggestible, for example when Minister's counsel led him to subscribe to the notion that there was a conspiracy against him by the US authorities.\nThis demeanour is fully consistent with the claimant's surreptitious entry into Canada and his dishonesty at the time he was intercepted by the RCMP about his identity, and when and how he had arrived in this country, and even his fluency in English.14 The Refugee Protection Division finds that the claimant is not a credible witness concerning his criminal activities, and his denial of any involvement in the offence in question on XXXXX, 2003 in Washington state deserves little weight.\nIn her written submissions counsel for the claimant has asserted that this is a case of mistaken identity because the Certificate of Probable Cause says the man found at the scene was an \"East Indian male,\" while Mr. XXXXX XXXXX is not an East Indian male, nor does he appear as such. The Refugee Protection Division finds that the police officer's description of the claimant's race\/ nationality was subjective and it is not material in light of the positive identification of the claimant by name, based upon examination of his Washington State driver's licence and his motor vehicle registration at the scene.\nBy contrast to the claimant's evidence, the Refugee Protection Division gives full weight to the police and court documents provided by the Washington State authorities. Counsel for the claimant argues that the officer who laid the charge was not available for cross-examination but, with due respect, it was open to her to ask Minister's counsel to produce this witness. The Refugee Protection Division is not aware of such a request.\nJudicial interpretation of \"serious reasons for considering\" has established the standard of proof at less than a balance of probabilities,15 but more than suspicion or conjecture.16\nThe Refugee Protection Division finds on the preponderance of credible evidence that indeed there are serious reasons for considering that the claimant did commit the crime of burglary in the 2nd degree on XXXXX, 2003, in the US, for which there is an outstanding charge against him.\nIs this offence a serious non-political crime?\nThe Federal Court has also ruled that Article 1F (b) is not applicable to refugee claimants who have been convicted of a crime committed outside Canada and who have served their sentences prior to coming to Canada.17 There is no issue here that the claimant still has charges pending in the US for anything other than the most recent offence on XXXXX, 2003.\nCounsel for the claimant argues that the offence of burglary in the 2nd degree is not sufficiently serious as to exclude the claimant because it was essentially a crime of property, and no weapons were used and no violence was perpetrated against any person. She finds support in Brzezinski18 in which the Federal Court Trial Division ruled that the minor crime of shoplifting in the conventional sense or \"theft under\" pursuant to section 334 of the Criminal Code, even when committed repeatedly, is not \"serious crime\" within the meaning of Article 1F (b).\nShe draws upon the quotation from The Refugee in International Law by Goodwin- Gill considered by Judge Lufty in the Brzezinski decision:\nWith a view to promoting consistent decisions, UNHCR proposed that in the absence of any political factors, a presumption of serious crime might be considered as raised by evidence of the commission of any of the following offences: homicide, rape, child molesting, wounding, arson, drugs trafficking, and armed robbery. ...However, that presumption should be capable of rebuttal by evidence of mitigating factors, some of which are set out below: The following offences might also be considered to constitute serious crimes, provided other factors are present: breaking and entering (burglary); stealing (theft and simply robbery); receiving stolen property; embezzlement; possession of drugs in quantities exceeding that required for personal use; and assault. Factors to support a finding of seriousness included: use of weapons, injury to person; value of property involved; type of drugs involved; evidence of habitual criminal conduct.19\nIn addition to the fact that the claimant is not alleged to have used weapons or physical violence in committing the offence, counsel for the claimant speculates (without adducing evidence to this effect) that the value of the computer equipment he is suspected of stealing (a computer mainframe, keyboard, power cords and a small stereo) was probably insubstantial. While the claimant has a long criminal record, she argues that the lack of seriousness of his crimes is evidenced by the fact that he has never served sentences of more than two years for any of them.\nOn the first point made by counsel for the claimant, the Refugee Protection Division notes that the Federal Court decision in Xie20 has thoroughly canvassed the question of whether purely economic crime falls within Article 1F (b) and ruled that as a matter of principle it does - and this is not at odds with Brzezinski.\nAs to the value of the goods stolen, the Refugee Protection Division finds that computer equipment in the claimant's situation is distinguishable from the items shoplifted by the applicants in Brzezinski, which included, for example, a dress and a chocolate cake.\nJudging by their respective written submissions, there is no dispute between the parties that an individual's criminal record should be a factor in the assessment of the seriousness of the crime. This is also consistent with respected academic opinion and the UNHCR Handbook.21\nThe claimant has an extensive criminal record which at last count showed he had been booked 11 times since 1995 when he arrived in the US and had 26 warrants.22 In addition to two prior convictions for burglary in the 2nd degree (in 1999 and 2002) and related convictions for possession of stolen property, his record includes other types of crimes such as those related to threatening behaviour (stalking, harassment, and driving with a loaded gun in his vehicle). He was considered a threat to community safety and unlikely to appear for proceedings. Accordingly, in XXXXX 2003 bail for the claimant (in the event of his arrest) was set at $30,000. The Refugee Protection Division finds that the claimant's criminal record in the US is further evidence that this offence is a serious crime and that he is a habitual criminal.\nFinally, the Refugee Protection Division takes the view that the proper measure of seriousness is the maximum allowable sentence for the offence in question, not the actual length of the sentences pronounced in the past, as counsel for the claimant suggests.\nThe Federal Court of Appeal in Chan23 presumed without deciding that a serious non-political crime equates with one in which a maximum sentence of ten years or more could have been imposed had the crime been committed in Canada. Later in Xie, Judge Kelen finds this to be a sensible approach and consistent with the definition of \"serious criminality\" in subsection 36(1) of the IRPA dealing with inadmissibility.\nThis provision demonstrates Parliament's desire to exclude from Canada individuals who have committed crimes punishable in Canada by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 10 years, even if the offence in question is a purely economic one. 24\nThis parallel is particularly noteworthy because in the instant case Minister's counsel states in his written submissions that shortly after the claimant's arrival in Canada he was brought before the Immigration Division for a hearing on admissibility under this provision of the IRPA,25 and the Immigration Division found him inadmissible and issued him a conditional deportation order for serious criminality.\nCounsel for the claimant argues that the fact he was still allowed to make a refugee claim under section 101(2)(a) of the IRPA is prima facie reason that he should not be excluded under Article 1F(b). With due respect to counsel, the paragraph that deals with eligibility where there is a criminal conviction outside Canada is section 101(2)(b) not (a), and it states that a claim is not ineligible by reasons of serious criminality unless the Minister is also of the opinion that the claimant is a danger to the public in Canada. While the decision of the Immigration Division is not in evidence, presumably the claim was considered eligible despite serious criminality, because the claimant was not considered a danger to the public. This does not detract from the finding of inadmissibility due to serious criminality under section 36(1) of the IRPA. There is nothing in IRPA to suggest that the Refugee Protection Division loses jurisdiction over exclusion issues if a claimant is found eligible to make a claim.\nAccording to the documentary evidence provided by Minister's counsel drawn from the US statute under which the claimant was accused,26 and an excerpt from the Criminal Code of Canada,27 the Washington State offence of burglary in the 2nd degree equates to Section 348(1)(a), with the penalty covered at 348(1)(e). In both countries the crime of breaking and entry in a non-dwelling house with intent to commit an indictable offence carries a maximum penalty of ten years.\nConsidering all of this evidence and argument, the Refugee Protection Division finds that the criminal offence for which the claimant was charged in the US on XXXXX, 2003, which is still outstanding against him, is a serious non-political crime within the definition of Article 1F(b).\nShould the nature of the offence be balanced against the degree of persecution or risk of harm established in the inclusion claim?\nCounsel for the claimant quotes the UNHCR Handbook at paragraph 157 that suggests in applying the exclusion clauses it is necessary to \"strike balance between the nature of the offence presumed to have been committed by the applicant and the degree of persecution feared.\" She argues that the Refugee Protection Division must weigh the exclusion evidence against the well-foundedness of the inclusion claim and find that the claimant's relatively minor criminal offence is outweighed by the grave risk he would face upon return to Iraq.\nThe Federal Court of Appeal has considered and rejected this notion of balancing the seriousness of the persecution the claimant is likely to suffer against the gravity of the crime there are serious reasons to consider that he has committed.28\nIn Xie,29 the balancing argument is revisited in light of new Supreme Court jurisprudence in the cases of Pushpanathan30 and Suresh.31 Judge Kelen makes a distinction between decisions affecting a claimant's entry to Canada as a Convention refugee or person in need of protection and those that concern a rejected claimant's removal from Canada to a country where there may be a risk of torture. He concludes that the balancing process needed to satisfy section 7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms properly belongs under the Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) provisions of the IRPA.32\nMost recently, the Federal Court of Appeal in answering the questions certified by Judge Kelen in Xie has upheld that analysis, consistent with the prior jurisprudence on the issue of balancing, in light of the division of authority between the Refugee Protection Division and the Minister under the IRPA.33 The Court points out that claimants who are excluded from refugee protection under section 98 of the IRPA (by the Refugee Protection Division) can still apply to the Minister for protection, at the pre-removal stage. The grounds are the same, although the Minister has additional discretion to assess the dangers to Canada as well as to the failed refugee claimant, and a successful application would result only in a stay of the deportation order, not access to permanent resident status. However, the Court makes it very clear that once the Refugee Protection Division has excluded a claimant from refugee protection, the jurisdiction shifts to the Minister. The Refugee Protection Division simply does not have the authority to balance the nature of the offence that forms the basis for exclusion and the risks associated with removal from Canada.\nIn the particular circumstances of Mr. XXXXX claim, the Refugee Protection Division also considers that such a weighing would be more meaningful if it is deferred until that later stage in his removal processing because the governance of Iraq is at a turning point and this affects even the definition of state authority and the identification of state agents for the purposes of evaluating the possibility of harm and the protection available. The Refugee Protection Division takes judicial notice that as this decision is being rendered the US occupying force has just returned partial sovereignty to the interim government of Iraq - a limited transfer of power from the civilian authority appointed by the US following the military victory that overthrew the Saddam Hussein regime. The interim government is scheduled to remain in place for seven months until elections are held. Meanwhile, the Americans retain responsibility for security. The way in which the new Iraqi government exercises its control and the way the Iraqi people ultimately perceive the US military forces will both be critical factors in assessing the risks the claimant may face upon removal from Canada.\nThe bases for the inclusion claim and the exclusion claim in this case are entirely separate. Thus, while the full conditions the claimant would return to in Iraq are presently unclear, what is clear is that he is excluded from refugee protection in Canada under Article 1F (b) because there are serious reasons for considering that he committed a serious non-political crime in the US.\nDETERMINATION\nFor all the reasons above, the Refugee Protection Division finds there are serious reasons for considering that the claimant has committed a serious non-political crime, burglary in the 2nd degree, outside Canada. Accordingly, the Refugee Protection Division determines that XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX is excluded from refugee protection under Article 1F(b) of the UN Convention and section 98 of the IRPA.\n\"Barbara Hodgins\"\nBarbara Hodgins\nJuly 9, 2004\nDate\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - EXCLUSION CLAUSES - ART. 1(F)(b) - SERIOUS NON-POLITICAL CRIME - BALANCING - JURISDICTION - STATUTORY INTERPRETATION - IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEE PROTECTION ACT - MALE - NEGATIVE - IRAQ\n1 Exhibit 1.\n2 Exhibit 7, tabs 5, 6 and 7.

The Respondent was determined to be a Convention refugee on February 10, 1994.\nALLEGATIONS\nOn September 4, 2002, the Minister (Applicant) filed an Application pursuant to section 108(1)(a) of the Act, setting out the grounds for the Application. The Applicant alleges inter alia that the Respondent had now ceased to be a Convention refugee and\/or a person in need of protection, because he (a) has voluntarily re-availed himself of the protection of authorities in Russia; (d) has voluntarily become re-established in Russia, a country he left, or remained outside of and in respect of which he claimed refugee protection in Canada; and\/or (e) that the reasons for which he sought refugee protection have ceased to exist.\nAfter hearing the evidence of the Respondent, the Applicant withdrew the allegations in respect of subsection (e). This analysis will deal only with a determination pursuant to sections 108(1)(a) and (b), therefore.\nAccording to the Statutory Declaration XXXXXXXXXXX, Immigration Officer with the Immigration Enforcement Office in Vancouver, pursuant to section 108(1)(a), the Respondent voluntarily re-availed himself of the protection of his country of nationality by returning to Russia sometime during 1994, for a period of five years.1 Mr XXXXX also declares that the Respondent admitted to having travelled to Russia on his own Russian passport. Also filed is an Affidavit of XXXXXXXXXX,2 which sets out the allegations. She alleges that she has reviewed the contents of the Respondent's immigration file and declared to certain matters, as follows:\n* The Respondent confirmed he has left Canada to travel to his home area of XXXXX, Russia because his mother was ill.\n* He was charged at least three times in Vancouver with shoplifting, while collecting social assistance, and he failed to appear for his court dates when he left the country to return Russia.\n* He obtained a Russian Driver's Licence in 1998 valid from XXXXX 1998 to XXXXX 20083 and a Temporary Driver's permit dated XXXXX 1998 from the State Motor Vehicle Inspectorate, in XXXXX, Russia.4\n* He had both an internal and external Russian passport issued to him by Russian authorities while he lived in Russia between 1994 and 1999.5\n* He was arrested and imprisoned at least three times in Russia, for causing a disturbance or fighting and found guilty and sentenced to jail time.\n* He destroyed his Russian passport while in the US.6\n* He was arrested in Montreal because he was in possession of a false Denmark passport, and did not appear for his court date as required.\n* He fled to Vancouver, thereby avoiding a trial on this matter.\n* He filed a second refugee claim in January 2000 and was found to be ineligible to make a second claim on the basis he had previously been found to be a Convention refugee.\n* He filed a Notification of Claim to be Convention Refugee, and at Question 27 indicated he was a Citizen of Russia from XXXXX 1994 to XXXXX 1999.\n* He indicated in the Notification of Claim that he left Canada in XXXXX of 1994.\n* He told XXXXX XXXXX he left either late 1993 or early 1994\nAccordingly, the Applicant also alleges that the Respondent is a person who has voluntarily re-established himself in the country that the person left, or outside of which the person remained, by reason of a fear of persecution section 108(1)(a).\nSection 108 of the Act clearly places the burden of proof on the Minister to show that the person who was determined to be a Convention refugee under this Act has ceased to be a Convention refugee.7\nIt is uncontested that the Respondent returned to Russia in or around 1994, and resided in XXXXX until his return to Canada in XXXXX 1999. The Respondent admitted this to XXXXX XXXXX, and also to the panel in his oral evidence at the hearing. It is also uncontested that when the Respondent returned to Russia, he obtained several official government issued identity documents, including an external passport.\nIt is also uncontested that when Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) officials interviewed the Respondent and when he testified at his hearing, he presented inconsistent and contradictory testimony regarding the date of his return to Russia. In his interview with Officer XXXXX he said that he left for Russia in late 1993 and later, XXXXX 1994, whereas it is clear from his PIF and oral testimony that he left for Russia in XXXXX 1994. It also remains unclear whether he was in possession at any time, of a Canadian Visitor Visa (CVV).8\nThe Respondent was asked about the inconsistent and contradictory testimony that he presented in his interviews with CIC officials and the IRB. He stated that he was unsure of these details at the time. The panel does not accept this as a satisfactory explanation and inferred instead that he was not being truthful and consistent to Canadian immigration officials and this panel.\nThe Respondent's testimony at the cessation hearing was not always presented in a straightforward or direct manner. There were times the Respondent appeared to be changing his testimony to suit the circumstances, and times when he delivered long and circuitous, but nonetheless non-responsive answers to questions put to him by the panel, the Minister's counsel, and even his own counsel, whose frustration with his client was evident in the hearing. Counsel conceded that the Respondent's credibility was questionable but that the panel should nonetheless, give him the benefit of the doubt.\nHe was asked why he returned to Russia. He stated it was because his mother was about to have emergency surgery to treat her varicose veins. He testified that he was told by a Russian doctor that it was urgent that he return immediately to Russia to be with his mother who could die if she did not have surgery right away. During his hearing the Respondent confirmed that his mother was in general good health prior to this and had not had any medical problems before this surgery, other than what would be usual for an elderly woman.\nIn the interview with XXXXX XXXXX, the Respondent admitted that his mother's surgery did not take place for two months after his return to Russia, suggesting it was not an emergency. When confronted with this and other problems with the evidence, the Respondent continued to repeat that it was an emergency and he had to return to see his ill mother. Yet, he did not provide any documentary evidence to substantiate the fact his mother was ill. He said there was too much \"red tape\" and he thought it would be difficult to obtain such corroboration now, ten years after the fact. Later he said it never occurred to him and he might be able to obtain this information if necessary.\nWhile the onus is on the Minister to advance a prima facie case for cessation, the Respondent must answer the allegations of the Minister, once a prima facie case has been established. The Respondent knew or ought to have known, that medical evidence to corroborate the fact his mother had been ill would be necessary to establish he had a pressing reason for leaving Canada. His failure to provide any evidence of his mother's illness, even evidence that should have been readily available, such as letters of appointment, prescriptions, follow up reports, and the like, causes me to suspect he was not being truthful.\nIn addition, the fact that the Respondent went to government authorities to obtain official documents such as passports and driving permits, causes me to conclude that he has sought and received the protection of his state, and voluntarily re-established himself in Russia. He was also self-employed, buying and selling vehicles, which suggests he was living and working in Russia as any normal citizen would.\nI am not persuaded by the Respondent's explanations for his departure from Canada, or his lengthy stay in Russia. The Respondent testified repeatedly that he returned to Russia in 1994 to help his sick mother. I note once again that if his mother did indeed have surgery, it did not take place, according to the Respondent's own evidence, until two months after his arrival in Russia. She did not experience any life-threatening consequences from this surgery - at least none are alleged by the Respondent, and she is alive and well in Russia today, some ten years later.\nAgain, when he was asked if he had any documentation to substantiate that his mother was staying at this hospital, during her serious illness, he answered, \"No.\" He also stated that he did not try to get any documents to corroborate his mother's stay at this hospital.\nThe panel finds that the Respondent's failure to make any efforts to obtain the supporting documentation regarding his mother's alleged illness in Russia demonstrates a lack of due diligence on his part. Accordingly, the panel draws a negative inference from the Respondent's failure to provide any supporting documentation that his mother was seriously ill and staying in a hospital in Russia during the relevant periods of his stay there.\nIt would be reasonable to expect a person in the Respondent's position to have made serious efforts to obtain documentation to support his case against the Minister's application for cessation, but he clearly failed to do so. Therefore, taking the totality of the evidence into consideration, the panel concludes that this Respondent is neither a reliable nor trustworthy witness.\nIt is uncontested that the Respondent has not been entirely truthful to Canadian immigration officials since his first arrival in Canada. He attempted to enter the country surreptitiously on a fraudulent Danish passport. He did not initially declare himself to Canada immigration officials. He thought he could enter illegally, and resume his life as a Convention refugee in Canada. He admits to shoplifting on several occasions, including times he did not get caught.\nThere is no reason to accept that the Respondent presented the panel with credible evidence to counter the Minister's evidence in support of its application for cessation.\nWith respect to section 108(1)(a) of the Act, the panel finds the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Handbook to be persuasive. It states that the cessation clause implies three requirements:\n(a) voluntariness: the refugee must act voluntarily;\n(b) intention: the refugee must intend by his action to re-avail himself of the protection of the country of his nationality;\n(c) re-availment: the refugee must actually obtain such protection.9\nWith respect to the issue of voluntariness, at no time did the Respondent indicate that he was pressured to return to Russia. When he was asked why he would risk his life to return to Russia, he stated, \"My mother was sick and that is why I left. She had no one else and needed me to help her with groceries, cleaning and taking care of her.\" The Respondent would have the panel believe that he returned to Russia solely for altruistic reasons and out of a deep sense of obligation to his mother. The Respondent alleges that he called Canada Immigration to see what\nhe could do to leave the country. He was allegedly told that if he completed an application form, filed supporting medical documentation and waited around thirty days to process this form, his application would be considered and he might be permitted to leave to assist his mother. Counsel for the Respondent argues this suggests the Respondent did not intend to remain in Russia and had every intention to return to Canada as soon as he was able.\nYet, his past history of deceit, would suggest he has exaggerated his mother's illness, if it existed at all. As preciously stated, he presented no credible evidence to show that his mother was ill or that he ever cared for her while he resided in Russia from 1994 to 1999. The Respondent returned to Russia because he wanted to do so. His choice to return was freely made. Accordingly, the panel finds his return to Russia was a voluntary act.\nWhat was the Respondent's intention of returning to Russia? The Minister submits it was to re-avail of the protection of the country. The Respondent testified that he went there solely to see his mother during her illness. However, the Respondent remained there for five years. He worked, obtained identity documents and a driver's licence, and generally lived like any other citizen. He said he did not vote while he was there and did not have a bank account. Counsel argues this suggests his sojourn in Russia was transitory and his mere presence for five years is not sufficient to establish an intention to establish himself there.\nHe was asked whether he had ever previously voted or had a bank account when he lived in Russia before he made his refugee claim in Canada. He said \"no, it is against my philosophy\" which suggests that when he returned to Russia, he carried on, in his home, and in with his usual habits, as before he made his refugee claim.\nThe Respondent's length of stay in Russia, and the fact he was gainfully employed while there, cannot be considered as merely incidental to going to see and aid his sick mother. As stated previously I have made the finding that the Respondent willingly returned to Russia. The Respondent's intentions can be inferred from his actions. The panel finds his intentions were to return and to live in Russia. Hence, the Respondent's action reveal his intentions were to re-avail himself of the protection of his country of nationality and to re-establish himself in Russia.\nThe evidence before the panel shows that the Respondent not only obtained an internal passport to aid him with his business, but he also obtained an external passport from the authorities, without difficulty. The Respondent's intentions can clearly be inferred from his\nactions while he lived and worked in Russia. It is evident that he lived there like any other Russian citizen, apparently, and with the exception of being drunk and disorderly and arrested for the minor offences of hooliganism and fighting, abiding by the laws of the state.\nConsequently, I find that the Respondent re-availed himself of the protection of the Russian state.\nThe Respondent's testimony establishes that he was able to obtain a variety of services from the Russian state. The Respondent was allowed to get a driving permit, he was allowed to work, and he was allowed to get medical benefits, according to his testimony. The Respondent's ability to live and work in Russia, establishes a prima facie case that the Respondent was able to obtain the protection of the Russian state. The ability to obtain an internal passport to do business in Moscow, the ability to buy and sell cars, obtain an external passport, and other identification indicative of Russian nationality indicates not only the Respondent's willingness to seek state protection, but also his ability to receive it.\nThus, I find that the Respondent not only sought the protection of the Russia but that he was able to obtain it.\nAccordingly, the panel finds that the Respondent meets all three requirements of section 108(1)(a) and, therefore, concludes that the Respondent voluntarily re-availed himself of the protection of his country of nationality.\nWith respect to section 108(1)(a) of the Act, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Handbook states that \"voluntary re-establishment\" is understood as return to the country of nationality \"with a view to permanently residing there.\"10 Moreover, Professor James C. Hathaway notes the following, on this point:\nRe-establishment requires more than mere physical presence and a greater commitment to the country of origin than is evinced, for example, by a temporary return to visit an ailing parent or to bring out relatives, friends, or property. Careful scrutiny of more prolonged and frequent visits for such purposes as holidays or business is warranted, however, since at some point the degree of attachment may qualify as re-establishment. While an occasional visit of up to a few weeks is too transitory to sustain the cessation of status, a regular presence in the state of origin for a significant part of the year is prima facie inconsistent with a continued need for protection.11 [Emphasis added]\nThe panel has duly considered the Respondent's evidence with respect to his voluntary re-establishment in Russia. It is clear that the Respondent did not remain in Russia for a mere few weeks but more than five years. In my view, this certainly constitutes \"a regular presence in the state of origin\". Hence, the panel finds this to be inconsistent with the Respondent's allegations for the continued need for surrogate state protection abroad, that is, in Canada. A stay of this duration cannot be considered temporary but, rather, it must be deemed as permanent. Moreover, it belies a subjective fear of persecution that the Respondent testified to, while he was resident there. Hence, the panel finds that the uncontested evidence presented establishes the Respondent voluntarily re-established himself in Russia, given his length of stay there before his return to Canada.\nThus, having considered the circumstances in this case, the panel concludes that the Minister has satisfied the burden of establishing, on a balance of probabilities, that the Respondent not only voluntarily re-availed himself of the protection of his country of nationality but also voluntarily re-established himself in the country that he left and in respect of which he claimed international protection in Canada.\nFor these reasons, the Minister's application pursuant to subsections 108(1)(a) and (d)) is granted. The panel, therefore, determines that the Respondent, XXXXX XXXXX, has ceased to be a Convention refugee. Pursuant to section 108(2) of the Act, the Minister's Application is allowed, and the claim of the Respondent is deemed rejected.\n\"Paulah Dauns\"\nPaulah Dauns\nOctober 18, 2004\nDate\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - APPLICATION - CESSATION - REAVAILMENT - VOLUNTARY REAVAILMENT OF PROTECTION - VOLUNTARY RE-ESTABLISHMENT - CREDIBILITY - EVIDENCE - DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE - DOCUMENTATION -IDENTITY DOCUMENTS - STATE PROTECTION - CESSATION CALUSE - STAUTORY INTERPTRETATION - IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEE PROTECTION ACT - MALE - ALLOWED - RUSSIA\n1 Statutory Declaration of XXXXX XXXXX, Immigration Officer, dated 12th October 2000, at Vancouver, BC.\n2 Exhibit 6, Affidavit of XXXXX XXXXX, Immigration Enforcement Officer declared on October 29, 2003.\n3 Exhibit 2 (E) and 6 (E).\n4 Exhibit 6 (F).\n5 Exhibit 2 (I) and 6 (I) is a copy of the tombstone pages of a Russian Federation Passport in the name XXXXX XXXXX, the Respondent, with the date of issue being XXXXX 2000; Exhibit 6 (J) is a copy of a Passport from the Russian Federation, in the Respondent's name, with the date of issue being XXXXX 1995.\n6 Exhibit 6 (K) is an I-94 document from the USINS (United States Immigration and Naturalization Services) indicating that XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX (aka XXXXX XXXXX) entered the US on XXXXX 1999.\n7 Olutu, Charles v.

Mr. XXXXXXXXX claims a well-founded fear of persecution pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (Act)1 based upon his political opinion and his race, as a Tamil male. The claimant also alleges he is a person in need of protection pursuant to section 97(1)(b) of the Act in that he fears a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment should he return to Sri Lanka.\nHe also claims he is entitled to protection pursuant to section 97(1)(a) of the Act in that he is a person in danger of torture as defined in Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture.2\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant alleges he is a 38-year-old Tamil male from the Jaffna area of Sri Lanka who fled Sri Lanka because he has been persecuted by the Sri Lankan Army (SLA) who suspect him of being connected to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). He alleges the SLA and the Eelam People's Democratic Party (EPDP) extorted work from him. He alleges that he was forced by the LTTE to dig trenches near the SLA base camps, forced to build bunkers and fortify the LTTE camps, donate blook, look after the sick and wounded, and cut the hair of LTTE members (because he was a XXXXX by profession). Although he was harassed to join the LTTE, he did not do so. He alleges in addition, that the LTTE extorted funds from him, to aid their cause.\nHe was also arrested by the SLA on three occasions: XXXXX 1997, XXXXX 1999 and XXXXX 2000. He was detained with others, asked questions about his involvement with the LTTE, and then released. He was ordered to cut the hair of members of both the SLA and the LTTE, from time to time. He was warned against cutting the hair of members of the SLA by the LTTE.\nBecause he felt caught in the middle between the SLA and the LTTE, he fled Jaffna and moved to Colombo with his family. He left Sri Lanka and came to Canada to make a refugee claim May 2003. His wife and children returned to Jaffna, where they remained up to the time of the hearing.\nDETERMINATION\nI find that the claimant is not a Convention refugee as he does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Sri Lanka. I also find the claimant is not a person in need of protection in that his removal to Sri Lanka would not subject him personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, and in that there are no substantial grounds to believe that his removal to Sri Lanka will subject him personally to a danger of torture.\nANALYSIS\nThe duty of this panel is to find whether there is sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to determine that there is a \"serious possibility\"3 that the claimant will be persecuted or at risk to his life or at risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he is returned to Sri Lanka. This means that it must not be possible for him to get protection from this persecution in his own country and, further, that there is no other location in his country where he could live safely. The single decision, therefore, is whether the claimant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\nThe Immigration and Refugee Protection Act provides a definition of a Convention refugee and of a person in need of protection. Over the years, the courts have interpreted these definitions. I am bound by the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and the Courts' interpretations of that Act. In arriving at my decision, I have considered the testimony of the claimant, the other evidence filed and the submissions of counsel and the Refugee Protection Officer (RPO).\nIn order to establish a successful claim a claimant must demonstrate either a well-founded fear of persecution or that he is a person in need of protection. I found that the claimant's testimony was not credible. In assessing credibility I am guided as always by the principles enunciated by the Federal Court of Appeal in the decision of Maldonado,4 which stands for the proposition that when a claimant swears to the truthfulness of certain facts this creates the presumption that these facts are true, unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness.\nI am also guided by the principles in Rajaratnam5 and in Shahamati6 where the Federal Court of Appeal stated that the Board is entitled in assessing credibility to rely on criteria such as \"rationality and common sense.\"\nIn this case I find there are reasons to doubt the claimant's truthfulness and that his evidence was, at times, irrational and lacking in common sense. In particular, I noted contradictions, inconsistencies and implausibilities in his evidence. He was asked about the issues that were of concern to me and the explanations provided by him were not satisfactory in resolving these issues, in my view. I will cite only a few examples.\nThe claimant has established that he is Tamil through the documentation filed, including his national identity card, birth and marriage certificates and those of family members. All of the documents indicate that he is a Tamil from the Jaffna area.7\nThe claimant has established he is a XXXXX through the same documents, which refer to his occupation as \"XXXXX.\"8\nThere were numerous inconsistencies as between the Canada Immigration notes9 the Personal Information Form (PIF)10 and his oral testimony. There were discrepancies with respect to his education and employment, including where he worked and for which period of time. There was inconsistency as to when the last threat was made to him by the LTTE, and whether\nhe was present when the threat was made or not. There was inconsistency as to where he lived before he came to Canada, and when he moved to Colombo. The dates of his detention differed as between the CIC notes,11 his interview with CIC and the omission of these detentions from his hand-written notes at the Port-of-Entry. Because this is such a significant event as to why he seeks protection, the omission and inconsistency in this very important area, is significant, in my view.\nThe inconsistencies between his testimony and the CIC notes included the time and period he worked for the SLA as a XXXXX, and the work he did for the EPDP. This evidence is also inconsistent with the PIF, which mentions he was taken to the SLA army camp \"after the ceasefire in XXXXX of 2002.\"\nAs well, there were significant omissions in the evidence. The claimant said that the LTTE visited his wife in Colombo, a detail not present in the PIF, nor the amendments to the PIF, even though he testified that he was aware of this in 2003. The first time we heard of this, was in the hearing. The claimant made a trip to Malaysia in 1995. The purpose of this trip was identified as to \"visit his aunt with cancer\" (PIF), to \"escape to Canada\" (CIC notes) and he returned to Sri Lanka rather than carry on to Canada, because he was cheated by the agent who assisted him.\nThe claimant's explanation for these inconsistencies and omissions was that he was tired when he was interviewed by CIC, and he was \"confused.\" I do not accept his explanation. The claimant was asked several times by his counsel, what he feared today if returned to Sri Lanka and his answer was: \"war will start any time now\" which suggests a fear not personal to him.\nFinally, the claimant was evasive. He was often non-responsive to questions put to him, or answered in a circuitous manner.\nIn addition, there is no mention of his fear of the SLA or the EDPD in his interview with Canada Immigration and his handwritten statement, only his fear of the LTTE.\nBecause Mr. XXXXX did make submissions with respect to a potential explanation for the variance between the CIC notes and the testimony today, I want to comment on this. Counsel conceded that there were apparent inconsistencies in the evidence but submitted that the CIC notes are not a previous statement of the claimant and support for this proposition is that the document is not signed by the claimant. Counsel asserts the document does not appear to have been read back to the claimant and it is, therefore, not reliable.\nThe entire file is provided to counsel for the claimant and the claimant and counsel were aware of what was written in the notes. If these inconsistencies raised concerns they could have been dealt with. The onus remains on the claimant at all times to prove his refugee claim and I do not accept the inconsistencies as I have described have been adequately addressed today, although the claimant has been given ample opportunity to do so.\nIf the claimant had legitimate concerns about the CIC notes the officer could have been brought to the hearing or asked to explain what happened and that did not happen. I find that the claim as set out by the claimant is not credible.\nWhile the claimants fits the general profile of those at risk in Sri Lanka today, not all Tamil males will automatically be granted protection as refugees. The claimant must establish his claim on the facts surrounding his claim, and he must establish he has either a well-founded fear of persecution or a risk to his life. The credibility concerns raised by this claim overshadow his profile. I note as well that his wife and children remain in Jaffna, apparently without problems. The claimant is therefore not a Convention refugee.\nSection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act outlines the definition of a person in need of protection. The elements necessary to establish a claim under section 97(1) are not identical to those necessary to establish whether a person is a Convention refugee under section 96 of the Act. Consequently, as noted by the court in Bouaouni,12 a negative credibility determination which may be determinative of a refugee claim under section 96 of the Act is not necessarily determinative of a claim under section 97(1) of the Act.\nIn the case at hand there is nothing in the evidence, whether personal or documentary, that would provide a foundation for establishing a personal risk for the claimant pursuant to section 97(1) of the Act. I, therefore, find the claimant is not at risk of harm in that there is insufficient evidence that there is a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a risk to his life.\nWhether the claim is framed under the Convention refugee sections of the Act or the risk to his life or of cruel and unusual treatment and punishment, the outcome is the same. The panel did not find the claimant's testimony credible, so there is no evidentiary basis for his claim.\nFor these reasons and upon consideration of the whole of the evidence I determine that XXXXX XXXXXXXXXXX is neither a Convention refugee as defined in section 96 of the Act nor a person in need of protection as defined in section 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nCONCLUSION\nFor these reasons, the claim for refugee protection is rejected.\n\"Paulah Dauns\"\nPaulah Dauns\nMay 6, 2004\nDate\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - CREDIBILITY - - MALE - NEGATIVE - SRI LANKA\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Article 1 of the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (the \"CAT\"), Can.

All but the son, make their claim for protection against Egypt. The son is an American citizen who makes his claim against the United States. The date is February 5, 2004. The claimants claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, the divorced husband of the main claimant and the father of the children.\nIt must be noted that the boy has only American citizenship and, hence, may not have to return to Egypt. In that case, his claim is against the United States on the ground of separation from family. Counsel has stated that this would be contrary to stated rights in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international covenants. As such, it would constitute cruel and unusual treatment.\nIt is the duty of this panel to find if there is sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to determine that there is more than a \"mere possibility\"1 that the female claimants would be persecuted if they returned to Egypt or be at risk. Similarly, what is the case with the son if he should be returned to the United States?\nThe claimants must also demonstrate that it would not be possible to get protection from their own countries and that there is no other location in their countries where they could live safely. The mother was appointed the designated representative for the three children. A reference to the claimant in this decision is a reference to the mother.\nIn coming to my decision, I have considered the testimony of the mother, the evidence before me, the observations of the refugee protection officer and submissions by counsel. Given the nature of the claim, I have also kept in mind the points raised in the Chairperson's Gender Guidelines.2 I will briefly outline the story. The story is one of domestic abuse faced by the mother and her two daughters delivered by the husband or father. The mother and her ex-husband were married in 1987 and divorced in 2003.\nDuring this period the wife was beaten repeatedly. Her two daughters were also beaten and physically abused by the father. The claimant sought advice from her brothers about what to do and was advised to simply put up with it for the sake of the children. Her brothers went on to warn her that if she divorced her husband they would take her and the children in, but only as domestics.\nAt one point in the late 1990's, the claimant stated that she visited the local police station to request help. She said she was told by the policeman that it was a trivial event and they had much more important things to do than assist her. She testified that she was not surprised by this as she had a twice-divorced friend who had often sought assistance from the police but had been unsuccessful in obtaining any.\nIn XXXXX 2000, the claimant went on a trip with her two daughters to the United States and Canada. Her son was born in South Carolina on XXXXX, 2000. Upon returning to Egypt in XXXXX 2001, the claimant's husband continued his abuse towards her and the children. However, he had moved out of their common home and had, in fact, begun a relationship with another woman with whom he was living. Eventually, the claimant sought and was granted a divorce on XXXXX, 2003. At that time she renounced all rights to any possessions or future rights and her husband signed a document renouncing his rights to the children.\nWith this in hand the claimant and her children came to Canada and claimed for protection. After having been in Canada she has had no direct contact with her former husband, although one of her brothers in Egypt stated that the sister of her former husband had called him screaming and angrily demanded to know when the children would be returning.\nCredibility is an issue in every claim. There is some reason to doubt the credibility of the claimant. In particular, at the outset of the hearing, she amended her Personal Information Form (PIF).3 Where the original PIF stated that she had never gone to the police, her amendment stated that she had. She was asked to explain this contradiction. Her explanation was that she had omitted to mention the police in the first version of her PIF because she had no documentary proof that she had been and also did not think its omission was very important. The panel pointed out that the directions to filling out the PIF were explicit in this regard. The panel does not find the explanation provided by the claimant believable.\nApart from this embellishment, the claimant's testimony was consistent with her statements to Canada Immigration and with her PIF. Her demeanour was not inconsistent with, and I use counsel's phrase \"a submissive person\" from a poorly educated background, which is what she claimed to have come from. Overall, I found her to be a truthful witness and I accept her account of the experiences she claims with the noted exception of the visit to the police station.\nThe panel finds that the claimants have established their identities and nationalities through certified copies of their passports.\nWith respect to the nexus under the Convention, the panel finds that what the female claimants' fear constitutes persecution and that persecution is linked to the Convention ground of particular social group, namely, women or child victims of spousal or parental abuse.\nI will have more to say about the boy further on in these reasons. In the panel's view, the central issue in this case, as concerns the three female claimants, is state protection. The panel has considered whether state protection is available to them. The country documents4 make it clear that domestic violence and general violence against women in Egypt is a serious concern. Egypt has in recent years brought in a new divorce law to make it easier for women to divorce men. This has earned the anger of the conservative in Egypt.\nHowever, even with regard to this new law, men appear to receive more favourable consideration than women. As well, CEDAW, which is the Committee to Eliminate Discrimination Against Women, has stated that the reality for women has not changed significantly since the introduction of the new law. The documentary evidence also notes that\npolice and society in general in Egypt, do not take the issue of domestic abuse seriously, notwithstanding the laws against it.\nEffective protection requires not only that the state have laws prohibiting the actions in question, but also that the State take steps to enforce these laws. It is in this area that one notes Egypt's weakness. The claimant's evidence about the lack of success faced by her friend in getting protection from the police when her husband abused her is consistent with these documents.\nThe claimant had a document purporting to be from her husband in which he renounced his rights to the children forever. The claimant stated that her ex-husband signed it only in order to get her to give up everything else, including her right to alimony and child support. Consequently, the claimant feared that upon returning to Egypt her ex-husband would simply ignore the document and she stated he would be able to take the children legally.\nThe documents on the right of custody in Egypt do not support the claimant's understanding of the process. Currently, the law in Egypt is that girls under the age of 12 and boys under the age of 10 remain with the mother. When the children reach those ages the father becomes the custodian. However, there is a right to go to the court to extend the mother's custodial right of the boy until he becomes 15 or of the girls until they marry.\nReflecting on the father's renunciation, the panel does not know whether it is legally binding or not. The panel does note, however, that the phone call from the ex-husband's sister in which she demanded the children, would appear to indicate that her ex-husband has a continuing interest in his children. In any event, the mother has little money to bring on a motion before the court to retain custody. The outcome of that would be uncertain, anyhow.\nConsequently, in the panel's view, there is more than a mere possibility that if the girls return to Egypt their custody would revert to their father. As he has abused them in the past there is no reason to suppose that he would not continue to do so in the future. That would constitute persecution. Consequently, the panel finds, for the reasons earlier given, that state protection would not be available to the girls under these circumstances nor to children of that age is Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) an option.\nBecause of these reasons the panel determines XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX and XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX are Convention refugees.\nWith respect to the wife, the case is different. Unlike her children, she cannot be returned to her husband. Even so, the panel is of the view that the ex-husband has demonstrated a violent past towards her and that the issue of custody with the children would exacerbate relations and the panel finds that there is a more than a mere possibility that the husband would abuse her once again. As noted, the panel is of the view that the state could not provide effective protection to her for this. Given her particular situation and the general situation for women in Egypt, an IFA is also not a reasonable option\nBecause of this the panel determines that XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX is a Convention refugee.\nTurning to the claim of XXXXX XXXXX against the United States, in that case the claim is against the United States on the ground of separation from the family. As noted, counsel has argued that this would be contrary to stated rights in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and of other international covenants. As such, he stated it would constitute cruel and unusual treatment to deprive him of his family.\nIn order to come within the Convention or the categories of risk or torture, the claimant must establish the likelihood that he would be persecuted or at risk if returned to his country, which is the United States. There is no evidence before the panel that suggests that the boy, if returned to the United States, would be at any risk or subject to persecution. The Federal Court of Appeal has ruled that being part of a family group is not an independent ground for establishing membership in a particular social group.\nThe argument by counsel is based on the notion that the act of separating the boy from his mother constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. It is worth noting that the action of separation would be taken by Canada and not the United States in the first place and the boy has no claim against Canada as, indeed, he could not as he holds no status here other than as an applicant for Canada's protection. As well, the panel notes the statement of Mr. Justice Rothstein in the case of De Busto.5 Mr. Justice Rothstein stated:\nFinally, I do not see how the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child assist the applicant in this case.\nThis was a case where one of the children was not granted refugee status and the rest of the family were. As Mr. Justice Rothstein goes on to note:\nRegrettably, removals do cause disruption in families but if they are as a result of proper judicial and\/or quasi judicial processes, such disruptions must be seen as acceptable.\nAccordingly, the panel rejects XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX claim to Convention status or person in need of protection status.\n\"Michael A.

XXXXX XXXXX is a 23-year-old citizen of Israel. He says he does not want to return to Israel because he does not want to serve in the Israeli army and he generally fears for his life in Israel.\nThe claimant is not represented by counsel. He confirmed at the hearing that he was taking no steps to get counsel and wished to proceed without counsel. The claimant also indicated he speaks and understands English and did not wish to have an interpreter. Finally, the claimant says he received the documents sent to him in regard to this hearing.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant was born in Israel in 1981. From XXXXX 1999 until XXXXX 2002 he performed his compulsory military service. He said he was keen to serve in the military, but once there he did not like it. He says he did not like the loss of personal freedom nor the danger. The claimant has XXXXX and was able to use that as a way to avoid combat. However, he was put on guard duty and he says there was a danger of being shot. He says he tried to get out of the military after about sixteen months of service by pretending he was depressed and not sane. He says others had managed to convince the military authorities they were not well mentally and had been exempted from further service. The claimant was not successful with his attempt, and was required to finish his military service.\nHe says that, once released, he would be recalled each year for one month of service and could be recalled on a more permanent basis if the military needed more soldiers. The claimant says he never applied for an exemption as a conscientious objector as he was not in a fighting role. He said he was just afraid of being killed. The claimant says he did not refuse to serve in the army because he did not want to go to jail. The claimant was unable to produce any documentation regarding his military service and release.\nThe claimant worked after being released from the army until he came to Canada in August 2003 with four friends. After about a month he made his refugee claim. He says two of the friends who travelled with him have also made refugee claims in Canada, while the other two returned to Israel.\nThe claimant also says generally he feels unsafe in Israel, as suicide bombers have killed many people including civilians. He fears this could happen at any time to anyone, including himself. He says there is security everywhere.\nDETERMINATION\nI find the claimant is not a Convention refugee, as he does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Israel. I also find the claimant is not a person in need of protection in that his removal to Israel would not subject him personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, and in that there are no substantial grounds to believe that his removal to Israel will subject him personally to a danger of torture.\nANALYSIS\nI find the claimant gave credible evidence about his background and reasons for wanting to remain in Canada. He is a young man who honestly fears for his life in a country where many people have been seriously injured or lost their lives. He also much prefers the personal freedom and lifestyle in Canada as compared to Israel. I feel sympathetic to the claimant, but I find his claim does not come within section 96 or 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. I do not have any jurisdiction to consider his claim otherwise.\nThe claimant's identity as a national of Israel is established by his testimony and the passport he provided to Canada Immigration.1\nProsecution Versus Persecution - Law of General Application\nThe claimant objects to the law that requires him to report for military service in Israel. Generally, a state is entitled to enact laws that will contribute to the better, safer, and more just functioning of the national community and its government. Further, a state is entitled to impose penalties upon those who break its laws. Normally a person who objects to the general laws of their country or fears a penalty for violation of such a law will not meet the requirements to be a protected person in Canada. However, there are limits to this proposition.\nThe Federal Court of Appeal in Zolfagharkhani2 set out the analysis to apply in these situations:\nAfter this review of the law, I now venture to set forth some general propositions relating to the status of an ordinary law of general application in determining the question of persecution:\n(1) The statutory definition of Convention refugee makes the intent (or any principal effect) of an ordinary law of general application, rather than the motivation of the claimant, relevant to the existence of persecution.\n(2) But the neutrality of an ordinary law of general application, vis-\u00e0-vis the five grounds for refugee status, must be judged objectively by Canadian tribunals and courts when required.\n(3) In such consideration, an ordinary law of general application, even in non-democratic societies, should, I believe, be given a presumption of validity and neutrality, and the onus should be on a claimant, as is generally the case in refugee cases, to show that the laws are either inherently or for some other reason persecutory.\n(4) It will not be enough for the claimant to show that a particular regime is generally oppressive but rather that the law in question is persecutory in relation to a Convention ground.\nFirst, I find the claimant has not discharged the onus upon him of establishing that the Israeli conscription law is inherently persecutory in relation to a Convention ground. I find the Israeli military conscription law is a law of general application. Israel is a democratic country. The law applies to all Israeli citizens, although there is some difference in the length of service for men and women, and women and certain religious groups have more scope to apply for an exemption from service.3 I find these differences do not mean it is not a law of general application. The intent of the law is that all men and women are subject to be called for military service, and certain limited exemptions then apply. I note the Federal Court has said it is not persecution for a country to have compulsory military service.4\nSecond, I find the claimant has not shown on a balance of probabilities that the law is persecutory as applied to him. The Federal Court has said an aversion to military service or a fear of combat is not in itself sufficient reason to justify a fear of persecution.5 However, conscientious objectors and people who object to particular military operations that the international community has judged to be contrary to international law or to the basic rules of human conduct may be found to be Convention refugees. 6\nIn this regard, I note the claimant never said he is a conscientious objector - he says he does not want to die. He said other young men in Israel share these views, although many are willing to serve their country. He gave no political or religious convictions for his views. He participated in the Israeli military for three years, although he tried to pretend he was not sane in order to get out. The claimant did not apply for an exemption from service as a conscientious objector as he said he was not in a combat role. I think this indicates the claimant is not a conscientious objector, as if he objected to war on the basis of his conscience, I am satisfied he would have applied for an exemption from the military whether or not he was in an active combat role. He was on guard duty and carried a weapon. The claimant gave no evidence of any activities or other conduct that would suggest he was a conscientious objector.\nFurther, the claimant gave no evidence of objecting to any particular activities of the Israeli military. Thus I find his claim cannot be considered as one in which a person, although not a conscientious objector generally, objects to serving in military operations that the international community has judged to be contrary to basic rules of human conduct or contrary to recognized basic international principles of human rights.7\nIn conclusion on this point, I find the claimant has failed to establish on a balance of probabilities that he has a credible nexus to any Convention ground. As a result, I find his objection to military service is not persecution based on a Convention ground.\nThird, even where a law of general application is found not to be inherently persecutory nor persecutory with respect to the specific individual, the Federal Court has indicated it is necessary to consider whether the penalty for violation of the law may constitute persecution.8 This raises the issue of whether the imprisonment the claimant could face if he returns to Israel and refuses to report for military service if he is recalled would be sufficiently serious to constitute persecution.\nThe UNHCR Handbook9 comments on the punishment for individuals who do not perform compulsory military service.\n167. In countries where military service is compulsory, failure to perform this duty is frequently punishable by law. Moreover, whether military service is compulsory or not, desertion is invariably considered a criminal offence. The penalties may vary from country to country, and are not normally regarded as persecution. Fear of prosecution and punishment for desertion or draft-evasion does not in itself constitute well-founded fear of persecution under the definition. Desertion or draft-evasion does not, on the other hand, exclude a person from being a refugee, and a person may be a refugee in addition to being a deserter or draft-evader.\nI note there is no alternative service available in Israel for people who claim conscientious objector status. Further, there is only a very limited opportunity to gain exemption from military conscription. The result is that many people who refuse to serve face charges, convictions and jail sentences. The maximum sentence for each conviction appears to be two years and, once released from jail, the person may face repeated convictions and jail sentences if he\/she still refuses to serve. However, the documentation indicates the usual sentence for each conviction is 28 to 35 days in jail, followed by repeated sentences of the same length for people who continue to refuse to serve. This may continue until the person has served five or six of these sentences - apparently to a maximum of approximately 150 days of jail in total, although there is one report of one person serving seven 28-day terms and another report of several people serving a total of nine months in jail before being released and exempted from further military call-up.10\nIf the claimant returns and is recalled and refuses to serve in the military, he could expect to serve a period of incarceration. The most up-to-date information we have is that such a period would likely be from five to nine months in total. In the panel's view such a penalty would not be disproportionate to the breach of the law. Therefore I find the expected penalty for failing to abide by the law is not persecutory.\nIn conclusion with respect to the claimant's aversion to military service, I find the law and its penalty do not constitute persecution on a Convention ground for the purposes of section 96 of the Act. I find the claimant fears prosecution and not persecution in this regard.\nWith regard to section 97 of the Act, I find the risk the claimant fears in serving in the military is a risk faced generally by other individuals in Israel. Military service is compulsory with few exceptions. Therefore I find it is covered by section 97(1)(b)(ii). Further, in accordance with the reasoning above, I find the risk the claimant fears if he refuses to serve is inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions that have not been shown to be contrary to accepted international standards. The claimant has provided no evidence that the penalty for refusing to serve in the military is contrary to international norms. The normal sentences outlined above do not appear to be excessive for the nature of the offence. Therefore, I find this is covered by section 97(1)(b)(iii) of the Act.\nGeneral Fear of Serious Harm\nThe claimant also expressed a fear of serious harm generally as many people are seriously injured or killed by suicide bombers in Israel.\nI find the government of Israel is making serious efforts to reduce or prevent these attacks on its citizens. The Court of Appeal in Villafranca stated:\nNo government that makes any claim to democratic values or protection or human rights can guarantee the protection of all its citizens at all times. Thus it is not enough for a claimant merely to show that his government has not always been effective at protecting persons in his particular situation. Terrorism in the name of one warped ideology or another is a scourge afflicting many societies today; its victims, however much they may merit our sympathy, do not become Convention refugees simply because their governments have been unable to suppress the evil. ... where a state is in the effective control of its territory, has military, police and civil authority in place, and make serious efforts to protect its citizens from terrorist activities, the mere fact that it is not always successful at doing so will not be enough to justify a claim that the victims of terrorism are unable to avail themselves of such protection.11\nI find this statement applies here. Israel is in control of its territories; it is taking extensive measures to prevent and combat attacks on it civilian population; the measures taken are serious and consistent; and there is no clear or convincing evidence that the state is unable or unwilling to protect its citizens. While the protection against random and unpredictable terrorist attacks on Jewish civilians in Israel is not perfect, Israel is nevertheless making serious efforts to protect is citizens. I find the claimant has not rebutted the presumption of state protection.\nCONCLUSION\nBased on the evidence, country documentation and law, I find there is less than a serious possibility the claimant faces persecution on the basis of any Convention ground for the purposes of section 96, and less than a serious possibility he faces a risk to his life, a risk of cruel and unusual punishment or treatment, or a danger of torture for the purposes of section 97 of the Act if he returns to Israel.\nTherefore, the Refugee Protection Division determines XXXXX XXXXX, a.k.a. XXXXX XXXXX, is not a Convention refugee and is not a person in need of protection.\n\"Thomas H. Kemsley\"\nThomas H.

He fears persecution from the state authorities in Iran because of his activities as a photojournalist.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant says, between 2000 and 2002, he worked as a photographer for a daily newspaper in XXXXX. In the summer of 2000 he took photographs of a man who died in suspicious circumstances in a court building in XXXXX. The newspaper published the photographs. The editor of the paper and the claimant were required to report to the Ministry of Islamic Guidance in XXXXX and were reprimanded. The authorities prohibited the claimant from taking photographs in certain areas.\nIn XXXXX 2002 the claimant took video pictures and still pictures of the New Year celebrations in an area of XXXXX. The police arrived to break up the celebrations, and they detained the claimant and others. The authorities mistreated the claimant and kept him in jail for approximately eight months. The claimant was released on conditions, and was required to report on several occasions.\nThe claimant returned to work with his former editor, who had started a new publication because the authorities had closed the newspaper. The claimant was involved in taking photographs at special events at the University of XXXXX and got to know students who opposed the Iranian government. Through his contacts, the claimant assisted these students in getting materials printed and helped them distribute those materials at various demonstrations. In XXXXX 2003, these students held large public rallies. The claimant attended some of those rallies. The authorities raided the university and arrested some students who had worked with the claimant. A week later, the police stopped and detained the claimant's brother while he was driving the claimant's car. The police detained his brother for about a week. They told his brother they were looking for the claimant because he had participated in demonstrations and helped the student protesters.\nThe claimant was concerned for his safety. He thought the authorities maybe had taken photographs of the demonstrations and had identified him through those photographs, or some of the students who had been arrested had given his name to the authorities. The claimant went into hiding. With the assistance of one of his brothers, he left Iran with the assistance of an agent and came to Canada. He fears the authorities will detain, torture and possibly kill him if he returns.\nDETERMINATION\nI find the claimant is a Convention refugee.\nANALYSIS\nThere are some weaknesses in the claimant's story. The primary one is that he was unable to produce any examples of his published work. However, he produced an undated XXXXX XXXXX and several other documents to confirm his identity and occupation.1 The claimant was also vague on what has happened to the editor of his paper, even though his editor's difficulties with the authorities are publicly available.2 Finally, the claimant had difficulty producing a logical story as to how he ended up in Canada, rather than Azerbaijan or Turkey.\nHowever, generally, I find the claimant provided sufficient credible evidence to establish his story. I accept he worked as a photographer in a newspaper, he was arrested and jailed for approximately eight months in 2002 for taking photographs of the New Year celebrations, and the authorities now want him for his participation in student demonstrations in XXXXX and assistance he provided to the students at the University of XXXXX.\nThe country documentation indicates the authorities can treat dissidents very harshly in detention.3 I find that treatment can amount to persecution. In this case that persecution would be on the basis of his political opinion - either actual or perceived.\nCONCLUSION\nBased on the evidence, country documentation and submissions, I find there is more than a mere possibility the claimant faces persecution on the basis of his political opinion in Iran.\nTherefore, the Refugee Protection Division determines that XXXXX XXXXXXXX is a Convention refugee.\n\"Thomas H.

It will be useful to set out an overview of the facts.\nTHE BACKGROUND\nThe Respondent, a citizen of Pakistan, arrived in Canada on April 15, 1995. On May 29, 1995 he signed his Personal Information Form (PIF)2 and a hearing into his claim was held on December 19, 1996 in front of a two-person panel of the CRDD in Calgary, Alberta. The claimant based his claim upon alleged persecution he faced in Pakistan due to his membership in the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF). The panel raised the issue of possible exclusion with the claimant and his counsel and questions about the nature of the organisation and the claimant's particular role in it were asked at the hearing. Specifically, counsel for the claimant asked whether he had \"...any knowledge that the JKLF indulges in any - any acts of terrorism or crimes against humanity.\"3 The claimant responded as follows:\nNo. There is nothing - there is nothing like this because JKLF does not participate in any such activities - any activities that are against the humanity, or against the law, or against democracy. It is a registered political party of Pakistan, of Azar Kashmir, who believes in democracy, and we believe - and we also try. The solution to every problem should be found out through negotiations and should be done in a democratic fashion. And this is our belief, and we follow our belief.4\nCounsel for the claimant then asked his client whether he had \"...ever assisted or participated in any tradition of crime against humanity\"?5 The following exchange took place:\nA. Neither I have participated in any such activities that is against the humanity, nor - nor - nor my party has ever participated in any such activity that is against the humanity or against the democracy, and - neither I'm aware of any such activities, or nor we participate in any such.\nQ. Okay. Does your organization advocate violence against opponents of Kashmiri cause in Pakistan?\nA. No. No, never. Not myself nor neither my party, neither we are ever aware of such - such things.6 [Emphasis added]\nShortly after this the panel expressed that it was satisfied that exclusion was \"...no longer an issue.\"7 A positive decision was rendered at the conclusion of the hearing although detailed reasons were not given. A written decision, outlining the reasons for the decision was signed on March 19, 1997. At the hearing the panel noted that they had found the claimant to be a credible witness.8 In its reasons for judgment the panel noted:\nThe claimant related credible evidence which convinced the panel that he was not an advocate of violence in his own political objectives. In this context, the panel concluded that there was no issue of exclusion in relation to this claim. ...\nThe panel concluded that the claimant was a credible and trustworthy witness, and accepted his testimony.9\nThe Respondent made an Application for permanent residence following his successful claim for refugee status.\nOn September 5, 2000 an Immigration Officer (IO) interviewed the Respondent. As a result of this interview and the IO's view that the JKLF was a terrorist organisation a Section 27 Report was issued pursuant to the old Immigration Act.10 An Inquiry before an Adjudicator of the Adjudication Division (AD) was held on May 18th and June 1, 2001. On July 19, 2001 the Adjudicator determined that the Respondent was a person described pursuant to S. 19 (1) (f) (iii) (b) of the old Act; namely that he was a member of a terrorist group and thereby removable from Canada. This decision was appealed to the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) and a hearing was held on November 15, 2001 in front of a three-person panel in Vancouver, B.C. A unanimous decision was delivered on December 17, 2001 denying the appeal.\nTHE CURRENT APPLICATION\nIn his Application to Vacate counsel for the Minister alleges that the Respondent:\n...misrepresented and concealed both the nature of the JKLF and its activities to the CRDD, foreclosing the CRDD from assessing whether the Respondent should be excluded from the Convention Refugee definition under Articles 1 (F) (a) and 1 (F) (c).\nThe Application to Vacate section of the IRPA is set out in S. 109. It reads:\n(1) The Refugee Protection Division may, on application by the Minister, vacate a decision to allow a claim for refugee protection, if it finds that the decision was obtained as a result of directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts relating to a relevant matter.\n(2) The Refugee Protection Division may reject the application if it is satisfied that other sufficient evidence was considered at the time of the first determination to justify refugee protection.\n(3) If the application is allowed, the claim of the person is deemed to be rejected and the decision that led to the conferral of refugee protection is nullified\nThe previous section under the IA was s. 69.3 (5), which read:\nThe Refugee Division may reject an application under subsection 69.2 (2) that is otherwise established if it is of the opinion that, notwithstanding that the determination was obtained by fraudulent means or misrepresentation, suppression or concealment of any material fact, there was other sufficient evidence on which the determination was or could have been based.\nThe courts have not interpreted the new section. In the past the courts generally have held that for the purposes of conducting an analysis pursuant to this section there is a two-step process. Firstly, the burden is upon the Minister to adduce sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the claimant misrepresented, was fraudulent, suppressed or concealed a material fact. If the Minister demonstrates this then the Board is obliged to consider the remaining evidence available to the original panel in order to determine whether there is still sufficient evidence upon which to conclude that the claimant was or could have been a refugee.\nTHE MINISTER'S ARGUMENT\nThe Minister takes the position that the Respondent withheld from the CRDD his true knowledge of the activities of the JKLF. The Minister argued that had he been truthful with the panel members about his knowledge of the activities of the JKLF they would have concluded that the JKLF was engaged in either crimes against peace, war crimes, or crimes against humanity - contrary to Article 1F(a) - or had been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations - contrary to Article 1F(c). This being so, the Minister contends that the clamant would have been excluded from consideration under the Convention refugee sections of the Act.11\nTo demonstrate his argument the Minister contrasted the testimony of the Respondent before the CRDD in 1996 and his testimony before the Adjudication Division in 2001. I have already fully quoted the relevant testimony given by the Respondent at his hearing before the CRDD in 1996.\nIt is not in dispute that the Respondent was a member of the JKLF from 1988 until 1994 and that he was appointed XXXXXXXXXXXXXX for the XXXXXXXX District sometime in 1993. In my view, for the Minister to be successful in the preliminary step of this Application he must demonstrate that the Respondent directly or indirectly misrepresented or withheld a material fact or facts relating to a relevant matter. It is clear that facts relating to the exclusion issue would be relevant. The question is whether the Respondent \"misrepresented\" directly or indirectly or \"withheld\" information respecting the JKLF's involvement in activities contrary to either or both of Articles 1F(a) or 1F(c). The following exchange took place between the respondent and the Minister at the Adjudication hearing on June 1, 2001:\nQ. Now, are you aware that the JKLF accepts responsibility for a number of bomb attacks in areas of Kashmir?\nCOUNSEL: Can we have a time frame with respect to you - your comments?\nMR. WILKINSON: Certainly, 1988 through 1989.\nINTERPRETER: \"You want me to answer?\" And I said, \"Yes.\"\nA. I have joined JKLF in 1988. And my duties in JKLF was to collect donations. But during that time if a member of JKLF was part of these sort of activities, then I have no knowledge of that.\nBY MINISTER'S COUNSEL:\nQ. But are you aware or were you aware at any time that the JKLF was accepting responsibilities in 1988 and 1989 for - bombings and explosions in Kashmir?\nPERSON CONCERNED: Excuse me.\nA. The Pakistan held - I don't remember and I don't recall that there has ever been an incident where a Pakistan-held Kashmir has such - something like that happening.\nBY MINISTER'S COUNSEL:\nQ. Let me refer you to and read from our book of documents.\nMR. WILKINSON: At Tab 6 you'll find a document, Mr. Adjudicator, called Asia Watch, a highly recognized human rights organization, entitled \"Kashmir Under Siege.\" At page 13 or that document, top of the page.\nBY MINISTER'S COUNSEL:\nQ. I'll read from the paragraph starting with the word \"Beginning.\"\n\"Beginning in the latter half of 1988 and continuing through 1989, militants of the JKLF, the organization formed more than two decades earlier to win independence from India, claimed responsibility for a series of explosions in Kashmir which damaged government buildings, buses and the houses of present and former state government officials.\"\nAre you aware that the JKLF was publicly accepting responsibility during this period of time for bombings? [Emphasis added]\nA. As far as I remember, some of the news which you just read, they were in the newspapers. But whenever we had our meetings to collect donations, we always talked about that, who are those people who are part of these kind of - now who are doing these kind of things, which are not only inhumane but they are illegal.\nBut these things were always looked at and - with indifferently but nobody ever accepted responsibilities of the - personal responsibilities for these things. The thing is that the news which is printed in the newspaper and the media is under the government. But these things were always discussed in the meeting that nobody took personal responsibility. We always talked about that whoever is doing these kind of things, they're inhumane, unjustifiable, illegal. And usually when the news are printed in the newspapers, nobody - we always discussed in the meeting that these were - must be rumours because nobody ever had personal responsibility. So we always looked at them as they were not - these were not right things. Who would do such a thing? [Emphasis added]\nQ. So, notwithstanding the fact that the JKLF was admitting responsibility, you stayed with the organization.\nA. JKLF is basically like an umbrella, and there are a lot of other groups which are under that umbrella. [Emphasis added]\nQ. Oh, let's stop there. Let's - you can tell me about that because I've never heard that before. I'd be very interested in you telling me what the structure of the JKLF is, then, because I've read all this material and it doesn't talk like that.\nA The majority of the people who are in that party are - who want the Kashmir to be free as - on the political personal democracy and - on a democratic basis for - from the India and Pakistan. Want to get - have them freed and also to start a Western-style democracy. So the majority of the members in JKLF have this idea.\nBut like you were just saying and like in the newspaper, and I may have read in the newspaper in Pakistan, as well, these kind of violent activities which are mentioned, nobody has ever admitted personal responsibility. [Emphasis added]\nQ. But your organization admitted responsibility. Repeatedly in the documents the JKLF says they did it.\nA. [Foreign language spoke - response not interpreted]\nQ. Do you deny that?\nA. That's what I'm saying.\nQ. So you agree that the JKLF publicly announced that they did those bombings.\nA. No, I do not agree with that, because over there nobody admitted to - to accept responsibility for that.\nQ. Not an individual, sir. An organization is what I'm saying.\nA. But I have never read about that this organization have accepted any responsibility. And neither I know the whereabouts, or I know them personally, or in the newspaper and anywhere as - at all that who have admitted to taking responsibility of each activities.\nQ. So you've never read in the newspapers that the JKLF was accused or admitted to committing bombing or other terrorist acts?\nA. Like I said before, and that it's been six, seven years ago if I have read it in the newspaper. These - the news were always discussed in our meetings, that who are the people who are involved in such kind of activities in the JKL - JKLF. [Emphasis added]\nQ. Now, I have a question for you. Why did you stay with JKLF if there was all these allegations that they were engaged in bombings?\nA. If I had known anybody in JKLF that personally from anywhere at all - that if I have known anybody who - in JKLF who - but this - anybody who was in the JKLF -\nINTERPRETER: I'm just going to ask him to say it again because he was very -\nMR. WILKINSON: Thank you.\nA. Like I said before - like I mentioned before, that I don't know anybody personally who was involved in such kind of activities. The main purpose of JKLF is to free Kashmir from India and Pakistan and to start a Western-style democratic government.\nMR. TUCCI: Just a moment, Mr. Adjudicator, please.\nMR. WILKINSON: I'd like you to take - take you to - Mr. Adjudicator, to Tab 11 and an article entitled, \"Kashmir in the Crossfire,\" page 240, the third paragraph.\nBY MINISTER'S COUNSEL:\nQ. Part way down that paragraph I'll read.\n\"...the JKLF made headline news with the kidnapping of the home minister's twenty-three-year-old daughter, Dr. Rubaiya Sayeed, an intern at the Lalded {L-a-l-d-e-d} Memorial Women's Hospital...\"\nWere you aware of this kidnapping?\nA. I was - I was not aware of that kidnapping, as far as I remember.\nQ. You don't remember the headlines speaking of this woman's kidnapping.\nA. As far as I remember, in Kashmir and Pakistan I haven't read about this kind of news.\nQ. Okay. But you had a lot of discussions about the fact that the JKLF was being accused of bombings and other acts, acts of violence.\nA. Yes, I was often asked these kind of questions. [Emphasis added]\nQ. And, nonetheless, you stayed with the organization. You got promoted to the XXXXXXXXXXXXX for the district with the XXXXXXXXXX of the JKLF. You didn't ever feel that you had any obligation to distance yourself from an organization that was so seriously accused of very serious crimes, such as bombings, kidnappings, murder?\nA. Like I said before, when this kind of news were printed in the newspaper, we discussed them in our meetings. But nobody -- nobody admitted responsibility of who has done it.\nBut, secondly, it doesn't - if there is a news, it doesn't matter whether it's a rumour or not, and it was always looked at that nobody should be apart of activities which were inhumane and illegal. And it was always looked at and made a commitment as to in the meetings, as well, and we discussed with each other and that the only way the - and the Kashmir can be free is - was based on political and also democratic level.12 [Emphasis added]\nIt is clear from a reading of the transcript and with particular regard to the highlighted parts that the Respondent's answers to the questions, directed at what he knew about his party's possible connection with violent acts, were unclear. At no point does the Respondent admit that he was involved personally in any crimes committed by the JKLF. In fact he states that he knew no one personally in the organisation who had been involved in the commission of the various crimes alleged. Nor does he testify that he knew that members of the JKLF were involved in these alleged crimes. He goes further and states that he and others wondered who were involved although it is unclear whether he means other JKLF members or just other people in society. Nonetheless he does mention that the \"majority\" of the members of his party think as he does about the proper approach to take on achieving independence. This implies that others in the party - which he describes as like an umbrella - do not.\nIt is unclear what the Respondent is saying. The particular passages above can be interpreted in more than one way. However, what can be discerned is that the Respondent was at least aware while he was still in Pakistan that allegations in the newspapers were being made that his party - the JKLF - was involved in violent acts. He indicates that these allegations were frequent topics of discussion at his donation meetings. It is this, which was not mentioned to the CRDD. In my view this can either be characterised as \"indirectly misrepresenting\" or \"withholding\" material facts relating to a relevant matter. The information he withheld is clearly a material fact and it relates to the relevant matter of whether he should be excluded and his possible complicity. The panel finds that the Respondent indirectly and knowingly misrepresented a material fact and\/or withheld that same fact from the CRDD.\nSection 109 (1) reads:\nThe Refugee Protection Division may, on application by the Minister, vacate a decision to allow a claim for refugee protection, if it finds that the decision was obtained as a result of directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts relating to a relevant matter.\nI do not take this to mean that the Minister must be able to demonstrate that it is the particular withholding or misrepresenting that \"caused\" the panel to arrive at the determination that it did. Rather, it is sufficient if the misrepresentation or withholding was material and could have caused the panel to make the determination that it did, in the sense that the material fact is inextricably woven in to the other evidence. That being the case the panel finds that the Minister has presented a prima facie case that the misrepresentation or withholding did cause the original panel to come to the determination that it did.\nAt this point it is necessary to turn to the second part of the review; namely, was there \"other sufficient evidence\" in front of the original panel that could \"justify refugee protection.\" In order to consider s. 109 (2) we need to review what information was available to the original panel. It is clear that the panel had raised the issue of exclusion and Respondent's counsel asked questions specifically about the possible criminality of some of the actions of the JKLF. Clearly, the panel was alive to the issue and aware that there were documents - which were in disclosure - that dealt, perhaps inconclusively, with the issue of the terrorist activities of the JKLF. In particular, PAK19133.E; dated February 6, 199513 referred to the JKLF having a \"military wing.\" PAK20606.E dated May 19, 199514 referred to a national spokesman for the JKLF denying that the organisation was involved in \"military or violent activities.\" There is as well, documentary evidence that indicates that the Pakistani government at times mistreated members of the JKLF. However, the documentary evidence in front of the original panel made it clear that there appeared to be both a militant and non-militant wing of the party. As to the issue of violence or terrorism it must be said that the evidence was vague and inconclusive. Given this, and the fact that the claimant admitted at the IAD to no more than reading newspaper reports that\naccused his party of committing acts of violence, the panel finds that there was sufficient evidence in front of the original panel that could have justified a finding of refugee protection.\nAccordingly the Application to vacate is dismissed.\n\"Michael Ross\"\nMichael Ross\nAugust 19, 2004\nDate\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - APPLICATION - VACATION - EXCLUSION CLAUSES - ADJUDICATION DIVISION - INADMISSIBILITY - REMOVAL - MALE - DISMISSED - PAKISTAN\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibit 1.\n3 Exhibit 7, tab C, page 13, lines 11 - 12.\n4 Ibid, lines 38 - 43.\n5 Supra, footnote 3, lines 45 - 46.\n6 Ibid, page 13, line 48 to page 14, line 5.\n7 Exhibit 7, tab C, page 15, lines 1 - 2.\n8 Ibid, page 28, line 23.\n9 Exhibit 7, tab D, page 5.\n10 Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1985, C.

The hearing into the claim was held pursuant to section 170 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA),1 at Vancouver, B.C. on 26 July 2004.\nIn determining whether the claimant is a Convention refugee or person in need of protection, I have considered all the evidence, including the claimant's Personal Information Form (PIF),2 oral testimony, the documentary evidence filed by counsel and the Refugee Protection Officer (RPO), counsel's submissions, IRPA, and the relevant caselaw.\nALLEGATIONS\nIn his PIF, the claimant alleges that he issued false invoices for his manager in the XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX. From 1995 to 2000, his manager appropriated 10 million RMB. To avoid further complicity in the scheme, the claimant went on long-term medical leave and was subsequently asked to resign by the manager and given two years' severance pay.\nWhen the company was facing financial problems in 2003, and after the manager had left, an audit was taken which revealed the scheme. His manager blamed the claimant for the problem.\nIn addition to facing a court inquiry into the scheme, the claimant alleges he will be blamed for a fraud practiced on the company in 1997. A large shipment of XXXXX XXXXX, for which he had signed the invoice and make the transportation arrangements, failed to reach the warehouse. While he was initially cleared of blame, which was attached to a different factory manager, he believes the new 2003 audit will also attach the blame to him for this action.\nISSUES\nThe determinative issue in the claim was Exclusion 1F(b).\nANALYSIS\nExclusion 1F(b)\nArticle 1F(b) of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees states:\nThe provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:...\n(b) He has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee.\nThe Federal Court of Appeal held in Sivakumar that \"serious reasons for considering is something more than mere suspicion or conjecture, but something less than the balance of probabilities.\"3\nAccording to the Federal Court of Appeal, \"a claimant can be excluded from refugee protection by the Refugee Protection Division for a purely economic offence.\"4 Justice Kelen in Xie5 found \"sensible\" the earlier practice of Justice Robertson in Chan6 of defining a serious crime by reference to the maximum sentence that could be imposed had the crime been committed in Canada. Justice Kelen followed it because it was consistent with the definition of serious criminality in subsection 36(1) of IRPA and it dovetailed with the general principle of extradition set out in seubsection 3(1) of the Extradition Act, S.C. 1999, ch. 18. Justice Kelen also cited academic sources such as Waldman,7 Hathaway8 and Goodwin-Gill9 as supporting the view that economic crimes could be included within the scope of Article 1F(b).\nJustice Kelen's lead was followed by Justice Pelletier in the Court of Appeal's review of the same claim.10\nSubsection 36(1) of IRPA stipulates that\n36. (1) A permanent resident or a foreign national is inadmissible on grounds of serious criminality for\n(c) committing an act outside Canada that is an offence in the place where it was committed and that, if committed in Canada, would constitute an offence under an Act of Parliament punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 10 years.\nWhile this section of the Act applies to immigrants rather than refugees, I find that Parliament's intent was to associate serious criminality with a punishment of at least ten years' imprisonment in Canada.\nSection 334 of the Criminal Code of Canada states that the penalty for theft over $5,000 is \"a term not exceeding ten years.\"11 Section 380(1) of the Criminal Code states that the same penalty attaches to defrauding the public or any person of money over $5,000. Ten million RMB equals over $1 million.12 Following the lead of the Courts and IRPA, I find that the fraudulent scheme that the claimant describes is a serious non-political crime.\nWhat was that scheme? In his PIF, the claimant alleges that his boss asked him to mark up incoming lumber by 20-30 RMB\/sq. m.\nI was surprised by his request. The total mark-up would have been approximately 200,000 RMB mark up\/month and I thought this was too much. He wanted me to do this in order to have a larger expense account for himself. ... I thought this was the right of the factory manager to do as long as he accepted responsibility for it. It was his right to decide. I thought as well this would help the business. I would prepare the (false) invoices and Mr. XXXXX would sign them. In the beginning I did not think this was a problem, as I saw Mr. XXXXX doing business banquets with clients. Later on in 1997 as China became more deregulated, I became more suspicious because Mr. XXXXX was becoming too close to the lumber sellers and he was purchasing poor quality lumber. I did not know he was pocketing the money himself. Later, I realized the factory manager used the 10 million RMB, accumulated over time, to put in his own pocket.13\nIn the claimant's Port of Entry (POE) interview, he stated:\nThe job that I was given is purchasing of lumber and also sales of lumber. In 1995 the person in charge of my unit he told me [sic] that when I purchase the lumber I should add $20.00-$30.00 [sic] on top of the original price and that is per cubic meter. At that time the policy is such that the supervisor can withdraw some kind of a fund from the company for whatever purposes. In my unit every month we would consume 9,000 cubic meters of lumber. In other words, every month he could withdraw up to about 200,000.00 RMB. So within a year it would amount to over 2 million RMB. Because he was my superior so all I can do is to do the reporting of the accounts according to the instruction that he gave me. In the year 2000 I have some health problem. I left the company and right now this company is closing down and they need to audit the accounts. Because since 1995 up to the year 2000 within this 5 years of the price difference that I did they found a discrepancy of close to 10 million RMB. They said to me that it was because I was the one who did this pricing that I should bear this responsibility, but I told them there was no point for me doing the pricing this way because I gained nothing from it, it was rather my supervisor who could benefit from it. The auditor said that I must have pocketed the money from the customers.14\nThe claimant explained that it was legal for the manager to take 4 percent of profits for his business expenses. But his boss raised the price of the lumber and took 4 percent of the inflated price. Inflating the price he considered to be not legal. Moreover, later he allegedly discovered that the boss was also skimming off the 96% of the inflated price that was not his to appropriate, and splitting it with the suppliers.\nWhile the appropriation of 4 percent of uninflated profits had a legal justification, both inflating the price of the lumber and also misappropriating the remaining 96 percent had no legal justification.\nThe claimant said that he only learned about the manager's appropriation of the 96 percent at a dinner he had with company suppliers in 1998. However, when asked to relate the conversation he had with those suppliers in which these revelations were made, he could not give a satisfactory report of it. Instead he said that the suppliers made general comments such as that the manager was greedy. The claimant said that this comment meant that the manager wanted to increase the mark-up. Given that he already knew about the mark-up, this explanation was not\nhelpful in showing the panel how he came to know about the splitting of profits with the suppliers in the first place. The rest of his descriptions of what was said at the dinner were equally unhelpful in disclosing how the conversation led to his full knowledge of the manager's scheme. To be sure, the claimant took the opportunity to explain to the panel details of the scheme he had not shared so far, but the panel's request had been to relate those parts of the conversation which brought about his sudden awakening and conversion to opposition against the scheme. This he did not do. I find the explanations he provided in lieu of descriptions of the conversation to be an attempt to deflect the panel's attention from its search for an explanation.\nThe claimant acknowledged having a sense from the beginning that the manager was up to fraud and embezzlement. In his PIF, he says that he had misgivings from the beginning (\"I thought this was too much.\")15 In the hearing room, the claimant explained that inflating the purchase was wrong but that he had to do what he was told, an admission that also shows that he was aware of the illegality of inflating the lumber's price in the first place. Asked by the Minister's Representative if he was aware that the invoices had false values, he said that he was. I therefore find that the claimant had knowledge from the start that he was involved in an illegal and fraudulent arrangement.\nI find it improbable that the claimant would have continued the arrangement he had with the manager as long as two and a half years if he had reservations about its legality from the start. I also do not believe that his manager could have kept the second half of the arrangement (keeping the remainder of the marked-up price and splitting it with the suppliers) from his assistant (the claimant) for two and a half years and that the manager's assistant (the claimant), in the context of his involvement with the financial affairs of the company, came to learn of it in the manner he describes. While I cannot know the truth of the situation, I find the scenario the claimant has presented it to me to be, on a balance of probabilities, an attempt to hide the truth. Thus I find it to be not credible.\nMoreover, even if I believed the claimant's story of how his knowledge unfolded (which I do not), I do not believe that he was obliged to wait six months to separate himself from the scheme. The claimant's explanations of why he could not leave were for the most part posited on him remaining employed and needing to go through channels to find another position.\nBut it was open to him simply to leave the company in order to avoid being part of the criminal appropriation of funds, a choice he did not take for the full three years during which the scheme operated. By way of explanation, the claimant stated that even leaving the company outright was not that easy a task and he described his elaborate ruse of sick leave as an attempt to allay suspicions about his reasons for separating from the company. I do not accept the claimant's allegations that he could not have left the company soon after discovering the fraudulent intentions of his boss, whether that was sometime after the scheme began (as he testified at the beginning of the hearing) or in early 1998 (as he testified later). The claimant said that when he was not in the office, other employees signed the invoices. He was away a great deal of the time between 1998 and 2000. I believe it reasonable therefore to assume that others would also be signing the fraudulent invoices and facing the same risk. Moreover, he discussed a female employee who would have taken over from him and she was described as leaving the company at the same time as him, but without sick leave. I do not believe that it was not reasonably open to the claimant to leave the company if he were concerned about the illegality of his boss's actions.\nAsked why he did not change jobs, the claimant stated that changing jobs is not easy in China and that he was afraid he would get saddled with the blame for the arrangement, even though he also alleges that he did not profit from it. Asked why he did not move to another post, he answered evasively that he did not want to work in the lumber business because as a business it was corrupt.\nIn the years that he continued the illegal arrangement with his boss, the claimant testified that he did not cover himself by taking photocopies of faked invoices or assembling any other evidence in order to protect himself in the event of discovery by the authorities. When asked to explain why not, he said that he had to hand over everything to his boss when he left, evading the question why he had not assembled a package of evidence before leaving. He also revealed that other members of his department would sign invoices in his absence and yet he did not speak to any other members of the department as a means of assembling evidence for his case. Asked why, he said they did not speak of personal matters. I find the claimant's lack of efforts to protect himself to be improbable.\nThe claimant described the efforts of the audit department inconsistently, in a manner that simply seemed designed to support his allegations. On the one hand, the claimant stated that the investigating audit department was very sharp and able to get to the bottom of financial misdealings. On the other hand, he represented them as willing and able to be duped by managers into blaming the lower-echelon staff.\nThe claimant acknowledges being involved in corrupt practices himself. He obtained medical leave certificates with falsified information from a hospital doctor who owed him a favour. He explained his help in the following manner: when his friends wanted a certain thing, he supplied it. A family doing renovation work would need plaster and he would supply it from the company stores. He said that if a person knew him, that person could buy things from him; if they did not, they could not. If they had a good relationship, there need be no money changing hands. He added that the company did allow him to do that for a \"certain\" amount. He had allowed the doctor to have building materials and so the doctor had benefited from him. In return, the doctor supplied him with fake medical certificates which allowed him to take extensive sick leave for a condition he did not have. I find the claimant himself to be involved in corrupt activities.\nRegarding the matter of the vanished cardboard fibre, the scheme had already been investigated and responsibility affixed to the deputy factory manager who signed the invoice and who was subsequently removed from his position. Given that responsibility has already been assigned to the deputy factory manager some years earlier, I do not accept the claimant's story that he stands to be punished for this criminal action.\nI accept the summons that the claimant has produced16 and fact that he has been summoned by the Economic Court as part of their investigation of XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX financial irregularities. The summons says that the Court \"suspect[s him] of corruption and malpractice\" in the theft of 10 million RMB from XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX.17 Of a similar situation, the Federal Court of Appeal ruled that:\n[20] The Board was entitled to presume that the warrant for the appellant's arrest was issued in the belief that she was guilty of misconduct. The presumption of innocence would apply to the proof of that misconduct, but it does not apply so as to prevent the Board from\ntaking the Chinese state's belief in her guilt into account in deciding if there are serious reasons to consider that she committed the crime with which she is charged.18\nThe claimant has acknowledged to the Board that he was part of a scheme that succeeded in defrauding the XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX of 10 million RMB. His denials of complicity and his explanations of his role in the scheme are marred by serious credibility problems. He has substantiated the Chinese government's interest in him by providing a summons to Economic Court. On the basis of the totality of the evidence and pursuant to Article 1F(b), I find that serious grounds exist for considering that the claimant has committed a serious non-political crime in XXXXX, China, prior to admission to Canada.\nDETERMINATION\nIn light of these findings, I determine that, pursuant to IRPA, Section 98, XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX is excluded under Article 1F(b) and not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. I therefore reject this claim for refugee protection.\n\"S.M. Beckow\"\nS.M.

These disclosures contain what is referred to as \"Updated Regional Disclosure\" indexes of documents, but do not contain the documents referred to. Counsel takes the position that by failing to attach the actual document referred to the Board does not conform to Refugee Protection Division (RPD) Rule 27 or the Chairperson's Guideline 7.\nThe issue of whether actual documents or index lists need be disclosed has been dealt with by the courts. The Federal Court of Appeal, in Hassan,1 has held that disclosure of the index where the documents are readily available to counsel is adequate in order to comply with s. 68(5) of the previous Immigration Act.2 There is no equivalent to former section 68(5) in the new Act.3 In the old Act 68(4) dealt with the Board relying upon \"generally recognized facts...\", etc and made it subject to section 68(5). There is no such limitation in the current equivalent of section 68(4).4\nHowever, Rule 18 of the RPD Rules does contain the equivalent of the old section 68(5). Consequently, the rationale provided by the Federal Court of Appeal remains: where ready access is available to claimant's counsel then the claimant has a reasonable opportunity to prepare by reading that material. In this case the documentary material is readily available at the Immigration and Refugee Board's Document Centre.\nGuideline 7, paragraph 3, states, \"The RPD has to follow the same rule.\" Reference to the RPD having to follow the same rule was intended to show that the RPD is subject to the same\ntiming restriction - disclosure of documents no later than 20 days before the hearing. It does not mean disclosing individual documents from the index. Paragraph 5 underlines the fact that the RPD is responsible for providing basic documentary evidence on country of reference.\nConsequently, the Board takes the position that the index constitutes appropriate and fair notice of documents that may be relied upon by the Board in coming to its decisions.\n\"Michael A.

It will be useful to set out an overview of the facts.\nTHE BACKGROUND\nThe Respondent, a citizen of Sri Lanka, arrived in Canada on January 9 2000. On March 28, 2000 he signed his Personal Information Form (PIF)2 and a hearing into his claim was held on January 31, 2001 in front of a panel of the CRDD in Vancouver, British Columbia. The respondent based his claim upon alleged persecution he faced in Sri Lanka from the Sri Lankan Security Forces (SLSF).\nSpecifically, he claimed in his PIF3 and at his hearing that after his mother hosted two of his cousins in XXXXX 1999 the family began to get visits from the Sri Lankan Police (SLP) because of their suspicions that the cousins were involved with the Tamil Tigers (LTTE). On XXXXX, 1999 one of the cousins - XXXXX - went missing and was never seen again. Later that day the SLP detained both the respondent and his other cousin - XXXXX. The respondent was taken to a Sri Lankan Army (SLA) camp and held until released on XXXXX, 1999. During his detention he was physically beaten and sexually abused continuously by a Colonel in the army.\nOn XXXXX, 1999 the respondent was awakened one morning by noises from SLSF coming to arrest him. He fled and after a period of hiding succeeded in escaping to Canada. The other cousin, XXXXX, was never seen again either.\nA hearing into the claim took place on January 31, 2001. A positive decision was rendered at the conclusion of the hearing. The panel noted the centrality of the issue of credibility. In its reasons for judgment the panel noted:\nAt the outset, credibility was identified as a significant issue and it is particularly so because the claimant provided false information and a false document to corroborate information that he was younger than he really is. When an individual lies to the Board with respect to identity, that is always a concern and it raises issues with respect to credibility.\n...The next issue that I need to deal with is the credibility of the allegations about his experiences with the Sri Lankan Army and the reasons for those experiences...\n...Having heard the claimant's evidence and heard the testimony of Dr. XXXXX, I'm satisfied that the claimant had the experiences that he alleges in his Personal Information Form and in his testimony...4\nOn February 6, 2004 the respondent arrived on a flight from Hong Kong. At the airport CIC became interested when they found him in possession of two passports in the name of XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX along with other documents in the name of XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX. A check with US officials revealed that he was one and the same person and had been living in the United States from XXXXX, 1999 and remained there until coming to Canada in XXXXX 2000.5 As a result of this information the Minister filed an Application to Vacate.\nAt his hearing the claimant admitted that he had lied to the original panel and that he, in fact, had not been in Sri Lanka during the time the events he alleged had taken place. However, he stated that all the events that he had spoken of had taken place except that they had occurred exactly one year earlier. By way of explanation he stated that because he was operating under two different names he had to conceal the passports which would have shown him to have been in the United States rather than Sri Lanka at the times of the alleged incidents.\nThe Current Application\nThe Application to Vacate section of the IRPA is set out in S. 109. It reads:\n(1) The Refugee Protection Division may, on application by the Minister, vacate a decision to allow a claim for refugee protection, if it finds that the decision was obtained as a result of directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts relating to a relevant matter.\n(2) The Refugee Protection Division may reject the application if it is satisfied that other sufficient evidence was considered at the time of the first determination to justify refugee protection.\n(3) If the application is allowed, the claim of the person is deemed to be rejected and the decision that led to the conferral of refugee protection is nullified.\nThe previous section under the IA was s. 69.3 (5), which read:\nThe Refugee Division may reject an application under subsection 69.2 (2) that is otherwise established if it is of the opinion that, notwithstanding that the determination was obtained by fraudulent means or misrepresentation, suppression or concealment of any material fact, there was other sufficient evidence on which the determination was or could have been based.\nIn the past, the courts generally have held that for the purposes of conducting an analysis pursuant to this section there is a two-step process. Firstly, the burden is upon the Minister to adduce sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the claimant misrepresented, was fraudulent, suppressed or concealed a material fact. If the Minister demonstrates this then the Board is obliged to consider the remaining evidence available to the original panel in order to determine whether there is still sufficient evidence upon which to conclude that the claimant was or could have been a refugee.\nThe Minister's Argument\nThe Minister position is simple. The documents show, and the respondent acknowledges, that he was not in Sri Lanka at any of the times relevant to the alleged incidents in Sri Lanka. Consequently, the Minister states that she has demonstrated that the respondent mislead the original panel on the material facts. Secondly, the Minister has argued that absent this information all that is left as evidence for the original panel to consider is that the respondent is a citizen of Sri Lanka. This, the Minister contends, is not sufficient by itself to support a successful claim for refugee status. Consequently, the Minister urges the panel to vacate the respondent's status as a refugee.\nThe Respondent's Argument\nCounsel for the respondent acknowledges that the respondent was not in Sri Lanka at the relevant times. However, he noted that, as to evidence left in front of the original panel, there remained the claimant's testimony about what happened to him - namely the sexual abuse by the SLA Colonel. As well, there was the testimony of Dr. XXXXX who concluded, on the basis of objective tests and the respondent's evidence that he had in fact been the victim of sexual abuse at the hands of a Colonel in the SLA. Consequently, even after removing the dates from the incidents the panel would be left with evidence, which indicated that the respondent was sexually abused and persecuted while in Sri Lanka and that is enough to justify a finding that he was a Convention refugee.\nDr. XXXXX Evidence\nIn his testimony to the original panel Dr. XXXXX stated that he performed two objective assessments upon the respondent - the Beck Depression Inventory and the Impact of Events Scale. On the former he testified that he found XXXXX to be \"moderately depressed\".6 On the latter Dr. XXXXX stated that he could not have scored higher.7 The doctor went on to state that, according to XXXXX other misfortunate events in his life - the death of his father, witnessing the carnage of the civil war over many years - did not traumatize him. The doctor stated that he could not second guess XXXXX on that.8 He concluded that: \"So, there's nothing in which - that he said to me that suggested that there were any, you know, prior conditions that would account for this posttraumatic stress disorder.\"9\nDr. XXXXX was also asked whether he thought XXXXX could have misled him. Dr. XXXXX was adamant that he had not been fooled. He elaborated that he believed that he was very good at what he does and that he had objectively tested the respondent.10\nFindings\nWith respect to the first prong of the test the panel finds that the respondent's lies about the events taking place as he stated they had in his PIF and to the original panel can be characterised as \"directly misrepresenting\" or \"withholding\" material facts relating to a relevant matter. The information he withheld are clearly material facts and they relate to the relevant matter of whether the respondent suffered persecution in Sri Lanka. The panel finds that the\nRespondent directly and knowingly misrepresented a material fact and\/or withheld that same fact from the CRDD.\nAt this point it is necessary to turn to the second part of the review; namely, was there \"other sufficient evidence\" considered by original panel that could \"justify refugee protection.\" In order to consider s. 109(2) we need to review what information was available to the original panel.\nIf we subtract all the events between XXXXX 1999 and XXXXX 2000 from the respondent's PIF we are left with nothing other than a Sri Lankan man whose mother was Tamil and father was Malay and because of this their parents and siblings - excepting one - would have nothing to do with them. In the panel's view this evidence would have been insufficient for the original panel to have found that the respondent was a Convention refugee.\nHowever, counsel for the respondent has argued that \"other\" evidence that was considered by the original panel included the report of Dr. XXXXX, his testimony and indeed the testimony of the respondent himself. Dr. XXXXX concluded that the respondent was a victim of male sexual abuse at the hands of a Colonel in the SLA. That, argues counsel, is enough other \"sufficient\" evidence for the original panel to have found the respondent to be a Convention refugee.\nIn the panel's view this reasoning is flawed. Reasonably considered, what the original panel would have had was evidence from the doctor that the respondent suffers from PTSD and that the respondent offered as an explanation for this that he had been sexually abused by a Colonel in the Sri Lankan Army.\nIt is true that Doctor XXXXX concluded that the respondent suffered from PTSD. He testified that he concluded this because of his observations of the respondent on the basis of 6 hours of interviews and the respondent's scores on two objective tests. As to what caused this PTSD the doctor relied upon the story of abuse told by the respondent. It is important to note that both in his report and in his testimony Dr. XXXXX made it clear that he did not explore what happened to the respondent in any depth because he feared re-traumatising him.11 Perhaps, most importantly he stated in his report:\nWhile the basis for my conclusion [that the respondent suffers from post traumatic stress disorder] on this point is supported only by the evidence provided by Mr. XXXXX, I have no reason to doubt what he has said and feel satisfied in concluding that there are no other circumstances which could account for this symptom presentation.12\nIt is for this panel to form conclusions on credibility and while a medical practitioner's views may be of assistance they cannot supplant it. However, if we remove the incidents of 1999 in which the abuse is rooted then there remain no incidents. The fact that the events are alleged to have take place in 1998 is new evidence and the panel has no jurisdiction to consider this. If the respondent cannot rely upon this lie as to what happened to him in 1999 to found his claim then how could the doctor do so simply because he believed the lie and wrote about it and testified about it. In the panel's view what is left after subtracting the 1999 incidents is that the respondent is a Tamil suffering PTSD. Nothing else. It would have been speculation for the original panel to connect the PTSD to any particular event. As Dr. XXXXX put it himself in his testimony:\nThe type two events, of which XXXXX falls into, are people who will go through repeated trauma, exposure to events which are beyond their control over an extended period of time and this fits into people such as prisoners of war, torture victims, domestic violence and child abuse.13\nThe panel finds that there was insufficient evidence in front of the original panel that could have justified a finding of refugee protection. Accordingly the Application to vacate is granted.\n\"Michael A. Ross\"\nMichael A. Ross\nDecember 8, 2004\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibit 1.

They are citizens of Venezuela and claim refugee protection pursuant to ss. 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act because they are members of their father's family. The claimant is the designated representative of XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, the minor claimant.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant alleged that members of the Bolivarian Circles, the government of Chavez and its security agencies would harm or kill him if he were to return to Venezuela.\nHe alleged that on XXXXX 2002 some members of the Bolivarian Circles intercepted his car as he drove to his home from a meeting, pulled him out of his car and started to beat him but luckily some passers-by intervened and he was let go. He alleged that his assailants threatened to harm or kill him if he did not quit his political activities.\nHe further alleged that he started to receive threatening phone calls at his home towards the end of the month so he and his wife decided that he should leave the country. He went to the United States of America from where he came to Canada to seek protection.\nThe claimant's spouse and daughters seek protection because they are members of the claimant's family.\nDETERMINATION\nI find that the claimant is not a Convention refugee, as he does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Venezuela. I also find that he is not a person in need of protection in that his removal to Venezuela would not subject him to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment and no substantial grounds exist to find that his removal to Venezuela would subject him personally to a danger of torture.\nI make the same findings and for the same reasons for his spouse and his daughters.\nANALYSIS\nThe claimant testified that he started participation in political activities in the 1970s and that he did not have any problems as a result of his political activities until the general problems arising from the political turmoil in Venezuela starting in 1998. His political involvement included active participation in the Convergencia Nacional Party (CN) and COPEI and the Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS). He stated that with the coming into power of Chavez it became increasingly more problematic for those opposed to Chavez as his supporters, especially members of the Bolivarian Circles, harassed members of the opposition.\nHe stated that utilizing his XXXXX XXXXX skills he provided XXXXX XXXXX support for MAS to help maintain the membership XXXXX While the claimant mentioned a number of his colleagues and fellow opposition members who were harassed and in some instances beaten by Chavez supporters, he did not indicate they were involved in the same line of work for the party that he was engaged in; XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX. I find that the claimant's involvement in providing XXXXX XXXXX entailed work that was not exposed to the Chavez supporters. I find the incident he refers to of XXXXX, 2002 to be an isolated incident that does not amount to persecution. I find it to be harassment. To constitute persecution, the harm feared must occur with repetition or persistence, or in a systematic way. The claimant did not suffer any serious harm as a result of this incident. I find, for the same reasons that the few alleged telephone threats that he stated that he received towards the end of XXXXX 2002 also amount to harassment and not persecution. I find, consequently, that the claimant's fear of persecution for his political activities in Venezuela is not well founded.\nI also find the claimant's failure to make a claim for asylum in the United States of America where he spent about three months before coming to Canada indicates a lack of subjective fear in Venezuela. When asked why he did not make a claim for asylum in the United States the claimant responded that \"the United States was paranoid about immigrants and was going to war against Iraq\". I do not find his explanation to be reasonable and acceptable. It is an expression of the claimant's opinion not supported by fact. The claimant's circumstances have no bearing to the situation between the United States and Iraq.\nBased on the foregoing I find that there is no serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted for a Convention ground if he were to return to Venezuela today. I also find that his removal to Venezuela would not subject him to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment and no substantial grounds exist to find that his removal to Venezuela will subject him personally to a danger of torture.\nI make the same findings and for the same reasons for the claimant's spouse and children as their claims depend on the circumstances of the claimant.\nCONCLUSION\nFor those reasons I find that XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX and XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection and I reject their claims.\n\"Benjamin Ayorech\" Benjamin Ayorech\nDATED: September 16, 2004\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION \/ POLITICAL PARTICIPATION \/ POLITICAL OPINION \/ INDISCRIMINATE HARM \/ HARASSMENT \/ SOJOURNING \/ MALE \/ SPOUSE \/ CHILDREN \/ NEGATIVE \/ VENEZUELA\nRPD File # \/ No. dossier SPR : CA3-00897\/CA3-00989\/\nCA3-00899\/CA3-00900\n1\n",

He became interested in the claimant and wanted to help her get a XXXXX downtown where the business was lucrative. He told her to meet him at a restaurant in XXXXX 2003. When the claimant met XXXXX he told her that he was interested in having a sexual relationship with her. The claimant refused to accept this proposal. At that point, XXXXX XXXXX apologized to the claimant and they continued to stay for dinner. After the dinner the claimant felt weak and XXXXX offered to give her a ride. When she regained consciousness she realized that she had been raped. The claimant rushed to the clinic for treatment and later reported the incident of rape to the police; however, no action was taken because XXXXX is a very influential man. She reported the incident to Women and Juvenile Unit (WAJU) and they promised to investigate the matter.\nIn XXXXX 2003, the claimant realized that she was pregnant. She told XXXXX XXXXX, but he advised her to abort the child. The claimant refused to do so and it made XXXXX angry. On XXXXX, 2003, she received an anonymous phone calls threatening her that XXXXX had hired a man to kill her. The claimant fled to her uncle's house who subsequently assisted her in fleeing Ghana. The claimant travelled to the United States (U.S.) on a fraudulent passport. She impersonated as a U.S. citizen and came to Canada with an agent and made her claim for refugee protection two days later.\nDetermination\nThe Refugee Protection Division determines the claimant not to be a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection within the meaning of subsections 96 and 97(1) of the IRPA, because key aspects of the claimant's testimony were found not to be credible.\nAnalysis\nThe issues in the claim included state protection, internal flight alternative (IFA) and any credibility issues arising from the claimant's testimony.\nIdentity\nThe panel is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the claimant is a citizen of Ghana. In this respect she presented copies of the claimant's Ghanaian passport are included in the port-of-entry (POE) notes.1\nCredibility\nThe central issue in the claim is whether it is credible that a former XXXXX, official, who allegedly raped the claimant is targeting her because she refused to abort the child.\nThe panel finds the claimant to be neither a credible nor a trustworthy witness. Both in the claimant's Personal Information Form (PIF)2 and oral testimony, she stated that XXXXX was interested in having a sexual relationship with her. When she refused to accept his proposal, XXXXX raped her. When asked if she did not accept XXXXX XXXXX proposal and knew that it was his intention that he wanted something before he did any favours to her, why she continued to stay there, the claimant stated that she had accepted the apology and thought she would leave after having dinner.\nThe claimant admitted that she did not personally know XXXXX other than he was her client's husband. The panel finds it highly implausible that after knowing the wrong intentions of an individual person they would continue to socialize with him.3\nAccording to the claimant, when she realized that she was pregnant, she phoned XXXXX to give him the news however, he advised her to abort the child. The claimant refused to do so. Subsequently, in XXXXX 2003, an anonymous caller informed the claimant that XXXXX had tried to hire him to kill her and was confident that someone else would be contracted to kill her. The panel notes that this individual who carried out killings to extort money did not ask the claimant to provide him with money.\nTaking the claimant's testimony into consideration, that the hired assassin informed her that his agreement was not finalized, as XXXXX was not willing to pay the amount of money demanded, the panel finds it implausible that XXXXX would provide information regarding the victim when the deal had not been confirmed. The panel places no weight on such hearsay evidence since it comes from an unknown person to the claimant. It is the claimant's testimony that police, WAJU and the doctor did not co-operate with her and no legal action could have been taken against XXXXX because he was very influential. Given this profile, the panel finds it highly implausible that XXXXX XXXXX would arrange to kill the claimant because she was pregnant, when he simply could have denied that he raped the claimant. The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant did not receive death threats as alleged.\nIn resolving this issue, the claimant has not provided a medical report as required in Rule 7 of the RPD rules to establish her claim does not assist the panel. On a measure of such fundamental importance one would expect it to be addressed with more reasonable evidence. The claimant provided a statutory declaration from her mother to support her contentions4 that following the rape incident she sought treatment at XXXXX Clinic in XXXXX. When asked why there is no medical report in this respect, the claimant stated that she asked her mother to obtain a medical report from XXXXX, because it was required for her refugee hearing. She further explained that her mother made five unsuccessful attempts to secure the medical report. Each time the doctor made an excuse and advised her to come back some other time. The claimant further explained that her mother believed XXXXX was afraid of XXXXX.\nHence, in XXXXX 2004 the claimant requested her mother to provide a sworn declaration. The panel does not find the claimant's explanation reasonable because this document is prepared 17 days prior to the date of request i.e., XXXXX, 2004. The panel sees this document as being specifically prepared to support the claimant's claim.\nThe panel notes that the documentary evidence5 states,\nRegarding state protection of victims of sexual violence, the country reports on human rights practices for 2001, claims that although violence against women, including rape and domestic violence remains a significant, the police tend to intervene in domestic disputes hence to not intervene in domestic disputes, and abuses usually go unreported and seldom come before the courts.\nIt further states that the commissioner of police responsible for the WAJU, which was established in 1998 to manage cases of domestic violence, stated that \"the fees charged by medical personnel to conduct examinations, required by the police in cases of suspected sexual assault, were too high and this deterred many poor women from pursuing their cases.\"\nWhen asked if she obtained a medical report while she was in Ghana, the claimant stated 'no', she personally never requested to have the clinical records assuming that he would give it to her when needed. The panel finds it highly implausible that the claimant made no attempt to secure a medical report, especially because she was aware that such a document was crucial and was required by the police and WAJU to investigate the matter.\nThe panel takes into consideration the claimant's testimony that she was aware that her friend who had suffered domestic abuse had obtained a medical report before she reported her case to the police and WAJU. The panel finds that the claimant is a reasonably well-educated person. She worked in Ghana for a number of years as a XXXXX and was aware of the, similar situation. She herself did not make any efforts to obtain a medical report in her alleged case. The panel finds the claimant's actions inconsistent with a person truly being raped and abused as alleged.\nIn the absence of efforts made by the claimant to produce satisfactory evidence, i.e., the medical report that is central to the claimant's claim, the panel draws an adverse inference with respect to the claimant's credibility.\nFurthermore, the claimant gave conflicting evidence regarding her work history. In the claimant's oral testimony, she stated that she continued to work XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX, XXXXX Ghana until XXXXX 2003. However, according to information on individuals seeking refugee protection,6 the claimant when asked about her work history, the claimant stated that she worked until XXXXX 2003. When this contradiction was pointed out, in light of her testimony that XXXXX had hired a killer to kill her, she stayed in hiding, and had fled to her uncle's house. The claimant stated that she continued to work until XXXXX 2003 from home.\nThis information is in conflict with column 4, question 18 of the claimant's PIF. When asked to list the period of employment including self-employment, the claimant stated that she worked as a XXXXX at XXXXX XXXXX until XXXXX 2003. The claimant explained that she worked from home as her employer redirected clients to her home. The panel finds it highly implausible that a person truly in hiding would continue to work and attend clients while they are in hiding. The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant did not receive threatening phone calls and was not in hiding, as alleged.\nBased on all the evidence adduced, the panel finds the claimant's claim that XXXXX XXXXX, a former XXXXX official raped her and continues to look for her, not to be credible.\nInternal Flight Alternative\nEven if the panel were to believe the claimant's contentions, which it does not, the panel finds that there is an IFA for the claimant. The documentary evidence notes that the main consequences in this case is that the claimant has shown herself able and willing to remove herself from the vicinity of her alleged abuser by coming to Canada.\nThe question for the panel is whether the claimant would achieve the same results by removing herself from XXXXX and settling in another large urban city such as XXXXX.\nThe panel believes that if the claimant were to return to Ghana, she could reasonably settle in XXXXX. The panel notes that the claimant's father resides in XXXXX. There is no persuasive evidence that XXXXX will seek her out if she returned to live in XXXXX assuming that he knows she has moved there.\nThe existence of several women and juvenile units of the police force will be further deterrent. There is not a serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted if she were to return to XXXXX, Ghana. The claimant admitted that no one ever went to her father's residence to inquire about her whereabouts.\nFor the second prong of Rasaratnam,7 IFA test, the panel finds it reasonable that in all of the claimant's circumstances that she can settle in XXXXX. As noted, she is a reasonably well-educated woman. She has shown herself in being flexible in coming to Canada to make a better life. The claimant worked as a XXXXX for approximately three years. The panel believes that with the same effort and resourcefulness, the claimant is prepared to show in Canada she can reasonably make a life in her own country where language and customs are more familiar to her. The panel finds that the claimant has an IFA in XXXXX, Ghana.\nEven if the claimant's story is true and that she fears psychological and physical punishment at the hands of XXXXX, the documentary evidence notes that, \"the Ghana police established several units at various police stations to deal with cases of abuse of women as well as the cases of abuse of children's rights.\"8\nDuring the year 2003, WAJU recorded 2,244 cases including assault on women and rapes.9 The Director of WAJU stated the increase in reported cases was due to increased awareness programs. He further stated that WAJU international donors and NGO's collaborated to create a medical trust fund for victims of such violence. The unit works closely with the Department of Social Affairs, the International Federation of Women Lawyers and Legal Aid Board, all whom the claimant can appeal to for assistance.\nIt is the claimant's testimony that XXXXX, an ex- XXXXX official, is still influential with the law enforcement agencies in Ghana. Each time the claimant went to report to the police, they did not take any action and advised her that XXXXX was influential, and the police officer told her that XXXXX was his friend. She received no assistance from WAJU that assists abused women in Ghana. Again, it is her testimony that the doctor who treated her did not provide her with a medical report. According to the claimant, all these actions were because of XXXXX influence on the authorities in Ghana. While the panel acknowledges that state protection is not perfect, the panel finds that the claimant has not provided clear and convincing evidence that the government is unwilling or unable to protect her. According to Villafranca.10 No government can guarantee the protection of all its citizens at all times.\nThe panel finds that Ghana is a state, which is exhibiting effective control of its territory; it has military, police and civil authority in place, and it is making serious efforts to protect its citizens. Given the earlier credibility findings, the panel finds that the claimant did not seek protection from the police. Based on the foregoing, the panel concludes that there is adequate state protection available to the claimant in Ghana.\nThe panel finds that there is not a reasonable chance that the claimant would be persecuted if she were to return to Ghana. Given that the panel found the claimant's claim not credible, the panel finds there is no basis for a claim under 97(1) of the IRPA.\nThe Refugee Protection Division rejects this claim.\n\"Jiti Singh Grewal\"\nJiti Singh Grewal\nDATED at Toronto this 4th day of October, 2004.\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION \/ VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN \/ RAPE \/ PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS \/ RULES \/ INTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE \/ STATE PROTECTION \/ MALE \/ NEGATIVE \/ GHANA\n1 Exhibit R\/A-2.\n2 Exhibit C-1.\n3 Faryna v.

The claimant is a 25-year-old female citizen of China. She based her claim on a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of the Chinese authorities on the grounds of perceived political opinion and membership in a particular social group, namely, members and practitioners of Falun Gong (FG). This is a sur place claim because the claimant was allegedly discovered of being a FG practitioner in China after returning to Canada at the end of a short visit in XXXXX, 2003. The claimant had arrived first in Canada in April, 2001 on a Student visa. Allegedly, she was accused of having sent banned FG material from Canada by way of E-mail to her fellow FG practitioner. The claimant alleged that should she return to China, she would be arrested and sentenced to imprisonment just as her fellow practitioners who have had been sentenced to three years of imprisonment.\nIn addition, I considered whether she is a person in need of protection either (a) by a danger of torture or (b) by a risk to her life or to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in China. The hearing was held pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nThe evidence consisted of the claimant's oral testimony, her Personal Information Form (PIF)1 and its subsequent amendments and documentary material filed by the claimant's counsel2 and the Refugee Protection Officer (RPO).3 The panel considered the observations of the RPO and counsel's submissions, both rendered orally at the end of the hearing. The panel also considered the post-hearing documentary evidence submitted by counsel by way of an application dated September 2, 2004 pursuant to Rule 37(1) of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) Rules.4\nIssues\nAt the outset of the hearing, credibility was recognized as the major issue. The claimant's personal identity, as to who she is as she describes herself in her PIF narrative and as a national of China, was not an issue considering the identity documents such as the passport and the resident identity card (RIC) that the claimant submitted. Delay in making the refugee claim, a element interlinked to the sur place nature of the claim and the re-availment, were also recognized as legitimate issues.\nDetermination\nI made a general finding of a lack of credibility.5 Accordingly, I determined that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant's assertion of being a FG adherent is not genuine, and her alleged devotion to FG is just a ruse to claim refugee protection on a sur place basis. I have valid reasons to arrive at this finding due to inconsistencies, lack of corroboration, unlikely coincidence and implausibilities that arose in the claimant's evidence, for which the claimant could not offer satisfactory explanations.\nAnalysis\nIn arriving at the findings that I made, I have taken into account the cultural factors, the milieu of the hearing and the anxiety that a claimant may feel in responding to a viva voce examination in the context of the refugee hearing process.\nInconsistencies, discrepancies and implausibilities may be taken into consideration when making an assessment of the credibility or trustworthiness of the evidence.6\nIn addition, in considering the credibility of the claimants' story, I have been guided by the Federal Court's ruling that, to be considered credible or trustworthy, a claimant's story must be \"probably so, not just possibly so.\"7\nCredibility Findings\nI had the opportunity to observe the claimant providing testimony for nearly three hours. The claimant was a pleasant young intelligent lady who was straightforward in areas of testimony for which she had come well prepared. However, the claimant was evasive when she had to deal with questions that she did not anticipate. The claimant demonstrated a high level of sophistication. The claimant was well aware of what was\nexpected of her in establishing her claim and as stated, she was relying on a well-rehearsed and memorized script for providing her testimony. I found her responses to crucial questions impacting on some material aspects of her claim were hesitant and measured. There was no spontaneity in her answers taking pauses before coming up with responses. That said, the claimant was quite articulate and showed considerable facility when providing testimony respecting some other aspects of her evidence. Her hesitation was mostly in areas that I found to be fabricated for the purpose of her claim. It is reasonable to consider the demeanour as an important factor inter alia the credibility concerns in assessing the credibility of the claimant. I did not find a reasonable justification for her uneven demeanour unless she was attempting to present a concoction as a true story. I acknowledge that a negative credibility finding cannot be based on demeanour alone and that the demeanour of a witness is not infallible for fact finding. Nonetheless, it can be of help to a decision-maker to sense the lack of ring of truth to the story being narrated.\nIt was the claimant's evidence that she had become an ardent FG practitioner since XXXXX, 1997. Purportedly, her interest in FG manifested after being introduced to it in the year 1997 by her friend, XXXXX XXXXX, while she was studying at XXXXX University. Apparently, she was convinced of the benefits one would accrue from the practice of FG after reading \"Zhuan Falun,\" the FG book written by its founder that was lent to her by her friend XXXXX. The claimant alleged that she kept up with the practice of FG by secretly practising it at her home and the homes of fellow practitioners following the ban of FG in July, 1999. Ostensibly, the secret group consisted of six practitioners including the claimant. The claimant came to Canada on a student visa in April, 2001 and allegedly kept in touch with her fellow practitioners back in China by talking to them over the telephone despite her studies. Purportedly, she told them about the vast FG information that was available in Canada. The claimant alleged that she sent two E-mails to her friend XXXXX on two different occasions, once at the end of the year 2001 and again in the middle of 2002. On each of these occasions, the claimant testified that she sent FG material as attachments to her E-mail; on the first occasion, allegedly it was some speeches of Master Li while on the second occasion, it was material related to the media coverage of protests against the Chinese government's ban of FG. The claimant asserted that she only sent the E-mails to her friend XXXXX and to nobody else. The claimant returned to China in XXXXX, 2002 to visit her family and stayed there until XXXXX, 2003. During her stay, the claimant allegedly continued to practice with her old group. Allegedly, on XXXXX, 2003 the claimant was informed by a telephone call from her mother that her FG group had been discovered by the Public Security Bureau (PSB) on XXXXX, 2003. The claimant also learned that the PSB had visited her home on the morning of XXXXX, 2003 looking for her. Purportedly, the PSB had found the FG material that the claimant had sent and that they had enough incriminating evidence to conclude that the claimant was a FG practitioner, both within and outside China. The claimant also stated that she learned that four fellow practitioners were arrested during the PSB raid on the practice station on XXXXX, 2003. Purportedly, the PSB demanded that the claimant should return to China immediately. Subsequently, it was alleged that the claimant's parents were dismissed from their jobs as part of mounting harassment due to the claimant's FG involvement. Because of the above allegations, the claimant asserts that she would be arrested should she return to China and, therefore, seeks surrogate protection from the government of China.\nThe panel does not find the above scenario as presented by the claimant to be credible for the reasons discussed in the analysis to follow. The claimant asserted emphatically that she regards FG as her life and that she would not exist without practising FG. Ostensibly, her devotion to FG was solidified by the enormous benefits in terms of her academic, intellectual and spiritual enhancement that she derived following her practice of FG since XXXXX, 1997. Her commitment to FG was so firm that she took enormous risk to her freedom and security of life by practising FG secretly in the homes of other fellow practitioners despite knowing the crack down of FG practitioners that ensued the government announcement of FG ban on July 22, 1999. It was the claimant's purported plan to return to China after completion of her studies in Canada in the year 2005. However, the claimant seemingly made an unplanned decision in XXXXX, 2002 to visit China to see her parents, which she did in XXXXX, 2002. These raised some troubling questions: if the claimant were that devoted to FG as she alleged, why did she not make a refugee claim soon after her first arrival in Canada on April 20, 2001? Her explanation was that her group had not been discovered practising FG secretly and her belief that justice would prevail over evil. On being pressed why would she not seize the opportunity to be able to practice FG openly and freely in Canada thereby getting the full benefits of bigger energy field resulting from larger group practice, the claimant was evasive in her responses. Furthermore, why would she return to China and take unnecessary risk by practising secretly with her former small group? After all, she could have avoided the risk by practising on her own at home as she purportedly had done following the ban of FG. Given the above, the panel draws a negative inference with respect to her credibility that she was an ardent FG adherent in China before coming to Canada for the first time in April, 2001.\nImprobable Coincidence\nReinforcing the above negative credibility determination is the alleged coincidence of her small FG group being discovered within two days after her departure from China on XXXXX, 2003. It belies credulity that the PSB was just waiting in the wings for the claimant to leave before raiding the practice station of the claimant's group that was allegedly successful in secret practice of FG for nearly four years. It raises the question: was the alleged discovery of her FG small group two days after her departure just a lucky coincidence? The panel does not think so. It was the claimant's evidence that her alleged E-mails evaded being caught by the censorship procedure due to the non-use of suspicion triggering words such as FG in the cover letter to her friend XXXXX.8 Apparently, the incriminating FG material, that did not include pictures, was part of the attachments thereby passing the filters undetected. The following, in part, was stated in the post-hearing document submitted by counsel:\n... it would be quite difficult, or nearly impossible, to scan every attachment that is sent via email. So if an individual is already under surveillance, it is quite likely that their attachments will be scanned and\/or blocked, but if not, it isn't likely to be the case...9\nGranting that the above were to be true, it is reasonable to conclude that neither the claimant nor her group was under surveillance. Allegedly, the PSB traced the FG material that they found when they raided the practice station to the E-mails that the claimant had sent. It was not made clear to me as to how hard copies of information pertaining to FG could have been linked to E-mail messages that were sent some months before the raid. It is highly unlikely that XXXXX would have her computer at the practice station and that too without erasing the E-mails after taking out prints of the attachments. Was it therefore sheer luck that the PSB got suspicious of the group, all of a sudden, within two days after the claimant's departure, when they had not entertained any suspicion or surveillance before? In the opinion of the panel, it is highly implausible. The negative credibility findings rebut the presumption of truth by virtue of its cumulative impact on the inherent unlikelihood. Therefore, I find it reasonable to conclude, on a balance of probabilities, that the alleged discovery of the claimant's group was not just a lucky coincidence, but part of a well-planned fraudulent scheme to claim refugee status in Canada.\nOther Credibility Findings\nWhen pressed for details as to how she was certain that the PSB discovered her to be the source of the alleged incriminating FG material, she could only state that she learned from her mother that the PSB found out that the claimant had sent the material on the day of the raid that also culminated in the arrest of her four fellow FG practitioners. She stated that she did not know any further details. The claimant testified that the claimant after ascertaining the receipt of the E-mails by her friend, she never asked XXXXX, or any other fellow practitioner about the FG material. On being pressed, the claimant got flustered and provided inconsistent and dithering testimony as regards whether she had any discussion about the material during the time she was in China and practising FG with her group from XXXXX, 2002 to XXXXX, 2003. It emerged that she did ask her friend XXXXX having read first E-mail material; that she did not ask or wanted to know anything about the second E-mail. The panel finds it highly implausible that the claimant did not have any discussion whatsoever about the utility of the information that she sent when she returned to China and practiced with them for nearly three months. Given the above implausibilities, I draw an adverse finding with respect to the claimant's credibility. In making this determination, it is singularly important, given her intelligence and sophistication, that she failed to provide copies of the incriminating information in the attachments that she sent. Further, I also noted the discrepancy between her written PIF narrative10 and her testimony. She testified that she was exclusively in touch with her friend XXXXX after coming to Canada resulting in her sending two E-mails. However, she indicated in her written narrative that she often spoke to fellow practitioners and at their request, she sent FG information via E-mails, albeit, she was reluctant to do so in the beginning. As an explanation for this discrepancy, her response was that her intention to send E-mails to her friend was to benefit the group. I did not find her response reasonable to be satisfactory.\nFor the aforesaid reasons, it is the panel's finding that the claimant was not a FG adherent practising secretly in a group and that she did not send any incriminating FG material to China as she alleged. As such, the claim should be rejected on this count alone as it goes to the crux of her claim.\nThere were other credibility concerns that could be considered peripheral when considered in isolation, but material when considered cumulatively with other findings. There was this anomaly in claimant's evidence respecting the consequential adverse effects on her parents. It was alleged in her written PIF narrative that both of her parents were dismissed from their employment. The claimant was confronted with the contradictory information in the Hukou11 that the claimant submitted. The Hukou shows her father as being a retired worker as of XXXXX 1998, the issue date of the document. When questioned, her hesitant explanation was that her father took up another job, but she was not able to provide when he took up the new job. Further, the claimant did not produce any corroborative documents respecting the dismissal of her parents. Nor did she produce any corroboration in terms of arrest warrant, summons that the claimant was being actively sought in China.\nThe claimant testified that she improved knowledge of FG and its philosophy by extensively reading the book \"Zhuan Falun\" that she bought in May, 2001 soon after her arrival in Canada. Yet, the book that she showed to the panel appeared to be pristine in its condition and did not appear to have been extensively read as the claimant alleged. The book did not even bear her name and there were no discernible markings such as underlined or highlighted text.\nThe claimant testified that she had been diligently practicing FG in Canada from XXXXX 2001 with the XXXXX XXXXX at XXXXX XXXXX. Notwithstanding that the claimant provided names for the contact persons, different from those in the IRB document,12 the claimant did not attend any Group Study sessions that she said takes place on Sundays in contradiction with the said document that shows the Group Studies taking place on Saturdays.\nClaimant's Knowledge and Her FG Practice in Canada\nAs stated, the claimant testified that she had been practicing FG at the XXXXX practice station since XXXXX, 2001. The claimant did not produce any corroboration in terms of a testimonial letter from the group or photographs of her practicing albeit she produced photographs of her alleged participation in the latest FG activities of the year 2004.13 Given the clear determinative negative credibility findings, I do not give any probative value to these photographs. In the panel's opinion, the claimant has attempted to mislead the panel by posing for these photographs knowing that her hearing was coming up shortly.\nI acknowledge that the claimant was knowledgeable about FG, its philosophy and FG related events that happened in China. She was able to draw and describe the FG logo.14 Given the determinative negative credibility findings, the panel does not give any probative value to this demonstrated knowledge. It is the panel's determination that whatever knowledge she acquired, was for the purpose of the claim. After all, the information on FG is readily available and given her intelligence and high level of sophistication, it would not have presented much of a challenge for the claimant to come\nprepared. In the opinion of the panel, it is the knowledge derived not from conviction, but for convenience. The claimant was not asked to demonstrate any of the FG exercises, as it is not difficult to demonstrate the rudiments of the exercises. To sum it up, the claimant has spun a tale about a non-existent adherence to FG.\nSummation\nFor all the aforesaid reasons, I find the claimant devoid of any credibility or trustworthiness. It is my finding that the claimant's story that she narrated is a total fabrication concocted for the purpose of providing a basis for her sur place refugee claim.\nFor the same reasons I found the claimant not credible, I also find that the claimant is not a person in need of protection in that there exist no substantial grounds to believe that she will be subjected personally to a danger of torture nor is there a serious possibility that she will be subjected personally to a risk to her life or to cruel or to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in China.\nConclusion\nFor the reasons as discussed in the above analysis and after considering all of the evidence, the Refugee Protection Division finds that XXXXX XXXXX is not a Convention refugee; neither she is a person in need of protection.\n\"Puttaveeraiah Prabhakara\"\nPuttaveeraiah Prabhakara\nDATED at Toronto, Ontario, this 29th day of September, 2004.\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION \/ POLITICAL OPINION \/ REFUGEE SUR PLACE \/ DELAY \/ CREDIBILITY \/ IMPLAUSIBILITIES \/ INCONSISTENCY \/ EVIDENCE \/ FEMALE \/ NEGATIVE \/ CHINA\n1 Exhibit C-1.\n2 Exhibits C-2 to C-6.\n3 Exhibits R\/A-1 and R\/A-2.\n4 Entered post-hearing into evidence as Exhibit C-7.\n5 Sheikh v.

The principle claimant claims protection because of her membership in a particular social group, battered wives in Pakistan, pursuant to section 961 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. She also alleges that she is a \"person in need of protection\" pursuant to section 972 of the Act.\nALLEGED FACTS\nThe incidents that led the principal claimant and her children to claim protection in Canada occurred from 1996 to her arrival in Canada on XXXXX, 2003.\nANALYSIS OF THE FACTS\nThe claimants have valid identity documents.\nThe child's designated representative, XXXXX XXXXX, made no representations regarding a claim against the United States. The panel therefore does not have this aspect of the American child not claiming against his country of citizenship to analyze.\nAccording to question 21 of her Personal Information Form (PIF), the principal claimant made three trips abroad. The first trip was to New York, from XXXXX to XXXXX 1997, when she gave birth to her first child; the second, to Pakistan, in XXXXX 2001; and the third, to Canada, in XXXXX 2002.\nIn the course of the hearing, the panel learned that, in 1994 and 1995, the principal claimant made four or five trips to London and one other to the United States, in addition to those appearing on her PIF. The panel learned that the principal claimant also came to Canada with her husband in XXXXX 2001, as she said, just to visit, while staying in their hotel room in Montreal for a week.\nThe panel wishes to cite Basseghi3 and believes that these numerous omissions from her PIF, although not central to the principal claimant's claim on her PIF, taint her credibility.\nDuring her testimony, the principal claimant alleged that her husband had informed her, in XXXXX 2002, of his intention to take their children away and give them to another woman who was his future wife. However, the principal claimant's PIF narrative made no mention of this XXXXX 2002 threat. When asked to comment on this significant omission, the principal claimant stated that in XXXXX 2002, her husband was probably joking. The panel does not accept this explanation and wishes to point out that the principal claimant initially stated that she had been informed of her husband's intention in XXXXX 2002 and that, confronted with this inconsistency, she has simply changed her answer. The principal claimant's credibility is, once again, tainted.\nThe principal claimant claims that her husband had beaten her and that she was still afraid he could abduct her children. During her testimony, she also referred to the attempted kidnapping of her child after their separation. The panel pointed out to the principal claimant that this incident did not appear in her narrative either, whereas, in the panel's view, this was an important incident because it related to the fears expressed by the principal claimant. Confronted with this omission, the principal claimant stated that this had not come to her mind before the second hearing on January 7, 2004. The panel does not accept this explanation and believes that this forgetfulness, combined with the preceding, further taints the principal claimant's credibility.\nWhen she arrived at the Lacolle border post on XXXXX, 2003, during her interview, the principal claimant made no mention of her husband's intention to kidnap her children. The principal claimant stated that she had been about to give birth and that she had not had all her wits about her. This was why the Immigration Officer had written, (translation) \"Interview incomplete as subject had to be rushed to Saint-Jean Hospital due to pregnancy.\"\nHowever, the interview was resumed on January 21, 2003, and the principal claimant made no mention of her husband's intention to kidnap her children. When the panel confronted her to explain this omission, the principal claimant claimed that she had not been in her normal state. In addition, after the birth of her daughter in Canada on XXXXX, 2003, the principal claimant called her mother to tell her the news, and her mother, in turn, hastened to call her former son-in-law to tell him the good news. The panel simply does not believe that the claimant fears that her husband will kidnap her children.\nThe principal claimant submitted a document (Exhibit P-7) that was allegedly the couple's divorce decree. The panel dwelled upon this document at length and pointed out to the principal claimant that it was signed by two justices of the peace, that it seemed more akin to an affidavit than an official divorce decree and that it contained many spelling mistakes. This document gives the principal claimant custody of the children:\nWhereas it was mutually decided that the said children will remain under the custody of the second party and whatever the said second party (the principal claimant - panel's addition) would marry to anyone else, the child will be delivered to his father.\nThe panel accords no weight to the contents of this document. Moreover, it refers to an Information Request of the German authorities about false documents used in Pakistan (Montreal Regional Binder, section 8.6 PAK.35362.E) and finds that the panel does not attach any credibility to the fact that the child or children should be delivered to the father, in other words, the principal claimant's husband.\nWhen the panel pressed her to say why she had not claimed refugee protection in the United States, where she had been many times, the principal claimant stated that she had learned it would be easier for her in Canada. The panel wishes to cite Ilie, Leul, and Hibo Farah Mohamed and Ardo Abdi Omer here.\nIn Ilie4 the Federal Court stated that:\n[TRANSLATION]\nA claimant's failure to claim refugee status in a signatory country of the 1967 Protocol contradicts the claim that he\/she fears persecution.\nIn Leul5, the Honourable Justice Muldoon expressed the following:\n[...] Just as I would not wish to send back to his country a person who stood in jeopardy of a reasonable chance of persecution, so I just do not wish to leave in Canada a person who isn't entitled to be here; a person who passed through a country which was a signatory to the convention and did not think to claim refugee status there.\nThe panel also refers to the decision of April 9, 1997 in Hibo Farah Mohamed and Ardo Abdi Omer6 in which the Honourable Justice Rothstein stated:\nThe Geneva Convention exists for persons who require protection and not to assist persons who simply prefer asylum in one country over another. The Convention and the Immigration Act should be interpreted with the correct purpose in mind.\nThe principal claimant's testimony demonstrated that she is not a person subjected to the danger of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture or a person whose life is at risk or who is at risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. During the preparation of these reasons, the panel considered the IRB Chairperson's Guidelines concerning Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.\nCONCLUSION\nThe refugee protection claim is therefore rejected.\nThe panel concludes that the claimants XXXXX XXXXX, XXXXX XXXXX and XXXXX XXXXX are not \"Convention refugees\" under section 96 of the Act. The panel also concludes that the said claimants are not \"persons in need of protection\" under section 97 of the Act.\nRoger Houde\nRoger Houde\nMarch 19, 2004\nDate\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. (2001), c. 27, reads in part as follows:\n96. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,\n(a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or\n(b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.\n2 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. (2001), c. 27, reads in part as follows:\n97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\n(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or\n(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.\n3 Basseghi, Kourosh v.

He left college for he was fired upon, but he did finish his education as a correspondence student. He was named the XXXXX XXXXX of the youth wing of his village, XXXXX, in XXXXX 2001. He was attacked on XXXXX, 2002 as he was XXXXX XXXXX at the Independence Day celebration. He was hospitalized for ten days and a First Information Report was registered. Some people were arrested, but later were released. He resumed his activities and took part in the election of October 2002. He worked very hard for the party and the opposition Pakistan Muslim League (PML (Q)) wanted him to leave the PPP and join their party but he refused. His candidate won in his area so the opposition held a grudge against him. In XXXXX 2002 he was fired upon while he was coming home on his motorbike but he was not hurt. He went to his aunt's home. His father went to the police to report the incident; the police refused to file any report for there was no proof. His father later received threatening phone calls that his son should have joined PML (Q) and also stating that they would not miss the next time. His father received two more calls and decided to send the claimant to Canada on XXXXX, 2002, and the claimant made his claim on December 30, 2002.\nDETERMINATION\nAfter considering all of the evidence, I find that the claimant is not a Convention refugee, as he does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Pakistan, nor is he a person in need of protection, for the following reasons.\nThe panel finds with respect to the material elements of the story, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is not credible. The panel finds that the claimant would not face a risk to life, or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or danger of torture, if he were to return to Pakistan.\nISSUES\nThe determinative issues were the claimant's profile as a PPP worker, credibility and a lack of subjective fear, which is not supported objectively.\nANALYSIS\nThe Refugee Division only received the disclosures of the claimant on August 23, 2004 and on August 27, 2004; however, the panel accepted the disclosures, as the documents were relevant to his political affiliation.\nThe panel allowed two post-hearing documents: one authenticating the name the claimant used, and the other, a letter from the PPP party in XXXXX, which counsel had received via fax but which was not legible. The hearing was adjourned for these documents until September 18, 2004. The documents were received and considered for this hearing. The panel will refer to the letter later on.\nIdentity\nThe panel accepted the claimant's personal and national identity. His profile as a PPP activist was an issue.\nCredibility\nThe panel considered the claimant's testimony in its entirety, and also took into consideration the claimant's age, education, cultural differences, and the stress of the hearing room setting that might have impacted on how his testimony was given. The panel finds that the central issue in this claim and both material and peripheral aspects of his evidence were not credible or trustworthy.\nPolitical affiliation\nThe panel has considered the claimant's testimony in regard to his fear in Pakistan and his alleged political affiliation and his fear of the PML (Q). The claimant presented two PSF cards, one PPP card, two letters of his designations3 and a letter from the PPP office in Canada4 to establish his political affiliation.\nPSF Cards\nThe claimant presented two cards, one dated XXXXX 1997, and the second one does not have a date but a number \"XXXXX\", which states he is the XXXXX XXXXX. There was also a corresponding letter stating he has been elected the XXXXX XXXXX. The claimant was asked why the letter was from XXXXX and not from the president of the village and his explanation was that the district office appointed him solely to write the letter. The panel does not find that explanation reasonable for one would expect the village committee to issue a letter and not the district level. The conditions of the party as a general rule are for renewal of membership normally after two years as indicated on the reverse of the PPP card, whereas the claimant has the cards from the PSF in consequent years, which shows they are not genuine.\nPPP Card\nThe claimant presented a PPP card dated XXXXX, 2001, and a letter dated XXXXX, 2001, on the letterhead of a lawyer who has a PPP Party letterhead from XXXXX that the claimant has been selected\/nominated as the XXXXX XXXXX. This letter has no address on the letterhead, just a stamp under the author's signature, which states \"PPP XXXXX CITY.\" The panel does not give much weight to the letter since it is not on proper party letterhead and has no address on it. The panel does not find it to be a genuine letter, which impugns the claimant's overall credibility.\nThe claimant testified that his activities included:\n1. XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX.\n2. XXXXX XXXXX.\n3. XXXXX XXXXX.\nThe claimant's family was well off and he was able to assist the PP and his family always supported and voted for the PPP.\nWhen asked if he did this alone he said no, there were others. With him were the president, general secretary, and other people who worked very hard. He was asked if they were all in Pakistan and he stated that he knows that his father told him that the president was now in London, England. He also said that the General Secretary is a poor man and stays at home. The panel finds that there is no evidence, other than the claimant's testimony, which the panel does not believe, that these individuals encountered any problems due to their political affiliation.\nPost-hearing letter\nThe word Peoples in the letterhead of the letter does not have an apostrophe. It is written in English with a lot of spelling and grammatical mistakes. There is no mention of the PML (Q) requiring him. Since the panel does not find the claimant's testimony credible and considering the anomalies of the letter, the panel does not give it any weight. The panel finds that the claimant was affiliated with the party, but did not have the profile to be a target. The documentary evidence also does not support his claim.\nIncident of XXXXX, 2002\nThere were discrepancies between the written, oral and the contents in the First Information Report (FIR) about this incident. The claimant's oral description painted a different picture to what he has presented in the written version, and the FIR had another version. In his PIF he states:\n..on XXXXX, 2002, while I was XXXXX XXXXX on the occasion of \"Independence Day\" in Pakistan, some goons of the P.M.L.(Q) attacked all of the participants and beat us with rods and hockey sticks. As their primary target, I received serious injuries when one of the attackers hit my head with his hockey stick. They left me unconscious with a bloody nose and mouth. When the gathering dispersed, I was taken to the hospital, where I received twenty-six stitches to my head. I remained in the hospital for approximately ten days. This incident was reported to the police by my senior party members....[sic] 5\nIn oral testimony he stated:\n* There were about 100 people present\n* He was on the stage XXXXX\n* The goons came straight to the stage and started beating him\n* There were five other people who were injured\n* Gave names of five people who were injured\n* He said the president and he were the targets\nAfter, he was asked how many people came on that day and, he said more than 15, he did not have a count. When asked what was the means of their travel, he said that they came on motorbikes. He stated that he was XXXXX XXXXX about 1947 independence and military rule. He said they came straight to the stage and started beating him with hockey sticks or guns. He was asked why they beat him and he said because he worked hard for the Party. He stated orally that his father reported the incident.\nFIR\nThe information in the FIR about this particular incident was:\n* His father and two other gentlemen reported\n* 6\/7 goons\n* Armed with fire guns\n* The goons starting calling bad names\n* When they started to call bad names the claimant asked them not to make a noise\n* His son was beaten with gun butts and hockey\n* Son was seriously hurt and fell down\n* The people around intervened and they ran away\nThere is no mention of anyone else being injured. The claimant was asked why these three descriptions of the same event were different. His explanation was that it is not different and that it has been two years since the incident and that his father did report the incident. The panel does not find his explanation reasonable and finds that the discrepancies in all three versions make the panel believe that the incident never happened.\nThe claimant was also asked if this incident was in their local newspaper and he said it was not. Whereas the documentary evidence6 states that incidents of harassment of a political nature are mostly reported in newspapers. The panel relies on the documentary evidence and finds that such an event should have been reported in the local newspaper since it was related to Independence Day.\nMedical report\nThe claimant was asked what he was wearing when he alleges he was injured on XXXXX 2000, and he said he was wearing a shirt and pants. He was asked if he was sure about that and he said he was. When it was pointed out to him that the document he presented states it was a \"shalwar,\" traditional dress, the claimant said that this was not the case and he was asked if the document was wrong to which he said that the doctor must have made a mistake, for he wore pants. The report the claimant has presented is dated the same day as the alleged incident. Since the panel does not find his testimony credible, the panel finds that the medical document has been obtained only to present his claim.\nPhotographs\nThe claimant was asked why the photos were taken and he said that the party wanted to keep a record. When asked how and where did they keep the record, he said they were kept in the office. The pictures show people with bandages, with some blood on one person's bandage. The panel does not find his explanation reasonable. The photos were taken for a record, why were the photos not taken when their injuries happened. They seem to be posing for the photo while their heads are bandaged. The panel finds that the photos have been staged and presented merely to bolster the claim and not genuinely taken, which impugns his credibility.\nObjective basis\nThe documentary evidence indicates that PPP members were detained in corruption cases. Some did face harsh treatment in the early stages of the coup in 1999. It further states that, \"it would be highly unlikely that this [would] apply to rank and file PPP members.\" 7 The same document states that through 2001 to March 2004, some PPP activists were arrested. That was to stop parties from having rallies planned by the ARD, some on corruption but were later released. The document states that some did face problems leading up to the 2002 election, but since the election, this harassment has decreased, although PPP leaders have faced problems. The same document states that the PPP has not faced targeted violence from other opposition parties, and is in alliance with many of them. The same document lists three incidents of violence against the PPP. One of them occurred in a clash between the PPP and the PML, whereas the other is about a member of a provincial assembly.\nSince the panel does not find the claimant's testimony credible and due to the anomalies in the documents presented and lack of recent documents, the panel finds that the claimant has not established that he had a profile in the PPP party.\nIn summary, the panel finds that the claimant did not discharge his burden of proof to establish the subjective basis of his claim, which the panel finds is also not supported objectively. Furthermore, the panel finds that the testimony of the claimant is not credible, which negates his claim.\nCONCLUSION\nGiven the above analysis and after considering all of the evidence, the panel finds that there is not a serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted for a Convention ground if he returns to Pakistan.\nThe panel also finds that the claimant would not face a risk to life, or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or danger of torture, if he were to return to Pakistan.\nThe Refugee Protection Division concludes that XXXXX XXXXX is not a Convention refugee and is not a person in need of protection and, therefore, his claim is rejected.\n\"Sarwanjit Randhawa\"\nSarwanjit Randhawa\nDATED at Toronto, Ontario, this 25th day of November, 2004.\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION \/ POLITICAL OPINION \/ POLITICAL OPPOSITION \/ DISCLOSURE \/ LATE FILING \/ ADJOURNMENT \/ DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE \/ BURDEN OF PROOF \/ MALE \/ NEGATIVE \/ PAKISTAN\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27.\n2 Exhibit C-1, Personal Information Form (PIF), Client ID Number 5244-8904.\n3 Exhibit C-2, Package of Personal documents, pp. 9, 10,11,12,13,14.\n4 Exhibit C-3, Pakistan Peoples Party Letter (Canada).\n5 Exhibit C-1- Personal Information Form (PIF) narrative, page 2, paragraph 5.\n6 Exhibit R\/A-1, Item 1.3 Request for information PAK40294.E. p. 1.3.5.\n7 Exhibit R\/A-1, item 4.2, Information Request, Number: PAK42532.E, pp. 4.2.1- 4.2.2.\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n2\nTA3-00703\nTA3-00703\n",
