He also claims to be \"a person in need of protection\"2.\nThe Minister's counsel intervened in this case, questioned the claimant and submitted that the claimant should be excluded under section 1F (b) of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention3.\nSUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant, a 33-year-old farmer of Sikh origin and alleged member of the Bhartyia Kissan Union (BKU), is a resident of the village of XXXXX, Punjab. He alleges that he was persecuted by the police. He was arrested in XXXX 1995, XXXXX 1998 and XXXXX 2001. Each time, he was tortured and beaten by the police.\nThe claimant alleges that the reason for harm was his involvement in the BKU, an organisation that voices the demands and needs of Sikh farmers to the government. Concerning the XXXX 2001 arrest, the claimant alleges that the police believed that he had links with militants\/terrorists because he was caught in a police blockade transporting \"some kind of explosives\" on the night of XXXXX, 2001.\nDETERMINATION\nThe panel excludes the claimant under section 1F (b) of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention.\nANALYSIS\n1) Identity\nThe Immigration and Refugee Protection Act places emphasis on the need to have acceptable documentation establishing identity4.\nUpon his arrival in Canada, the claimant had two identity documents: a driver's licence and a birth certificate that were seized by Citizenship and Immigration Canada (exhibit A-5). Although the panel has concerns about these two documents, it noticed that the claimant obtained later on and submitted his identity card with a picture issued by the Election Commission of India (exhibit P-4). Hence, the panel contends that the identity of the claimant has been reasonably established.\n2) Credibility\nThe Minister's counsel argued that section 81 (1) (d) (ii) of the Criminal Code applied to the present case:\n\"81 (1) ?Using explosives? Every one commits an offence who\n(d) makes or has in his possession or has under his care or control any\nexplosive substance with intent thereby\n(ii) to enable another person to endanger life or to cause serious damage\nto property.\n(2) ?Punishment? Every one who commits an offence under subsection (1)\nis guilty of an indictable offence and liable\n(d) to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years.\"\nAfter assessing the claimant's testimony and PIF as a whole, the panel is of the opinion that the claimant demonstrated that he is credible on the following facts:\n1) On his way to the grain market located in XXXXX, he was intercepted by two armed Sikh terrorists, approximately 2 km from his farm and about 4 km to the market;\n2) he had the intention to transport \"some kind of explosives\"5 to the market and hand them over to the terrorists;\n3) after the departure of the two gunmen, realizing that \"the toolbox of the tractor is often checked by the police\"6, the claimant \"hid the items in the paddy bags under the tarpaulin\";7\n4) the police intercepted the claimant and seized the \"some kind of explosives\"8 at a police blockade, about 2 km from the market.\nThus, the claimant demonstrated that he intended to transport explosives and deliver them at the market to terrorists and that these explosives were under his care and control.\nHowever, the claimant demonstrated that he is not credible when he stated that he did not know that he was transporting a bomb and that he acted under pressure because the terrorists threatened to kill him and his family.\nWhen asked whether he transported a bomb as he was heading towards the market, the claimant answered that he did not know it was a bomb. Confronted by the Minister's counsel since the claimant wrote in December 2001 in his answer to question 37 of his Personal Information Form (PIF) that \"he thought that it was some kind of explosives\", the claimant replied that it was wrapped in a piece of cloth. In assessing credibility, the panel is entitled \"?...? to rely on criteria such as rationality and common sense\"9. Hence, the panel does not find it plausible that the claimant did not know he was transporting a bomb given he was dealing with terrorists, given that he admitted to the Immigration Officer in December 2001 (exhibit A-5) that he knew that it was a bomb, given that he took the precaution to remove the explosives from his toolbox and hide them, and given that he \"started to shiver\" at the sight of the police blockade10. Questioned, the claimant's defence was that he acted under the threat of himself and his family being killed by the terrorists. However, the claimant declared at some point in the hearing that \"if he had known it was a bomb, he would have left his tractor and run away\". Given that the terrorists left after handing the explosives to the claimant, hence given that the claimant was never under the constant threat of the terrorists watching his every move, and given the panel's previous conclusion that it did not find plausible that the claimant did not know he was transporting a bomb, the panel concludes that the claimant had the opportunity to leave his tractor where it was and run away. The claimant is not credible when alleging that he acted under duress.\nHence, given that the standard of proof required is less than the balance of probabilities11, the panel comes to the conclusion that it has serious reasons for considering that the claimant \"has committed a serious non-political crime\" outside Canada prior to his admission to Canada as a refugee, thus should be excluded from refugee protection.\nIn the present case, the crime was not committed \"in the course of and incidental to a violent political disturbance such as a war, revolution or rebellion.\"12 Documentary evidence indicates that the situation in Punjab is now under control. Acts of violence are now at a low level as the militancy period ended in the mid-1990s.13 Moreover, there is no evidence that the perpetrators were, indeed, members of a militancy group. The claimant's ignorance about the identity of the group casts serious doubts that the act of violence had any political motive. Transporting a bomb in order to deliver it to militants, waiting for it at a market, which bomb can then be used to kill innocent people, is a crime of \"an atrocious or barbarous nature.\"14\nIn conclusion, under section 98 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act15, a person referred to in section 1F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention, as it is the case of the claimant, is not a \"Convention refugee\" or \"a person in need of protection\".\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the panel excludes the claimant, XXXXXXXXXXX, under section 1F (b) of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention. The claimant is not a person who can be protected under sections 96 or 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nPhilippe Patry\nMe Philippe Patry\nAugust 22, 2003\nDate\n\/na\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C.

The panel must determine whether the claimant is a Convention refugee as defined by the s 2(1) of the Immigration Act1. The claimant alleges that because of his half Romani ethnicity he has been subjected to attack and has received inadequate state protection in Poland.\nThe claimant alleges his mother is Polish and his father is a Rom. The claimant alleges that his first language is Romanes. However, when asked by counsel to describe what he did that morning in Romanes, the claimant spoke with hesitation and paused, as opposed to when he was speaking in Polish which he did with apparent fluidity and ease.\nThe claimant was asked to describe in the Romanes language one of the incidents in 1998 as set out in his Personal Information Form (PIF). He then stated what he had said in Romanes in the Polish language. Under further examination, he admitted that he had said more in Polish than when he had been speaking in Romanes. Also, when the claimant was originally speaking Romanes and describing the incident in 1998, the panel heard the word Canada. At first, the claimant denied having said Canada. He then admitted that he had said he came to Canada to have a better life. The claimant was asked why he had said this since he had been asked to describe the incident from the fall of 1998. The claimant alleged that he had done so but also responded that he wanted to add this about Canada.\nThe claimant was again asked by his counsel to describe the incident in the Fall of 1998 in the Romanes language and then tell us what he had said in Polish. The claimant again mentioned Canada and admitted that he had said the same thing as before. He then explained in Polish what he had allegedly said in Romanes. The counsel pointed out that he had asked the claimant to describe the incident from thefall of 1998 whereas the claimant had described what had happened in the summer of 1998 according to his Personal Information Form. The claimant tried again and again spoke with less ease and fluidity than when he spoke Polish.\nThe claimant was confronted with the fact that he had testified that his mother tongue, his first language, was Romanes and yet, he clearly spoke that language with less ease than when he spoke Polish. The claimant responded that this was because they tried to speak Polish as much as they could and his mother did not allow him to speak Romanes too much and preferred him to speak Polish so people would not beat him. However, the claimant had earlier testified that his mother spoke to them at home in Romanes. Also, the claimant is from a small town in Poland where people allegedly knew they were Roma. The panel therefore does not find his argument valid that he would be more or less targeted depending on which language he was speaking.\nThe panel heard testimony from a witness, XXXXXXXXXX, a Romani citizen of Poland who testified that the claimant is Romani. The witness was excluded while the panel advised the claimant what to speak about in the Romanes language when the witness returned. The witness would then say in Polish what the claimant had said in Romanes. When the witness returned, the claimant spoke in Romanes haltingly and without detail, but was able to get the general story right in accordance with his Personal Information Form.\nThe panel therefore accepts that he has a certain low level of capability in the Romanes language. The panel notes however that at one point in his discussion in Romanes with this witness, the claimant whispered in Polish to her that his father was not with the group when describing the incident.\nIn any event, on the basis of the claimant's very limited abilities in Romanes, the panel accepts his testimony that he has this limited capability because his father is a Roma, and thus the claimant has established on a balance of probabilities that he is half-Romani.\nThe panel then had to turn to the issue of whether the claimant's testimony regarding what he had suffered in Poland was credible and what he might face in the future should he return to Poland.\nThe panel also heard testimony from another witness, XXXXXXXXX, also a citizen of Poland who is an ethnic Pole. She testified she saw the claimant being harassed and beaten by Polish boys and saw bruises on his face. She testified that it often happened in their hometown that Polish boys would fight with gypsies. She testified she does not know what the police do in these situations and does not know of any Polish boys who have been charged criminally for such beatings.\nThe panel therefore examined the alleged incident in more detail with the claimant.\nThe claimant says he was attacked in XXXX 1999, because he is Romani and that he was hospitalized as a result. The police found the attackers but the claimant allegedly received a threatening note in hospital that he would be killed if he did not withdraw the charges. He testified he did not show the police the note because he was afraid and he therefore threw the note away. He testified that he threw the note away before he withdrew the charges. The panel questioned why he would do such a thing. Clearly, it would be useful to keep the threatening note as evidence in case the perpetrators came after him. The claimant responded that he was hoping they would not beat him anymore. This explanation does not adequately respond to the implausibility of the claimant throwing away important evidence even before he had withdrawn the charges from the police.\nHe testified the police told him not to withdraw the charges. He testified he went home from hospital at the end of XXXXX or the beginning of XXXXXXX 2000. He says he did not withdraw the charges until the beginning of XXXXX. In spite of the alleged death threats that he had received in hospital about withdrawing the charges, the claimant had no problems throughout the month of XXXXXXX. He said he would hide when he saw the perpetrators. However, the claimant was working and continuing to take the bus to work alone. The claimant continued going to work even though there were these alleged death threats against him, he had destroyed the evidence of these threats, and he did not tell the police about these threats even though they had previously acted on his case and had actually found the perpetrators.\nThis whole sequence of events is simply not plausible. Moreover, if there truly were death threats against the claimant, the perpetrators presumably had ample time and opportunity to have acted on those threats as the claimant continued to live in his home, to work, and to take the bus alone. Furthermore, the claimant has no documentary record of his being in hospital for a month and a half. It is entirely reasonable to conclude if the claimant truly had been hospitalized for a month and a half, a documentary record would have been readily available to him to present as documentary evidence.\nThe claimant was not a credible witness. Even if the claimant were to be believed that he had been attacked in his hometown, the fact remains that adequate state protection was available to him there. The police had acted upon his complaints and even found the perpetrators. They also encouraged the claimant not to withdraw the charges against the perpetrators. This alleged XXXXXX 1999 incident was the most serious one alleged by the claimant and in the panel's view, the police actions were indicative of adequate state protection. However, even if the panel were mistaken in this conclusion and the claimant did not have adequate state protection in his town, the panel concludes that he had an internal flight alternative to Warsaw, which is about 300 kilometres from his hometown.\nThe claimant admitted in testimony that he is not physically identifiable as a Roma to a stranger. He is well-educated, and Polish is clearly his first language. The claimant testified that he would eventually be identified as a Roma even in Warsaw when his family or acquaintances visited.\nThe panel concludes that the chance of him being identified as a Roma in Warsaw are unlikely. However, if he were identified as a Roma, the documentary evidence leads the panel to conlude that adequate state protection would be available to him in Warsaw. The evidence indicates that relations between the police and Roma in Warsaw are quite good.\nThe claimant indicated that he has two friends in Warsaw, that they moved frequently and that they were being persecuted all the time. The claimant however was short on detail and did not even know if his friends had reported anything to the police. He also admitted that his two Romani friends work in Warsaw.\nOn the basis of all of this, the panel finds that an internal flight alternative exists in Warsaw and further that it would be reasonable in his circumstances.\nThe claimant's vague assertions regarding his two Romani friends who allegedly had problems in Warsaw are not sufficient to outweigh the documentary evidence regarding the good relations between the police and Roma in Warsaw.\nThe panel finds further support in its conclusion that the claimant has not established a well-founded fear of persecution in Poland given the fact that he was in Canada when he was sixteen or seventeen years old and returned to Poland making no refugee claim in Canada. The claimant has three siblings in Canada. He testified they have been here about ten years and two of them are Canadian citizens. As well, when the claimant returned to Canada for this current trip, he made no claim at the Port of Entry which was the airport in Toronto, nor did he make a claim for refugee status while living in Toronto after his arrival. The claimant made his refugee claim in Ottawa about a week later because his family in Toronto allegedly did not know about the refugee process. It is implausible to the panel that his three siblings who have been in Canada for approximately ten years would have family members in Poland allegedly being persecuted and that these siblings would not know about the refugee process in Canada.\nThe claimant or his siblings could have gone to an immigration lawyer or to the authorities in Toronto to obtain information about how the claimant could be helped if he had a well-founded fear of persecution and in fact, this could have been done when the claimant was here for his first three-month trip to Canada. His actions are not consistent with the claimant having a well-founded fear of persecution in Poland.\nOn the basis of all of the above, the panel concludes that the claimant has not established a well-founded fear of persecution in Poland. The Refugee Division therefore finds that XXXXXXX XXXXXX is not a Convention refugee as defined by s.2(1) of the Immigration Act.2\nPer: \"Dale L. Noseworthy\"\nDale L.

The file numbers of the three claimants respectively are AA1-00073, -00072, -00074.\nThe hearing was held on the 15th day of October in Ottawa. The designated representative for the minor child XXX was the mother.\nALLEGATIONS\nIt is the evidence of the claimants as provided by the mother (when the two children were asked if they had anything to add to what the mother had said or testified to in the hearing, they said no) that they are members of a minority clan. In the case of the children, they are Reer Hamar and in the case of the mother, a Sheikhal. And because of this and the civil war in Mogadishu and in Somalia in general, they were forced to flee. They went to Kenya in 1991, lived there for some eight years without any legal status and then came to Canada in the year 2000.\nTo quote her Narrative, the principal claimant, the spokesperson for the three claimants, says that she fears that if she was to return to Somalia, she\n\"... would be persecuted by the warlords who belonged to the powerful majority tribes and who are still fighting among themselves, persecuting minority tribes at the same time. My tribe is a minority tribe and we have no political or military means to protect ourselves.\"\nANALYSIS\nThe issue in this claim is credibility and the credibility concerns which I will outline are not all major, there are several minor ones, but taken together, they undermine the story that this claimant has told on her behalf and on behalf of her children.\nThese credibility issues, as I am about to demonstrate, surfaced at the beginning of the hearing when because of some omissions in the Personal Information Form of the principal claimant, I addressed some questions in order to get a complete picture of her education. And when I did so, I found that there were problems right off the bat.\nIn the Personal Information Form of the principal claimant, we read in question 17, section 1, that she went to high school from 1976 to 1980. But it became clear in oral testimony that this could not be so because if we added up her education prior to going to high school, we would find that she started high school in 1968. Asked which was correct, did she in fact go to school in 1976 or 1968, she said she wasn't sure when she started high school. Then she revised that to say she was sure it was 1976. If 1976, she would be 27 years old when she started high school. This makes no sense whatsoever.\nSo before the hearing was five minutes old, we had some obvious contradictions and\nI cannot understand why there would be this problem with the chronology of her education\nif she were telling a true story. If indeed she were telling a true story, there would not be these problems. So immediately, I began to focus on whether or not her story was true and this questioning continued when we came to the only document that she has in support of her identity, and that is her driver's license.\nMindful of the fact that there is a brisk trade in fraudulent Somali documents,\nwhich I know about because of my specialized knowledge having done hundreds of Somali claims, I questioned the claimant very closely on the authenticity of this license. First and foremost, I note that the date of birth on the license is 1951. The claimant's Personal Information Form on the other hand says her date of birth is 1949. When asked which was the correct date, the claimant said it was 1951, but I note here that just a few minutes prior to this questioning, when her Personal Information Form was introduced into evidence, she was asked\nif the information contained therein was true and accurate. She said it was.\nAnd yet, a few minutes later, she testified that the 1949 date given in her PIF is wrong and this is a date to which she swore not only when the PIF was introduced into evidence at the hearing but when she signed the PIF, which was on the 29th day of December in the year 2000. So twice she swore to the authenticity of the date that she contradicted at the hearing, twice she swore that she was born in 1949. And then at the hearing, when questioned about the discrepancy on this date between what it says on her alleged license, and what it says in her PIF, she says that 1951 is the correct date.\nFurther questioning on this document leads me to the conclusion that I can give no weight to it and it is the only document going to her identity. For example, she said that she needed the license for her business but she started the business in 1980. She didn't get the license until 1986. If she needed the license to purchase goods for her store, a store selling food, utensils such as plates and thermos flasks, along with children's clothes, then why would she wait until her business was six years old to buy a car? She said she didn't have the money to buy a car until 1986. But it is hard to reconcile that with the fact that she had an ongoing business, which required a vehicle and didn't get a vehicle until 1986.\nAsked how old she was when she got her driver's license, there was a long pause which\nI could not understand given that she had just finished testifying that she got it for business purposes and she was in business between 1980 and 1991. Finally, she said she was close to 40 when she got her license. In fact, she would be 37. But the fact that it took her so long to answer the question raises further questions about the authenticity of the license.\nFurthermore, the license is in Italian. Anyone knowing anything about the history of Somalia in the south knows that it's true that southern Somalia was an Italian protectorate, but the south declared independence from the Italians in 1960. And yet, the claimant would have us believe that 26 years later, documents are still being issued in the Italian language. Furthermore, the government of Somalia introduced a Somali script in 1973. So the claimant would also have us believe that 13 years later, official government documents were still being issued in Italian.\nCounsel in his submissions alluded to the fact and it is plausible that the government was still issuing documents in the language of the colonial power, but it is hard to believe that they would still be doing so some 13 years after Somali script was introduced and some 26 years after independence was declared. That would be a lot of leftover documents in the Italian language.\nAnd finally in this connection, I note that the stamps on the document are in Somali, if not all of them, then certainly a good number of them. It is hard to believe that the stamps would be in Somali and the document itself would be in Italian.\nTherefore in summary, for all of the above reasons I can give little or no weight to this document going to identity.\nQuestions were put to the principal claimant in an effort to find out if there were any other documents that she had at any time that would have assisted us in establishing her identity. Her answer was yes, she did have other identity documents at one time. She had a Somali national identity card, a tessera, and she had a license for her shop. Asked where they were, she said she lost them. Asked where she kept them, she said she kept all three of the documents in her purse.\nI find it interesting to say the least that the only document that she didn't lose from her purse was the driver's license and that would be a document that is not the primary document in Somalia that helps to establish one's identity. The tessera is the primary document and the primary document is missing.\nThe other interesting thing I find about this document that it is a license issued in 1986 and it was not renewed. And yet, she kept it. I cannot imagine why she would need a document such as this, i.e. a license issued in 1986 for 5 years before she left Somalia in 1991 and then for almost 10 years in Kenya once she had fled Mogadishu. When I asked her this, she said she needed it to establish her identity at the refugee camps in Kenya. I asked if she showed it to the authorities and she said whenever she was asked, she showed them this. When asked what was the last time she had to produce it, she said she couldn't remember.\nI do not find this testimony to be convincing as a reason why one would keep an out of date document from 1986.\nFurthermore, on the issue of identity, we have no documents other than those in Exhibit C-4 to establish that she was ever in a refugee camp or in any refugee camp in Kenya. What we do have in Exhibit C-4 are documents which she says establish that her husband was in a refugee camp, at least the man she portrays as her husband in the Personal Information Form. These are documents issued in 1992 and 1993 with regard to the Utanga Refugee Camp in Kenya but these are not originals. Asked why she had these in her possession, she said she kept them because they reflected well on her husband. But if that were so, I would expect that she would be able to produce the originals. She was unable to do so and I said to her if I had something that reflected well on somebody in my family, I would have the originals and it makes sense that one would have the originals. Here we have only photocopies and I can give very little weight, if any, to photocopies of original documents.\nSo I am not even assured that the claimants were in the refugee camps that she alleges that they were in and she says from 1991 to 2000, they were in five refugee camps, Libooyeh for seven days, Thika until early 1992, then Utanga until '95, mid-year, then Marafa until 1999, and then Banadiri. Asked if she had any documents from these camps, she said parents were issued with documents saying the number of people living with them and they had a different card for\nevery camp. Asked where these different cards were, she said she had thrown them away because they were no longer needed. Apparently her license from 1986 was needed but cards from the camps were not.\nHer testimony here does not have the ring of truth. One would expect that she could demonstrate that she was indeed in the camps when she said she was with some kind of primary document, which these cards would be.\nFurthermore on the issue of credibility, she alleges that she and her family were in Mogadishu in the lead-up to the civil war. So I asked her what was life like and she said it was\na good life. There was a government. There was peace. The economy was good. But then\nI asked when one got nearer civil unrest and the subsequent war, what was it like. She was unable to give me any specific answers. And I would expect that someone of her education and business acumen, having been in business for some 11 years, would know that life in 1989 and 1990, before the war started, was not particularly good in Mogadishu and that anybody living there at the time would be able to tell me what I know from reading the history of life in Mogadishu at that time certain specific incidents that happened, public incidents, assassinations, murders, and so on.\nShe was unable to offer anything except vague and general statements such as there were movements opposed to the regime and things got worse. The war was based on tribalism.\nI gave her several opportunities and asked her several times to be specific and she could not do so. Therefore I do not find her testimony to be credible that she was in fact in Mogadishu at the time she says that she was.\nFinally, in lieu of the fact that she had no reliable documentary evidence to establish that she is who she says she is and lived where she says she did at the time that she said she did, a witness was brought forward. The witness allegedly is the claimant's brother. His name is XXXXXXXXXXXX.\nUnfortunately, I can give little weight to the testimony of such witnesses because their testimony is not in the same realm as objective independent testimony that one would get from documents. It is testimony that can be rehearsed and often is.\nHowever, sometimes it can be reliable if it corroborates what we are told by the claimants. In this case, it did in some respects but not enough to reassure me that it is testimony that I can rely on to establish identity. And in other respects, it was demonstrably unreliable. For example, the claimant told us that she left Galkayo when she was eight years old, which would be 1957. She left this brother, the witness, behind. However, when the brother appeared, he said he was born in 1962. So it was impossible for her to leave him behind.\nThere are other inconsistencies and contradictions in the testimony of the two with regard to each other that leads me to suspect that they are not related and leads me to find that I can give no weight to the testimony of the witness with regard to the identity of the claimant. For example, when asked if the witness ever visited her store, the claimant said yes, he did. And when I asked the witness what the claimant sold in her store, the witness said she sold food, candies, clothes. He said nothing about utensils which the claimant clearly said she sold.\nFurthermore, the witness said that he came to live with an uncle in Mogadishu and his uncle had a German wife. This is such an interesting fact that one would expect the claimant to have told us about this. She said nothing about a German wife married to the uncle whose home she said she visited. She also said she was very close to her brother. So if she was close to her brother, I would expect that she would know about the German wife and would have volunteered this information. It would be the kind of spontaneous testimony that is credible, trustworthy testimony.\nAnd finally, I note that the claimant before me said in her testimony that the rest of her family never moved from Galkayo to Mogadishu permanently, that they maintained their residence in Galkayo. She was the only one that left when she was eight years old.\nBut her alleged brother said that he left as well when he was seven or eight years old and that's when he ran into his sister in Mogadishu. I would reasonably expect that if that were the case, the claimant would not have testified that the rest of her family, including her brother, the witness, never permanently left Galkayo but just travelled back and forth, which was her testimony.\nDETERMINATION\nSo for all these reasons, the minor ones that I have elucidated and the major ones\nthat I have elucidated, taken together lead me to the conclusion that the principal claimant is not a believable claimant. And since the claims of her children and her claim are one and the same,\nI find that the principal claimant is not a Convention refugee as her two children are not. And since no other ground was put before me on which I could make a decision, I also find that the principal claimant and her two children are not otherwise in need of Canada's protection.\n\"Gary F.

The claimant is a 33-year-old female who claims a well-founded fear of persecution in Poland on the ground of membership in a particular social group, namely her sexual orientation.\nALLEGATIONS\nIn her PIF and oral testimony the claimant asserts that she grew up in a Catholic household in a small Polish town and that at the age of 17 she knew that she was not interested in men. She studied carpentry and preferred to dress in men's style of clothing.\nAs a consequence she was constantly taunted, called names, ridiculed, discriminated against and even became the victim of physical assaults, and expelled from technical school in 1988.\nShe alleges that her father was an alcoholic and very abusive towards her and she detailed a number of incidents when he had abused her. She asserts that in 1997 he attacked her in the street and knocked out three teeth when he punched her in the face. In 1989 she claims that he had a number of male friends at the apartment and threatened to have them have sex with her to make her a real woman because of her sexual orientation. The claimant alleges that her father continually visited her, abused and harassed her especially from 1997 until she left Poland in February 2001.\nThe claimant stated that in 1990 she began a one-year relationship with a woman XXXXXX and that they shared the claimant's apartment. This ended when XXXXXXXX could no longer stand all the threats, graffiti and damage to the apartment door and windows, and she moved to Warsaw. The claimant then had a three-year relationship with XXXXX but they never lived together, as the claimant's sick mother had moved in with her. Between 1996 and 2000 the claimant was not in any relationship asserting that she was depressed, stressed and upset by the constant harassment based on her sexual orientation. In March 2000 she began a relationship with XXXXX which lasted until the claimant decided she must leave Poland for her safety in February 2001.\nThe claimant described her life in Poland as intolerable as she was constantly discriminated against, refused entry to shops, excluded from church, and fired several times from jobs all because of her being perceived as a lesbian. The claimant and her mother applied for visitor's visas after receiving an invitation to visit the sister of the claimant in Toronto, Canada. The mother was issued a visa but the claimant was refused. She then found someone to get her false documents, which she used to travel from Poland, through Holland arriving in Canada on 18 February 2001 in Toronto. She made her claim for refugee status 10 days later in Ottawa, on 28 February 2001.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\nThe claimant submitted a short birth certificate, an identity book and a vocational school certificate, as corroboration of her personal and citizenship identity. The panel accepts her evidence on her individual and citizenship identity as credible and established.\nIssues\nIssues to be resolved at the outset of the hearing were identified as credibility regarding the claimant's sexual orientation, the agent or agents of persecution, state protection and internal flight alternative.\nSexual Orientation\nThe panel finds that the claimant failed to establish that she is perceived as a lesbian on a balance of probabilities. The panel noted a number of inconsistencies, contradictions and implausibilities, which were not satisfactorily explained, and therefore finds the evidence not to be credible or sufficient.\nThe claimant in her PIF alleges she was 17 when she realised her sexual identity. The claimant's sister gave evidence to corroborate the claimant's sexual orientation. She stated that she suspected that the claimant was gay because when the witness would be at home with her girlfriends the claimant would act oddly and her friends would laugh at the claimant because they thought she was different. The claimant had stated that she was 17 when she realised she was gay. The claimant's sister's evidence was confused on this issue. She stated she knew the claimant's sexual orientation about 22 years ago, and then she clarified this to be when she herself was 19 or 20. This would have been approximately 1980, which is not consistent with the claimant's evidence that she knew herself when she was 17, which was approximately 1986.\nThe witness's attempt to clarify this evidence simply became more confused. When asked specifically when she knew the claimant's sexual orientation, she stated that she left Poland 12 years ago and that maybe it was about 8 years ago that she found out. When asked to clarify the apparent contradiction between knowing for 22 years and knowing for 8 years, the witness explained that she had serious suspicions that her sister was strange and different and that she absolutely knew when she was told by their mother. However the witness's evidence remained contradictory about whether she was told by their mother 8 years ago or as she later stated, she was told when she was leaving the country, which as she stated earlier was 12 years ago. The witness appeared to be trying to make her evidence fit the claimant's assertion that she herself knew she was a lesbian when she was 17.\nAs a consequence of these unresolved contradictions the panel finds the witness's evidence to be untrustworthy and cannot rely on it regarding the claimant's sexual orientation. In addition the panel notes several other exaggerations in the claimant's evidence and contradictions between the evidence of the witness and the claimant. The witness described her reaction to the claimant's sexual orientation as uneasy but that she had left the country and was therefore not really close to her sister. The claimant's evidence was that she was alienated from her sister. The claimant's sister indicated that she had known about the claimant's bad treatment in Poland and that that was the reason she and her mother wanted to visit Canada. The claimant in a written statement in support of her refugee claim stated that she had come to Ottawa to make her claim rather than stay in Toronto because she did not want her sister to know about the refugee claim.\nThe panel finds the claimant to have exaggerated the reaction of her sister in her written statement to bolster her claim and does not find the contradictions in the evidence to have been satisfactorily explained. The panel therefore does not find it to be credible. Further the claimant's evidence about not making her claim in Toronto on arrival because she did not want her sister to know about it is also not credible in light of what the claimant's sister said about knowing about her orientation.\nThe claimant asserts that she was known by everyone in her town to be a lesbian. The claimant's evidence in support of this assertion is not credible.\nThe claimant stated that her home town is small but when asked for the population the claimant indicated that it had a population of 80,000 people. The panel finds the claimant's evidence to be exaggerated and implausible. A population of 80,000 people is a significant size place even by Polish standards. The panel finds the claimant, in saying it was a small town, to have exaggerated to bolster her assertion that she was known by everyone.\nThe claimant gave no credible explanation as to how she would be physically identified by everyone in a town of 80,000 people. The claimant asserted that she was constantly thrown out of shops, cafes, church because of her sexual orientation being known by everyone. The panel finds this to be exaggerated and not supported by any credible evidence. The claimant gave no evidence of any position or activity that would have given her any public profile in her town. She also asserted that on one occasion she and her partner held hands on top of the table in a public place. The panel simply finds that such limited public behaviour could not reasonably lead a population of 80,000 people to know the claimant's sexual orientation and to have resulted in being constantly told to get out of shops, being sold bad fruit and other discriminatory treatment.\nThe panel believes the claimant also exaggerated the incidents directed at her apartment. The claimant was a single woman living with her mother. The fact that on occasion there was another woman living there is insufficient evidence that everyone would perceive the claimant\nto be a lesbian.\nOther than wearing more manly clothing the claimant was not able to indicate anything about her physical appearance which could lead everyone to perceive her as a lesbian. Given the above findings on credibility, the panel finds this to be insufficient to establish on a balance of probabilities that the claimant was perceived by the general population to be lesbian.\nThe claimant alleges that she had several relationships with women while in Poland. The claimant's evidence was that they would occasionally hold hands in public, mostly it would be under the table but at least once it was on top of the table. The claimant's evidence was also that she lived in her own apartment, which was owned by her sister who was in Canada. Given that the claimant asserted that she was harassed and discriminated against, and that Polish people are completely intolerant of homosexuality, the panel asked the claimant why she would risk any public displays of affection when she had her own apartment and therefore had the opportunity for complete privacy. The claimant's explanation was that she had a need for spontaneous show of affection and that she was a human being who had the right to be what she was.\nThe panel does not find the claimant's evidence to be believable. If the claimant's evidence regarding her daily treatment were to be believed then the panel simply does not find it to be credible that she would risk drawing attention to herself by holding hands in public when she had unlimited opportunity for privacy. The claimant's evidence regarding her motivation to exert her rights as a lesbian is also not credible. Her evidence was that she was completely depressed and desperate while living in Poland and that she only began realising how life could be for a lesbian once she was in Canada. The panel finds her evidence in this regard to be contradictory and not credible.\nThe claimant alleges that she had three relationships with women in Poland. One in 1990 for about a year; the second one was in 1993 for about three years; that she had no relationship between 1996 and 2000; and then in 2000 she had a relationship which lasted until she left Poland in February 2001. The claimant never attended homosexual clubs in Poland. She stated that there were none in her town and that she never attended any in Warsaw because it was too far. Later in her testimony she revealed that she made frequent trips, sometimes 4 in a month, to Warsaw for shopping. Her explanation for not seeking any relationship for 4 years was that she was very depressed. However the claimant gave evidence that she frequently travelled to Warsaw for shopping trips during this period.\nShe conducted her relationships with these women in private apart from going to cafes. She was not active in any homosexual organisations. The panel notes that for four years there is a complete absence of expression of sexual identity and for a very young woman this is hard to believe.\nThe panel finds it to be implausible that someone who was making frequent trips to Warsaw where there are homosexual clubs, would not visit these clubs out of curiosity or an interest in meeting other lesbians in a safe environment. Further, the panel does not find it reasonable to believe that someone who was making frequent pleasure trips to Warsaw, would also be too depressed to be seeking a relationship. The panel has already made a number of findings of lack of credible evidence regarding how the claimant was perceived. The panel finds the claimant's assertions that these relationships, conducted almost entirely in private, even if they were sexual in nature, to be insufficient to establish on a balance of probabilities that she is perceived to be lesbian.\nThe claimant asserts that she had one relationship in Canada which did not last long. The claimant did not bring a partner as a corroborating witness. The panel draws an adverse inference from there being no partner who could be questioned. The claimant asserts that she attended a gay parade in Canada as further evidence in support of her sexual identity. The panel gives the photographs, which establish this attendance, no probative value. The fact of attending a gay parade is not evidence of a sexual orientation. Many heterosexuals attend such parades for a variety of reasons.\nThe claimant submitted a letter from the Polish Gay and Lesbian Association of Toronto in support of her claim. This letter indicates that the President knows the claimant and that she has been a very active member of the Association, and that the President supports the claimant being allowed to stay in Canada on a humanitarian basis. This letter does not state that the claimant is a lesbian. This letter has little probative value other than indicating that the claimant is presently active in this association. Given all of the other credibility issue raised in this case, those already mentioned and those to follow, the panel believes that the claimant has involved herself in this organisation to bolster her refugee claim.\nExhibit C-2 is a sworn statement from friends of the claimant in Poland in support of her assertions about her sexual orientation and her treatment as a consequence. The panel notes that a detail in this statement is in contradiction to the claimant's evidence. The statement describes the claimant as having been \"kicked out\" by her father. The claimant's evidence was that her father moved out to be with his lover and that the claimant went at some point to live in her sister's apartment. She never asserted that her father kicked her out. Given that this statement is in contradiction to the claimant's evidence and was solicited by the claimant, the panel finds it to be lacking in credibility as well as self-serving and gives it no probative value.\nThe claimant was not believed by the visa officer when she applied for a Canadian visitor visa in Warsaw. The mother was believed and was given a visa. The claimant in her PIF and in her oral evidence gave the impression of her mother as ill, frail and somewhat incapacitated and dependent. The panel finds this description difficult to reconcile with the visa officer granting the mother a visa and making no reference in his note to dependency or health problems. The panel finds the claimant to have again exaggerated her evidence to bolster her claim.\nAgents of Persecution\nThe claimant asserts that she is afraid mostly of Polish society and individual Polish people because of their lack of tolerance and their hostility. However, in her PIF and in her oral evidence, the claimant has given evidence which leads to the conclusion that a significant agent of persecution that she is alleging is her father. Counsel in his submissions even asserted that the claimant was more afraid of society than her father quoting the claimant as saying \"she could hide from her father but not from society\". However in her PIF the claimant clearly states when she was explaining about being fired from her jobs \"my father was the main culprit in those actions against me\". The panel finds the claimant's evidence regarding who she fears most and why to be contradictory and therefore not credible.\nThe claimant cited numerous serious physical assaults by her father beginning in 1989 and continuing until she left Poland in 2001. These incidents range from threatening to have his friends rape her, to beating her in the street and to constantly coming to the apartment where the claimant was living, constantly showing up at her workplaces and verbally and physically abusing her. The claimant's evidence is that her father was frequently drunk and that he was extremely angry at the claimant because of her sexual orientation.\nThe panel found a number of inconsistencies between the claimant's oral evidence and that in the PIF regarding her father. In her PIF the claimant alleges that she moved to an apartment with her friend XXXXXXXX in 1990 and her father found out where she was living and was very angry. Later on in her PIF she states that her father moved to live with his lover in 1990. When asked about the apartment that the claimant lived in the claimant revealed that it was in fact the apartment that was owned by her sister in Canada. It seems that the claimant has lived in this apartment since her sister left Poland.\nAgain the panel finds the manner in which the PIF is written is deliberately misleading. It is written to suggest that the father was angry to find that the claimant had moved to an apartment with a lesbian friend. Given that the claimant was living with her mother in her sister's apartment, it does not seem reasonable to believe that where she was living and who she was living with would be a surprise to the father.\nThe claimant in one part of her PIF indicates that her father moved in with his lover. In another part of the PIF the claimant asserts that her father kicked the mother out after she had a stroke. The panel finds that the claimant's evidence was contradictory, exaggerated, misleading and not credible.\nThe panel cannot believe that the claimant would continue to allow her father to come into the apartment long after he and her mother were estranged. The claimant had been living in her own place since at least 1990 and did not leave Poland till 2001. It seems impossible to believe that the claimant would repeatedly let her father into the apartment to continuously abuse her for more than 10 years while she was living an independent life as an adult woman. The panel does not believe this evidence.\nGiven the lack of credibility regarding the father's abuse, the panel does not accept as credible that the father was the cause of the claimant losing her jobs.\nThe claimant provided no medical evidence to explain any psychological condition that could explain her continuing to allow her father to abuse her. When asked questions about seeking assistance the claimant asserted that she saw a medical doctor at some point for psychological problems but that the advice that she got was to be patient with her father and try to find common language. The panel does not believe the claimant with regard to visiting a doctor or the advice she received. The evidence regarding this medical assistance was not in the PIF and appeared to be being fabricated by the claimant when she was being asked extensive questions about why she did not seek police help.\nHowever even if the panel were to believe that the claimant sought medical help, the advice the claimant says she was given is simply not reasonable to believe. On a balance of probabilities, it is not believable that a medical doctor, in a country such as Poland, would tell a single adult woman, who was being abused for more than ten years by a father who was not even living with her, just to be patient and calm and would not advise her to get legal help to have him ordered to keep away from her or charged with something.\nState Protection\nThe claimant did not seek any assistance from any police in Poland for any of the physical or verbal abuse that she suffered at the hands of her father. She never attempted to make any kind of report, official or unofficial, to the police about her father's abuse. Her explanation was that domestic abuse is regarded as a family matter and that police show little or no interest in helping abused women. In her PIF she states that she was contemplating asking the police for help but she realised she would expose herself to more jokes and she could not find enough courage to go to the police. When asked for further explanations as to why she did not more actively seek assistance, the claimant alleged that she knew a policeman who was a long-time friend of her mother and that she actually discussed her problems with him. She further alleged that he subtly discouraged her from reporting any of her problems.\nThe claimant explained the lack of mention of this police officer in her PIF by stating that she forgot, and that she did not think that it was so important. The panel finds this explanation to be not believable. She mentions in two separate places in her narrative about contemplating seeking police protection. If this police man was a friend of the family and had discouraged the claimant it is hard to believe that the claimant would think mentioning it was not important or connected to what she was relaying in her PIF. Further the claimant asserts that her mother was in poor health and that this policeman was a very good friend. The panel does not find it reasonable to believe that a policeman would do nothing when a good friend was being upset by her former husband constantly forcing his way into the apartment and abusing her daughter.\nThe panel believes the claimant fabricated the evidence about the friend who was a policeman as she was being questioned regarding state protection, to bolster her claim and does not believe it.\nThe panel is aware that abuse of women, mostly by their spouses, is a serious social problem in Poland and that police response is in many cases grossly inadequate or in some cases non-existent. Also the panel is aware that housing problems often compound the problem as frequently an abused woman is forced by shortages in housing to continue to live in the same house as her abuser. However this is not the case for the claimant. She was an adult living independently in an apartment. She had her mother living with her, and her father had not lived with either of them since 1990.\nIn the absence of credible medical evidence to explain this behaviour, the panel does not find it credible that the claimant would continue to allow her father into her apartment over a period of more than 10 years. Further the panel does not find it to be reasonable that she did not ever even make a report to the police against her father for assault. The panel does not find it reasonable to believe that the claimant would continue to endure the abuse by her father, and would never seek the advice of a lawyer about what charges could be brought against him, or how she could force him to stay away from her apartment.\nWhen asked about approaching any support groups who assist abused women or homosexuals, the claimant asserted that she had phoned a help line and had been given the same advice as the doctor had given, namely to try to be calm and find common language with her father and society. The claimant did not specifically call this help line when she was assaulted by her father, giving her mental state as the reason.\nThe panel does not believe the claimant's evidence. The claimant is alleging her mental state incapacitated her and yet she at the same time describes making frequent trips to Warsaw for shopping and socialising with friends. If she was in such a mental state that she was unable to call a help line then surely she would not be able to be so social. The panel does not find the claimant's evidence regarding the advice she received from a help line to be credible either. It does not seem reasonable to believe that a help line would not have other advice for an adult woman who was being terrorised by her father, who was not living with her.\nIn a state such as Poland, an elected democracy with an independent judiciary and system of law enforcement, there is a presumption of state protection and it is for the claimant to demonstrate that in her case state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming. In not attempting to ask the police for help with her problem with her father, or not seeking advice from a lawyer as to what exactly she could do legally to get protection, the claimant has not met the burden of proof, and has failed to demonstrate that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming.\nEven if the claimant had provided sufficient credible evidence to establish on a balance of probabilities that she is perceived as a lesbian, and even if she had provided sufficient credible evidence to establish on a balance of probabilities that she suffered such discrimination that it amounted to persecution from either Polish citizens or her father, the panel finds that she has failed to establish on a balance of probabilities that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming. Her claim must therefore fail.\nDETERMINATION\nI find that the claimant is not a Convention refugee as she does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Poland. I also find that the claimant is not a person in need of protection in that her removal to Poland would not subject her personally to a risk to her life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, and in that there are no substantial grounds to believe that her removal to Poland will subject her personally to a danger of torture.\nI therefore reject her claim.\nFor all of the above reasons, the panel finds that XXXXXXXXXXXXX is not a Convention refugee.\n\"Eunice Harker\"\nEunice Harker\nDated at Ottawa on November 1, 2002.\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - WOMEN REFUGEES - GENDER - SEXUAL ORIENTATION - LESBIANS - PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP - GENDER-RELATED PERSECUTION - CREDIBILITY - STATE PROTECTION - FEMALE - NEGATIVE - POLAND\nThe claimant alleged a fear of persecution by reason of her sexual orientation. The Refugee Protection Division found that the claimant failed to establish that she was perceived as a lesbian. There were a number of unexplained inconsistencies, contradictions and implausibilities in her evidence. Her claim of physical abuse over a period of a number of years by her father, who did not live with her, was contradictory and exaggerated. Physical abuse of women is a serious social problem in Poland, and police response is in many cases grossly inadequate and in some cases non-existent. However, it was implausible that the claimant would have continued to let her father into her apartment for those years, and it was not reasonable that she did not report him to the police or contact any of the support groups which assist abused women and homosexuals. The claimant failed to establish that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming. RPD AA1-00454, Harker, November 1, 2002.\n1\nAA1-00454\n13\nAA1-00454\n",

The claimant indicated1 that his father held this position from 1995 to 2000. Following the re-election of Alberto Fujimori in 2000 for a third term, the claimant's father quit his political job as XXXXX of the XXXXXXXX District of the XXXXX Region of Lima. He publicly denounced the Fujimori-Montesinos regime which was at that time besieged by political scandals.\nThe claimant alleged in his PIF that on XXXXX 2000, his father was ambushed near his home and viciously beaten by unknown assailants. He was taken to a clinic, and a police report subsequently was filed. The claimant's father was told during the attack to refrain from criticizing the government in public. Otherwise, he would, along with his family, suffer the consequences. Following that incident, the claimant's parents moved from Lima to Trujillo and they feared being killed by a paramilitary group.\nThe claimant remained in Lima to complete his university studies but for security reasons moved to another district to live with his aunt. He went several times to the police station in the district of Ingenieria to enquire if the police learned about the assailants of his father. He did not get a satisfactory answer.\nOn XXXXXXX, 2001, at 11 p.m. the claimant was returning to his aunt's home when four armed and masked men threw him to the ground, beat and kicked him. These men enquired about the whereabouts of his father, and told him that he and his family would die because they were \"considered traitors by the Fujimori-Montesinos government\" even though Fujimori was no longer in power in August 2001. The claimant said that the Colina Group were violent supporters of the former Fujimori and Montesinos government and hunted down persons perceived to be \"traitors\". After hearing gun shots, the attackers fled and the claimant was brought to the hospital and he later filed a police report.\nFollowing this incident, the claimant, with the financial help of his father and a smuggler, known as \"XXXXX\" in Peru, obtained false documents and took a flight to Mexico and to Canada.\nThe claimant says that if he returns to Peru, he might be persecuted or killed.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\nI have seen the claimant's passport and I accept that he is a citizen of Peru.\nCredibility\nThe claimant's testimony goes directly against the documentary evidence. He is saying that his father was being targeted by the supporters of Fujimori-Montesinos\nwho are still very powerful in Peru. Futhermore, he fled the country in XXXXX 2001 but according to the documentary evidence2, a transition government took over from Fujimori in November 2000. A new government was elected in July 2001. This government is prosecuting Fujimori and his close associates for corruption, human rights violations, killings, and other crimes.\nThe documentary evidence also reported that Fujimori is in Japan and Peru is demanding his extradition while Montesenos, after fleeing the country, has in fact been extradited to Peru to face charges of corruption and homicide. There is no documentary evidence that the followers of the Fujimori government are hunting down people who had criticized the former regime.\nFurthermore, the claimant was vague and evasive in his testimony nor did he provide a reasonable explanation for the contradictions and implausibilities in his testimony and in the documentary evidence.\nFor example , he said that when the Fujimori followers could not get to his father, they went after him. But if they had been as powerful as the claimant alleges, it is reasonable to infer that they could have killed his father when they assaulted him. They let him go after beating him and warning him to not criticize the government in public. The evidence is that he did not criticize the government after that incident.\nThe claimant did not provide a reasonable answer as to why the Fujimori followers would attack him almost a year after his father had criticized the Fujimori government. He only stated that they could not get to his father so went after him. But his father was still in Peru when the claimant fled the country. Even though the claimant testified that his parents moved to Trujillo from Lima the Fujimori followers only beat his father once and let him go after a warning.\nMoreover, the documentary evidence shows that the Fujimori government was being severely criticized in Peru at the time when the claimant's father was allegedly beaten for criticizing the regime. Since then Fujimori and Montesinos have been thoroughly discredited. Fujimori has fled to Japan and his return is being demanded by Peru. Montesinos is being tried for his crimes after having been extradited to Peru. There is no documentary evidence that the followers of the former government, who themselves are being prosecuted for their actions during the Fujimori regime, are persecuting the former critics of the government - or are in a position to do so.\nThere were other implausibilities and contradictions.\nFor example, he wrote in his narrative that he was attacked by four armed men\nwho fled when they heard gun shots from not too far away. But the police certificate he produced mentions his being attacked by five men and his being helped by two security guards who fired in the air twice to stop more beating.\nSimilarly, the claimant wrote in his narrative that his father was beaten and took a taxi home. The claimant then took him to a medical clinic. At his hearing also he repeated that his father was alone when he was beaten. But the police report (C-5) stated that the claimant's father and the claimant were beaten together when they were walking by the Peru Avenue.\nNor did he provide a reasonable answer to why a gynecologist would treat his father when he was beaten. He stated that the gynecologist was his mother's doctor and also his family doctor.\nThese relatively minor contradictions and implausibilities aside, the claimant's testimony is totally at variance with the documentary evidence on Peru. The claimant testified that he did not know if his father is still wanted but that the military people who were in power during the former government are still in control of the country. The documentary evidence makes it very clear that this is just not so.\nI find the claimant's testimony unreliable and not trustworthy and not supported by the documentary evidence. I do not believe that he and his father were beaten and that the Fujimori supporters are seeking to kill them.\nConclusion\nFor all these reasons, I find that XXXXXXXXXXXXXX is not a Convention refugee. There is no more than a mere possibility of his facing persecution in his country on a Convention ground. For the same reason, I find that there is no more than a mere possibility that the claimant would be subjected to a risk to his life, or to a risk of cruel and unusual punishment or to a danger of torture in his country.\nI therefore reject his claim.\n\"Azhar Ali Khan\"\nAzhar Ali Khan\nDated in Ottawa the 17th of October 2002.\n1 C-1, PIF, Personal Information Form\n2 R-1, Tab 1, US Department of State Report.\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nAA1-01289\n5\n",

The claimant is a thirty-year-old male who claims a well-founded fear of persecution in Cambodia, at the hands of the Cambodian government or individual workers defrauded by the claimant's employer, on the grounds of membership in a particular social group and political opinion. The claimant further claims to be a person in need of protection because he would be subjected personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or to a danger of torture in Cambodia.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant alleges that he was recruited and subsequently employed for a company XXXX, run by a XXXX national XXXXXXXX. This venture in partnership with XXXX a Cambodian XXXXX agency, with high level connections to the Cambodian Senate, was allegedly recruiting over 1000 Cambodian workers to work in XXXXX projects overseas including the XXXXXXXXX. The whole thing turned out to be a fraud for which XXXXXXXX is now under indictment in XXXXX. The scheme saw the 1000 and more Cambodians paying approximately $1000 for the privilege of being chosen to work and for their travel and medical documents to be issued, but no one ever left Cambodia to work. It appears that XXXXXXXX had also been involved in a similar scheme in Indonesia and Thailand.\nThe claimant asserts that he and another Cambodian who is also a refugee claimant were brought to Canada with XXXXXXXX to finish paperwork that they had been involved with in Cambodia. Once here they were treated like prisoners by him and forced to make calls to officials in Cambodia on his behalf. When they realised that there was a fraud they escaped from where they were being kept in Montreal and made their way to Ottawa and made their refugee claims.\nThe claimant was hired as an administrator and was the interface in Cambodia between the company and the workers who had been selected for the project, meeting with groups of them on several occasions to prepare their applications, medical forms and other administrative matters.\nThe claimant fears that he will be arrested on return to Cambodia as he and the other colleague are the only two people involved in working for XXXX who left the country with\nXXXXXXXX. The Cambodian workers are demanding their money back and the Cambodian government is slowly beginning to partly compensate some of them. The claimant fears that he will be charged for being part of the fraud and used as a scapegoat because he does not have any powerful government connections unlike some other Cambodians who were hired by XXXX. The claimant believes that he would not get a fair trial, have no legal representation as he has no money, and would face torture to force a confession.\nHe further fears that the publicity about them having \"escaped\" while in Canada that has been in the papers in Cambodia will result in the workers in Cambodia believing that they were part of the fraud along with XXXXXXXX. He believes that these workers have been so hurt financially and are so frustrated about corruption in Cambodia that they will want to extract revenge and that the claimant and his colleague are the perfect scapegoats. The Cambodian government would have no interest or ability to protect the claimant from this vigilante behaviour and as these workers come from all over Cambodia, there would be nowhere in the country that he could find safety.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\nThe claimant's personal identity and as a national of Cambodia are established by his testimony and by the credible identity and education documents presented in support of his assertions.\nCredibility\nThe claimant was a credible witness and provided credible evidence in support of the allegations of his claim. The panel believes that the claimant knew nothing of the actual intentions of XXXXXXXX and actually believed that he was involved in working for a legitimate organization and purpose. No evidence was presented of any criminal charges in Cambodia or elsewhere against the claimant to this date because of his employment at XXXX.\nThe claimant testified in a straightforward manner, and there were no material inconsistencies or contradictions between his testimony and other evidence before the panel. Further the panel heard the two claims separately to test credibility and found that each of them corroborated the evidence of the other, without the panel believing it had been significantly contrived between them.\nReason for Harm: Nexus\nThe panel has considered whether the claimant is a Convention refugee. For the claimant to be a Convention refugee, his fear of persecution must be by reason of one of the five enumerated grounds. There was no evidence to assert a claim based on race, religion or nationality. The panel has considered whether political opinion or membership in a particular social group applies. The claimant was never involved in any activities which could have been described or perceived to be political in nature. In examining the perceptions of the agents of persecution, the panel finds that regarding the 1000 or so defrauded workers, any motivation to harm the claimant would be as a consequence of seeking revenge and thus is not imputing a political opinion to the claimant. Regarding the state as the agent of persecution, the motivation of the government to prosecute the claimant would be to prosecute those they believe to be guilty of fraud and is in no way ascribing a political opinion or motive to the claimant.\nThe panel in assessing what the particular social group is that the claimant belongs to has referred to the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Ward. The panel finds that the claimant could be described as a member of a group who is falsely accused of a crime and does not have political connections or financial resources in Cambodia. In examining the three categories defined in Ward, the panel finds that the group as defined does not constitute a particular social group.\nThe panel therefore finds there to be no nexus to a Convention ground, and therefore finds that the claimant is not a Convention refugee.\nRisk to Life or Risk of Cruel and Unusual Treatment or Punishment\nThe claimant alleges that if returned to Cambodia he will be at risk of being killed by any one of the more than 1000 workers who were defrauded of a considerable sum of money and who have yet to have full compensation from the company involved or the government which, through its connected consulting company XXXX, is held to be partly responsible. These workers have held violent demonstrations that have been reported in the press.\nEach one of these workers met on numerous occasions with the claimant to prepare all the papers necessary for them to leave Cambodia to work. They had paid more than $1000 for the privilege of being chosen and had to incur numerous other expenses such as living in the capital while all the paperwork was done. The claimant was known to be XXXXXXXX \"right hand\" as he also used the claimant as translator with the workers. Each one of these workers knew that the claimant and his colleague were the two coming to Canada to finalise the paperwork and they learned in a newspaper article that the two of them \"ran away\" when the fraud finally came to light.\nThe documentary evidence reveals that mob violence in Cambodia is commonplace. There are reports that ordinary citizens take drastic action when they believe someone has engaged in criminal activity. In the U.S. Department of State Report on Human Rights Practices in Cambodia for 2001 it states:\n\"Police and military continue to acquiesce in or fail to prevent mob violence against suspected criminals, which resulted in dozens of killings, although the number of such killings was lower than in previous years. In April a mob overpowered police and beat two alleged robbers in police custody to death. The Government never has prosecuted anyone for participation in such cases of mob violence.\"\nThe claimant fears that any one of these workers individually would hold the claimant responsible for the losses they incurred and would want to kill the claimant. Given the documentary evidence showing the behaviour of the public to those they regard as criminals, and the reports about demonstrations already held by the workers, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility of a risk to the claimant's life from any one of these defrauded workers.\nThese workers were recruited from all over Cambodia and the claimant asserts that he would be instantly recognizable to any one of them because of the frequent contact he had with them and because of the nature of the contact. The panel accepts the claimant's assertion that there is a serious possibility of a risk to his life and that it extends throughout Cambodia, because the workers came from all over the country. There is no documentary evidence to establish that the attitude to criminal activity is different in any part of Cambodia. I further find because of all the circumstances of this case and the publicity it has received that the risk of harm faced by the claimant is not one faced generally by others in Cambodia.\nI have considered the standard of proof to be applied in assessing the risk of harm under section 97(1)(b). In my opinion, the test is whether the claimant faces a reasonable chance or serious possibility of a risk to his life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. The Act is silent as to the appropriate standard of proof to be used in applying section 97(1)(b) and it seems logical that it should be consistent with the standard of proof for establishing a well-founded fear of persecution under the Convention. Both the Convention ground and this ground deal with a prospective risk of serious human rights violations and the harm contemplated under section 97(1)(b) is no less serious than the harm to be protected against under the Convention. Therefore, a claimant should not have to establish the prospective risk to a higher degree of certainty than under the Convention.\nIt is worth noting that the CIC Guidelines issued for Post-Determination Refugee Claimants in Canada (PDRCC) reviews, the precursor of the section 97(1)(b) provisions, set the standard of proof at \"less than a clear probability, or even a balance of probabilities, but greater than a mere possibility.\"1 In addition, there is a compelling argument that the standard of proof should be consistent among the three grounds as all grounds deal with a prospective fear of human rights violations. In fact, the U.K. Immigration Appeal Tribunal in Kacaj2 noted that the various expressions used in reference to the legal test for asylum cases, namely \"reasonable chance,\" \"substantial grounds for thinking\" and \"serious possibility\", were taken to refer to the same degree of risk as a \"real risk.\" In addition, it noted the practical difficulty of applying two legal tests to the same set of facts in a given hearing. I am of the opinion, therefore, that the standard of proof as set out in Adjei3 and as applied to the Convention refugee definition is the standard that should be applied under section 97(1)(b) and I have applied that standard to the facts of this case as follows.\nI find there is a serious possibility that the claimant would be subjected personally to a risk to his life should he return to Cambodia for the above-mentioned reasons. In the documentary evidence it is clear given the impotence of the police in the face of mob action, that the state would be unable or unwilling to protect the claimant. Further I find that there is no Internal Flight Alternative for the claimant given that the workers the claimant fears are from all parts of Cambodia and the inability or the unwillingness of the state to provide adequate protection extends to the entire territory of Cambodia.\nThe panel finds that the risk faced by the claimant is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, nor is it due to inadequate health or medical care.\nDanger of Torture\nThe claimant fears that there is more than a mere possibility of being arrested for the involvement in the scheme to defraud the 1000 or so workers in Cambodia. The Cambodian government wants to have someone to blame for the fact that they are being pressured to pay compensation when they had no involvement. The claimant believes that there is more than a mere possibility of torture as the Cambodian government is widely reported to be a state that allows its police to routinely torture prisoners to obtain confessions. Given the high public profile of the fraud he was caught up in, the claimant believes that he will be subjected to torture in order to extract a confession of complicity in order that the Cambodian government can mollify the disgruntled workers and demonstrate that they have done something.\nThe issue is whether the alleged harm meets the definition of torture in Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture (CAT).\nThe documentary evidence from the U.S. Department of State Report on Human Rights Practices for 2001 and Amnesty International report that the Cambodian police routinely torture criminal suspects in order to extract confessions.\nThe U.S. Report states under the section on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment:\n\"The Constitution prohibits torture and physical abuse of prisoners; however, torture, beatings, and other forms of physical mistreatment of persons held in police or military custody continued to be a serious problem throughout the country. There were credible reports that military and police officials used physical and psychological torture and severely beat criminal detainees,\nparticularly during interrogation. The problem was compounded by a climate of impunity, whereby police and security force perpetrators of torture and abuse frequently were protected from prosecution or disciplinary action by local government authorities, despite some central government efforts to curtail or eliminate violations of prisoners' rights and to address problems of accountability.\nDuring the year, the Ministry of Interior was slow to investigate allegations by the UNHCHR of torture and severe abuse of individuals in detention in various parts of the country, including one case in July in Prey Veng province when police beat a prisoner to death. However, provincial prosecutors filed preliminary charges against prison officials in Kampong Cham province for alleged mistreatment of prisoners following an escape attempt in 1999.\"\nThe panel finds this documentary evidence from reliable human rights organizations familiar with the meaning of torture in Article 1 of CAT to be persuasive.\nThe judiciary is not independent, they are poorly trained and compensated, many are not lawyers, and they routinely take money for favourable verdicts. These facts are reported by a number of independent human rights organizations and are regarded by the panel as credible. There is no opposing information to balance.\nThe panel finds that the claimant has a profile in the whole affair by having accompanied, to Canada, the chief suspect in the fraud and then escaping and making a refugee claim. The documentary evidence reveals extensive corruption and political interference in the Cambodian judicial system. The panel finds that the claimant has established on a balance of probabilities that he would be charged with involvement in the fraud if returned to Cambodia.\nOthers who worked for XXXX have political connections and have been able to avoid any blame. The highest-ranking person in the XXXX has been fired but given his political connections with the Cambodian Senate he has so far avoided prosecution. The claimant is without any political connections to avoid being held responsible and without money to get proper legal\nrepresentation. He and his colleague were the only two Cambodians connected with the fraud to go out of the country with XXXXXXXX. In these circumstances, the panel finds that the claimant has established on a balance of probabilities that he will be used as a scapegoat and arrested and charged for participation in the fraud. Given the documentary evidence the panel finds that there is a serious possibility that the claimant would be personally subjected to acts by which severe pain or suffering would be inflicted by officers of the state in order to extract a false confession.\nAs the state is one of the agents of persecution, it is clear that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming. On the evidence contained in the documentary evidence, it is clear that there exist substantial grounds to believe that the claimant would be subjected to torture throughout the territory of Cambodia.\nI have considered the issue of the standard of proof expressed by the phrase \"a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture\" in section 97(1)(a). Is the risk to be assessed on a standard of reasonable chance or serious possibility or on a higher standard? In my opinion, the claimant is not required to establish that it is more probable than not that he would be tortured but rather that there is a serious possibility that he would face torture. I reach this conclusion mainly for two reasons:\n1. It is consistent to apply the same standard of proof as in refugee claims since the risk being assessed is also prospective;4 and\n2. It is illogical to think that a person would be entitled to the lesser standard of \"serious possibility\" for a risk of persecution but not for the risk of the aggravated form of harm encompassed by torture.\nMy view is supported by the approach taken in Canadian and international jurisprudence on this issue.5 The U.N. Committee against Torture and the European Court of Human Rights (\"ECHR\") have expressed the test of \"substantial grounds to believe\" as being whether the individual would be exposed to a real risk of suffering ill-treatment. In the case of Kacaj,6 the U.K. Immigration Appeal Tribunal discussed the standard of proof in Article 3 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\"European Convention\")7 and found that the test formulated by the ECHR is no different from the test applicable to Refugee Convention cases. The various expressions used in reference to the legal test for asylum cases, namely \"reasonable chance\", \"substantial grounds for thinking\" and \"serious possibility\" were taken to refer to the same degree of risk as a \"real risk\". The tribunal was of the view that it would be surprising to use different legal tests as both the Refugee Convention and the European Convention are concerned with whether future ill-treatment would amount to a breach of an individual's rights. In addition, it noted the practical difficulty of applying two legal tests to the same set of facts in a given hearing.\nIn my view, similar reasoning may be relied upon in determining the legal test applicable to claims based on a danger of torture under section 97(1)(a) of the Act. In Suresh,8 the Supreme Court of Canada, while not directly addressing the standard of proof issue, concludes that where there is a \"serious or substantial risk of torture\" or \"substantial grounds to believe he or she would be tortured on return\", deportation to torture would generally be contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The expressions \"serious or substantial risk\" and \"real risk\" are not significantly different from the expressions \"good grounds\", \"serious possibility\" and \"reasonable chance\" used in Adjei,9 in the context of the Convention refugee definition. In Adjei, the Federal Court of Appeal indicated that \"good grounds\", \"serious possibility\" and \"reasonable chance\" connote more than a mere possibility and less than balance of probabilities. In addition, the French version of \"substantial grounds to believe\" in section 97(1)(a), \"motifs s\u00e9rieux de le croire\" is similar to the expression for the legal test for grounds of inadmissibility in section 33 of the Act (formerly found in section 19 of the Immigration Act10), namely \"motifs raisonnables de croire\". The legal test \"reasonable grounds to believe\" in section 19 of the Immigration Act was interpreted as referring to \"less than the balance of probabilities\".11 Similarly, Section F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention12 contains the expression \"serious reasons for considering\" which has been interpreted to refer to \"less than the balance of probabilities\".13 Bearing in mind the objectives set out in the Act with respect to refugees, I do not believe that Parliament intended to make access to protection more difficult for those risking torture than for those risking persecution. In fact, allegations of future ill treatment may meet, within the same claim, the definition of torture by virtue of Article 1 of the CAT and the definition of Convention refugee in section 96 of the Act. Setting the legal test at a standard higher than that applicable in Convention refugee definition claims would result in refusing protection to persons who nevertheless face a serious possibility of torture. Consequently, I am of the opinion that \"substantial grounds to believe\" refers to a standard of serious possibility of torture and have applied this standard to the facts of this case.\nI find that there are substantial grounds for believing that the claimant would be subjected personally to a danger of torture should he return to Cambodia for the following reasons. The Cambodian government is under considerable pressure from all the defrauded workers to provide\ncompensation and punish those responsible. The claimant's profile with all the workers was significant in that he was seen to be coming to Canada to finalise everything and had been involved in all the details of their selection from the beginning. The claimant remaining in Canada was portrayed in the Cambodian newspapers as \"running away\" when the fraud came to light. The claimant has no financial resources to pay bribes to defend himself and the judiciary is reported in the documentary evidence to be widely corrupt. The documentary evidence further establishes the routine use of torture by the police to extract confessions before trial. The panel finds that the danger of being subjected to torture as an innocent person to extract a confession does not arise from a lawful sanction and is not inherent to or incidental to a lawful sanction. That danger would rather arise from the widespread recourse by officers of the state to torture detainees as a means of extracting confessions or punishment.\nFor the foregoing reasons, I find that the claimant XXXXXXXX is a person in need of protection and I therefore accept his claim.\n\"Eunice Harker\"\nEunice Harker\nDated at Ottawa this 30th day of December 2002.\nKEYWORDS - STANDARD OF PROOF - TORTURE - POSITIVE - MALE - CAMBODIA\n1 Sinnappu v.

The claimant is a 48-year-old male, who claims a well-founded fear of persecution in Poland on the ground of his race, namely his ethnicity as half Roma.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant asserts that his mother is Roma and his father is Polish and that as they lived in a small village everyone knew them as a Roma family. The claimant speaks almost no Roma, as the language at home and at school was Polish. The claimant asserts that he was perceived to be Roma also because when he was growing up his two best friends were Roma. In addition he was known to be Roma, as his maternal grandparents lived very close to them and he visited with them regularly.\nThe claimant asserted that he had trouble remembering dates. His PIF narrative was not chronologically constructed and was vague about dates. His PIF details several incidents where the claimant alleges he was attacked because he was either known to be or perceived to be Roma. In 1980 he was attacked by a group of 5 young people and he was beaten and bruised, but had no broken bones. When his daughter was about 7 years old, she and the claimant were at the entrance to a stairwell, when they were attacked by a group of men. The claimant was pushed down the stairs and his daughter was forced to witness the incident. According to the PIF, the claimant did not report either of these incidents to the police.\nThe claimant applied for and received a visitor's visa and came to visit his brother in Canada between XXXXX and XXXXX 2001. He made no claim for protection during this visit. The claimant then had to return to Poland because he had learned that his daughter was very sick. The claimant asserts that on his return to Poland he was again the victim of an assault by two middle-aged Polish people. They kicked, beat and hit the claimant with a hard rubber instrument, resulting in the need for medical treatment for cuts to his face and back. The claimant reported this incident to the police and was told that they would try to get to the bottom of the incident, but that nothing ultimately came of it.\nThe claimant asserts that these are only a few examples of what was a lifetime of experiences of being pushed, called names and spat at. He further asserts that his apartment was broken into and the windows of their apartment were broken, but that he had great difficulty remembering dates of these incidents.\nThe claimant decided that he could no longer live with the constant fear that he might be killed and decided he had to leave Poland after the incident that occurred in XXXXXXX 2001. The claimant used the services of a smuggler and traveled to Canada on a false passport, travelling through Holland and arriving in Canada in January 2002.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity - Personal and Citizenship\nThe claimant had used a genuine Polish passport to travel to Canada in XXXXX 2001 but he claims to have given this genuine passport to a smuggler in exchange for a false German passport used to travel to Canada in 2002. He therefore could not produce his Polish passport in support of his identity. He provided the original birth certificates for himself and his wife, and their marriage certificate. The panel therefore accepts that the claimant has established his personal and his citizenship identity.\nIdentity as Roma\nIn support of his assertion that he is perceived to be Roma, the claimant's evidence was that he came from a very small village and he was known to be Roma because they knew his mother as Roma. He frequently visited her parents who lived very close to them and were known to be Roma and he also associated with two close friends who were Roma. The claimant provided no independent evidence regarding his identity as a Roma.\nIn order to successfully base a claim on one's Roma ethnicity, the claimant is required to establish on a balance of probabilities that he is Roma or perceived to be Roma. There was no testing of the claimant's knowledge of the Romani language as the claimant stated that he spoke almost none as his father was Polish and the language he learned at home was Polish. He even spoke only Polish with his two best friends that were Roma.\nThe issue of speaking the Romani language is an important indicator in determining whether the claimant has established his Roma identity, in light of the documentary evidence that upwards of 90% of Polish Roma speak Romanes. While this is not the only determinative factor, the panel has considered this evidence in light of other factors considered.\nThe claimant asserted that him having darker skin would cause people to perceive him as a Roma. The panel noted that the claimant's skin was not observably dark. He asserted that his mother looked Roma and that he had problems when he was doing his compulsory military service because she attended a ceremony and people saw she was Roma.\nThe claimant provided no independent evidence in support of his assertion of his identity as half Roma. He presented no family photographs or affidavit evidence or any witnesses. Given that he was able to get documentary evidence from Poland to present at the hearing, the panel draws a negative inference from the fact that he produced no family photographs of his mother. Again, on its own this would not be the only determinative factor, but considered in light of the lack of ability in the language and other factors mentioned below, the panel finds that the claimant has failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish on a balance of probabilities that he is perceived as Roma.\nThe claimant asserted that there were no frictions that he observed or knew of between his mother's family and his father's family. The panel does not find this to be credible evidence in light of documentary evidence that mixed marriage is very rare and not easily accepted by either side but most specifically the Polish side. Acceptance of the Roma culture by a Polish family is highly unusual. The claimant asserted that this was not so in his case.\nRegarding knowledge of cultural practices or customs, this is another of a number of factors which is important in establishing ethnicity. The only evidence the claimant provided was his assertion that he liked to be with Roma people because he always felt more comfortable with them as \"there was nothing that was not said\" and \"that it was more peaceful\". The panel does not find this to be sufficient evidence to establish any knowledge of Roma customs or traditions.\nThe claimant had 14 years of school and technical training. He was continuously employed in Poland in a skilled occupation as a XXXXX. Such a level of education and a skilled occupation resulting in continuous employment is not typical of Polish Roma according to the documentary evidence. Unemployment amongst Roma is disproportionately high in Poland and education is an area of huge difficulty resulting in the majority of Roma children attending school for only a very few years. The panel finds that the claimant's educational background and his language skills suggest that he is highly integrated into Polish society and not credible evidence of his Roma ethnicity.\nThe claimant stated that he came from a very small village and he was perceived to be Roma because he and his family were known. When asked about the population of this very small village, the claimant stated that it was about 50,000 people. A population of 50,000 is a significant size by Polish standards. The claimant did not assert that he had any significant profile in his town other than being a member of one of about 50 Roma families. Given no particular public profile, it seems unreasonable to believe that the claimant would be known throughout his town of 50,000 people. The panel finds that the claimant's evidence that he lived in a very small village to be deliberately misleading and exaggerated, and not credible.\nExhibit C-12 which is a translation in English of Exhibit C-7 regarding alleged injuries to the claimant after an attack does not mention the claimant's ethnicity and therefore the panel gives it no weight in regards to the claimant's ethnicity or perceived ethnicity.\nI find the claimant's evidence regarding language and education to support a high level of assimilation, and he does not exhibit any specific physical characteristics that would lead people to perceive him to be Roma. He does not dress differently than any other Polish male. His wife is Polish. I draw an adverse inference from the lack of family photographs and find that the claimant's allegations about his colour of skin and being perceived to be Roma because he associates with Roma people to be insufficient. In considering all of the above, I find the claimant has failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish on a balance of probabilities his ethnicity as part Roma or that he would be perceived to be Roma.\nDelay in making claim\nThe claimant did not make his refugee claim during a 4 month visit to Canada in 2001 despite asserting that he had experienced a lifetime of insults, harassment and violence. When questioned about his state of mind and his intentions when he left Poland at this time, the claimant was very hesitant in the manner in which he gave his evidence. He stated that his intention was to go back to Poland and that he came to see what it was like in Canada. When asked was he not afraid to return given his experiences in Poland, his evidence was that he was afraid, but that he had had to return because his daughter got sick. His PIF states that he did not make a claim at this time as he did not know about the refugee process. He further stated that he returned to help his wife because his daughter was sick. The sickness turned out to be no more serious than a viral infection that responded to treatment. His PIF does state however \"I had been afraid most of my life\".\nThe panel finds the claimant's evidence about his intentions when he left Poland for the first time to be deliberately obtuse. The claimant did not satisfactorily explain the contradictions in his evidence as to whether his intention was to find out about protection or to go back. Nor did he satisfactorily explain why if he had been afraid for most of his life why he would not make a claim immediately on arrival. The panel therefore finds the evidence in this regard not to be credible.\nA lack of knowledge about the refugee process is not a credible reason for the claimant not seeking protection on arrival. I find the claimant's evidence regarding his motivation for leaving Poland or re-availing himself of the protection of Poland not to be credible and that it is evidence inconsistent with a subjective fear.\nThe claimant was able to get a Canadian visitor visa in 2001 by applying to the embassy in Poland. The claimant stated that he did not apply a second time after his return in 2001 because he was told by phone by an official that they did not know how long it would take and whether he would get one. The claimant chose to give a smuggler $5,000 and his Polish passport and risk the vagaries of travelling with a false passport rather than make a second visa application and wait to see if it was granted. The claimant did not make his claim on arrival at the airport, rather he traveled to Ottawa and made his claim there. The claimant has no proof therefore that he actually returned to Poland or that he arrived in Canada on the day he alleges.\nThe panel acknowledges that people in genuine fear and with no legitimate way to leave their country often have to take desperate measures. The panel is not persuaded that this is the case of this claimant. He was able to leave his country legitimately and come to Canada. He did not make a claim for protection. Thus he has not demonstrated behaviour consistent with a subjective fear. Further, the panel finds that the claimant had a reasonable expectation of getting a legitimate visa to visit Canada given that he had already obtained one and demonstrated good faith by returning to Poland. Instead he deliberately decided to engage in expensive, risky, illegal behaviour and has deliberately ensured that his entry into Canada is not verifiable by not making his claim on arrival. I find the claimant's evidence in this regard to be inherently suspect and therefore not credible.\nThe panel notes that there are additional credibility problems regarding the period the claimant asserts he returned to Poland. The claimant presented a police report1 that was ostensibly relating to an incident detailed in his PIF in XXXXXX 2001, almost as soon as he had arrived back in Poland. On examination of the document and the translation it appears that the police report was relating to an incident that took place on XXXX.2001. Based on an examination of this and another police report, all dates are given using the format of day, month and year. This suggests that this report relates to an incident that took place when the claimant was in Canada.\nThe claimant's evidence was that the report relates to the incident when he was allegedly attacked by two middle-aged people, and that he himself made the report to the police. When confronted by the contradictory evidence the claimant had no satisfactory explanation.\nThe panel therefore finds it not to be credible that the claimant was attacked in\nXXXXXX 2001 and further finds the police report to have no probative value. Exhibit C-6 is a police report relating to a break-in at the claimant's apartment; however, given the lack of trustworthiness of C-5 the panel finds that it cannot rely on C-6 as it was also provided by the claimant's wife at the claimant's request and find it to be self-serving.\nThe claimant asserted that the most significant incident that happened to him was the occasion when he was pushed down the stairs and his daughter had to watch. The claimant had to be significantly assisted by counsel's leading questions when describing when this incident occurred. At one point in his testimony he was not sure if it was before he came to Canada or not and was only clear about this when counsel indicated that his PIF stated it was when his daughter was seven.\nThe panel draws an adverse inference regarding credibility from the claimant's hesitant responses regarding this incident. The claimant did not report this incident to the police even though he asserted that it was the most serious because of how it upset his daughter. His explanation for not doing so was that there was no point.\nHe asserts that he reported an attack on himself in 2001 and he presented a report that allegedly shows that he reported a break-in and theft at his apartment. If his daughter had been traumatized, it would seem reasonable to believe that the claimant would have regarded this as serious as a theft of a television or an assault on himself when he was on his own. The panel did not find this to be credible.\nThe claimant presented a sworn affidavit2 from a friend who is a nurse. In this statement, she indicates that she dressed the wounds after the claimant was attacked. The panel has already made a finding regarding the 2001 assault and found it not to be credible as it appears that it occurred while the claimant was still in Canada. The panel gives no probative value to the evidence in C-12 from the claimant's friend as it is not only self-serving, but it is inherently suspect.\nWhen considering all of the above credibility concerns together, the panel concludes that the claimant's testimony was not credible and trustworthy and that there was insufficient credible evidence to establish on a balance of probabilities that he is part Roma or that he is perceived to be Roma in Poland. And the panel finds insufficient credible evidence of a subjective fear. His claim to refugee status therefore fails.\nDETERMINATION\nFor all these reasons, I find XXXXXXXXXXXXXX not to be a Convention refugee as he does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Poland. I also find that the claimant is not a person in need of protection in that his removal to Poland would not subject him personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, and in that there are no substantial grounds to believe that his removal to Poland will subject him personally to a danger of torture. I therefore reject his claim.\n\"Eunice Harker\"\nEunice Harker\nDated at Ottawa, this 12th day of September, 2002\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - CREDIBILITY - IDENTITY - NATIONALITY - DELAY - ETHNIC PERSECUTION - MALE - NEGATIVE - POLAND\nThe claimant alleged that his mother was Roma and his father Polish, that he was perceived to be Roma and that he was subjected to physical attacks throughout his life. He provided no independent evidence of his Romani identity. He had almost no knowledge of the Romani language. According to the documentary evidence, upwards of 90% of Polish Roma speak Romanes. He did not look Roma. An adverse inference was drawn from his failure to produce any photographs of his mother. The claimant failed to establish on a balance of probabilities that he was perceived as Roma. His claim that there was no friction between his parents' families was inconsistent with the documentary evidence that mixed marriages are very rare and not easily accepted by either side. The fact that the claimant had 14 years of schooling and worked in a skilled occupation was not typical of Polish Roma and suggested that he was highly integrated into Polish society. There was no credible evidence that the claimant was ever attacked. The claimant's failure to make a refugee claim during a four-month visit to Canada in 2001, and his reavailment of the protection of Poland, were inconsistent with a subjective fear of persecution.

They allegedly left their country on XXXX, 2001, stayed in Russia for two days and in the United States for one day, and finally arrived in Canada on February X, 2001. They are claiming refugee protection in Canada, stating that they have a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of their nationality, religion and political opinion and that they are persons in need of protection because they would be subject to a danger of torture, to a risk to their lives or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nIn support of their claims for refugee protection, the principal claimant alleged the following, and her two daughters are basing their claims on hers.\nThe principal claimant comes from a mixed Azeri-Russian family and, although she is Orthodox, she married a Muslim.\nIn XXX 1995, she lost her father, who was a XXXX of non-violence and who died after being beaten by nationalists in Baku.\nIn addition, she obtained a divorce from her Muslim husband, with whom she had violent discussions regarding their differing opinions on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. She was even beaten on a number of occasions.\nShe worked in the non-violence organization, and at the New Year's Eve party, nationalists attacked disabled individuals and beat the claimant.\nThe nationalists then attacked and beat the claimant again. At XXXX in 1999, they vandalized the claimant's apartment and a number of other apartments, and they destroyed the Christ monument on two occasions in 1999.\nThe claimant was married on XXXX, 1999.\nIn 2000, the claimant's church was attacked by the nationalists. Complaints were filed but were unsuccessful. In XXXXX 2000, the claimant, then pregnant, was arrested by the police and detained for 24 hours.\nOn XXXX, 2000, the claimant gave birth to her daughter XXXX.\nOn XXXX, 2000, the claimant's brother was killed in the army.\nOn XXXX, the claimant was again arrested, beaten and humiliated. This lasted for 24 hours.\nThe claimant decided to flee to Russia. However, on XXX, she was attacked and beaten by five skinheads, and later, she was again beaten by Russian nationalists. She did not remain there long, as she was unable to obtain either employment or a propiska.\nBack in Azerbaijan, in XX 2000, she was humiliated by Azeris, arrested, hit in the stomach and threatened by the police with imprisonment. In XXX, the claimant's daughter was beaten by students, as was the claimant, who was beaten in XXXX XXXXX XXXX 2000 and received threatening telephone calls.\nOn XXXX, 2000, she lost her son, who was attacked by five nationalists.\nOn XXXXX, 2000, her brother's apartment was attacked by nationalists and on that occasion, the claimant's nephew lost his life.\nThe claimant then worked as a waitress and sold her property in order to obtain a visa for the United States.\nIt is important to note that the principal claimant has been designated as the representative of her two minor daughters for the purpose of their claims.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\nIn order to establish her identity, the claimant filed the following exhibits:\nP-4: claimant's birth certificate\nP-5: baptismal certificate\nP-15: divorce certificate\nP-13: birth certificate for XXXXX\nP-6: baptismal certificate for XXXXX\nP-16: adoption certificate for XXXXX\nP-14: birth certificate for XXXX\nP-7: baptismal certificate for XXXX\nThe panel is therefore satisfied that the claimants have established their identities.\nCREDIBILITY\nThe claimant testified at length regarding the facts that led her to leave her country. The panel found no implausibilities or contradictions between her port of entry documents, her narrative in response to question 37 on her Personal Information Form (PIF) and her testimony.\nAmong other things, the panel asked her to explain why XXXXX last name is that of the claimant's last husband even though the claimant's first husband is XXXXX father. The claimant explained that her last husband had adopted XXXXX and, as agreed, she later provided the panel with the adoption certificate.\nIn addition, the panel found that the claimant provided satisfactory explanations concerning the absence of a medical report and a copy of the complaint to the police. The panel was also satisfied with the reasons she gave for taking some time to depart.\nThe panel therefore finds the claimant credible. Her testimony was spontaneous and direct and she did not exaggerate the events, although there might have been reasons for doing so.\nWELL-FOUNDED FEAR\nSince the panel found the claimant to be credible, it accepts the facts as alleged in her response to question 37 on her PIF.\nBecause the claimant speaks primarily Russian although she was born in Azerbaijan, and because she is Christian, she has experienced several tragedies in recent years.\nIn 1995, the claimant lost her father, who was killed by Azeri-Muslim nationalists because, as XXXXX of a Christian non-violence association, he supported a peaceful resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.\nFurther, the claimant's first marriage was also dissolved because her husband was Muslim.\nShe was attacked on a number of occasions during demonstrations by her association to protest organized violence.\nThe claimant's two daughters were also attacked and harassed because of their nationality.\nThe nationalists attacked the claimant's house on XXXXX, 2000, and during this attack, her son XXXX lost his life.\nIn addition, the claimant's nephew was killed by nationalists during an attack in XXXXX 2000.\nThe panel finds that all the tragedies experienced by the claimant are equivalent to persecution.\nMoreover, although the documentation does not detail situations similar to those experienced by the claimant, the fact remains that in Azerbaijan, as in the other countries of the former USSR, there was a time when the Russians dominated. Following the dismantlement, Russians and Azeris of Russian origin fled the country and now represent only 1.8% of the population. Acts of vengeance and nationalism continue to occur.\n1- A-17 Amnesty International Report 2002, page 1: \"Demonstrators and political activists were detained. Allegation of torture and ill-treatment in prison. Correspondents from Russian and Turkish television channels were assaulted...\"\nThe document also states that there is no independent mechanism to investigate complaints against the police.\n2- A-18 International Helsinki Federation Report 2002: On page 42, the report describes problems with demonstrations, stating that those trying to demonstrate are immediately prevented from doing so and are often imprisoned. On page 43, the report mentions an engineer who was arrested because he was unable to produce identification and who died in prison; the police officer even tried to obtain a bribe from the man's wife in return for her husband's release.\nEven more serious, on page 44, the report states that violations of the rule of law occur even in things that are under the president's personal control.\nWith respect to charity organizations, the report states on page 45 that in December 2001, the Minister of Justice prohibited the registration of a number of such organizations. This is an example of religious intolerance.\nThat being said, the panel concludes that the claimant and her daughters have established that they have a serious fear of persecution should they return to their country.\nCONCLUSION\nTherefore, the Division determines that XXXXXXXXX and XXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXX are \"Convention refugees\" in accordance with section 96 of the Act.1\nGuy Lebel\nMe Guy Lebel\nNovember 12, 2002\nDate\n1 96.

He travelled to Canada via Belgium and arrived at Dorval airport on February 5, 2001 and claimed refugee status the same day. He states that he fears being persecuted in his country by reason of imputed political opinion and membership in a particular social group, as he is a former police officer. He is also claiming refugee protection because he believes that he is subject to a danger of torture, to a risk to his life and to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nSummary of alleged facts\nIn XXX 1994, after a four-month period of accelerated training, the claimant was assigned as an officer of public order (AOP) to the police force of XXXXXX, in the XXXX XXXXX. In the beginning, he was assigned to administrative duties that consisted of receiving citizens, taking down their complaints and referring them to various departments.\nOn XXXXX, 1994, while on supply duty to get food and cigarettes, the claimant and eight of his fellow officers were caught in an ambush set up by a group of armed terrorists. Two police officers were killed, and seven others were wounded. The claimant took three bullets in the back. He therefore convalesced until early 1996, as a victim of terrorism, following a decision made by the director general of the S\u00fbret\u00e9 nationale [national police force], produced as Exhibit P-6. Following this attack and during his convalescence, the claimant did not receive any threats from the terrorists. During his period of convalescence, he lived with his sisters. His mother had been in Canada since 1993. His father had remarried and lived alone with his new wife.\nIn XXXXXXX 1996, the claimant went back to work at the same police station, working in personnel management.\nOn page 2 of his written statement, the claimant said that the draft legislation on civil concord that the new president had introduced had raised much hope of peace. The claimant went on to say that this hope was dispelled. There was a new outbreak of acts of terrorism, of an intensity never seen before, directed equally against civilians and members of the military and police forces.\nThe claimant stated that if he had to return to Algeria, he fears being killed by the terrorists, or else being imprisoned by the police for abandoning his position. According to the news that had been sent to him, his father had received a document notifying him that the claimant had abandoned his position. This document, which was allegedly in Algeria, was not led in evidence.\nThese are, in essence, the facts that were brought before the panel by the claimant, who was the only witness in this case.\nANALYSIS\nHaving heard the testimony and analyzed all the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant is a citizen of Algeria, as he alleges. His identity has been established by means of the original of his driver's licence, his military service card, his national card, and a copy of his passport, the original of which was seized by the Department of Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC).\nAs far as the credibility of the claimant is concerned, the panel accepts that he was a police officer and that he was a victim of a terrorist attack in XXXXX 1994.\nHowever, the panel does not believe that he was a personal target of the terrorists. If that were the case, the terrorists would have threatened him directly and would even have taken steps to attack him, especially since during the entire period of his convalescence, which lasted 18 months (from XXXX 1994 to XXXX 1996), the claimant lived at home, with his sisters. It should be recalled that he testified to the effect that he had not received any threats from the terrorists, either during his convalescence or afterwards.\nThe claimant was a victim of the attack indicated above at that specific moment because in his capacity as a police officer, he happened to be in a police van that was involved in an operation to supply a police group with food and cigarettes. Consequently, he was not personally targeted.\nIn the circumstances, the panel does not believe that anyone called the claimant's father about him, first in 1998 to tell the father that his son was a traitor, and again in 2001 after the claimant had left the country, to remind the father that his son had left for Canada. If the terrorists had never approached the claimant to threaten him, the panel does not see why they would have gone through his father to do so. The claimant has added these facts, which were not indicated in his answer to Question 37 of his Personal Information Form (PIF), and concerning which no amendment was made, for the purpose of maximizing the chances of having his claim accepted.\nThe fact of the matter is that the claimant left his country not because he was the subject of personal threats that were made after the attack and his return to work, but because he found himself alone after his sisters joined their mother in Canada, as he said in his testimony. When he was asked why he had left Algeria, apart from the fact that he was victim of an attack in 1994, he frankly replied: \"[TRANSLATION] I left Algeria because I was alone.\"\nMoreover, the panel cannot accept the refugee protection claim simply because the claimant was a police officer and might have been the target of terrorists in the same way as all police officers, due to the very nature of their work. That cannot, and could not, make him a \"Convention refugee\"1 because the general risks arising from work as a police officer in Algeria, like the attack of XXXXX, 1994, are part of the risks of the occupation.\nAs far as the claimant's fear of the future is concerned, there is every reason to believe that he can return to his country and live there with complete peace of mind. In the first place, in the seven years following the attack, and until he left for Canada, he did not have problems with any Islamic fundamentalist group whatsoever. Secondly, he was always assigned to administrative duties, which made him an anonymous figure confined to the office. Thirdly, one of his fellow officers, who had also been a victim of the attack, was transferred to office work and is still working as a police officer, has never had any problems with the terrorists, according to the claimant's testimony. In the circumstances, the panel does not see why the claimant would have problems with the terrorists in future, even though he is a former police officer.\nIt is unlikely that the claimant would have problems with Islamic terrorist groups in future, especially since he was not personally targeted by these individuals and since for the last two years, terrorism has become a strictly rural phenomenon,2 as can be seen from the following statement:\nThe violence takes place primarily in the countryside and smaller towns as the security forces have largely forced the insurgents out of the cities.\nAt the conclusion of his testimony, the claimant stated that he feared returning to Algeria because he had abandoned his position as a police officer and a notice to that effect had been sent to his father. This fear is accessory to the principal fear and cannot form the basis for the panel to accept the claim, since any sanction against a police officer who has abandoned his position must be interpreted as a disciplinary action, not as persecution, as can be seen from the documentary evidence:3\nResponsibility for maintaining law and order is shared by the Gendarmerie Nationale and the S\u00fbret\u00e9 Nationale. Members wishing to be discharged must have their resignation approved by a special police commission and leaving the force without authorisation can incur punishments ranging from a fine to imprisonment.\nDanger of torture\nThe panel has no reason to believe that the claimant would be personally subject to the danger of torture. As discussed above, the most he would face for abandoning his position would be the imposition of a fine or a prison sentence.\nRisk to life\nThere is also no serious possibility that the claimant would be subject to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment since the claimant was not personally targeted in the terrorist attack of XXXXX, 1994. In the mind of the terrorists, the attack was not directed towards an individual in particular, but towards members of the police. The victims could have been members of the gendarmerie, or even of the army.\nThe fact that the claimant was not bothered following this attack is proof that he was not personally targeted. The panel does not see why he would be targeted if he returned to his country, when he was never targeted during the seven years following the attack.\nCONCLUSION\nFor all these reasons, the panel determines that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is neither a \"Convention refugee\" nor a \"person in need of protection\",4 as defined in sections 96 and 97(1)(a) and (b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nGeorges Gustave\nGeorges Gustave\nDecember 24, 2002\nDate\n1 96.

Before leaving his country, he worked as a XXX merchant.\nIn 1983 (according to one version of his testimony) or in 1993 (according to another version of his testimony), the claimant met XXXXXXX, a XXXX merchant in the village of Bent Jbeil, who introduced him in February 1998 to XXXXXXXX, a native of South Lebanon. XXXXXXXX proposed to the claimant that he distribute his merchandise and find him new customers in the security zone. The claimant accepted the offer.\nDuring the course of their business meetings, the claimant discussed the situation in Lebanon and the Hezbollah with Mr. XXXX. These discussions began in May 1998. In August 1998, Mr. XXXX, who shared the same negative opinion of this militia group, suggested that the claimant become an informant in return for US$800 per month. The claimant was to give the information to XXXXXXXX, who would pass it on to the Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service. The claimant accepted without hesitation.\nHe worked as an informant from August 1998 to August 1999, during which time he provided XXXXXXXX with information twice a month. Their meetings took place at his place of business in Beirut and also in Jezzine in South Lebanon and in Aroun.\nIn XXXXXXX 1998, the claimant travelled to Syria to attend the wedding of one of his friends.\nThe claimant's problems allegedly began in XXXX 1999, with the withdrawal of the South Lebanon Army (SLA) from the Jezzine region.\nIn XXXXX 1999, at his last meeting with XXXXXXXX, the latter told the claimant that they would be halting their operations, due to Israel's possible withdrawal from South Lebanon.\nFearing for his safety, the claimant decided in XXXXX 2000 to leave Lebanon. He applied for a Canadian visa in XXXX 1999 (according to one version of his testimony) or in XXXX 2000 (according to another version of his testimony).\nOn May 8, 2000, the claimant left his country legally without any problem. He stopped over in England before arriving in Canada that same day. However, he did not seek the protection of Canadian authorities until December 24, 2000.\nWhile in Canada, he learned that members of the Hezbollah were looking for him and that they had shown up at his place of business and at his home on XXXXX, 1999 (according to one version of his testimony) or on XXXXX, 2000 (according to another version of his testimony and his PIF, question no. 37). His wife told him about this on XXXXXXX, 2000.\nThen, on XXXXX, 2000, he read in an article in an Arabic newspaper published in Montreal that XXXXXXXX had turned himself in to security services in Lebanon and provided information concerning the people who had worked as informants under his direction. That is when the claimant decided to approach the Canadian authorities to seek protection.\nIf he had to return to Lebanon, the claimant says he would suffer, disappear, be imprisoned or be mistreated by both the Hezbollah and by the Syrian and Lebanese intelligence services because he had acted as an informant for the Mossad.\nANALYSIS\nAfter careful consideration of all of the evidence, I find that the claimant is not credible with respect to certain aspects of his claim for refugee protection; I find that his testimony is implausible and contradictory with respect to major elements of his claim for refugee protection. The claimant was confronted with these implausible and contradictory elements, but the explanations he provided could not be considered credible or trustworthy.\nFor example, at the hearing of September 12, 2002, the claimant testified to the effect that he had known XXXXXXXXX since 1983. He then changed his testimony and said it had been since 1993. He also mentioned that he had submitted a Canadian visa application in XXXX 1999, but then changed his version of the facts and said he had done so in XXXXX 2000.\nMoreover, he mentioned that people from the Hezbollah had come to his home in Lebanon on XXXXX, 1999. He confirmed this particular date twice. However, according to his answer to question 37 in his PIF, this visit took place on XXXXX, 2000. When confronted, the claimant only said that the visit had been in 2000. This explanation did not satisfy the panel, and all the changes in the claimant's testimony have merely served to affect his credibility.\nThe claimant was asked why he had waited seven months before seeking the protection of the Canadian authorities. He indicated that he had come to Canada to see whether economic conditions were good and whether he could live here, and during his stay, he learned that Israel had withdrawn on May 22, 2000. He alleged that on XXXXXXX, 2000, his wife told him that people from the Hezbollah had come to his home and to his place of business four days earlier and asked questions about him. On XXXXX, 2000, he read in a newspaper in Montreal that XXXXXXXX had been arrested by the Hezbollah. After reading that article, he contacted a lawyer in Canada and made a claim for refugee protection. It should be noted that on September 7, 2000, the claimant went to the U.S. Consulate General in Montreal, to obtain a tourist visa, which was denied.\nThese explanations are not satisfactory. The claimant's behaviour is difficult to reconcile with that of a person who fears for his safety. His course of conduct negates the very existence of a subjective fear of persecution. In short, I am of the opinion that the claimant came to Canada for economic opportunities, which also affects his credibility.\nIn this case, the Minister had advised the panel of his intention to participate in the hearing and to raise the issue of the claimant's exclusion under Articles 1F(a) and (c) of the Convention.1 However, in making her submissions, the Minister's representative, Me Shahin, only raised Article 1F(a).\nArticle 1F(a), set out in the schedule to the current legislation, reads as follows:\nF. The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:\n(a) he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes.\nAre there \"serious reasons for considering\" that the claimant, XXXXXXXXXXXXX, has committed crimes against humanity or acted as an accomplice in the commission of such crimes?\nA definition of \"crimes against humanity\" is found in Article 6 of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal, an excerpt of which is set out in the schedule to the Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status (United Nations High Commission for Refugees [UNHCR], Geneva, January 1992):\nCrimes against humanity: namely, murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation and other inhumane acts committed against any civilian population, before or during the war; or persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds in execution of or in connection with any crime within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, whether or not in violation of the domestic law of the country where perpetrated.\nLeaders, organisers, instigators and accomplices participating in the formulation or execution of a common plan or conspiracy to commit any of the foregoing crimes are responsible for all acts performed by any persons in execution of such plan.\nIt is advisable at this point to review certain important facts in this case.\nThe claimant began working as an informant for the Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service, in XXXX 1998. He allegedly provided information through XXXXXXXX on 24 occasions, i.e., twice a month, between XXXX 1998 and XXXXX 1999. The information was provided in person at his place of business in Beirut, Aroun and Jezzine in South Lebanon.\nThe information the claimant provided had to do with the Hezbollah, the centres they used, their meeting and prayer locations, the health premises, the makes of cars used, the print shops that handled print jobs for the Hezbollah, the names of persons and the offices located in his residential complex and the cooperative they used. He allegedly handed over Hezbollah forms, which contained some 40 names of members of the organization. He was paid US$800 per month for being an informant.\nThe claimant told us he had accepted this work because of the hatred and resentment he felt for the Hezbollah and that XXXXXXXX had offered this work to him because of the mutual trust that developed between them. He was not forced to accept the work of an informant. Moreover, he allegedly ended the work in XXXXX 1999 on the advice of XXXXXXXX. At that time, no threats were made against him by XXXX or the Mossad.\nHowever, the documentary evidence on the record indicates the links between the Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service, and the South Lebanon Army (SLA). The SLA was therefore no more and no less than a pro-Israeli militia armed, trained, financed and controlled by Israel and its secret service [translation]:\nPersons who have served in the ranks of the South Lebanon Army (SLA), the pro-Israeli militia (...)2\nThe SLA, an Israeli backup militia, operated in southern Lebanon, in the zone occupied by the Hebrew State. It was founded, financed and controlled by Israel.3\nThe Israelis have a direct presence with numerous soldiers and military security agents. Israel uses the SLA to do its \"dirty work and thereby claim its innocence before international opinion\". The Israeli authorities attempt to have people believe that the SLA is solely responsible for the Khyiam prison when, in fact, the Israelis \"work people over\" during questioning, perform the administrative duties, etc. The Israeli secret service has offices scattered throughout several areas in the zone. It is on its orders that the SLA arrests and detains Lebanese. On its own, the SLA does not have enough authority to go ahead with prolonged arrests.4\nThere is no doubt that the information the claimant passed on to the Israeli intelligence service was thus intended for its SLA militia.\nThe documentary evidence paints a picture of crimes committed by the SLA and Israel, including the displacement of civilians, hostage taking, the destruction of houses, arrests, detention without trial, forced recruitment, homicide, torture and atrocious crimes committed at the Khiam prison in South Lebanon:\n\"Israel arms and finances the [South Lebanon Army] SLA, and thus bears ultimate responsibility under international humanitarian law for SLA actions in south Lebanon that violate the rights of the civilian population. The expulsions are grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and, as such, constitute war crimes, Human Rights Watch said in a letter to Prime Minister Barak made public today.\nArticle 147 of the Fourth Geneva Convention describes unlawful deportation or transfer of civilians as one of the acts that constitute a grave breach of the convention.\n'Since 1985, hundreds if not thousands of Lebanese civilians have been ordered to leave their homes and villages without notice and with no means of appeal. They have been summarily dumped in a no man's land without any possessions save the clothes on their backs,' said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. 'This cruel and illegal dispossession has destroyed the lives of innocent Lebanese families, and it must stop.'\n(...)\nHuman Rights Watch said that Lebanese were expelled from the occupied zone because they refused to cooperate with occupation intelligence forces, because male relatives deserted or refused to join the SLA, and as collective punishment for known or suspected armed attacks by their relatives against Israeli and SLA military forces.\"5\n\"Many parties to this conflict have committed serious violations of international humanitarian law. Where evidence exists of such violations, including grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, or war crimes, legal proceedings should be initiated in domestic courts or in the courts of other countries, and the individuals found responsible should be brought to justice.\n(...)\nAfter the withdrawal, thousands of Lebanese families will want to return to their homes and property, including businesses and agricultural land, in the occupied zone, particularly those hundreds of families who were summarily expelled by the SLA. (As of this writing, residents of the zone continue to be forcibly expelled.) Human Rights Watch has documented cases of SLA militiamen and their families living rent-free in the homes of residents who were expelled.\n(...)\nSome 140 Lebanese men and women are currently being held without charge in Khiam prison in the occupied zone. Some of the detainees have been imprisoned since 1986. This notorious facility, where torture is endemic, is a joint enterprise of Israel and the SLA.\nIsraeli human rights lawyers have petitioned Israel's Supreme Court for the release of twenty-five Khiam prisoners, arguing that Israel is ultimately responsible for Khiam. Ha'aretz (April 13) has reported the possibility that some of the prisoners will be transferred to Israel, a step which would violate international humanitarian law.\n(...)\nHuman Rights Watch has documented grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions by SLA forces, including torture and expulsion of civilians from the Israeli-occupied zone.\n(...)\nIsrael, as the Occupying Power in the 'security zone,' is ultimately responsible for its own actions as well as those of its local Lebanese military auxiliary, including grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions. Israel directly arms and finances the SLA. In April 1998, the Israeli Ministerial Committee for National Security, in announcing Israel's acceptance of United Nations Security Council Resolution 425 (1978), referred to the occupied zone as 'territories under IDF control.' The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) Liaison Unit to Lebanon, commanded by an Israeli military officer with the rank of brigadier general, reportedly directs Israeli and SLA military activities in the occupied zone.\"6\n\"The events in south Lebanon and northern Israel thus far in 1997 have demonstrated, once again, how the military forces involved in this ongoing international armed conflict disregard the laws of war that prohibit attacks on civilians. In particular, indiscriminate attacks and illegal reprisals against civilians by both sides continue the mark the conflict, and put the lives of both Lebanese and Israeli civilians at risk.\"7\n\"Khiam Detention Centre, administered by the SLA, is in the area of South Lebanon occupied by Israel. Although Israel denies being involved in the running of the centre, as occupying power it is ultimately responsible for the area. Moreover, such involvement has been affirmed by Israeli soldiers and General Lahad himself.\nDetainees in Khiam appear to be held as hostages for Israeli soldiers missing in action or killed.\"8\n\"At least 150 other Lebanese nationals are detained in Khiam Detention Centre, run by the South Lebanese Army, a militia allied to Israel in the part of South Lebanon occupied by Israel. Some have been there without charge, trial or any legal status since 1986. Since September 1997 they have had no access to the ICRC.\"9\n\"The SLA practice of forced conscription of teenaged boys has been a long-standing nightmare for families that are opposed to the occupation and despise the SLA.\"10\n\"Both sides-Israel and its allied Lebanese militia, the South Lebanon Army, on one side, and guerrillas affiliated with Hizballah and a number of small Palestinian factions on the other-have exhibited a willful disregard for international humanitarian law (also known as the laws of war). Both sides have directly targeted civilians and indiscriminately lobbed shells and fired rockets at civilian population centers during various stages of the conflict. Israel, with its superior firepower, has caused by far the most civilian casualties, and the most damage to residential homes and civilian infrastructure.\"11\n[Translation] \"Ms. Ibrahim, who was regularly beaten and questioned during her nine months in detention, was never charged with anything. 'It was a real concentration camp, not a prison', she explained. 'In Khiam, none of the international agreements is observed. I did not have the right to a lawyer and I was not tried.'\n[Translation] She was only 24 years old when six soldiers of the South Lebanon Army (SLA, a militia allied with Israel) took her prisoner when she was visiting her parents in Rmeich, a village located in the Israeli-occupied territories.\"12\n[Translation] \"The war crimes defined in the Geneva Conventions, which were committed in southern Lebanon, include homicide with intent, illegal deportation, hostage taking, torture and inhuman treatment, illegal detention and the deprivation of a protected person of the right to be tried impartially and in accordance with the law. Several hundred Lebanese were systematically tortured and detained in the Khiam Detention Centre, without being tried, for periods of up to 15 years.\n(...)\n[Translation] \"After the occupation of southern Lebanon and the flagrant violations of human rights committed by Israel and the SLA, a message of justice should be conveyed. This type of process is a denial of justice.\"13\n\"The Khiyam Prison\nThe prison and its adjoining area holds hundreds of Lebanese prisoners in very harsh conditions. Reports suggest that torture is routinely practised in the prison.\nThe Israelis and the South Lebanese Army (SLA) control the prison.\n(...)\nRecruitment into the Israeli-controlled South Lebanese Army (SLA) is forced. The SLA and Israel exert strong pressure in recruiting individuals and their families into the SLA. Individuals are threatened with forced expulsion from their homes if they do not join the militia.\"14\n[Translation] \"Khiam Detention Centre\nFollowing the Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon and the collapse of the SLA, inhabitants in the region entered the Khiam Detention Centre and released the prisoners. The persons unlawfully detained in Khiam were systematically tortured and mistreated for years. There were 144 inmates left, some of whom had been jailed for 14 years without ever having been convicted or sentenced. Among the prisoners were five women, including two, Cosette Ibrahim and Najwa Samhat, who suffered from illnesses brought on by torture and mistreatment and who were hospitalized in March. During the past 15 years, 16 inmates have reportedly died in Khiam as a result of torture.\"15\nDuring his testimony, the claimant alleged he did not know the purpose of the information he was providing. However, he did know that it was intended for the Israeli intelligence service who }[translation] \"worked on it\". He did not try to find out what was meant by \"working on it\", and absolutely nothing happened to the people about whom he provided information. So why was he paid US$800 per month? He answered that he did not know. He did not attempt to find out about the fate that befell members of Hezbollah at the hands of both the SLA and Israel, and as far as the Khiam prison is concerned, he said he had heard the name before; that was all.\nThe panel finds it implausible that the claimant, who had worked as an informant for the Mossad for one year, was unaware of the ill-treatment of members or suspected members of the Hezbollah by Israel and its militia, the SLA. I also find that it is not credible that he would not know of the treatment suffered by those detained at the notorious Khiam prison. The claimant said he had accepted the work because of the \"hate and resentment\" he felt for the Hezbollah. Is it plausible then that someone acting with that kind of motivation would not be aware of what was happening with that organization, about which he seemed to have so much information? I think not.\nIn this conflict in Lebanon, informants played an important role. The claimant was one such informant. I am of the opinion that the claimant has not told the whole truth and that he attempted to downplay his role and knowledge of the crimes committed by the SLA and Israel. He tried to disassociate himself from the acts the SLA and Israel were accused of committing and attempted to deny any knowledge thereof, to evade any charge of wrongdoing. To that end, he testified about his duties within the organization in a vague and evasive manner.\nConsequently, I find that there are \"serious reasons for considering\" that the claimant is complicit by reason of his personal and knowing participation in crimes against humanity committed by Israel (the Israeli Intelligence Service) and its militia, the SLA, and that in accordance with the decisions in Ramirez,16 Sivakumar,17 Moreno18 and Bazargan19, he is excluded under Article 1F(a).\nFinally, it should be emphasized that fighting terrorism is a laudable objective, but this must not be done to the detriment or in violation of human rights, charters and laws. Those who attempt to eradicate terrorism and fight terrorists must, in no way, conduct themselves as they do.\nDECISION\nThe panel finds that there are \"serious reasons for considering\" that the claimant was complicit in crimes against humanity, i.e., the displacement of civilians, hostage taking, the destruction of homes, detention without trial, forced recruitment, homicide and torture. Pursuant to Article 1F(a), he is excluded from the refugee definition.\nConsequently, the claimant, Mr. XXXXXXXXXXXXX, is not a \"Convention refugee\"20 or a protected person21 under section 98 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nSt\u00e9phane Handfield\nMe St\u00e9phane Handfield\nNovember 8, 2002\nDate\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - CREDIBILITY - IMPLAUSIBILITIES - EXCLUSION - ART. 1F(a) - COMPLICITY - NEGATIVE - MALE - LEBANON\nThe refugee claimant, who was an informer for an individual who was providing information to the Mossad, had provided, among other things, the names of some 40 members of the Hezbollah. The information was for the South Lebanon Army (SLA). According to the documentary evidence, the SLA and the Israeli government were responsible for a number of crimes, including civilian displacements, house demolitions, murders, torture as well as heinous crimes committed in Khiam Prison in South Lebanon. The claimant alleged not to be aware of the purpose of the information he was providing, but knew that it was for the Israeli intelligence service. He said he had heard about Khiam Prison but knew no more. The panel found it implausible that the claimant, who had worked as an informer for the Mossad for a year, would not be aware of the abuses inflicted by Israel and the SLA on people suspected of being members of the Hezbollah. In the panel's view, the claimant had attempted to minimize his role in and knowledge of those crimes. The panel was of the opinion that there were (serious reasons for considering( that the claimant had been an accomplice, because of his personal and conscious participation, in crimes against humanity committed by Israel and the SLA. The panel excluded the claimant under Article 1F(a) of the Convention and found that he was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.

With regard to the daughter XXXXX, she also alleged a fear of persecution by reason of her true or perceived political opinions, for refusing to do her compulsory military service.\nXXXXXXXXX was appointed the designated representative of her minor children.\nThe evidence presented by the claimants, their lawyer and the refugee protection officer (RPO) [filing of documents] mainly consists of testimony by the adult claimants, their Personal Information Form (PIF) and personal documents, as well as documents related to the socio-political and human rights situation in Israel. This information is in exhibits A-1 to A-9 and P-1 to P-6, filed jointly.\nReading the PIFs and the claimants' testimony revealed the following facts.\nSUMMARY OF ALLEGED FACTS\nXXXXXXXXX was born in Russia, on XXXXXX, 1959, to a German father and a Russian mother. His wife, XXXXXXXXX, was born in Ukraine to Jewish parents, on XXX, 1964. XXXXX XXXXX was also born in Ukraine, on XXXXX, 1983. XXXXX XXXXX was born in Russia, on XXXXX, 1993, and XXXXXXXXXXX was born in Israel, on XXXXXXX, 2000.\nThe claimants, benefiting from the \"Law of Return\" by reason of the Jewish origin of XXXXXXXXX, immigrated to Israel in XXXXX 1997. The events alleged by the claimants took place at the beginning of their stay in the kibbutz, in XXXXXX, in XXXXX 1997. Problems arose because of the principal claimant's German origin, because his German name, XXXXX, allegedly bothered people, more specifically older people, who associated it with the Holocaust. They were allegedly victims of insults and threats from the members of the kibbutz and from the children who supposedly attacked XXXXX. The principal claimant allegedly spoke to the police in XXXX 1998, but he did not receive the protection he requested.\nFurther, because he allegedly did his military service in Afghanistan, from July 1979 to July 1981, the principal claimant was also threatened at the kibbutz by Muslim workers, \"Hamas\" militants, who accused him of killing Afghan Muslims there. He also allegedly complained to the kibbutz authorities and to the police about this, but no action was taken.\nIn May 1998, when he was working with an Arab team, a large piece of metal fell on him. An Arab worker allegedly told him that the next time it would not miss his head. These incidents forced him to move to XXX with his family.\nThere the claimants allegedly continued to have problems with the authorities, neighbours and religious Jews who insulted and threatened them, again because of the principal claimant's German origin. At school and the day care, the girls, XXXXX and XXXXX, were allegedly victims of assault by their schoolmates, on several occasions. Although the principal claimant supposedly spoke to the teacher and the principal, no action was taken. At the Ministry of Education, he was apparently told that he had to change his surname and that he must convert to Judaism, which he refused to do. In July 1999, he allegedly received threats from the Arabs with whom they had had trouble before.\nAfter the claimants moved to XXXXXX in XXXX 1999, the situation remained the same, because once their neighbours and children learned their surname, they became hostile toward them. XXXXX was sexually harassed at the cafe where she worked. Upon complaining about the sexual harassment, the police allegedly told the family that they must leave Israel or change their name and convert to Judaism, if they wanted to be protected.\nIn XXXX 2001, when a complaint was made about the behaviour of members of the military recruiting centre toward the daughter XXXXX, the officer at the centre allegedly told the principal claimant that he must leave Israel and that he did not have the right to stay there as he was an undesirable in the country, because of his German origin.\nIn XXXXX 2001, XXXXX was again summoned to the recruiting office and was supposedly encouraged to denounce some Russian girls who took drugs and trafficked in them. Not being able to handle the situation anymore and concerned for their daughter XXXXX-who would be forced to do her compulsory military service, but was opposed to it because of a conscientious objection-the XXXXX family left Israel on March 22, 2001 for Canada, where, upon their arrival at Dorval airport on the same day, they applied for refugee status.\nANALYSIS\nAfter analyzing all the evidence, oral as well as documentary, the panel finds that the claimants did not demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of the principal claimant's German origin and Christian religion, their membership in a particular social group, namely the family, and because of the true or perceived political opinions of the claimant XXXXX, who refused to do her compulsory military service. Nor did they show that they are \"persons in need of protection\".\nThe panel does not believe the claimant's story of fear of alleged persecution. Their credibility was tainted by several factors: omissions and contradictions, of which the examples listed below are not exhaustive, as well as inconsistency with the documentary evidence on Israel.\nFirst of all, the panel noted omissions of important and relevant facts in the answer to question 37 of the claimants' PIF. In fact, the female claimant XXXXX failed to state that the neighbours abused her and her children when they moved to XXX in XXXX 1998. When questioned on the subject, she responded that she had not stated these facts because it did not happen often, just once or twice.\nI did not accept these inadequate answers because she contradicted herself on the topic during her testimony. When asked if she personally had problems in Israel, first she responded \"no,\" but that her family did. Later on she stated that she did have problems, because in XXXX she was assaulted by the neighbours. When leaving her house, the neighbour's children allegedly threw rocks that could have hit one of her children or her in the head. She added that she was not hit, but that her children were. Consequently, her credibility was undermined by this contradictory and inconsistent testimony.\nFor her part, the claimant XXXXX, in her answer to question 37 on her father's form, failed to state that she made a complaint to the person in charge of her class and to the school's principal \"XXXXX,\" after the incessant harassment she suffered from her classmates, who allegedly cruelly beat her on several occasions, because of her father's German origin and her surname.\nThe panel finds that, by adding information, the claimants tried to give more weight to their refugee claim and, consequently, their credibility was affected.\nUnder the circumstances, the panel recalls that the Federal Court came to this decision on a similar subject in the Basseghi2 case, when Teitelbaum J stated the following:\nIt is not incorrect to say that answers given in a PIF should be brief but it is incorrect to say that the answers should not be complete with all of the relevant facts. It is not enough for an applicant to say that what he said in oral testimony was an elaboration. All relevant and important facts should be included in one's PIF. The oral evidence should go on to explain the information contained in the PIF.\nThe panel does not believe the claimants' story about alleged persecution. I completely rejected the claimants' testimony, which seemed to lack credibility when describing Israel as a country in which discrimination against non-Jewish immigrants is rife and where the authorities refuse to help or protect them.\nI do not believe that the State of Israel would have persecuted the claimants or tolerated their persecution. The documentary evidence about Israel presented projects a very different image than the one the claimants seem to have in mind. In fact, this documentation states that the Israeli population has been very kind to newcomers. Some 80% of families have offered to help by giving them furniture, clothing and food, in addition to helping them complete the many procedures required, according to Exhibit A-3, document 1.7(b).3\nWith regard to the principal claimant's religion, I do not believe that he was a victim of persecution by reason of his Christian religious beliefs. Two sets of documentary evidence, namely Exhibits A-44 and A-3 document 5.5,5 note that Israeli law ensures freedom of religion and that the government respects Christians' rights. According to a representative of the Southern Baptist Church, there is more freedom of religion in Israel than in any other Middle Eastern country.\nNor do I lend any credibility to the principal claimant's allegation that he was a victim of persecution in Israel by reason of his ethnic origin and his German surname or because his Russian nationality is written on his identity card. In fact, neither Amnesty International, in Exhibit A-2 (a) document 1.1a,6 or Human Rights Watch, in Exhibit A-2 (a) document 1.3,7 have reported any hateful or violent attacks or death threats toward ethnic minorities in Israel. On the contrary, on the social level, there are very few inter-community tensions, according to Exhibit A-3 document 1.7(b).8\nI do not lend any credibility to the claimants' allegations that they could not rely on the protection of the state by reason of the principal claimant's Christian religion and German ethnic origin. Two sets of documentary evidence, namely Exhibit A-3, documents 1.4 and 1.6 (b),9 indicate that on the contrary, the Israeli police do not take the ethnic origin or religious affiliation of complainants into account when dealing with complaints addressed to them.\nIn addition, other documentary evidence, namely Exhibit A-3, document 7.7,10 states that the public can apply to the national police complaints unit. This organization has the mission of reviewing complaints made against the police about problems that arise in regular police work, especially concerning out-of-place behaviour that is unacceptable for a police officer.\nConsequently, even if I believed that the claimants had experienced such problems with the police, I think they could have sought protection from the state by applying to a higher organization, as pointed out in the Kadenko11 decision.\nNor do I attach any credibility to the claimants' allegations that their children were beaten and assaulted by other children on many occasions at school and in the street, because of the principal claimant's religion and German ethnic origin; and that they were unable to get help or protection from the school as well as the government authorities.\nThe evidence, namely Exhibit A-3 document 1.7 (b), shows the contrary, that the teachers received specific training, given the arrival of a large number of young people in the former Soviet Union, and that school administrators act quickly once a case of violence is reported to them. Further, the Israeli act, [Translation] An Act regarding the ill-treatment of minors and helpless persons, requires the principal or teacher of an educational institution to report any assaults. If the teacher or principal fails to inform the authorities, the person is punishable by imprisonment, according to Exhibit A-3 document 3.5.12\nWith regard to the female claimant XXXXX's concern of imprisonment upon her return to Israel because she did not follow up on her notice to report for military service, issued by the Israeli army, according to Exhibit P-6,13 refusing to do it because she has allegedly been against war since her childhood (her father having suffered because of it) and because a woman should not take up arms, the panel recalls that military service in Israel is governed by a law of general application. Further, I do not believe the claimants when they allege that the Israeli recruiting centre in Ukraine did not inform them that their daughters XXXXX and XXXXX would have to do their military service when they turned 18. In fact, the documentary evidence, namely Exhibit A-2 document 2.7,14 is a brochure published by the department of absorption in Israel in order to provide all immigrants and future immigrants information about the various aspects of military service. Further, according to Exhibit A-3 document 2.2,15 brochures about military service in Israel are distributed in large\nex-Soviet Union cities and are available at no cost in repatriation centres with the purpose of informing immigrants of their future military service responsibilities.\nMoreover, according to paragraph 167 of the Handbook on procedures and criteria for determining refugee status, a fear of persecution and punishment for desertion or draft evasion (where military service is compulsory) does not constitute a well-founded fear of persecution within the meaning of the definition.\nNor did the claimant XXXXX demonstrate, according to paragraph 169 of the Handbook, that being presumed to be a deserter or draft evader, she would suffer disproportionately severe punishment for the military offence on account of her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. According to Exhibit A-3 document 2.1,16 the sentences imposed by Israeli authorities on those who refuse to do military service vary from 7 to 70 days of imprisonment and can go up to one year.\nFurthermore, she testified that she did not express her opposition to military service and that she did not ask to do alternative service when she appeared at the recruiting office for her medical examinations in XXXX and XXXXXX 2001. She also added that, to her knowledge, she did not receive other notices to report from the military authorities, despite the fact that she did not appear on XXXXXX, 2001 to begin her 21-month long service, according to Exhibit P-6.\nFurthermore, now that she is the mother of a family, since she gave birth to a daughter, Maya XXXXX, in Canada, on XXXXX, 2002, she could possibly benefit from the exemptions under the Act. According to Exhibit A-3 document 2.4,17 section 12 of the national service law states that:\n\"12. A married woman is exempt from national service. In this section, \"married woman\" means also the mother of a child, a pregnant woman and a woman who has married during the period of her national service.\"\nFinally, it is possible that the claimants did experience some difficulties in their integration into Israel and that they did feel they were victims of some discrimination; however, I cannot on that account alone conclude that there was persecution or a reasonable fear of persecution. Under the circumstances, the panel prefers to rely on the documentary evidence issued by independent and credible sources that the claimants were shown.\nDECISION\nThe claimants did not discharge themselves of the burden of proving that they have a well-founded fear of persecution in Israel, their country of citizenship. Consequently, the panel concludes that XXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXX, their daughter, XXXXX XXXXX, who is of age, and their minor children XXXXX XXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXX are not \"Convention refugees\" under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Further, as they are not credible, they did not discharge themselves of the burden of proving that they are subject to a danger of torture or a risk to their life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. Therefore, I conclude that the claimants are not \"persons in need of protection\"18 under section 97(1) (a) and (b) of the Act.\nConsequently, these refugee claims are dismissed.\nLaurier Thibault\nLaurier Thibault\nSeptember 19, 2002\nDate\nD\/ez\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - NATIONALITY - SOCIAL GROUP - FAMILY - POLITICAL OPINION - CREDIBILITY - DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE - MALE - FEMALE - NEGATIVE - ISRAEL\nThe refugee protection claimants alleged a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of the German origin and Christian religion of the principal claimant and the membership of the wife and children in a particular social group, the family. Furthermore, their eldest daughter also alleged a fear of persecution by reason of her actual or imputed political opinion because she had refused to do compulsory military service. The principal claimant was born in Russia to a German father and a Russian mother. His wife was born in the Ukraine to Jewish parents. They took advantage of the \"Law of Return\" because of the female claimant's Jewish origin. The claimants stated, among other things, that they had suffered verbal abuse, insults and threats on a number of occasions due to the German origin of the principal claimant. They made a complaint to the police, but the police refused to protect them. The panel was of the opinion that the claimants' testimony contained omissions and contradictions. The female claimant had, among other things, omitted to state that she and her children had been personally assaulted by neighbours. She allegedly made no mention of this fact because it had happened only once or twice. She later contradicted herself in this regard. The documentary evidence indicated, however, that the people of Israel had proven to be friendly towards newcomers. Some 80% of families had volunteered to welcome them by providing them with furniture, clothing and food. According to the documentary evidence as well, Israeli law guaranteed freedom of religion, and the government respected the rights of Christians. No attacks involving hate and violence or death threats against ethnic minorities in Israel were reported. On the contrary, socially, very little tension between communities was reported. The panel did not find credible the claimants' allegations that their children had been beaten and assaulted numerous times by other children at school and in the street because of the principal claimant's religion and German ethnic origin; nor did it find credible that they had been unable to obtain assistance and protection from either school or government authorities. On the contrary, the documentary evidence indicated that teachers had received special training, as a large number of young people were arriving from the former Soviet Union, and that school administrators acted swiftly when a case of violence was reported to them. Furthermore, the law required any principal or teacher at an educational institution to report any assault or face imprisonment for failing to do so. As for the fear of the claimant's eldest daughter of being imprisoned for not responding to the call-up notice for military service sent to her by the Israeli army, the panel referred to, among others, paragraph 167 of the Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status, which states that fear of prosecution and punishment for desertion or draft evasion (where military service is compulsory) does not amount to a well-founded fear of persecution within the meaning of the definition. The claimants were not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.

He also alleges to be a \"person in need of protection\", because he would be subjected personally to a danger of torture or to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Bangladesh.\nThe evidence in this case consisted essentially of the claimant's testimony, his Personal Information Form (PIF), his personal documents, as well as the documents concerning the social and political situation in Bangladesh. The minister's counsel, who raised the issue of exclusion under article 1F of the Convention, participated in the hearing and also submitted evidence.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant is 44 years old. He is married and has two children. His wife and his children are in Bangladesh.\nThe claimant is a career soldier. In 1976, at the age of 19, he joined the Bangladesh army. In 1987, he was transferred to the office of the Director General XXXXXXXXXXXXX and became part of XXXXXXXXXXX. In the course of his employment, he had the opportunity to become familiar with the top-ranking officers in the army. Some of them were directly involved with the then ruling Jatiya Party and the administration of General Ershad. Some of them were jailed after the Jatiya Party lost power in Bangladesh in 1990.\nOn XXXXXXX, 1988, the claimant was transferred to the Bangladesh embassy in XXXXX, as an XXXX to the Consular office. Although he was appointed as a civilian employee, part of his duties involved security arrangements and surveillance of the Bangladeshis living in XXXXXX, as well as the members of the Bangladeshi political parties and army officers who used XXXXXXX as their stopover in their travels abroad. The claimant often rendered services to the travelling high officials from the Jatiya Party, who knew about the claimant's allegiance to the Jatiya Party.\nOn XXXXX, 1993, one of the claimant's co-workers from the XXXX in Bangladesh informed him that he was going to be called back to Dhaka and charged with subversive activities, including assisting forcibly retired officers from the Jatiya Party. The claimant's friend advised him not to go back to Bangladesh, considering the treatment reserved by the XXXXX to the \"traitors\" such as the claimant. Based on his previous experience, the claimant understood that he would be tortured and \"treated as less than an animal\". Realizing that his life was in danger, the claimant applied for a US visa.\nOn XXXXX 1993, the claimant was summoned by his immediate superior, XXXXXXX XXXXX, in charge of the XXXXX Section of the embassy in XXXXX. Mr. XXXXX told the claimant that he knew about his meetings with the generals from the Jatiya Party, and that he was no longer trusted, because he was disloyal to the government in place. The claimant was ordered not to leave his station. The same day, he was instructed by Mr. XXXXX to immediately leave XXXXX and return to Dhaka.\nFearing for his life, the claimant decided not to go back to his country. On XXXX, 1993, he sent his wife and his children to Bangladesh, and he himself travelled to the United States, where he applied for refugee status.\nWhile in the United States, the claimant learned from his family that two security people had come to his home, presenting themselves as his friends. They wanted to know the claimant's whereabouts, and threatened his family.\nAfter the claimant's demand of refugee status in the United States was rejected and after he had exhausted all legal recourses, he came to Canada on XXXXX, 2001, and asked for Canada's protection.\nShould he go back to his country, he is afraid that, since he is still on the black list of the XXXXX, he would be arrested, tortured, or even killed.\nDETERMINATION\nAfter examining the claimant's written and oral testimony, as well as all the evidence adduced in this case, including the submissions sent after the hearing by the Minister's representative and the counsel, I have come to the conclusion that the claimant is not entitled to refugee protection in Canada, because he is excluded under sections 1F(a) and 1F(c) of the Convention, for the reasons which follow.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\nIn order to establish his identity, the claimant produced his Bangladesh passport, his XXXXXX and US driver's licences, and an attestation of his diplomatic status in XXXXX (Exhibits P-2, P-3, P-4, and P-8). I do not have any valid reasons to doubt the authenticity of these documents. Therefore, I conclude that the claimant's identity has been established.\nInclusion\nThe claimant alleges that while being posted in XXXXX, he learned that he was targeted for persecution by the XXXXX, because of his personal contacts with the high officials and former military high-ranking officers linked to the General Ershad's Jatiya Party, which lost power in Bangladesh in 1990. Knowing what kind of treatment was reserved for him if he went back to Bangladesh and being afraid for his life, he made the early arrangements in order to obtain a US visa. One week after he was officially ordered to return to his country, the claimant sent his family to Bangladesh, and he himself went to the United States.\nThere were serious credibility problems with the claimant's explanations concerning the circumstances of his desertion from the consular post in XXXX. There was a significant delay in leaving XXXXX after the claimant learned from his friend in Bangladesh, in XXXXX 1993, that he was to be charged with subversive activities, and again after he was ordered by his immediate superior to go back to Dhaka, on XXXXX, 1993. The only independent evidence in support of the claimant's allegations to this respect (besides his testimony) is the Warrant of Arrest (Exhibit P-7). That document, however, does not mention any accusations against the claimant, besides the fact that he did not report to his duties on XXXX, 1993 (Fugitive and absent without leave). It is not dated, which raises more questions about that document and its probative value.\nThere is also a letter from XXXXXXXXXXXXX (Exhibit P-9), mentioning that the claimant was victimized for his support to the Jatiya Party. However, the claimant's testimony concerning this alleged friend was not credible, which again raises serious doubts as to the probative value of this evidence.\nI also find it implausible that the claimant, being a member of the Bangladesh embassy staff in XXXXX and a member of the XXXXX, would have been allowed to continue offering his support, openly and in a more discreet form, to ousted politicians and retired high officers linked to the Jatiya Party, for two and a half years after General Ershad was forced to resign, and was subsequently charged and condemned to a lengthy prison term.\nI find it implausible that, knowing about the methods of the XXXXX, the claimant would have stayed on his post after his friend allegedly warned him about the accusations against him, even though he had obtained a US visa and was free to leave. I doubt it even more that after the alleged conversation with XXXXXXXXXX, on XXXXX, 1993, and his order that the claimant should immediately return to Bangladesh, the claimant would have continued coming to his work (as he testified), and would not have left his post immediately, hiding in XXXXX, until he was able to make arrangements for his and his family's travel.\nI also find it implausible that after such serious accusations formulated against him, the claimant would be left free by his superior, a high officer of the XXXXXXXX, and not put under a home arrest or detained in the embassy before his eventual transfer to Bangladesh. It does not make sense that after the accusations were spelled out against him, together with a clear threat of torture, the claimant was not even under surveillance, and was left free for one week to make all the travel arrangements for him and his family.\nFinally, while in the United States, the claimant went back to the Bangladesh embassy, where he obtained a new passport. I seriously doubt that if the claimant feared with reason being persecuted in his country, he would have availed himself of his country's protection. I also doubt that if there was a valid warrant of arrest still pending against him, he would have been issued a passport.\nAll the above makes me seriously doubt the credibility of the claimant's testimony concerning the circumstances of his departure from XXXXXXX. It is possible that the claimant was afraid to go back to his country, but I do not believe that it was for the reasons which he alleges. I therefore conclude that the claimant did not establish, on the balance of probabilities, that there is a serious possibility that he would be persecuted in Bangladesh for the reasons which he alleges. He did not establish either that for the alleged reasons, he would be in danger of torture or that there would be a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nHowever, what was established clearly and without any doubts during the hearing is the fact that the claimant was a career soldier, that he was promoted to the rank of havildar (non-commissioned sergeant), that in the early 1987, he was assigned to work at the Directorate XXXXXXXXXXXXX (XXXXX), and that he worked for the XXXXX for six and a half years in Bangladesh and abroad. That in itself considers a serious ground to raise the issue of exclusion under Section 1F, regardless of whether the claimant has established or not that he needs protection under Sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nConstitutional question\nIn his notice, sent to the parties before the hearing, as well as during the hearing and in his written submissions, the Minister's counsel submitted that the claimant should be excluded from Canada's refugee protection, pursuant to Section 98 of the IRPA. The Minister's counsel submitted that the claimant should be excluded, because there are serious reasons for considering that he has committed crimes against humanity, as described in Section 1F(a), and has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations, as per Section 1F(c) of the Convention.\nConcerning the application of the exclusion clause in light of the new Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, counsel for the claimant submitted that:\n\"Section 98 of the IRPA is illegal, ultra vires and not with conformity with Section 7 and 12 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\nNo person should be allowed to be subject to 'torture' within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention against Torture or be allowed to be subject to a risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment as specifically forseen (sic) in the Charter at Section 12.\"\nAccording to the counsel, the exclusion clause, being an inherent element of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, does apply only to Article 96 of the IRPA and should not be applied to Article 97, since exclusion has no basis in international treaties with regards to victims of torture or persons facing risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment. The concept of \"person in need of protection\"1 is larger than a more restrictive concept of \"Convention refugee\",2 and its application cannot be restricted by Charter violations such as Section 98 of the IRPA.\nThe counsel also argues that the Supreme Court of Canada has ruled that a person cannot be deported from Canada should he be subject to a death penalty, regardless of guilt, a death penalty being considered under the Charter cruel and unusual treatment. That implies, according to the counsel, that it is Canada's obligation not to deny protection under Sections 97(1) and (2) of the IRPA to a person facing torture, execution, or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nConcerning the arguments based on Sections 7 and 12 of the Charter, pursuant to Rule 59 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules, a party who wants to challenge the constitutional validity, applicability, or operability of a legislative provision must complete a notice of constitutional question. A copy of this notice must be sent to the Attorney General of Canada and the Attorney General of each of the provinces, and must be received by the recipients no later than ten days before the day on which the constitutional argument will be made. If the party fails to provide such notice, the tribunal has no jurisdiction to consider the constitutional argument. Notice of a constitutional question has been considered to be a mandatory requirement, and a decision made without notice may be struck down on this basis alone.3\nExclusion\nConsidering the application of the exclusion clauses 1F(a) and 1F(c), the tribunal has to determine whether there are serious reasons to consider that the claimant participated, personally or by complicity, in the acts described in that section, whether the activities in which the claimant participated personally or by complicity are considered as crimes against humanity and\/or as acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations, and whether the claimant failed to dissociate himself from these activities at the earliest safe opportunity.\nDirector XXXXXXXXXXXX (XXXXX)\nIt was established during the hearing that from 1987 to 1993, the claimant was posted at the XXXXX in the rank of sergeant.\nThe following intelligence agencies operate to protect the internal and national security of Bangladesh: National Security Intelligence (NSI), Director (or Directorate) General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI), Special Branch (SB), Special Security Force (SSF), and Detective Branch (DB).4\nIn their respective submissions, both the counsel for the claimant and the Minister's counsel agree that the XXXXX has been involved in very serious human rights abuses, such as illegal detention, custodial violence, torture, and murder. The documentary evidence adduced in this case, among others Exhibits A-6,5 M-5,6 and M-9 to M-16,7 clearly supports such a conclusion. The two parties also agree that, although the XXXXX has committed very serious human rights abuses, it should not be qualified as an organization \"directed to a limited, brutal purpose\".8\nAs the Minister's counsel points out in her submissions:\n\"(...) the Directorate XXXXXXXXX (XXXXX) is an intelligence agency which operates in Bangladesh and abroad to XXXXXXXX and national XXXXX. It is used by the government for political purposes.\"9\nAnd she adds:\n\"It is one of few agencies which conduct surveillance of political, socio-cultural and human rights organizations. It is accountable only to the Prime Minister and is beyond the reach of the law.\"\nI do agree with the claimant's counsel, that \"these activities are not of themselves reprehensible\" and that \"most if not all nations create similar organizations to protect internal and national security, witness C.S.I.S. in Canada and the CIA in the USA\".\nHowever, in the fulfilment of the above-mentioned legitimate mandate, the XXXXX members apply torture, ill-treatment, and custodial violence against detainees, including political activists and students, sometimes resulting in custodial deaths. The reports speak about prisoners being kept incommunicado and being denied access to a lawyer for weeks or months, during which they were allegedly subjected to torture. Among the methods used by various intelligence services, including the XXXXX in their Dhaka Army Cantonment, the reports talk about severe beatings, burning with cigarettes during interrogations, prolonged interrogations of blindfolded and tied prisoners, suspension by arms from the ceiling and threats of further torture, exposure to cold air fans for extended periods, suffocating prisoners by putting a water soaked cloth on their faces, as well as the use of electric shocks.10\nThe documentary evidence is clear that the ill-treatment and torture has been an endemic problem in Bangladesh under successive governments since the inception of Bangladesh as an independent country in 1971, including the governments of Mujibur Rahman (1971-1975), various military juntas (1975-1982), and the rule of General Ershad (1982-1990), followed by the governments of Begum Khaleda Zia (1991-1996) and Sheikh Hasina (1996-2001).11\nIt is clear that the XXXXX has been part of that torture network:\n\"Other forces which create terror among citizenry had been members of XXXXX (Director XXXXXXXXX) and NSI (National Security Intelligence). These are virtually autonomous organizations, operate under little or no supervision.\nPolice repression has gone on in the country for far too long. Illegal arrests, torture, shootings, corruption and massive violation of human rights must stop.\"12\nAccording to Section 6(3) of to the Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act:\n\"'Crime against humanity' means murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, imprisonment, torture, sexual violence, persecution or any other inhumane act or omission that is committed against any civilian population or any identifiable group and that, at the time and in the place of its commission, constitutes a crime against humanity according to customary international law or conventional international law or by virtue of its being criminal according to the general principles of law recognized by the community of nations, whether or not it constitutes a contravention of the law in force at the time and in the place of its commission.\"\nThe notion of \"crimes against humanity\" requires that the crimes be committed in a systematic or widespread fashion.13 The notion of \"widespread\" has been defined in the literature as \"massive, frequent, large scale action, carried out collectively with considerable seriousness and directed against a multiplicity of victims\".14\nI agree with the Minister's counsel's submission that:\n\"(...) the documentary evidence establish without doubt that XXXXX has been involved in torture and murder on a large scale, collectively, with considerable seriousness, and that its actions were carried out against a multiplicity of victims.\"\nSince these acts were committed mainly against the civil population, primarily political opponents and students, I therefore conclude that the Minister has established that the reprehensible acts which has been attributed to the XXXXX over the years amount to crimes against humanity, according to the international instruments.\nComplicity and failure to dissociate (caselaw)\nSince it has been established that the XXXXX, while not being an organization \"directed to a limited, brutal purpose\", has been involved in crimes against humanity, it is necessary to evaluate the claimant's degree of participation it these crimes, by being a \"principal actor\" or \"an accomplice\", as defined by Justice MacGuigan in Ramirez.15\nBoth parties refer in their submissions to appropriate Canadian jurisprudence, elaborating notions of direct participation and complicity in an international offence leading to the application of an exclusion clause.16\nAccording to Justice MacGuigan in Ramirez,17 mere membership in an organization which from time to time commits international offences is not normally sufficient for exclusion from refugee status. It is therefore very important to establish what complicity is required to be an accomplice or an abettor.\nIn Penate,18 Madame Justice Reed defines the complicity as follows:\n\"In order to be complicit in the commission of an international offence the individual's participation must be personal and knowing. Complicity is an offence rests on a shared common purpose.\n(...)\nAs I understand the jurisprudence, it is that a person who is a member of the persecuting group and who has knowledge that activities are being committed by the group and who neither takes steps to prevent them occurring (if he has a power to do so) nor disengages himself from the group at the earliest opportunity (consistent with safety for himself) but who lends his active support to the group will be considered to be an accomplice. A shared common purpose will be considered to exist.\"\nAs indicated in Gutierrez,19 three criteria should be considered in establishing complicity:\n\"Essentially then, three prerequisites must be established in order to provide complicity in the commission of an international offence: (1) membership in an organization which committed international offences as a continuous and regular part of its operation, (2) personal and knowing participation, and (3) failure to dissociate from the organization at the earliest safe opportunity.\"\nThe notion of participation was defined by the Federal Court of Appeal in Bazargan:20\n\"In our view, it goes without saying that 'personal and knowing participation' can be direct and indirect (...) It is not working within an organization that makes someone an accomplice to the organization's activities, but knowingly contributing to those activities in any way or making them possible, whether from within or from outside the organization. (...) 'At bottom, complicity rests... on the existence of shared common purpose and the knowledge that all of the parties in question may have of it'. Those who become involved in an operation that is not theirs, but that they know will probably lead to the commission of an international offence, lay themselves open to the application of the exclusion clause in the same way as those who play a direct part in the operation.\"\nThe counsel for the claimant submits that the Minister, who bears the burden of the proof in questions of exclusion, did not establish that the claimant was an accomplice of the crimes committed by the XXXXX, and even less that he was a principal actor. The counsel submits that the claimant was a low-ranking career soldier, without effective authority, and that his duties, both in Bangladesh and in XXXXXX, were essentially of administrative nature. Although he had some knowledge of \"questionable activities\" carried out by the XXXXX, he himself never participated in or witnessed any crimes committed by the XXXXX. At worst, counsel argues, the claimant was a member of an organization which from time to time commits international offences, but according to him, it is not sufficient to exclude the claimant under Section 1F(a).\nThe Minister's counsel, on the contrary, submits that the claimant's testimony was not credible, that, faced with the exclusion, he tried to diminish his level of involvement in the XXXXX activities, that he had a full knowledge of torture and other human rights abuses committed by the organisation, and that he willingly contributed to persecution of some people by reporting on their activities when he was in XXXXXX. The Minister also argues that the claimant did not dissociate himself from the XXXXX at the first safe opportunity. The Minister submits that the claimant should be excluded under Sections 1F(a) and 1F(c) of the Convention.\nTestimony\nThe claimant testified that he had joined the army as a volunteer in 1976, at the age of 19. After a short basic training, he was assigned as a clerk to work in the office at the Army Headquarter of the XXXXXXXX. In 1982, he was transferred to the Army XXXX Unit. It was difficult to assess, based on the claimant's testimony, if the Army XXXXX Unit was a part of the XXXXX or not. First he testified that from 1982 to 1984, he worked in the XXXXX, in the Army XXXXX Unit. However, later on he insisted that the XXXXX and the Army XXXX Unit are two completely separate entities. His testimony to this respect was confused and contradictory. According to the claimant, the Army XXX Unit only deals with the military personnel and intervenes when soldiers are involved in illegal activities, such as going to prostitutes, taking drugs, and doing in illegal business, while the XXXXX is concerned with civil population and takes care of spying.\nDuring his assignment with the Army XXX Unit, the claimant completed his higher secondary education. In his unit, he worked in accounting, XXXXXXXXX. Two months before his transfer to the Military Academy, he was promoted to the rank of havildar (non-commissioned sergeant).\nIn 1984, the claimant was transferred for three years to the Military Academy. According to his testimony, he was working as a clerk XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.\nAt the beginning of 1987, the claimant was assigned to the XXXXX headquarter in the Dhaka Military Cantonment. Again, he worked in the administration, XXXXX XXXXXXXX XXX XXXXX XXXX X XXX XXXXXXXXXX XXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX.\nAfter less than two years of administrative work at the XXXXX, the claimant passed an exam and, at the very end of 1988, he was assigned to the embassy in XXXXX. Part of his work involved consular services. Although he was officially a civil consular staff, he remained a member of the XXXXX. His duties also involved embassy security, security of and logistic support for visiting dignitaries, as well as making sure that members of Bangladesh community living in XXXXX do not defame the good name of their country by being involved in criminal activities.\nI can agree with the counsel's submissions that, based on the claimant's testimony during the hearing, one could infer that he was simply a low-ranking career soldier, without effective authority, and that his duties, both in Bangladesh and in XXXXXX, were essentially of administrative nature.\nHowever, in his written narrative (answer to question 37 of his PIF), the claimant portraits his role and responsibilities, while working with the XXXXX since 1987, quite differently. He writes:\n\"I was then part of the XXXXXXXXXX. In the course of my employment, I had the opportunity to become familiar with the top ranking officers in the Arm (sic). Some of these officers were directly or indirectly involved in the political activities of the Jatiya Party or Freedom Fighters Association. A number of them served in the Administration of General Hossain Mohammed Ershad after their retirement.\"\nIn December 1988, the claimant was transferred to the Bangladesh embassy in XXXXX as an assistant to the consular office. He writes:\n\"Although my appointment in the Embassy was one of a civilian employee, part of my duties involved security arrangement and surveillance upon Bangladeshis living in XXXXXX and the members of the Bangladesh political parties and army officers who use XXXXXX as their stopover for onward journey.\"\nIt is clear to me that two descriptions of the claimant's career, one in his PIF and the other during his testimony, are quite different. The claimant's written narrative is basically the same as the one presented to the American authorities when he applied for refugee status in the United States. It appears that in the United States, the exclusion clause was not raised. It was obvious to me that the claimant made everything possible during the hearing, after the Minister raised the possibility of exclusion, in order to diminish the level of his involvement and his knowledge. From the person who, in his PIF, was a part of the security network intelligence of the XXXXX, having ample opportunities to fray with top-ranking officers and high-level politicians from General Ershad's Jatiya Party and being sent abroad disguised as a consular civil employee, to conduct surveillance of members of political parties and army officers passing by XXXXX, the claimant became, in his testimony, a modest clerk, doing office work, taking care of XXXXXX XXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXX XX X. The claimant could not reasonably explain the difference between his PIF and his testimony.\nHe could not reasonably explain it either how a series of simple clerical jobs would have prepared him to pass an exam to become a member of the intelligence staff in XXXXX. His explanation repeated textually several times, that XXXXXX is a friendly country, is not sufficient. In fact, being a friendly country, XXXXX is a place, as indicated in the claimant's PIF and in his testimony, frequented by Bangladeshi ousted politicians and high-ranking military, as well as a crossroad of traffic of drugs and women and children by the Bangladesh nationals.\nI do not believe the claimant's testimony to the effect that he was a simple clerk before he went abroad. I rather believe that after initial training and assignment to the XXXXXX, the claimant spent the rest of his military career in Bangladesh in intelligence services. He was assigned to the Army Military Unit. During his assignment, he was able to complete higher secondary education, necessary for further advancement. I believe that, promoted to the rank of sergeant, he was sent for training to the Military Academy (and not to do clerical work, as he testified). After completing his training, he was transferred back to the XXXXXXXXX, this time to the XXXXX. After two years of working in \"XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX\" in the infamous XXXXX Dhaka Military Cantonment, he was transferred to continue his XXXXXXXX work in XXXXX.\nIn his PIF, the claimant wrote that while working in the XXXXX, he had the opportunity to become familiar with the top-ranking officers in the army and the officers directly involved in the political activities of Mr. Ershad's Jatiya Party. The claimant was asked when he made these contacts. He said that it was during his assignment to the XXXXX in Dhaka. However, according to his earlier testimony, the claimant worked as a clerk in one of several buildings in the cantonment. Each building was fenced in and the claimant never went into any other building. He did not know what was going on there and what sections of the XXXXX occupied these buildings. How, in such circumstances, could a simple clerk have become familiar with top-ranking officers and politicians from the ruling party? The claimant answered that the top officers sometimes came to the place where he worked. He did not know why they came, maybe to see him working. They were not familiar with what he was doing. They just came to know about it. That explanation simply does not make any sense. It is obvious to me that if the claimant knew well top-ranking officers and Jatiya Party politicians, when he worked in the XXXXX headquarters in Dhaka, it is not because they were curious about a little clerk's job, but because the claimant was involved in what is the main purpose of the XXXXX, namely XXXXXXX of civilians perceived to be political activists:\n\"The Special Branch division of the XXXXX XXXXXX, and the Directorate XXXXXX XXXXXXXX (XXXXX) employ informers to report on citizens perceived to be political opponents of the Government and to conduct surveillance on them. Political leaders, human rights activists, foreign NGO's, and journalists report occasional harassment by these XXXXX organizations.\"21\nDuring the hearing, the claimant also testified that he did not know much about the functions of the XXXXX, its composition, and its organisation. I consider that the claimant pretended the lack of such knowledge in his general attempt to diminish his level of involvement with this organization. I found it implausible that after working for 17 years in the army, including six years in the XXXXX in its headquarters and abroad, he would not have such a basic knowledge.\nI believe that the claimant knowingly participated in the intelligence work of the XXXXX in Bangladesh, and when faced with the exclusion clause, lied about his real involvement, trying to portray his job as an administrative clerical position, without greater importance.\nThe same goes concerning his work and involvement in XXXXX. The claimant testified that his job there involved mainly assisting visiting officers and politicians, assuring their security, and helping them to make contacts with Bangladeshi nationals living in XXXXX. He also testified that he had to infiltrate the Bangladeshi community in XXXXX, in order to take care of the development of Bangladeshi there and assure that they were not involved in such activities that would defame Bangladesh. The claimant textually repeated that explanation several times during the hearing, giving the clear impression that he had learned it by heart. According to the claimant, the sole purpose of his spying on the Bangladesh community in XXXXX was to prevent criminal activities, such as drug dealing or trafficking in women and other people.\nHowever, not only this testimony contradicts his written narrative concerning his functions in XXXXX, but also it is contradicted by the documentary evidence. In his PIF, the claimant indicates that XXXXXX was used as a stopover by ousted politicians and top military officers forcibly retired under the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) government, which succeeded the Ershad's regime. These people were even having political activities in XXXXXX.\nI do agree with the Minister's counsel when she writes that, in this context and given the mandate of the XXXXX, its reputation and political purposes, as well as the presence in XXXXXX of high officials of the opposition parties involved in political activities, it is unlikely that the claimant would have been concerned only with criminal activities. It is particularly implausible because, according to the claimant's testimony, there were only two XXXXX people stationed in XXXXX, the claimant and his superior, head of the Embassy XXXXXXX Section, XXXXXXXXXX, both disguised as civil consular employees.\nKnowledge\nWhat and when did the claimant learn about abuses committed by the XXXXX, and XXXXXX in general?\nIn his Port of Entry declaration,22 the claimant wrote that he feared persecution from the Army XXXXXX Unit. He was asked to explain why. He testified that when he worked there, he heard, sometimes from the soldiers, sometimes from the newspapers, that people were sometimes persecuted by the Army XXXXXXXUnit and by the XXXXX. He learned that many people were apprehended and persecuted, that they were beaten in such a way that some of them died and some became insane. Later on during the hearing, the claimant testified that he learned that only when he was transferred to the XXXXX in Dhaka. He said that shortly after he was transferred, he heard from the mouth of soldiers about the torture. He also read about it in the papers. He textually repeated his earlier testimony, stating that when XXXXX people caught someone, they tortured in such a way that the person either dies or becomes insane or depressed. He added that once a person is blacklisted in the books of the XXXXX, he could not explain the situation he or she will have to face at the hands of the XXXXX. That is why the claimant knows that if he were apprehended by the XXXXX people, he would be tortured as an animal, and if he died, they would not care.\nThe claimant also demonstrated in his PIF that he knew that the XXXXX tortured people during investigation. He wrote:\n\"He also told me that I was lucky that there were no arrangements for interrogation cells in the Embassy (or maybe more appropriately called torture chambers).\"\nAnd further down:\n\"It was thus better for (me) not to come back due to the treatment that is reserved for \"traitors\" such as me. After receiving these messages, I was scared for my life since as part of intelligence forces, I understood that I would be tortured and treated as less than an animal.\"\nIt is clear to me, based on the documentary evidence, that the XXXXX uses torture as a method of interrogation of suspected politicians, students, and other civilians. Based on his testimony and on his PIF, it is clear to me that the claimant was well aware of these practices.\nIt is also clear to me that not only was he aware of these practices, but he knew that some of the people, including criminals, on whom he was spying in XXXXX and on whom he wrote reports to his superior, had a serious risk of being arrested and tortured by the XXXXX when they went back to Bangladesh. The claimant's testimony as to the treatment of such people was devoid of all credibility and simply did not make sense.\nThe claimant testified that his role in XXXXX was, among others, to make sure that people doing bad things and defaming the name of Bangladesh would stop doing so. He would tell them to stop doing such bad things, and if they did not, he would write a report on them and submit it to his superior, Mr. XXXXX, who in turn would send it to the headquarter in Dhaka. He was asked if he knew what was happening to these people when they returned to Bangladesh. He testified that most of these people would not return, but that, due to his intervention, they would stop their bad activities. The claimant was also asked if he knew what happened to those who returned to Bangladesh. After several evasive answers, he admitted that they would be investigated by the XXXXX and that the appropriate action would be taken.\nHowever, the claimant insisted that nothing would really happen to these people. They would just be asked by the XXXXX to stop such activities. The claimant said that he did not believe that the XXXXX can put anyone in jail or hang, since there is not enough evidence against these people. I do not give these explanations any credence, particularly considering the reputation of the XXXXX and the methods it uses. It simply does not make sense that hardcore criminals, such as drug smugglers and criminals trafficking in women and other people, would stop their activities just because the claimant told them that it was bad and that it defamed the good name of Bangladesh. I do not believe that such people, when they returned to Bangladesh, would be invited to the XXXXX in order to be nicely told to stop their criminal activities. It is inconsistent with the methods used by the police and security apparatus in Bangladesh, and the claimant knew it very well. He knew that by reporting on these people, he was directly exposing them to a danger to their lives and to a danger of cruel and unusual treatment, which should not be reserved even to the hardcore criminals.\nTowards the end of the hearing, when the claimant was asked to explain why he did not leave the XXXXX when he learned about the torture, he suddenly changed his testimony. He stated that he knew about the torture, but that it took place under General Zia, in 1977, and that he did not hear about anybody being tortured and killed when General Ershad was in power. The claimant could not reasonably explain why then he had testified earlier that in 1987, when he learned about torture committed by the XXXXX, he wanted to leave the army, if the crimes had been committed ten years before, under a different government. Altogether, this new and clearly improvised declaration contradicted large parts of his earlier testimony and his written narrative, and simply did not make any sense.\nIn conclusion, I consider that the Minister has established that the claimant knowingly participated in the surveillance of and spying on political opponents and criminals on behalf of the XXXXX in Bangladesh and in XXXXXX, and by doing so, he was exposing them to a danger to their lives and to a danger of torture. As an informer, the claimant knew all along that the XXXXX tortured and killed people on a regular basis, and that there was a serious possibility that the persons he reported on, would be apprehended, tortured, and even killed.\nFailure to dissociate\nThe claimant was asked why, when he learned about people being tortured by the XXXXX, he did not leave the army. He said that he could not quit, since it would have been considered as desertion, and his life would then have been in danger. The claimant admitted that he could have asked to be dismissed from the army, but he would have had to explain the reasons. However, in 1988, the claimant was sent to XXXXXX. He was asked why he did not quit the army right after he left Bangladesh, but instead he continued working for the XXXXX in XXXXX for four years and a half. The claimant's answer was straightforward and clear:\n\"I had a wonderful life. I did not want to flee.\"\nThis answer explains everything. The claimant was very happy to continue working for the XXXXX as long as it was good for him, regardless of the crimes committed by this organisation, crimes to which he had knowingly contributed. He only decided to leave when he was afraid that he could be subjected to the same treatment to which he had exposed other people, whom he had reported to the XXXXX. What was good for them was not good for the claimant himself. He knew that the XXXXX tortured and even killed people, and did not ask them politely to stop their activities.\nThe claimant did not dissociate himself from the XXXXX at the earliest safe opportunity (his and his family's arrival in Bangkok in 1988). He had a safe opportunity to flee and he failed to do so. He decided to flee only when he decided that, for whatever reason, his own security was allegedly in danger.\nConsidering all the above, I conclude that the Minister has met his burden of proof in establishing that there are serious reasons to believe that:\n\"(...) the claimant has been a full and knowing participant, providing essential support functions to an organisation which is held responsible for large-scale, widespread violations of human rights, more particularly, by reporting on civilians to the XXXXX, which he knew was torturing and killing people as a regular part of its operations, with the knowledge that there was a distinct possibility that harm could be done to these people.\"\nI therefore conclude that the claimant, as an accomplice, must be held responsible of the commission of crimes against humanity, and must therefore be excluded from the benefits of Canada's protection, under Section 1F(a).\nThe Minister has also established that the claimant should be excluded under Section 1F(c), by being guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations, since he was an accomplice of the XXXXX, who, according to his own testimony and documentary evidence, has been regularly using torture and other cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatments against political activists and other civilians, acts contrary to Article 2 of the Convention Against Torture, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 9, 1975.\nDECISION\nFor all the above reasons, I conclude that pursuant to Section 98 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the claimant, Mr. XXXXXXXXXX, should be excluded from the benefits of Canada's protection, as specified under Sections 96 and 97(1)a) and b), since there are serious reasons to consider that he has committed crimes against humanity and that he has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations (Sections 1F(a) and 1F(c) of the Refugee Convention), when he was serving at the XXXXX in XXXXXXX and in XXXXXX from 1987 to 1993.\nBarbara Berger\nBarbara Berger\nOctober 8, 2002\nDate\n\/jcbo\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C.

He lived in the Emirates his whole life, and his family still lives there.\nUpon finishing his secondary schooling there in 1999, the claimant left XXXXXXX to come study in Canada. After comparing the costs of the private universities in the Emirates with those of the Canadian universities, the claimant decided to register in a Canadian university and chose XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.\nDuring his second year of study at XXXXXXX, and after having spent his vacation with his parents in December 2000 and January 2001, the claimant's father told him that he could no longer continue to pay for his studies because of his responsibility to provide for the other children in the family, and because of the failing health of the claimant's sick grandparents living in Lebanon. From then on, the claimant had to support himself and pay for his studies himself.\nSuddenly forced to quit his studies for financial reasons, the claimant maintained that he had no choice but to go to Lebanon to live in the Palestinian refugee camp \"XXXXXXXX,\" where his father came from and where his grandparents were living. He maintained that returning would endanger his safety and his life, since the various political factions in the camps would immediately pressure him to take part in their terrorist activities. He maintained that he would have to refuse, and that his refusal would be interpreted as a political stand against the group concerned and in favour of another, which would endanger his life.\nThe claimant also maintained that he would be persecuted by Lebanon because it discriminates against refugees, providing them with limited employment opportunities and inadequate medical care.\nMoreover, the claimant maintained that he could not return to his family living in XXXXXXX in the Arab Emirates because any individual 18 years of age and over who does not hold a work permit or is not registered as a full-time student cannot obtain residence in the country.\nThe claimant returned to Canada for the third time on January 10, 2001 and claimed refugee status on April 26, 2001.\nANALYSIS\nAfter carefully examining the claimant's refugee claim, the panel has come to the conclusion that he is neither a \"Convention refugee\" nor a \"person in need of protection\" for reasons relating to the Convention Against Torture or because he would be subject to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he returned to his country of habitual residence.\nCountry of habitual residence\nThe claimant alleged persecution by both the United Arab Emirates and Lebanon. The panel was therefore required to briefly review in the hearing room the principles of the Convention,1 which set out that the term \"refugee,\" when referring to stateless persons, applies to individuals who are outside the country of their former habitual residence due to events that caused them to flee and who are unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.2\nThe panel thus pointed out to the claimant and his counsel that, since the claimant had spent most of his life in XXXXXXX and had never really lived elsewhere, the Emirates therefore constituted his habitual residence.3 Moreover, since he had not lived in Lebanon, he could not consider it to be \"another\" permanent residence4 and claim persecution by this country. The panel therefore examined the grounds on which the claimant alleged persecution because it was impossible to return to the country of his habitual residence, namely, the United Arab Emirates.\nPersecution by the United Arab Emirates\nThe claimant explained that he had no rights in the Emirates, despite the fact that he was born there. He could obtain neither citizenship nor even permission to live there because he was now over 18 years of age, was not registered as a full-time student in any educational institution and did not have a job there. He stated that these combined restrictions were persecutory and prevented him from returning to live with his family.\nThe panel does not share the claimant's conclusions and does not feel that the conditions of return imposed by the government of the Emirates were persecutory, as the claimant alleged.\nRegarding the right to nationality or citizenship, the application of the JUS SANGUINIS or JUS SOLI principle is a legal issue decided by individual countries and is not persecutory. Many countries apply one or the other, or even both. Not automatically obtaining the nationality of a country by being born on its soil is not, in our opinion, a breach of a fundamental right any more than not obtaining it by filiation. On this point, the panel cannot accept the claimant's arguments that his inability to obtain nationality in the United Arab Emirates was a form of persecution against him. These are the laws of the country, and they apply to all foreigners living there, regardless of their origin.\nMoreover, contrary to what he indicated in his narrative, the claimant admitted at the hearing that he could return to the country of his habitual residence to see his family, but only on a temporary visitor's visa for a few months. To obtain a residence permit for a longer duration, he would have to be a full-time student or be working for a private or state company. The panel does not feel that these conditions are a breach of a fundamental right of the claimant. They constitute legal restrictions imposed by the country, likely in a legitimate attempt to regulate not only foreigners entering and leaving its territory, but also its attractive job market.\nIndeed, the claimant freely chose to come study in Canada, even though he could have stayed in XXXXXXX. He did not leave the country because of persecution. Moreover, he returned there a number of times. On this point, the document that he filed as P-10, namely, the cancellation of his residence permit, merely certified that the claimant had not been living in the country for some time and that he needed to make his own applications in the future, since he had reached adult age. It did not deny him re-entry to the country of his habitual residence on one of the grounds in the Convention and, consequently, does not a priori constitute persecution.5\nMoreover, as regards the financial situation of the claimant's family, the panel feels that there was no nexus between this point and any of the grounds in the Convention.6\nConsequently, as to the persecution by the country of the claimant's habitual residence, the United Arab Emirates, the panel concludes that the claimant was not subject to any persecution in the past and would not be subject to any if he were to return. The case law is clear on this point. Mr. Justice Cullen's comments apply in the present case:\nFor stateless persons to be refugees they must be outside their country of habitual residence for the reasons listed in the Convention refugee definition. 7\nThis is clearly confirmed in the UNHCR's Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status:\nIt will be noted that not all stateless persons are refugees. They must be outside the country of their former habitual residence for the reasons indicated in the definition. Where these reasons do not exist, the stateless person is not a refugee. 8\nThe panel consequently does not believe that the claimant was persecuted in his country of habitual residence, or that he would be subject to persecution if he were to return there.\nPersecution by Lebanon\nAs mentioned above, the panel noted that the claimant had never lived in Lebanon. At most, he had vacationed there to visit his grandparents and other family members. In Maarouf, Mr. Justice Cullen expounds on the definition of \"country of habitual residence.\" His remarks read as follows:\nIn my view, the concept of \"former habitual residence\" seeks to establish a relationship to a state which is broadly comparable to that between a citizen and his or her country of nationality. Thus the term implies a situation where a stateless person was admitted to a given country with a view to continuing residence of some duration, without necessitating a minimum period of residence. 9\nTherefore, regarding the claimant's alleged persecution by Lebanon, since he never established \"continuing residence of some duration\" in this country, he cannot consider it to be his country of habitual residence. He cannot claim persecution by this country and cannot therefore be considered a \"Convention refugee\" from this country.\nCONCLUSION\nThe panel finds that, as a stateless person, the claimant did not establish a serious possibility of persecution in his country of habitual residence.\nDECISION\nThe panel consequently determines that the claimant, Mr. XXXXXXXXXXXXX, is not a \"Convention refugee\" or a \"person in need of protection\" for reasons relating to a danger of torture or a risk to his life, or because of a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. The panel dismisses his claim and concludes that there was no credible basis for his refugee claim, pursuant to section 107(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nJeannine Beaubien-Duque\nJeannine Beaubien-Duque\nSeptember 16, 2002\nDate\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - STATELESS PERSON - COUNTRY OF HABITUAL RESIDENCE - DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE - MALE - NEGATIVE - LEBANON - UNITED ARAB EMIRATES\nThe claimant alleged a well-founded fear of persecution in Lebanon by reason of imputed political opinion. The son of Palestinian parents who were refugees in Lebanon and working in the United Arab Emirates, the claimant was born in the latter country and lived there his entire life with his family before coming to Canada to study. Forced to abandon his studies for monetary reasons, the claimant stated that he no longer had the right to return to live in the Emirates. He had no other choice but to go and live in a Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon, which would put his safety and his life in danger. The panel was of the opinion that, since the claimant had spent most of his life in the Emirates and had never really lived anywhere else, this country was his country of former habitual residence. In addition, since he had not lived in Lebanon, he could not consider it \"another\" country of former habitual residence and claim persecution against that country. The claimant had testified that he had no rights in the Emirates despite the fact that he had been born there. He could not obtain citizenship or even reside there because he was now over 18 years of age, he was not enrolled in any school and he had no job. He alleged that all these restrictions, taken cumulatively, were of a persecutory nature and prevented him from returning there to live with his family. However, according to the panel, the conditions of return imposed by the Emirates government were not at all of a persecutory nature. They were legal restrictions imposed by the country, certainly with the legitimate purpose of controlling the entry and exit of foreigners to and from its territory. Moreover, the document submitted by the claimant was merely a declaration that the claimant had not lived in the country for some time and would have to make applications on his own behalf in future since he had reached the age of majority. It was not a refusal of return to the country of former habitual residence for a Convention ground and, consequently, was not a priori persecution. The panel determined that the claimant was not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection and that his claim for refugee protection had no credible basis. RPD MA1-04887, Beaubien-Duque, September 16, 2002.\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. (2001), c. 27, reads in part as follows:\n\"96. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,\n(a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or\n(b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.\"\n\"97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\n(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or\n(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.\"\n2 UNHCR's Handbook, January 1992, paragraph 6, subsections 101-105.\n3 Maarouf, Ayman v.

You say that you left your country on XXXXX, 2001, and after passing through Hungary, where you stayed for some eight days, you came to Canada to apply for refugee protection.\nYou are basing your claim for refugee protection on the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. You, Sir, are invoking your nationality. The female claimant, you, Madam, are citing your nationality and your membership in a social group, namely women victims of violence, and you are basing your daughter's claim on her nationality.\nAt the beginning of the hearing, you, Madam, were designated to represent your daughter, who is still a minor.\nWe should point out that at the start of the hearing, the panel, noting that your application for refugee protection only concerned the Convention, drew your lawyer's attention to the opportunity he had to invoke the grounds stipulated in section 97 of the new Act (the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act). However, he saw fit to limit your claim solely to the Convention ground.\nWe must also say that only you, Sir, produced an answer to Question 37 of your Personal Information Form (PIF). In that answer, you recount not only the incidents that you experienced, but also the incidents that your partner faced since she, like your daughter, is basing her claim for refugee protection on yours.\nSUMMARY OF ALLEGED FACTS\nIn support of your claim, you allege the following facts.\nYou a citizen of Romania, but of Gypsy origin, as is your common-law partner. This caused you many problems in your country.\nYou say, Sir, that in the child care centre and the elementary school, you were not wanted. You therefore had to quit school after the fourth grade. During your military service, you never received military training as such. You were limited to maintenance work, and in addition, you were beaten by the soldiers and by the other recruits. You had difficulty finding work. In your life, you were humiliated and beaten on several occasions.\nIn September 1998, while you were accompanying your common-law partner on the road leading to your home, you were approached by four men. They threatened you, Madam, with knives and raped you, taking turns, while threatening to kill you if you reported the matter to the police.\nYour brother was subsequently beaten, and died several days later of his injuries, more precisely in XXXXX 1999. And in March 2001, Molotov cocktails were thrown into your home, causing a fire which simply ruined everything.\nThese were the circumstances in which you left your country to come to Canada.\nThe decision that I have rendered concerns three points: your identities, your credibility and the validity of your refugee protection claim.\nIDENTITY\nIn light of the exhibits filed on the record and your own testimony, the panel declares itself satisfied with your identities not only as individuals, but also as persons of Gypsy origin. Your evidence was indeed completed today by Exhibit P-10,1 filed by your lawyer, which was precisely a document missing in your file.\nCREDIBILITY\nYou, Sir, testified at length about the facts that caused you to leave Romania and come to Canada. Your testimony did have some flaws. For example, I did not believe you when you said that you had been refused a passport in 1999 because your father, or you yourself, had tried in the past to leave your country illegally, or because you were of Gypsy origin.\nNonetheless, I did not think that this could taint your testimony to the point that I would reject it. I believe that in your case, you rather chose a Hungarian passport because with such a passport, one does not need a visa to come to Canada.\nConsequently, I consider that on the whole, in spite of the reservations I have mentioned, your testimony is credible.\nThe same may be said of your testimony, Madam, although it was very short.\nVALIDITY OF THE CLAIM\nYou explained how you were beaten on more than one occasion, and how your attempts to obtain a remedy from the police were never taken into consideration or resulted in any investigation. And in your case, Madam, the same thing happened after you suffered a sexual assault in September 1998, in the conditions we have already described.\nYou, Madam, explained that you went to the police station, where you were referred to an investigator specializing in rape cases. That individual did not even deign to receive your narrative of the facts, regarding you from the outset as a liar and demanding that you provide him with the names of your attackers, and also with witnesses. In the circumstances, this was impossible.\nWhen we look at the documentation on the status of Gypsies in Romania,2 at page 5 of Exhibit A-4, we note that it in fact discusses the many problems that Gypsies must face. Moreover, on page 41 of Exhibit A-5,3 these same problems are mentioned, problems of violence and even of excessive brutality on the part of the police.\nEven more important is the fact that Exhibit A-4,4 on page 3, speaks of the apathy, insensitivity or indifference of the police towards crimes committed against Gypsies. I believe that in general, we can say that there is discrimination against Gypsies, and occasionally violence as well.\nI believe that in your case, there was violence, not by the police of course. However, there was what we can call apathy or insensitivity on the part of the police, so that you were not able to benefit from the protection of the state in this particular case.\nIn light of all this, I think that you have proved, for the three of you, that you have a well-founded fear of persecution in the event of a return to your country.\nDECISION\nConsequently, the Board has determined that you, Mr. XXXXXXXX, Ms. XXXXXXXXXX and your daughter XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX are \"Convention refugees\"5 in accordance with section 96 of the Act.\nYves Boisrond\nMe Yves Boisrond\nJuly 30, 2002\nDate\n1 Exhibit P-10, copy of the driver's licence and translation.\n2 Exhibit A-4, Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 2001, page 5.\n3 Exhibit A-5, Romania, Country Information and Policy Unit, October 2001 (Country Assessment).\n4 Supra, No. 1, page 3.\n5 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C.

Her other two daughters, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, came to join her in XXXXX 2001, and in the days and weeks that followed, the claimant filed an asylum claim for herself and her three daughters. She alleged a well-founded fear of persecution in Mexico because they are members of a specific social group, that of the family and of women, who run the risk of family violence.\nThe claimant, XXXXXXXXXXXX, was designated as a representative for her minor daughters for the purposes of the hearing.\nThe evidence revealed that, for at least ten years, the claimant cohabited with her husband at his parents' house. She said she was constantly a victim of harassment, ill treatment and violence. She was considered a servant of sorts.\nUnfortunately, her husband was the victim of a car accident about five before, which made him disabled and incapable of working. This increased the dependency of the principal claimant and her family on their in-laws.\nThis abuse towards the principal claimant became worse when, in June 2001, the claimant caught her father-in-law trying to rape her eldest daughter, XXXXXX. The panel notes that XXXXXX attended the hearing, she is present. She is fourteen, and when her mother testified about the incident, the daughter's emotions corroborated her mother's testimony. Therefore, upon surprising her father-in-law, the claimant reacted as any woman and mother with common sense would. She took an iron and knocked out her father-in-law. Panic-stricken and intent on protecting her daughters, she left the house with the three girls and sought refuge several streets away, at the house of a woman for whom she worked part time as a servant.\nThe claimant said she received no news about her father-in-law's health, but the decision to leave and flee Mexico was made quite quickly. For economic reasons, the claimant could not buy four plane tickets; therefore, she decided to leave with her youngest daughter. Later on, her husband sold some furniture and found a way to pay for the fare for the two older daughters.\nThe copies of the passports in the file indicate that the father consented to his minor children's departure. As a whole, the testimony and the evidence indicate that the mother was a victim of violence, as well as the eldest daughter, and that it was with the goal of protecting her daughter that the mother attacked her father-in-law. The mother explained that over the past years, she endured the violence because she was scared of eventually ending up on the street with her three daughters.\nBased on the documentary evidence, it is evident that the context of Mexico must be taken into account to understand the fear of the principal claimant of finding herself penniless, with three children to feed, educate and protect.\nAfter analysing all the documentary evidence, hearing the principal claimant's testimony and considering everything, the panel came to the following conclusions.\nThe first issue is whether or not the objective fear of the claimant is well founded and if, as a member of the social group of women in Mexico, she is right to believe that she risks persecution if she returns there. The panel is of the opinion that, in this kind of case, it cannot analyze all the principles that govern the rights of refugees, without taking into account the claimant's particular problem.\nShe stated that she did not report the incident to the police over the past years. It is reasonable and completely logical to believe that, after the incident of aggression of the father-in-law towards her daughter, given that the principal claimant had just attacked him, she did not go to the police for protection. The panel is even under the impression that the fear of possibly having killed or severely hurt her father-in-law was probably the claimant's main motivation for leaving the country.\nRegarding what arises from the text in response to question 37 of her Personal Information Form (PIF), the claimant was questioned about the way the facts were related. At first glance, the text was submitted before the arrival of her daughters and after the claimant found out that her father-in-law was not dead. However, the panel understands that the claimant wrote her text in Spanish before knowing her father-in-law's state of health. Further, it can definitely be interpreted that, in her text, she described the psychological state she was in when she left Mexico, because at that time she did not yet know what the father-in-law's state of health was after the tremendous blow she had dealt him with the iron.\nThe claimant now says that the father-in-law has recovered. However, there is no indication that he had made a complaint to the police or that he would if the claimant returned to Mexico.\nThis element is probably not relevant, because the documentary evidence clearly indicates that about 80% of domestic violence cases, of which this is one, since the claimant lived with her in-laws, are not reported to the authorities.\nExhibit A-6, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices 2001, in the chapter on Women, on page 20, states that only one in six victims seeks help from the authorities. The report also mentions that over 1 million women in Mexico each year seek emergency medical treatment for injuries caused by a spouse or member of the household. Both statistical reports state that there are between fifty and sixty complaints to police stations throughout the country each day. Further, the same documentary evidence and more specifically Exhibit A-11, Response to an information request No. MEX33700.E, from February 2000 (filed jointly), which refers to violence against women-a document that, in my opinion, is still current-addresses the possibility of protection for the victims of spousal abuse. The document states that, although since 1997 Mexican legislation has gone so far as to criminalize crimes of domestic violence, it seems that judges and police are the two main obstacles in implementing these laws and effectively punishing sexual crimes and crimes of violence. The evidence explains that, even today, the police do not seem to take complaints seriously because there is an old prejudice that family affairs are private and do not concern society in general. Furthermore, due most likely to their inherent conservatism, Mexican judges assess the problem in a conservative manner, which would explain why five out of six women do not even report abuse in the home to the police.\nBased on these elements, the context allows the panel to conclude that, although protection exists theoretically in the legislation and the rules, in practice, this protection seems rather inadequate and ineffective, especially in disadvantaged environments and working-class neighbourhoods.\nEarlier, the panel stated that the claimant's motivation for fleeing was probably the fear of being accused of physically assaulting her father-in-law. At this point, she says that her fear of returning is linked more to the fact that the family would continue to harass her. She says this because she does not want to return to live with that family, with good reason. However, her fear seems less evident because she could no doubt live far away from the family. Nevertheless, the new problem that the claimant would face is the fact that she would be alone with three minor daughters in Mexico, where the general context and conditions of society scare her.\nThe documentary evidence indicates that there is a very high rate of violence towards women in general. At the end of Exhibit A-11 for example, there is a document entitled Standing Fast in Mexico Protecting Women's Rights in a Hostile Climate, a report by NACLA. This document describes women who are the heads of single-parent families, which is the claimant's case, who are obligated to earn a living to feed their children. It also explains that Mexico is not well equipped with centres and schools to take care of children while the women work and that, at work, they are often the object of discrimination and violence. It states that, since the beginning of the 1990s, some two hundred young women per year are killed in certain industrial cities and that the local authorities do not investigate these murders, as if to say, \"just another woman was murdered.\"\nSeveral incidents of abuse in the workplace are described. Employers will even go as far as to ensure that a woman is not pregnant, and pregnant women are never hired in some industries, because they will eventually have to leave the job. These are all examples of a society to which we could not imagine the claimant returning with three young girls. The chapter on children in Country Reports on Human Rights Practices states that abuse of young children, either in prostitution or trafficking, is a major problem in Mexico.\nIn other words, the panel is aware of the context, present and past, of the claimant who, I think, must no longer fear being accused of assaulting her father-in-law. Nor should she fear the prospect of finding herself in a fragile situation as a woman with a teenager and two young girls, where she would continue to be the victim of major abuse of her fundamental rights and the rights of her three daughters.\nGiven that her three minor children are also claimants, the panel emphasizes that the Convention on the Rights of the Child, signed by Canada, stipulates that the decision-maker, whether it is a judicial officer, a police officer, a commissioner or a judge, when it is a question of children's rights, must give primary importance to the interests of the child. Because the three young girls are evidently part of a social group of young women who are members of a single-parent family in Mexico, the panel does not believe that it would be in their interest to return to Mexico in the near future.\nFor these reasons, the panel concludes that the claimant established the main elements of her claim for refugee protection for herself and her three minor daughters, because the panel found her testimony to be credible on the whole. Her testimony was corroborated by her daughter's non-verbal language, which was also a major element in the decision.\nCONCLUSION\nFor all these reasons, the panel finds that XXXXXXXXXXXX and her daughters, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, are \"Convention refugees.\"\nGilles \u00c9thier\nGilles \u00c9thier\nAugust 26, 2002\nDate\n\/np\nNo. dossier SPR \/ RPD file #: MA1-07954\nMA1-07955 MA1-09897 MA1-09898\n2\n",

The claimant seeks \"refugee status\"1 based on her membership in a social group, namely, women forced into arranged marriages. Furthermore, she maintains that she is a \"person in need of protection\"2 because her life would be in danger, or she would be subject to cruel or unusual treatment or punishment in the Republic of Djibouti.\nTHE FACTS\nThe claimant was born in Ali Sabieh in the Republic of Djibouti on XXXXX, 1984, and is part of the ISSA-FOURLABA ethnic group. The claimant alleges that she was circumcised at age nine. In June 2001, at the end of the school year, her father informed her that she would not return to school because she had been promised in marriage to his long-time friend, XXXXXXXX, age 50. The claimant's father is a XXXXXXX and runs a retail store. He allegedly promised his youngest daughter in marriage to pay off a large sum he owed to his friend, XXXXXXXXX, a loan that he had contracted to buy animals for his business. In order that he not be dishonoured, the claimant's father dismissed all the claimant's protests.\nInformed of her husband's plans, the claimant's mother, after trying in vain to change her husband's decision, made arrangements so that her daughter could leave the country and escape the forced marriage planned for her, even though it meant facing her husband's violent reaction.\nThe claimant left Djibouti on XXXXX, 2001, and arrived in Canada on August 17, 2001, seeking refugee status the same day.\nThe panel finds that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is a refugee because there exists a reasonable chance of persecution if she had to return to the Republic of Djibouti.\nANALYSIS\nThe claimant's testimony was difficult, arduous and very strained, which the panel explains by the claimant's young age and low level of education. The claimant arrived in Canada without papers when she was only 17 years old. One month after her arrival, the claimant contacted her mother in the Republic of Djibouti so that her mother could send her proof of identity. The claimant produced a birth certificate filed as Exhibit P-2. The claimant does not have a valid passport from the Republic of Djibouti, an identity card, or any diploma. The only document that she could produce for the panel was her birth certificate. The Refugee Protection Officer (RPO) asked several questions about the Republic of Djibouti and the claimant's answers were satisfactory. The panel concludes that the claimant is a citizen of the Republic of Djibouti.\nThe documentary evidence, particularly Exhibit A-16,3 shows that forced marriages exist among the Issas of the Republic of Djibouti. Girls as young as 13 are offered in marriage. It specifically states the following:\n[Translation]\n\"??? Girls who oppose forced marriages find themselves in a tragic situation. According to the counsel, they have no other recourse but to flee the family home to seek refuge with distant relatives, live in dangerous parts of cities, or find employment in the city as cleaning ladies. He added that, in desperation, some young women resort to suicide.\"\nAs explained above, the claimant's testimony was laborious, but credible. The claimant was particularly hesitant and nervous when asked about the traditions of her country and the excision that she had undergone in the past. The panel also noted some contradictions when the claimant testified that her sister, XXXXXX, was also forced into an arranged marriage. The panel explains these contradictions by the fact that the claimant was only nine at the time. However, when she spoke of her own meeting with her father, when he explained why he had accepted this arrangement, her testimony became much clearer and more direct. The panel appreciates the claimant's youth and innocence and finds it entirely plausible that, faced with settling a pressing debt, the claimant's father offered the claimant in marriage to his creditor, despite his wife's disagreement. It is also plausible that her mother kept utterly secret all her arrangements to enable her youngest daughter to flee the Republic of Djibouti.\nThe claimant has been of age since XXXXXX, 2002, but she fled her country when she was a minor. From the claimant's testimony, it is obvious that the parting with her mother was very distressing. It is also evident that she misses her mother enormously. The panel has no reason to doubt what the claimant alleges to have lived through.\nTo this effect, the panel cites an extract from paragraphs 215 and 216 of the Handbook for Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status:4\n\"?...? a person of 16 or over may be regarded as sufficiently mature to have a well-founded fear of persecution.\n?...? a minor's mental maturity must normally be determined in the light of his personal, family and cultural background.\"\nFurthermore, the panel is of the opinion that the decision in Vidhani5 should be taken into consideration:\n\"?...? women who are forced into marriages against their will have had a basic human right violated. There are United Nations conventions to which Canada is a party which state that the right to enter freely into marriage is a basic human right.\"\nThe panel also wishes to refer to one of the Guidelines Issued by the Chairperson,6 which lists four general categories of women who are at risk of persecution. The fourth category is described as follows:\n\"Women who fear persecution as the consequence of failing to conform to, or for transgressing, certain gender-discriminating religious or customary laws and practices in their country of origin. Such laws and practices, by singling out women and placing them in a more vulnerable position than men, may create conditions for the existence of a gender-defined social group. The religious precepts, social traditions or cultural norms which women may be accused of violating can range from choosing their own spouses instead of accepting an arranged marriage, to such matters as the wearing of make-up, the visibility or length of hair, or the type of clothing a woman chooses to wear.\"\nThe documentary evidence indicates that protection from the State is non-existent. In this regard, Exhibit A-167 states as follows:\n[Translation]\n\"??? in principle, there exist laws against such practices. However, they are not applied and no authority dares to intervene in the traditional practices for fear of \"social disruption.\"\nThe panel also considers that no internal flight alternative was available to the claimant. In the Republic of Djibouti, a small country where culture and religion are a very important, it is illusory to think that at age 17, the claimant could have escaped from her marriage.\nConsidering all of the above, the panel determines that Ms. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is a \"Convention refugee,\" as defined in section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nMe Ruth Delisle\nMe Ruth Delisle\nAugust 19, 2002\nDate\n1 \"96.

She claims refugee status on the ground that she risks being killed in her country by a young hoodlum whom she saw commit a murder. She alleges that she belongs to the social group of \"women who are victims of threats and violence in Costa Rica,\" and that, by reason of her membership in this particular group, she risks persecution in her country.\nThe claimant also claims to be a person in need of protection because of the young hoodlum's death threats against her.\nALLEGED FACTS\nThe claimant worked in a small XXXX in Cartago. She often finished work very late because she had to close the cash. Around 11:30 p.m. on XXXX, 2001, she was waiting alone at the bus stop, which was two blocks away from the XXXX, for the last bus to take her home.\nShe saw two young men whom she recognized because they sometimes begged her for stale bread. They had a bad reputation in the neighbourhood, and she described them as \"drug addicts.\" One was named XXXXXX and the other XXXXXX.\nSeeing that they seemed to be arguing, the claimant tried to go unnoticed, moving away a few dozen metres. Suddenly, she heard a gunshot. Turning around, she saw XXXXXX fall to the ground and XXXXXX run away.\nThe claimant went home in a taxi and related to her parents what had happened. They told her not to tell anyone because of the bad reputation of XXXXXX and his gang of hoodlums.\nTwo weeks later, XXXXXX came into the XXXX and threatened her, telling her to keep quiet if she wanted to ensure she and her family stayed alive.\nShe stated that she had no further direct contact with XXXXXX, except that he would sometimes pass in front of the XXXXXX. However, in August 2001 she started receiving anonymous threats over the telephone and in letters, ordering her to keep quiet if she did not want her two children to be killed.\nThe claimant obtained a passport on XXXXX, 2001 and fled Costa Rica on XXXXX, 2001. She arrived in Canada that same day but did not ask for international protection until September 17, 2001.\nThe claimant stated that she never filed a complaint with the Costarican police because she was afraid that XXXXXX would retaliate. She stated that she could not have lived safely in another part of Costa Rica because it is a very small country and, since she was the sole supporter of her two children and her parents, she did not have the means to leave her house in Cartago and then rent a place in San Juan or elsewhere.\nISSUES TO BE RESOLVED\nAre the claimant's statements credible?\nDoes the claimant belong to a \"particular social group\" within the meaning given by the Supreme Court of Canada in Ward?i Does she risk persecution by reason of her affiliation with this group?\nIf not, does she meet all of the criteria set out in section 97(1)ii in order to be recognized as a person in need of protection?\nANALYSIS\n1- Identity\nThe claimant satisfactorily established her identity by submitting her passport and national identity card as evidence.\n2- Credibility\nThe claimant testified convincingly: she gave precise answers and her written narrative did not contradict her oral testimony.\nHowever, at first glance, it did not seem plausible that the young hoodlum, XXXXXX, would have waited two weeks before warning the claimant against any attempt to compromise or expose him. Was it not in the murderer's best interest to quickly ensure the silence of the only eyewitness to his crime? Similarly, it does not seem very logical to believe that he would have waited five months before threatening her again, as there does not seem to have been any reason for a sudden series of threats after such a long time. And this series of anonymous calls and letters on an almost daily basis, between XXXX, 2001 and the date the claimant left the country on XXXXX, 2001 is like a scene from an operetta because this uninterrupted flood of threats, strangely enough, is in stark contrast to the earlier silence of the persecuting agent.\nHowever, taking into consideration the claimant's obvious sincerity, there is reason to give her the benefit of the doubt regarding the alleged facts, despite reservations based on what seem to be exaggerations about the threats.\nThe panel therefore accepts that the claimant witnessed a murder; that she said nothing to the police and that her life was threatened by a young hoodlum from Cartago, who would certainly not want to go to prison.\n3- Membership in a social group\nThrough her lawyer, the claimant submitted that she was a member of the particular social group of \"women who are victims of threats and violence in Costa Rica\" and that she risked persecution by reason of this membership.\nIt is true that the documentary evidence produced indicates to what point violence against women, especially domestic violence, constitutes a serious problem in Costa Rica, a country that is, moreover, highly renowned for its democratic values and the genuine efforts of the authorities and institutions in respecting human rights. Documents A-4 and A-12 provide ample evidence of this.\nNevertheless, even though Costa Rica's situation illustrates the vulnerability of women in a society that is still very chauvinistic, this case has nothing in common with a typical case of domestic violence. Here, the claimant is in danger because a murderer does not want to be betrayed. She is personally targeted because of her actions, because she witnessed a crime being committed.\nIn considering everything from the persecutor's point of view, one has to conclude that the claimant was targeted simply because she was an unwanted witness, and not because she belonged to a group.\nClaiming that the claimant is affiliated with the group of women who are victims of threats and violence in Costa Rica amounts to saying that she risks persecution because she is a victim of persecution, whereas, in Canadian law, it is now well established that the persecution must be based on the affiliation with a social group, and not that the social group must be made up of persecuted persons. It is the membership in the social group that must give rise to the persecution.\nTherefore, according to all the evidence, the claimant does not risk being persecuted based on the fact that she is a member of a group, because her problem is too individual in nature.\nShe is afraid of revenge or criminal pressure directed at her, but not persecution within the meaning of the definition of a refugee.\n4- Protection\nEven if there existed a nexus with one of the five grounds for persecution, the claimant could not qualify as a refugee because she did not seek the protection that is assumed to have been available in her country, since she never made a complaint to the authorities.\nShe alleged that she did not do this because she was afraid of XXXXXX, who, she said, was part of the mafia. When she was asked to provide more details about this, she stated that XXXXXX's gang of hoodlums included three girls and five guys.\nThe panel considers that this is not a mafia and that a gang of delinquent youths such as this did not likely constitute an insurmountable problem for the police in her country.\n5- Risk to life\nAll of the evidence presented by the claimant leads to the conclusion that a number of the requirements of section 97(1)(b) defining a person in need of protection applied in her case, except for the major requirement regarding the need to be subject to a risk to her life in every part of her country, according to subparagraph (ii) of section 97(1)(b) and, as noted above, the fact that she did not seek the protection of her country.\nThe claimant was personally issued a death threat. Because of this threat, she does not want to return to her country. Other people from her country are not usually faced with such a threat, and it is certainly not the result of lawful sanctions or deficiencies in health or medical care.\nHowever, considering the person who issued the death threat against the claimant, it is very difficult to believe that this threat would exist everywhere in that country. In fact, according to the evidence, this individual is a young drug-using hoodlum from a Cartago neighbourhood who begs for bread, hassles the local people and enjoys scaring young schoolgirls, according to what the claimant said. Of course, he allegedly killed one of his friends, but can we believe that he would be capable of following the claimant all over Costa Rica? The evidence presented is far from being reasonably convincing in this respect, especially as the claimant herself never tried to get protection from the police in her country.\nThe claimant pointed out that she needed to work at the XXXXXX as the sole supporter of her family, that it would have been difficult to find a well-paying job elsewhere, considering the economic conditions of the country, and that she did not have the financial means to give up her house in Cartago and find rental accommodation in a big city or elsewhere in Costa Rica.\nApart from the fact that she nevertheless undertook an expensive trip to Canada, this argument is not relevant in this case because, with regard to subparagraph (ii) of section 97(1)(b), the real test is to determine whether the claimant faces a risk to her life everywhere in her country. If she does not establish that this is the case, and it turns out that she is not reasonably subject to this risk everywhere in Costa Rica, the claimant will have failed in her claim. On this point, the Act places emphasis on facing a risk to life in every part of that country, and not on whether it was reasonably convenient and safe to seek protection elsewhere in that country.\nThe evidence does not therefore allow us to conclude that the claimant has discharged the burden of proof on her to establish all the facts required to be recognized as a person in need of protection under section 97(1)(b).\n6- Torture\nThe above determination is strengthened by the fact that nothing in the evidence allows us to conclude that the claimant would risk torture in Costa Rica, within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture.\nDETERMINATION\nFor these reasons, the panel determines that the claimant, Ms. XXXXXXXXXXXXXX, is not a \"Convention refugee\" or a \"person in need of protection.\"\nGilles \u00c9thier\nMe Gilles \u00c9thier\nAugust 27, 2002\nDate\ni Canada (Attorney General) v.

They claim that they have a well-founded fear of being persecuted in their country by the XXXXXX XXXXX XXXXXXX and his men, for the following reasons: the political opinion imputed to the principal claimant; the membership of the claimants in a particular social group, namely the family; and their membership in a particular social group, namely women. Furthermore, they claim that they are \"persons in need of protection\" because their life would be threatened or they would be at risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nALLEGATIONS\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXX was a member of the former Fujimori party. A XXXXX affiliated with the police, he was involved in illegal work, practising terror by murdering people. He was a member of the same family as the principal claimant's husband and father of the principal claimant's daughter.\nThe principal claimant went to the United States to buy merchandise that would have enabled her to set up a business in her country. When she returned, she found XXXXXXXXXXXXXX in her home. According to her husband, XXXXXXXX was going to spend a few days with them. The claimant refused because XXXXXXXX was regarded as a person involved in irregular dealings. XXXXXXXXXXXXXX said disgraceful things to the claimant, declaring that it was his money that she had used in the United States. For his part, the claimant's ex-husband punched her in the face.\nThe claimant subsequently had other problems. XXXXXXXXXXXXXX's people beat her, and her husband informed her that he was going to leave the country and that she should be on her guard. The claimant then decided to leave her country and go to the United States.\nShe left Peru on XXXXX 2001 for the United States. She remained there until XXXXXX, 2001 and then arrived in Canada on October 20, 2001.\nPRELIMINARY AND INCIDENTAL PROCEEDINGS\nThe panel designated the principal claimant as representative of her minor daughter.\nDuring the hearing, counsel for the claimants stated that certain questions asked by the Refugee Protection Officer (RPO) were too vague and that the claimants were unable to answer them properly. The panel allowed counsel the necessary time to produce evidence in support of this statement. Counsel declined the invitation, but when the panel insisted, counsel's concerns were clarified. The panel insisted on this out of a concern for natural justice and transparency. It was important that all the points concerning the claimants be heard.\nFurthermore, an important sentence had been omitted in the French translation of Question 37 of the Personal Information Form (PIF), and the panel therefore insisted that the words of the claimant be checked in the original, with the assistance of the interpreter. The paragraph was translated during the hearing, and it was clarified that the claimant had stated, in the original, that she had been beaten and attacked by her husband, but that this fact had not been mentioned in the [French] text of the answer to Question 37.\nDETERMINATION\nThe Refugee Protection Division (RPD) has concluded that the claimants have not produced enough evidence to establish that they personally come within the definition of \"Convention refugee,\"1 pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act or of \"person in need of protection\"2 pursuant to sections 97(1)(a) and (b) of the Act.\nANALYSIS\nThe identities of the claimants as Peruvian nationals have been established by the copies of their passports and by the principal claimant's identity card. These documents were retained by Immigration.\nIn her representations, the RPO raised a number of points showing that the principal claimant lacked credibility. Given the concern of counsel for the claimants, who declared that the questions were too vague and that the answers given could thereby be affected, the panel has decided, in making its decision, to take into account, in particular, the questions that the panel itself put to the claimant.\nThe panel's negative determination is essentially based on two considerations: state protection; and an internal flight alternative within Peru if the claimant really did not feel safe in Lima.\nAccording to the panel's assessment, the documentary evidence establishes that there is a legal and judicial system in Peru capable of protecting the nationals of that country. In particular, there is a police force, an army and courts. While a presumption does exist that states are able to protect their nationals, the claimant was free, in accordance with the law, to rebut this presumption of protection by producing clear and convincing evidence. On the basis of the evidence presented, including the documentary evidence on the current situation in the claimant's country, the panel finds that the claimant has not succeeded in rebutting this presumption. The claimant has not succeeded in establishing, in a clear and convincing manner, that the Peruvian state is unable to grant her the normal protection in effect in her country.\nFurthermore, because of the current situation in Peru and the circumstances of the former president, Fujimori, the claimant's persecutor, who was an important source of support for the Fujimori group, is himself in prison. In the panel's opinion, his men surely have better things to do than to go looking for the claimant. They are probably busy trying to hide and save their own lives.\nThe panel does not see why the claimant could not lay a complaint today against all the persons she fears, to help the government find them. That this is possible seems even more clear from the documentary evidence, which very clearly indicates that the government is offering assistance and protection to anyone who lays a complaint against corruption and against any individuals directly or indirectly involved in illegal business, of the kind in which XXXXXXXXXXXXXX was involved. The claimant was unable to offer any coherent explanations on this point.\nThere is a wealth of documentary evidence concerning all the individuals who have been prosecuted by the current Peruvian authorities for corruption. Whether these individuals are generals, whether they occupy high-ranking positions-indeed, whatever their position-the government has taken measures to find them and arrest them. Furthermore, all this documentary evidence, which the panel went over with the claimant, also mentions the protection that the authorities are offering to those who are helping, precisely, to find these individuals. The panel cannot rely on the claimant's answers because they are not reasonable.\nThe claimant alleged that she filed a complaint. In her complaint, however, she did not mention the name of her persecutor, XXXXXXXX, as the source of her problems. The panel does not see how the claimant could avail herself of the protection of the state without naming her persecutor, when she knew him perfectly well. The second complaint that she allegedly laid was against her ex-husband, but here again, the claimant did not indicate that this individual-whose name she in fact gives-is the father of her daughter and the person with whom she lived. There are special laws concerning conjugal violence, and assistance is given to victims of such violence. The panel does not see why the claimant failed to indicate this important fact. The panel does not find the claimant's answers to be satisfactory.\nFurthermore, even if the claimant had some fear of her alleged persecutor, her husband, she herself declared in her answer to Question 37 that he had left the country. Consequently, the claimant has not established in evidence that her husband would be a danger to her today if she were to return to her country.\nIn addition, if the claimant was experiencing some fear in Lima, the fact is that Peru has 25 million inhabitants. The panel estimated that the claimant, who speaks Spanish, who is educated and who wanted to open a shop in Lima, could have taken refuge in another city of Peru. Ms. XXXXX XXXXXX was asked what the second largest city in her country was, and why she could not go and settle there. The claimant stated that Arequipo is the second largest city, but that she could not live there because she did not have any friends there. She wanted to do business on the basis of her circle of friends, who were in Lima.\nThe claimant also said that she feared the criminal activity in Arequipo. However, at no time did she say that she would fear her alleged persecutors, who might find her in Arequipo. It was instead the general situation that she would fear. She said that in Arequipo, all the houses have iron bars on the windows because of the crime, and she would not want her daughter to be raised in that kind of ambiance.\nGiven the claimant's profile, the documentary evidence and the answers she gave, which show that she does not fear her alleged persecutors, the panel is of the opinion that the claimant could seek refuge elsewhere in Peru.\nConsequently, the panel finds that if the claimant were really afraid, she could not only avail herself of the protection of the authorities of her country, who are vigorously hunting down the ex-Fujimorists-a group to which her agents of persecution belong-but could also very well go and live in Arequipo, given her profile, since there is no indication in the documentary evidence that it is impossible for Peruvians to move around within their country. The claimant speaks Spanish, and because of her level of education, she would not have any problem finding work.\nFor the reasons stated above, the panel determines that the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. Consequently, the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejects their refugee protection claims.\nJoulekhan Pirbay\nJoulekhan Pirbay\nDecember 23, 2002\nDate\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, reads in part as follows:\n96.

In the summer of 1999, after he had prepared a report on a drug trafficker, he received a call on his cell phone, the confidential number of which was only known to a few of his colleagues at work. The caller said that he wanted the claimant to alter the file of the drug trafficker in question, an individual by the name of XXXXX, in return for which he would be paid a large bribe. If he did not alter the file, he would die.\nThe claimant later received other threats, to prevent him from testifying at XXXXXX preliminary inquiry.\nThe claimant did not dare to talk about these threats to his superiors, as he suspected that some of his colleagues were involved in the affair because his confidential number had been used and because it is well known that police officers are accomplices of drug traffickers in Colombia.\nFearing for his life and that of his wife, he decided to flee to the United States on XXXXX, 1999.\nHe settled in Florida and worked illegally to survive. However, he did not claim protection from the Americans because he was afraid of being sent back to his country.\nIn XXXXXXX 2001, he received bizarre telephone calls, in which the caller attempted to confirm who he was. In a panic, he contacted a former colleague who was a refugee in Canada. He set out for Canada and arrived at the Canadian border with his wife on November 6, 2001.\nANALYSIS\nBoth claimants have established their identity in a satisfactory manner.\nTheir counsel had failed to produce an official document confirming that the male claimant did indeed work as an XXXXXXXX with the XXXXXXX, although the claimant had given him this evidence in July 2002. This document was finally produced a few days after the hearing.\nThe male claimant and his wife seemed to me to be sincere and trustworthy. The claimant testified in a direct, frank and spontaneous manner. The claimants were found to be credible.\nThe only real issue to be determined is whether their lives would be at risk if they returned to Colombia.\nThe documentary evidence abundantly reveals the very high level of widespread violence that is currently rampant in Colombia. There is no doubt that XXXXXXX working for the XXXXX, like the male claimant, are at risk of being killed by drug traffickers, corrupt police officers or armed groups involved in the drug trade.\nHundreds of assassinations of public officials show that there is no state protection for anyone in Colombia. It therefore appears obvious that the claimant and his wife would be subject to a risk to their lives everywhere in their country.\nCONCLUSION\nFor these reasons, I determine that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX are \"persons in need of protection\", pursuant to section 97(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and I therefore accept their claim for refugee protection.\nGilles \u00c9thier\nMe Gilles \u00c9thier\nNovember 4, 2002\nDate\nKEYWORDS - STATE PROTECTION - RISK TO LIFE AND RISK OF CRUEL AND UNUSUAL TREATMENT OR PUNISHMENT - POSITIVE - MALE - COLOMBIA\nNo. dossier SPR \/ RPD file #: MA1-11335\nMA1-11333\n3\n",

They were born in 1966, 1969, 1991 and 1999 respectively. They maintain that they have a well-founded fear of persecution in Peru by reason of the particular social group to which they belong. In the case of XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, this is the particular social group of women. In the case of her husband and her two children, the particular social group is the family.\nThe claimants also allege that they are \"persons in need of protection\", pursuant to section 97(1)(a) and (b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nALLEGATIONS\nIn 1991, the principal claimant, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, married XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXXXX. She had a series of problems and very quickly realized that this man was violent. In 1995, the couple separated, but after the separation, Mr. XXXXX continued to assault the female claimant. On XXXXX, 1998 the marriage was dissolved.\nThe female claimant, who got to know her second husband in November 1997, remarried on XXXXXX, 2000. Threats from her ex-husband then intensified. In XXXXX 2001, the claimants were physically assaulted near their home. They made a complaint to the police in XXXXXX 2001, but realized that the police officers had no interest in taking action with respect to their case. They decided to leave their county.\nThis sums up the alleged facts that were brought before the panel.\nDECISION\nThe Refugee Protection Division (RPD) has arrived at the following conclusion:\nThe claimants are not \"Convention refugees\"1 because they do not have a well-founded fear of persecution based on one of the Convention grounds.\nFurthermore, the claimants are not \"persons in need of protection\"2 because their removal to Peru would not personally subject them to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. Moreover, there are no substantial grounds for believing that they would be personally subject to a danger of torture if they were to be sent back to Peru.\nANALYSIS\nThe identity of the claimants as Peruvian nationals has been established through their testimony and by various documents filed in support of their claim, namely Exhibits P-7,3 P-84 and A-3.5\nIn the first place, the panel cannot consider section 97(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act because the perpetrator of the alleged harm is neither an officer of the public service nor a person acting in an official capacity or at his own instigation or with the expressed or implied consent of the state. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) will therefore conduct its analysis by taking into account section 96 and section 97(1)(b).\nThe panel has rejected the refugee protection claim of Ms. XXXXXXXXX and her family because they are not credible with respect to state protection. They are also not credible concerning an internal flight alternative. Finally, the attitude of the claimants is not that of persons who have a serious or reasonable fear of being persecuted or being subject to a risk of death or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nState protection\nAs for state protection, regardless of whether section 96 or section 97(1)(b) is considered, the claimants had to prove that the state was unable to protect them.\nGiven the fact that the perpetrator of the harm feared by the claimants is not an agent of the state, but simply the female claimant's ex-husband, XXXXXXXXX, the panel has attempted to assess whether the claimants properly availed themselves of the protection of their country's authorities before claiming international protection. The claimants have not succeeded in establishing, in a clear and convincing manner, that the Peruvian state was unable to accord them the normal protection in effect in their country.\nAccording to the panel's assessment, the documentary evidence has established that there is a legal and judicial framework in Peru that is capable of protecting the nationals of that country. In particular, there is a police force, an army and courts. According to the documentary evidence, even a law on domestic violence has been promulgated. Although states are presumed capable of protecting their nationals, the claimants were free, under the law, to rebut this presumption of state protection by producing clear and convincing evidence. On the basis of the evidence presented by the claimants, the panel can only conclude that the claimants have not succeeded in rebutting this presumption.\nThe claimants alleged that they have filed complaints on two occasions since they have been together and had problems with XXXXXXX. They said that they filed a complaint for the first time in XXXX 1998, and a second time in XXXXX 2001. The explanations that the claimants gave concerning these two complaints were rather inconsistent.\nFor example, regarding an attack that they allegedly suffered in XXXXX 2001, the claimants only laid a complaint on XXXXX, 2001, one month later. Furthermore, Mr. XXXXX XXXX, the husband of the principal claimant, declared that on the morning of XXXXX, they received threats, in the sense that the female claimant's ex-husband made death threats against them. However, at 10:30 a.m., when the male claimant went to the police to lay a complaint, he did not mention these threats. He only spoke of the incident of XXXXXX 2001. The panel finds it implausible that he would not have mentioned this incident. Furthermore, immediately after this complaint was filed, the claimants decided to leave their country. The panel is of the opinion that the mere fact that the claimants filed a complaint is insufficient to discharge the burden on them to prove that the Peruvian state was unable to protect them.\nInternal flight alternative - Convention refugees\nThe panel verified whether there was a reasonable internal flight alternative for the refugee protection claimants. This issue was brought to their attention because if they had problems with the principal claimant's ex-husband, they could very well have sought refuge in some other place, even in Lima, since that city has several million inhabitants. According to the panel's assessment of the evidence, the claimants would not face a serious possibility of persecution in another part of the country or in another city of Peru.\nThe claimants, who alleged that they had had all these problems, stated that since they have been married, they have never moved and have never made any effort to go and live in another quarter of the city or in another city. Given the fact that it is the principal claimant's ex-husband whom they allegedly fear, and not the authorities, the panel does not see any reason why the claimants could not go and settle elsewhere in order to live in peace. They speak Spanish, and there is no restriction on movement within the country.\nThe principal claimant explained that her ex-husband could find them anywhere in Peru. However, she was unable to satisfy the panel of this or give any valid reason, except to say that she felt safer near her parents and family, while elsewhere, she would not have her family to protect her. After examining conditions in the country and the profile of the claimants and of their alleged agent of persecution, the panel finds that it would not be objectively unreasonable for the claimants to go and live in another quarter of Lima or in another city of Peru, especially since the principal claimant is not a woman alone, but is married.\nInternal flight alternative - risk to life and risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment\nThe panel finds that an internal flight alternative is reasonably accessible to the claimants, since the documentary evidence does not indicate that Peruvians cannot move freely from one region to another.\nIn the final analysis, the panel has considered the claimants' behaviour throughout these last two years. The claimants all had passports and American visas from the year 2000 on. However, they did not leave their country. The male principal claimant, who had already gone to the United States, went back to Peru and only left Peru on November 8, 2001. Furthermore, the claimants passed through the United States, but did not claim refugee protection in that country.\nA number of facts have led the panel to the conclusion that the claimants do not exhibit the behaviour of persons who have the fear they allege. In the first place, the claimants did not move to another neighbourhood, even within Lima, or to some other place in Peru. Secondly, they did not leave Peru earlier. Thirdly, in the case of XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, he returned voluntarily to a country where he alleged that he faces a serious possibility or reasonable chance of being persecuted or subject to a risk of death or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. Finally, the claimants did not claim refugee protection in the United States, a country though which they travelled.\nThe arguments that the claimants made concerning this behaviour cannot hold up because the jurisprudence of the Federal Court is clear on this point. The panel quite simply finds that the explanations given by the claimants are difficult to accept.\nRegarding their allegation that they are \"Convention refugees\", the panel would like to refer to the decision by the Federal Court in Ilie:6\n[TRANSLATION] A claimant's failure to claim refugee status in a country that is a signatory to the 1967 Protocol negates the claim of a fear of persecution.\nIn Leul,7 Mr. Justice Muldoon noted:\nJust as I would not wish to send back to his country a person who stood in jeopardy of a reasonable chance of persecution, so I just do not wish to leave in Canada a person who isn't entitled to be here; a person who passed through a country which was a signatory to the convention and did not think to claim refugee status there.\nFinally, the panel also refers to the decision in the case of Hibo Farah Mohamed and Ardo Abdi Omer,8 rendered on April 9, 1997, in which Rothstein J. stated the following:\nThe Geneva Convention exists for persons who require protection and not to assist persons who simply prefer asylum in one country over another. The Convention and the Immigration Act should be interpreted with the correct purpose in mind.\nTo prove that they are \"Convention refugees\" or \"persons in need of protection\", the claimants had to establish that they would face a serious possibility or reasonable chance of being persecuted, a serious possibility or reasonable chance of being tortured, or a serious possibility or reasonable chance of being subject to a risk of death or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if they had to return to their country of origin.\nHowever, the claimants, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, her husband, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, and their two children, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, have not presented sufficient credible evidence to establish that they are \"Convention refugees\", pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, or that they are \"persons in need of protection\", pursuant to sections 97(1)(a) and (b) of the same Act.\nTheir claim is therefore rejected.\nJoulekhan Pirbay\nJoulekhan Pirbay\nDecember 20, 2002\nDate\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, reads in part as follows:\n96. A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,\n(a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or\n(b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.\n2 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, reads in part as follows:\n97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\n(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or\n(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.\n3 Exhibit P-7, birth certificate of the claimant XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.\n4 Exhibit P-8, birth certificate of the claimant XXXXXXXXXXXXXX.\n5 Exhibit A-3, immigration documents, in a bundle; photocopies of the claimants' passports.\n6 Ilie, Lucian Ioan v.

They arrived in Canada on September 6, 2001 with their four minor children: their eldest daughter, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, who is 10 years of age and a citizen of Venezuela; and their three younger children, who were born in the United States of America and are therefore American citizens, namely XXXXXXXXXXXXX, who is 5 years of age, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, who is 3 years of age, and XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, who is 2 years of age. The couple were also accompanied by XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, a citizen of Venezuela who is 20 years years old and the brother of the female claimant. The claimants made a claim for refugee protection at the port of entry.\nThe principal claimant alleges that he has a well-founded fear of persecution in his country by reason of the political opinion imputed to him and his membership in a particular social group, namely citizens who are victims of police corruption. The other claimants allege that they have a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of their membership in a particular social group, the family.\nAll the claimants also maintain that they are persons in need of protection because they would be personally subject to a danger of torture, to a risk to their lives or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if they had to return to Venezuela.\nAt the beginning of the hearing, the panel designated XXXXXXXXXXXXXX as representative of his minor children for the purposes of the hearing. The principal claimant said that his children, who are American citizens, have no fear of persecution in the United States, but that the family would have to remain together if they had to return to Venezuela.\nTHE EVIDENCE\nThe evidence in this case was presented by the claimants, by their lawyer and by the refugee protection officers (RPOs) unit. This evidence consists of the claimants' Personal Information Forms (PIFs), their identity papers, the testimony of the adult claimants, and documents concerning the sociopolitical situation in Venezuela. The principal claimant was practically the only person to testify at the hearing. His wife and brother-in-law merely confirmed his statements. In his PIF and in his oral testimony, the principal claimant alleged the following facts:\nSince XXXX 1993, the principal claimant had worked as a police officer in the drug squad in XXXXXXX, in the state of XXXXXXX. He began to suffer persecution from some fellow police officers on XXXXX, 1995, after he had arrested two drug traffickers who were under the protection of the highest-ranking police authorities in the city of XXXXXXX and the state of XXXXXXX, namely Inspector XXXXXXXX and Lieutenant XXXXXXX. After being forced to release his prisoners, and after refusing a bribe of US$2,000 from Lieutenant XXXXXXX, the principal claimant undertook to investigate the relationship between the XXXXXXX duo and the drug traffickers. As a result of his investigation, he realized that a number of fellow police officers were part of the network for protecting the drug traffickers and received generous compensation. On XXXXX 1995 the principal claimant turned down an invitation from Lieutenant XXXXXX to join the network.\nOn XXXXX 1995 the public prosecutor's office refused to follow up on the principal claimant's information against XXXXXXX and XXXXXXX, for lack of evidence. From that time on, the principal claimant was under constant pressure from members of the network. On XXXXX 1995 a stone with a written note was thrown through the window of his house. The note contained a threat that he would be made to pay for being an informer. The principal claimant attributed this note to XXXXXXX and to XXXXXXX. On XXXXX, 1995, individuals wearing hoods attacked him with daggers. Nineteen stitches were required to close up his wounds, and he was hospitalized until XXXXXX, 1995. When he was released from the hospital, he immediately fled to the island of Margarita with his family, where he started to work as a taxi driver. On XXXX, 1995, three men attacked him in his taxi and attempted to cut his throat. After escaping this last attack, he decided to leave Venezuela.\nAfter arriving in the United States on XXXXX, 1995 with his wife and daughter, the principal claimant attempted to regularize his situation by entrusting his case to an immigration consultant on January 8, 1996. On July 22, 1999, he learned of the arrest of the consultant, who had defrauded several immigrant families.\nFrom XXXXXX to XXXX 2000, his wife made a trip to Venezuela with the children, to visit the family. At the end of this trip, she returned to the United States with her brother, XXXXX. The principal claimant also made a trip to Venezuela on XXXXX, 2001, to assess the possibility of returning there with his family. At that time, he learned that corruption was even more widespread than in the past since his two principal agents of persecution had still more power and influence. Inspector XXXXXXX had been promoted to the position of XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX of the police in the state of XXXXXXX, while XXXXXXXX XXXXXXX had been appointed to the even more prestigious position of XXXXXXX of the National Police of Venezuela, in XXXXXXX, with the title of XXXXXXX Approximately one week after his arrival in Venezuela, the principal claimant received explicit threats from these two individuals, in which they gave him two weeks to leave the country. After attempting to obtain a Canadian visa in XXXXXXX, without success, the principal claimant returned to the United States on XXXX, 2001. Two months later, on XXXXX, 2001, the entire family arrived in Canada and claimed refugee protection at the border.\nDECISION\nThe panel determines that the claimants do not have a well-founded fear of persecution for the reasons they allege. The panel also determines that they are not persons in need of protection because their return to Venezuela would not subject them personally to a risk to their lives, to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or to a danger of torture.\nANALYSIS\nThe identities of the refugee protection claimants could be established satisfactorily by means of the documents produced in evidence, namely their passports, birth certificates and national identity cards, and the couple's marriage certificate.\nThe analysis of all the evidence submitted leads the panel to find that the claimants have not discharged the burden on them of establishing that they have a well-founded fear of persecution in Venezuela. The panel cannot find their story credible because of the inconsistencies, omissions, discrepancies, implausibilities and contradictions noted in the PIF, in the testimony of the principal claimant, and in the documents filed in evidence, for which no satisfactory explanation was given.\nIn the first place, the panel does not believe that the principal claimant really fled Venezuela on XXXXXXX, 1995 to go and settle in the United States, in order to escape his alleged agents of persecution. According to the notes of the immigration officer, when the principal claimant arrived in Canada on September 6, 2001, he did everything he could to conceal his passport.\nMr. XXXXX presented three US birth certificates for his children... after numerous questions, Mr. XXXXX claimed he had been travelling back and forth from Venezuela to Mexico to USA. After several questions, Mr. XXXXX lied several times during this examination. Mr. XXXXX has stated that his passport was lost in the USA. I was not satisfied with his answers and continued to interview why he submitted an application for a visitor visa to XXXXXXX as notes revealed he had no problems in Venezuela. I, then, asked Mr. XXXXX again for his passport and he replied that \"it was lost\". I advised Mr. XXXXX that I would search all his belongings..... I gave him one more chance to produce the identity documents and he went to his youngest child's infant seat and under the child was various passports from USA and Venezuela .....\nAn examination of the principal claimant's passport reveals why he made such an effort to hide it. On page 4 of the passport, it is indicated that he did indeed leave Venezuela on XXXXXX 1995 for the United States; however, he returned to Venezuela on XXXXX, 1995. It is also indicated on page 24 of the passport that he was allowed into the United States for the period from XXXX 2001 to XXXXX, 2001. On pages 26 and 27, it can be seen that his passport was renewed on XXXXX, 2001 in the city of XXXXX for a period of five years, expiring on XXXX, 2006. On page 7 of the passport, there is a stamp attesting to his departure from Venezuela for the United States on XXXXX 2001. In the panel's opinion, this information contradicts the principal claimant's oral testimony and the allegations contained in his PIF.\nIn his PIF and in his oral testimony, the principal claimant described a single trip to Venezuela, on XXXX, 2001. He tried to explain this trip, and the trip that his wife allegedly made in XXXXX 2000, by saying that he had managed to make use of an American multiple-entry visa by bribing an employee of United States Immigration. The employee had managed to place several stamps in the couple's passports so that it would seem as if the two adult claimants had made several trips to Venezuela. The panel finds this explanation to be unclear and implausible. In any case, a single trip by the claimant to his country would have been sufficient to cast doubt on his fear of persecution. According to the information in his passport, it is clear that he probably spent most of his time in his own country, making sporadic trips to the United States using his multiple-entry visa. In the panel's opinion, this fact irremediably damages his credibility.\nOn the subject of the alleged agents of persecution, who were supposedly given important positions in 2001, the panel submitted an information request and received the response, XXXXXXXX filed as Exhibit A-17. The information in this response does not support the principal claimant's allegations. The panel does not attach any credibility to the principal claimant's affidavit filed as Exhibit P-21, according to which he felt even more threatened because XXXXXXX had been fired. According to the newspaper article filed as Exhibit P-22, on XXXXX, 2001 XXXX XXXXXXX was removed from his position as XXXXXXXXXXXX of the municipality of XXXXXXX, the city where the principal claimant renewed his passport on XXXX, 2001, contrary to the principal claimant's statements at the hearing that XXXXX XXXXXXX had become XXXXXXX and XXXXXXXX of the police of the state of XXXXXXX, of which the city of XXXXXXX is the capital.\nThe panel accords no probative value to the document filed as Exhibit P-15, which according to the principal claimant was issued by the Ministry of the Interior and of Justice. This document does not agree with the principal claimant's PIF, according to which the information he laid was rejected due to lack of evidence.\nEven if the credibility of the principal claimant had not been so profoundly undermined, he would have had to explain why he did not act diligently to obtain the protection of the United States, a country where he claims he lived for nearly six years, from XXXXXX 1995 to XXXXXX 2001. The misadventure with the immigration consultant, who was supposed to take steps to regularize the family's status, is not enough to justify the principal claimant's failure to claim refugee protection in a country that is a signatory to the Geneva Convention.\nBecause of the discrepancies, contradictions and implausibilities raised at the hearing, the panel cannot find credible the fear of persecution alleged by the claimants. The panel finds that the words of MacGuigan J. in Sheikh are directly applicable to the present case:\n[...] even without disbelieving every word an applicant has uttered, a first-level panel may reasonably find him so lacking in credibility that it concludes there is no credible evidence relevant to his claim [...]. In other words, a general finding of a lack of credibility on the part of the applicant may conceivably extend to all relevant evidence emanating from his testimony.\nCONCLUSION\nThe evidence presented is insufficient to allow the panel to establish that if the claimants returned to Venezuela, they would face a serious possibility of being persecuted within the meaning of the decision in Adjei.\nThe panel determines that the claimants, XXXXXXXXXXXXXX, his wife, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, their minor children, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXand XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, and also the brother of the female claimant, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, are neither Convention refugees under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act nor persons in need of protection under section 97(1) of the Act. Consequently, their refugee protection claims are rejected.\nJacques M. Lapommeray\nJacques M.

He alleges that he has a well-founded fear of persecution in his country of citizenship by reason of his race, namely the fact that he is a member the Soninke ethnic group. He also alleges that he is a person in need of protection because he would be subject to a risk to his life and to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he had to return to the Republic of Mali.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant is a member of the Soninke ethnic group living in the village of XXXXXXX, situated XXX km XXXXXX of Y\u00e9liman\u00e9. The Soninke are known for their agricultural and commercial activities. XXXXXXXX is in the vicinity of the [TRANSLATION] \"Peul encampment and village\", the Peul being a nomadic and\/or sedentary people known for raising animals.\nThe conflict between these two ethnic groups developed because the herds belonging to the Peul were [TRANSLATION] \"ravaging\" the fields belonging to the Soninke that were under cultivation. In spite of agreements among [TRANSLATION] \"the sages of the villages\" to prevent such incidents, the Peul continued to drive their herds into the fields of the Soninke and went so far as to loot Soninke shopkeepers and [TRANSLATION] \"eliminate the notables\" of the Soninke.\nThe lack of security experienced by the Soninke drove the young people of the village of XXXXXXXXXX to form an association on XXXXXXXX, 1998. This association, called the \"XXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX\" (XXXXXXX) [XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXX] was set up [TRANSLATION] \"to watch over the fields under cultivation and security in the villages.\" The refugee protection claimant was appointed vice-president of the XXXX. The principal objectives of the XXXX were to enforce the agreements made by the [TRANSLATION] \"village sages\", to prevent the Peul from coming to the village in groups and to impose a curfew at ten o'clock in the evening.\nOn XXXXXXX, 1999 a Soninke notable from the neighbouring village was murdered by Peul bandits. The next day, the XXXX youth burned down the Peul encampments. The Peul were looking for the claimant following these events, and the claimant therefore left his village on XXXXXX, 1999 and went to Bamako.\nAt the beginning of the year 2000, the claimant was hired by a shopkeeper by the name of XXXXXXXXXXXX, also a member of the Soninke ethnic group. On XXXXXXX, 2000 the claimant escaped an ambush that the Peul had set up on the way out of Diayecoura, in the circle of Nioro du Sahel more than 400 km northwest of Bamako. In this incident, the claimant had to leave behind his bicycle and his merchandise.\nThe claimant alleged that on April 3, 2001 he was threatened by Peul shopkeepers and a Peugeot 305 automobile caused him to fall off his motorbike.\nOn XXXXXX, 2001 the claimant was knocked over by [TRANSLATION] \"hooligans\", known for their attacks, driving the same type of automobile. Following this accident, the claimant was hospitalized for two days.\nWith the help of his employer, XXXXXXXXXXXX, the claimant left Mali on XXXXXXX, 2001. He transited through France and arrived in Canada on October 29, 2001. He claimed Canada's protection on November 8, 2001.\nANALYSIS\nIt has been possible to establish the identity of the refugee protection claimant, who states that he is a national of the Republic of Mali, on the basis of his testimony and documents produced in support of his refugee protection claim, namely a passport (Exhibit M-3) issued by the Malian authorities, bearing number XXXXXXXX, with a Canadian visa. The panel finds that the claimant has produced identity documents that are acceptable within the meaning of section 106 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nThe facts on which the Minister's allegations are based are to the effect that the claimant should be excluded from Canada in accordance with section 98 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.1 This section incorporates Article 1F(b) of the Convention.2\nFor the purposes of its analysis, the panel must examine two issues:\n1. Was the claimant an accomplice in the acts committed by the XXXX?\n2. Does the act committed by the XXXX constitute a serious non-political crime?\nAs a preamble to the analysis of the facts, the panel here refers to the words of Tremblay-Lamer J. in Zrig:3\n[...] a single serious non-political crime suffices for exclusion of the applicant [...]\nThe claimant's oral and written testimony has shown that he was one of the two principal leaders of the XXXX, which had 55 members including 15 with responsibilities. Decisions were made by the president and by the claimant, as vice-president, and they communicated the information about their decisions to the [TRANSLATION] \"organizer\".\nThe claimant testified that he agreed with the president's decision to burn down the Peul encampment. He explained that his role as vice-president did not allow him to [TRANSLATION] \"go back on his word\", as he had been chosen and not elected by the members of his association. The claimant nonetheless admitted to the panel that even though he had never happened to disagree with a decision of his president, he did not believe that there would have been [TRANSLATION] \"any problems\" for him if he had expressed his disagreement with the decision to set fire to the Peul huts.\nThe claimant testified that the camp had between 10 and 15 huts and that a single hut could accommodate an entire family. The claimant explained that the Peul had left the camp to look after their animals. When the Minister's representative confronted the claimant with the fact that those who remained in the camp were women, old men and children, the claimant replied that these individuals fled when they saw the Soninke advancing towards them, armed with sticks.\nThe claimant testified that he was just an onlooker at the scene and did no more than glance into the huts before they were set on fire. The claimant was then confronted with his answer to Question 37 of his Personal Information Form (PIF) (Exhibit P-1), where in the third paragraph of page 2, he stated:\n[TRANSLATION] No longer wanting them in the vicinity of the villages, we (emphasis added by the panel) young people burned down the Peul camps on XXXXXX, 1999, forcing the inhabitants to take refuge far from the villages and fields under cultivation.\nThe claimant replied that the \"we\" in this statement meant [TRANSLATION] \"our group, and it was our group that was responsible.\" The claimant alleged that the people who had set the fire were smokers, and he did not smoke. When questioned as to whether this was the only reason that had prevented him from setting the fire himself, the claimant replied: [TRANSLATION] \"I did not have the heart to set the fire; I felt sorry for them.\" When questioned as to whether he had done anything to prevent this action, the claimant replied that he had not because he was [TRANSLATION] \"an officer\" of the XXXX.\nFinally, the claimant was asked whether he had resigned from the XXXX following this event. He replied: [TRANSLATION] \"No, because we did not do anything after that.\" The panel notes that the Peul encampment was burned down on XXXX, 1999 and that the claimant left his village on XXXXXX, 1999. On page 2 of his answer to Question 37 of his PIF (Exhibit P-1), the claimant gave the following account of what happened between these two dates:\n[TRANSLATION] A manhunt was carried out against the young people of XXXXXXXXXX in general, and against us leaders in particular. It became impossible for us to go into our own fields; we could no longer fetch wood or grass for our domestic animals. [...] Armed Peul regularly went through our fields, looking for me, so that my parents and uncles were forced to flee and go back to the house. At that time, I no longer went to the village.\nIn light of this testimony, it is reasonable that the XXXX would have stopped its activities, since the Peul were actively looking for one of its senior leaders. Nonetheless, the claimant did not withdraw from the organization.\nThe principles to apply in establishing the degree of participation required have been established in Ramirez, Sivakumar and Moreno, and summarized by Nadon J. in Mohammad.4\nEven though the claimant alleged that he had not set the fire himself, there is still \"personal and knowing\" participation, which is \"the starting point for the existence of complicity.\" The claimant held an \"important position\" in the XXXX and did nothing to try to stop the arsonists. He even \"encouraged\" them by communicating the president's decision to the organization in \"full knowledge\" of what was happening. He accompanied the armed group that set fire to the encampment and was thus in \"close association with those who committed\" this crime. He further encouraged them by first checking to see whether the huts were occupied. In spite of the \"knowledge\" that the claimant had that the XXXX had committed a crime, he continued to hold the position of vice-president in the association and never resigned.\nIn light of the preceding, the panel finds that the refugee protection claimant is an accomplice in acts committed by the XXXX.\nDoes setting fire to the Peul huts constitute a \"serious non-political crime\"?\nThe Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status defines what constitutes a serious non-political crime in paragraph 155,5 and in Zrig,6 Tremblay-Lamer J. defines the word \"serious\" as used in Article 1F(b).\nSection 434 of the Canadian Criminal Code deals with the crime of setting fire to property in the following terms:\nEvery person who intentionally or recklessly causes damage by fire or explosion to property that is not wholly owned by that person is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years.\nThe members of the XXXX intentionally set fire to huts that were the property of the Peul and were occupied by individuals, or even entire families, who belonged to the Peul ethnic group.\nRegarding the standard of proof that must be applied under Article 1F(b), it was determined in Ramirez7 that this was a lesser standard than that required in criminal law (beyond a reasonable doubt) or in civil law (based on a balance of probabilities, or on the preponderance of evidence8), and is expressed in the phrase \"serious reasons for considering.\"\nFollowing an analysis of all the evidence, considering the very serious punishment imposed under Canadian law for the crime of setting fire to property owned by others, and in line with the jurisprudence mentioned above, the panel finds that counsel for the Minister has discharged the burden on him of proving that there are serious reasons for considering that the claimant has committed a serious non-political crime.\nEven if the claimant had not been excluded, the panel would have found that the claimant is neither a \"Convention refugee\"9 nor a \"person in need of protection.\"10\nThe claimant testified that he took refuge in Bamako on XXXXXX, 1999, following the events he had experienced in his village. He alleged that he fell into an ambush set up by the Peul on November 18, 2000, more than a year after his arrival in Bamako. This incident allegedly occurred in the circles of Nara and Nioro du Sa\u00ebl, situated more than 400 km northwest of Bamako. The claimant also alleged that he had been the victim of two attacks, the first on April 3, 2001 when a Peugeot 305 automobile struck his motorbike, and the second on XXXXXXX, 2001 when he was knocked over by the same type of automobile, driven by [TRANSLATION] \"hooligans\", who were young people recruited to assault him.\nWhen the panel asked the claimant whether complaints had been filed with the police, he replied that at the time of the second attack, which resulted in his hospitalization, his employer had gone to file a complaint with the police. When questioned as to what action the police had taken, the claimant replied that he did not know because he was ill and stayed in bed; however, the police did not come to see him. When the claimant was confronted with the fact that he had not mentioned this complaint in his answer to Question 37 of his PIF, he replied that he thought that everything had been written down and that he did not know how to read. When he was confronted with the fact that his PIF had been translated for him and that the translation had been approved on page 11 of the PIF, the claimant became confused and could not provide the panel with a satisfactory answer.\nThe Republic of Mali is not characterized by a complete collapse of its state apparatus. Consequently, we must presume that the Malian state is capable of protecting its nationals. In this regard, the panel finds that the Ward11 decision applies to the present case:\nAbsent some evidence, the claim should fail, as nations should be presumed capable of protecting their citizens. Security of nationals is, after all, the essence of sovereignty. Absent a situation of complete breakdown of state apparatus, such as that recognized in Lebanon in Zalzali, it should be assumed that the state is capable of protecting a claimant.\nIn light of the evidence presented, the panel finds that the claimant has not managed to rebut, by means of \"clear and convincing evidence\", the presumption that the Malian state is capable of protecting him.\nCONCLUSION\nHaving analyzed all the evidence, the panel excludes the refugee protection claimant, XXXXXXXXXXXX, pursuant to Article 1F(b) of the Convention. Consequently, the claimant may not benefit from Canada's international protection.\nThe panel also determines that the claimant is not a \"Convention refugee\"12 or a \"person in need of protection.\"13\nRuth Delisle\nMe Ruth Delisle\nDecember 20, 2002\nDate\n1 Section 98: A person referred to in section E or F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\n2 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, signed at Geneva, July 28, 1951.\n3 Zrig, Mohamed v.

A person who aids in or encourages the commission of a crime may be responsible therefor.\n6.

The more important the position held by a person in an organization that has committed one or more crimes, the more likely his or her complicity.\n9. A person who continues to hold a leadership position in such an organization with full knowledge that the organization is responsible for crimes may be considered an accomplice.\n10. Evidence that the individual protested against the crime, tried to stop its commission or attempted to withdraw from the organization must be taken into consideration in determining whether he or she is responsible.\n5 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, signed at Geneva, July 28, 1951, paragraph 155:\nWhat constitutes a \"serious\" non-political crime for the purposes of this exclusion clause is difficult to define, especially since the term \"crime\" has different connotations in different legal systems. In some countries the word \"crime\" denotes only offences of a serious character. In other countries it may comprise anything from petty larceny to murder. In the present context, however, a \"serious\" crime must be a capital crime or a very grave punishable act. Minor offences punishable by moderate sentences are not grounds for exclusion under Article 1F(b) even if technically referred to as \"crimes\" in the penal law of the country concerned.\n6 Supra, note 3.\nOn the meaning of the word \"serious\", James Hathaway in Law of Refugee Status, Toronto, Butterworths, 1991, at page 22, mentioned that these are crimes that warrant an especially severe punishment, thus making clear the commitment of signatories of the Convention to withholding protection from those who have committed truly abhorrent wrongs.\n7 Ramirez, Saul Vincente v.

He claims, first, to have a well-founded fear of persecution in Guinea by reason of his imputed political opinion and, second, to be a \"person in need of protection\"1 since, as he alleges, he is subject to a danger of torture, a risk to his life and a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nHe alleged that he owned an XXXXXXXXXXXXX located in the vicinity of the Alpha Yaya military camp in Conakry.\nOne day in XXXX 2001, an explosion XXXXXXXX destroyed his XXXXXX. He said that he therefore left Conakry to return to his village. An uncle allegedly encouraged him to seek compensation from the department of XXXXXXX. He claimed that he went there two times without achieving the desired results and that the third time he was simply arrested and thrown into a mobile police cell, where he endured physical and moral torture for two weeks.\nThe torture took various forms such as undressing the claimant and leaving him exposed to adverse weather. He was also deprived of water. When he asked for some, his torturers handed him an empty cup, forced him to fill it with his urine and then made him drink it. The claimant said that he did this numerous times. They hit him with a braided whip, telling him that he would die soon. He was deprived of food. On several occasions, they allegedly bound his hands to his knees, forcing him to bend over, and then pulled him with a rope like a work animal, causing him the most excruciating pain.\nThe goal of the torturers was to intimidate him and punish him for holding the State to account.\nHe said that he managed to escape with the help of his uncle and then went into hiding. The police came after him, tracking him everywhere. On XXXXX, 2001, he headed for exile in Canada, passing through Mali, and carrying a false French passport.\nDECISION\nThe panel determines that the claimant is a person in need of protection because there is a serious possibility that he would be subject personally to a danger of torture.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\nTo establish his identity, the claimant presented, in addition to his testimony, his legally obtained identity card and birth certificate. The authenticity of these documents is not at issue in this case.\nBased on this evidence, the panel finds that he is a Guinean citizen and that he comes from Guinea.\nCredibility\nThe claimant gave direct and detailed testimony using consistent body language. His testimony did not contradict the information contained in his Personal Information Form (PIF). It made it possible to explain the minor contradictions presented in the evidence of the Minister's representative.\nThe panel could not therefore make a negative finding regarding the credibility of the refugee protection claimant.\nDanger of torture\nThe refugee protection claimant, aware that he is wanted by the authorities, alleged during the hearing that if he had to return to Guinea, he would be arrested, imprisoned and tortured by the security forces for having fled and defied the State.\nIn the panel's opinion, it is obvious that the harm feared amounts to torture.\nThe harm the claimant fears he would suffer resembles the detailed description he gave of the abuse he was subjected to in prison before escaping, in particular, where he was deprived of water and drank his own urine, was bound and dragged like an animal, was deprived of food and beaten, etc.\nIn any event, the panel is of the opinion that these are acts by which severe pain and suffering, whether physical or mental, are intentionally inflicted for the purpose of intimidation and punishment.\nThe documentary evidence on the record makes it possible for the panel to conclude that this humiliating treatment is inflicted by members of the security forces, as is indicated by the following passage from Exhibit A-2:2\nSerious human rights abuses include: Extrajudicial killings; disappearances; use of torture, beatings, and rape by police and military personnel; and police abuse of prisoners and detainees. (...) Members of the security forces committed abuses with impunity.\nIt should be noted that if he were to return, the refugee protection claimant would be subject to an extrajudicial procedure that heightens a risk that is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions.\nSection 97, subsection 1, paragraph (a) of the Act states the following:\nA person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally [...] to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture.\nGiven this, it is appropriate to examine the standard of proof under this section. This involves a consideration of the possible equivalence of the terms \"reasonable chance\", \"serious possibility\" and \"believed on substantial grounds to exist\", since it appears to the panel that the standard to be applied is that of a \"serious possibility\" and that it is the existence of such a possibility that the claimant must demonstrate.\nFirst, given that the risk involved is a prospective one, the panel is of the opinion that the standard to be applied is the standard that applies in considering claims for refugee protection based on the definition of \"Convention refugee\". In the present case, the prospective nature of the risk is based on the culture of violence within the Guinean police force.\nSecond, the panel finds that the standard of a \"serious possibility\" is bolstered by the fact that the danger of torture is, obviously, an aggravated form of the harm feared by the claimant.\nThe panel's conclusion with regard to the standard to be applied is based on international and Canadian case law on this subject.\nIt is worthwhile to refer to this case law, beginning at the international level. In Kacaj,3 it appeared that the expressions \"reasonable chance\", \"substantial grounds for believing\" and \"serious possibility\" indicate the same degree of risk as the term \"serious risk\". The British tribunal that heard the case concluded that two different legal criteria or standards could not be applied to the same set of facts. There is a requirement for logic and consistency.\nWith regard to Canadian case law on this subject, it is appropriate to note that in Suresh,4 the Supreme Court of Canada uses as equivalents the expressions \"substantial risk of torture\" and \"substantial grounds to believe\" he or she would be tortured on return to the country of destination. Furthermore, it should be noted that the expressions \"substantial risk of torture\" and \"real risk\" attest to a meaning equivalent to the meaning of expressions used in Adjei,5 specifically, \"good grounds for fearing\", \"serious possibility\" and \"reasonable chance\" in the context of the definition of \"Convention refugee\".\nGiven the objectives set out in the current Act with regard to refugees, the panel does not believe that the intent of Parliament was to make access to protection more difficult for people at risk of torture than for those at risk of persecution. Indeed, allegations of possible ill-treatment can meet both the definition of torture, as set out in Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture, and the definition of refugee, as set out in section 96 of the Act. If the legal standard were higher than the standard applied to claims for refugee protection based on the definition of \"Convention refugee\", people facing a serious possibility of torture would not be protected.\nConsequently, the panel finds that the expression \"believed on substantial grounds to exist\" refers to the existence of a serious possibility of torture, and the panel has applied this standard to the facts of the present case.\nDECISION\nThe panel determines that XXXXXXXXXXX is a person in need of protection; consequently, his claim for refugee protection is accepted.\nJos\u00e9 wa Tshisungu Tshisungu\nJos\u00e9 wa Tshisungu Tshisungu\nAugust 28, 2002\nDate\n1 Section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, reads in part as follows:\n97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\n(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to\nexist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the\nConvention Against Torture; or\n(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and\nunusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk,\nunwilling to avail themself of the protection of that\ncountry,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every\npart of that country and is not faced generally by\nother individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful\nsanctions, unless imposed in disregard of\naccepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that\ncountry to provide adequate health or medical\ncare.\n2 Exhibit A-2 - Country Report on Human Rights Practices 2001.\n3 Secretary of State for the Home Department v.

The claimant was designated as the representative of her child for the purposes of her claim.\nTHE FACTS\nOn XXXXXXXX, 2001 the claimants left their country with a Canadian ministerial residence permit valid until XXXXX, 2001, so that the child could receive free medical care at the XXXX Hospital, a private institution XXXXX. Since birth, XXXXXX has suffered from a very rare bone disease, which makes his bones fragile and likely to break at the slightest shock or awkward movement.\nAs she did in the visa application she submitted to the Canadian Embassy in XXXXX, the claimant cited medical opinions confirming that Iran does not have the expert physicians and resources required to provide her son XXXXXX with proper care.\nA little over a month after the claimant and her son arrived in Canada, she claimed \"refugee status\" for herself and for him, alleging that she would be at risk of persecution for her political opinion if she ever returned to Iran.\nThe claimant said that the Iranian doctors had taken a long time to discover what her son was actually suffering from. Most of the time, he did not receive proper care when, as a very young child, he suffered a fracture of one or other of his limbs. The claimant often had heated exchanges with health care personnel, for example, when affluent people were treated ahead of her son in the emergency ward.\nOnce, in XXXXXX 1999, she was held at the office of the hospital's security service because she was not wearing her veil in the prescribed manner. She had just got out of a taxi with her injured child in her arms and had not had the time-or even the idea-to adjust her veil. She was released with a warning.\nHaving obtained the name of a physician who could treat her son, she went to XXXX, where she stayed with her husband and child from XXXXXX 1999 to XXXXX 2000. It seems that the vitamin treatment offered there was not as successful as they had hoped. Moreover, the doctor told them that the only hospital in the world that could treat XXXXXX was the XXXXXX Hospital in XXXXXXX.\nWhen they returned to Iran, the claimant and her husband made many efforts to approach the Iranian medical authorities and the Canadian diplomatic corps. After a first refusal for having an incomplete file and other procedures, including the intervention of a member of parliament who is a friend of the family, they finally obtained the necessary documents and authorizations to bring XXXXXX to Canada for treatment.\nIn this regard, the file of the Canadian Embassy in XXXXXX, produced as Exhibit A-32, reveals the following particular facts: the Government of Quebec gave its consent for XXXXXX treatment on XXXXX, 2001; the letter of the Iranian ministry of health confirming that the treatments required for XXXXXX were not available in Iran is dated XXXX, 2001; the letter of acceptance of free care offered by the XXXXX Hospital is dated XXXXX, 2001; and the Minister's permit to stay in Canada is dated XXXXX, 2001.\nHowever, the claimant alleged that on XXXXXX, 2001 she shouted abuse at people in charge of medical care and people who were part of the state apparatus, in their offices. She accused them and the clerics in charge of the Iranian regime of corruption because she and her husband were not allowed to purchase American foreign currency at the official rate, which was much more favourable than the black market rate, although she urgently needed this foreign currency for her stay in Canada and there was, according to her, a government assistance program for parents who had to have their children treated outside the country.\nThe claimant said that she was detained for several hours because of the inflammatory comments she had made against the regime. She was released with a warning that she would soon receive a notice to appear in court.\nThe claimant said that she was finally able to leave Iran with XXXXXX, thanks to the generosity of members of her family. It was only when she arrived here in Canada that her husband told her over the telephone, in XXXXX 2001, that she had received at her home a notice to appear in court. In her narrative, she added that her husband went to the court and was told that his wife absolutely had to return to Iran without delay.\nThe claimant feared being convicted and mistreated if she ever returned to Iran, and she also feared that the authorities would never allow her or her husband to leave the country again, to come to Canada so that XXXXXX could receive the care he absolutely needed. The claimant therefore decided to seek Canada's protection before her residence permit expired.\nApart from claiming the benefit of protection under the Convention, the claimant cites the fact that being prohibited from leaving Iran would constitute cruel or unusual treatment for herself and her child, or even a threat to the life of her child XXXXXX.\nIn a letter of XXXXX, 2002, filed on the record as Exhibit P-5, Dr. XXXXXX of the XXXXX Hospital states that the treatment that XXXXXX has taken since XXXXX, 2001 has produced very encouraging results. However, the child is still unable to stand up because of the weakness and deformity of his femurs. Dr. XXXXXX adds that the administration of pamidronate intravenously must be continued to increase the strength of the bones. When the bones have become stronger, surgery will be necessary to straighten out the long bones of the legs. On the basis of the progress observed, the doctor estimates that the surgical procedures could be carried out in early 2003.\nIssues\nThe identities of the claimant and of her child XXXXXX are not in issue as they have been established in an entirely satisfactory manner.\nThe main issue here is the credibility of the claimant and of her allegations that she fears persecution by reason of her political opinion and risks cruel and unusual treatment in Iran.\nAt first glance, the child's claim appears to be essentially based on that of his mother. However, given the child's circumstances as a whole and the international conventions applicable to the present case, I find it necessary to analyze his claim more specifically, keeping in mind the fundamental rule that his best interests are paramount.\nANALYSIS\n1- Credibility\nThe credibility of the claimant is a problem because the evidence contains major contradictions concerning essential elements of her claim.\nIn the first place, concerning the essential element of the notice to appear in court that the claimant allegedly received, she wrote in her PIF-which she swore to be true and accurate-that her husband told her on the telephone, in XXXXX 2001, that a notice to appear in court had been sent to her at their home, that he had gone to tell the court that she was outside the country, and that after being questioned, he was told that his wife had to return to Iran immediately.\nIn her testimony at the hearing, however, the claimant substantially changed these alleged facts, declaring that she did not have a copy of the notice to appear because her husband had not received one. She rather claimed that representatives of the court came in person to the door of their home to tell her husband that she had to return to Iran and appear before the court. She did not offer any satisfactory explanation for these contradictions.\nAgain in her PIF, in paragraph 11 of her answer to Question 37, the claimant said that she realized that being able to purchase foreign currency at the more favourable official rate was reserved for friends of the regime. At the hearing, when asked to give more details about what she had learned of this form of corruption, she replied that she knew nothing about it because it was her husband \"[TRANSLATION] who looked after these details.\"\nThis statement clearly contradicts her written testimony, in which she affirmed:\nIn the course pursuing this matter I found out that this programme had fallen victim to corruption (sic).\nThis declaration also makes it implausible that the claimant would have denounced the authorities, accusing them of corruption. How can the panel believe that she uttered the words that she said she uttered when she could not explain how there was corruption in the currency market, as it was her husband who \"[TRANSLATION] looked after these details?\" To ask this question is to cast doubt on the whole story of political denunciation that would be the reason for the alleged persecution of the claimant.\nFurthermore, the claimant added a major element, which was not mentioned in her PIF. This adds to her lack of credibility. After she had declared that it was possible that she would be arrested if she returned to Iran because of what she had said to the authorities in early XXXX 2001, she was asked why, in that case, she had been allowed to leave the country in XXXXX 2001. She first replied that she had not been authorized to do so; then, contradicting herself, she immediately asserted that it was the intervention of a member of the Iranian parliament that had helped her to obtain the authorization to leave the country.\nThe claimant contradicted herself, not only in the same answer, but also contradicted her written narrative to the effect that after she and her husband met with a first refusal in XXXX 2001, due to insufficient supporting evidence, the member of parliament in question helped them to obtain, from the Medical Council, a letter certifying that the health services of her country were unable to provide XXXXXX with the care that his condition required. According to her written narrative, the intervention of the member of parliament-whose name she was unable to recall at the hearing-was only required to obtain a letter from the Medical Council, not to obtain a visa to leave Iran.\nFurthermore, the claimant could not remain credible when she claimed, under oath, that she did not have authorization to leave Iran, although in answer to Question 26(d) of her PIF, she had indicated that her country had granted her an exit visa for an unlimited period of time, as can be seen from her stamped passport.\nSince these contradictions concern essential elements of the claimant's allegations, they have dealt a fatal blow to her credibility.\nMy negative finding in this regard is reinforced by the claimant's attitude and behaviour on arriving in Canada, which indicate that she did not have a real fear of persecution by reason of her political opinion. The evidence shows that the claimant arrived in Canada on September 19, 2001 with the sole purpose of having her son XXXXXX treated in XXXXX. She only filled out the claim documents on October 29. She said that she did so because her husband had called to tell her that she had been given notice to appear before the Islamic court.\nApart from the fact that this allegation of a notice to appear in court has been found not to be credible for the reasons given above, the claimant's allegation that her fear of returning to Iran was triggered by her husband's announcement that she was wanted by the Islamic justice system is not serious because, according to the logic of her own narrative, she had been notified on XXXX, 2001 that she would soon be given notice by the court to appear before it. If she knew more than one month before leaving her country that she faced a risk of persecution, it is not credible for her to maintain that her fear of persecution originated with her husband's call. In this sense, her delay in seeking Canada's international protection allows the panel to find that her fear is not genuine.\nMoreover, if what the claimant says is true, she made very serious accusations against the Iranian regime. However, it seems implausible to believe, in the circumstances, that the authorities would only have taken action after her departure, and that the same authorities would have granted her, in the meantime, an exit visa for an unlimited period of time. These implausibilities add to the lack of credibility as a whole.\nOn the basis of all the facts, I find it reasonable to conclude that the claimant simply invented her story of political persecution in Iran after arriving in Canada, when she realized that the treatment that was to be given to her young son XXXXXX under a more protracted treatment plan would take much longer than the time limit indicated in her Minister's residence permit, due to expire on XXXXXX, 2001.\nMoreover, the claimant repeatedly emphasized, in her testimony, that she was not rich, that she and her husband had obtained financial help from their families, and that her stay in Canada had indebted her to them. The claimant's insistence on talking about her financial situation has raised doubts about her real reasons for making a refugee protection claim and has led the panel to believe that her attempt to obtain another status in Canada is motivated instead by economic considerations.\nI wish to state here that I am aware of the heavy burden that weighs upon the claimant. Her young son XXXXXXX state of health obliges her to be constantly with him and to seek specialized, experienced care. The last time she entrusted her child to a babysitter, in XXX 2002, the result was another fracture of a femur. Consequently, she no longer dares to place her child in the care of others, and this explains the presence of XXXXX throughout the hearing. This also explains the extreme fatigue that the claimant so obviously suffers from, and no doubt her desire to do anything she can so that her son will be properly treated.\nWhile the claimant's circumstances, so difficult in human terms, help the panel to understand her motives more clearly, they are not sufficient for her to be given the benefit of the doubt regarding the credibility of her allegations in support of her claim.\nMy negative finding concerning the claimant's credibility and her allegations has a negative impact on her refugee protection claim as a whole. Since I do not seriously believe that she faces persecution in Iran for her political opinion, I cannot conclude that there is a well-founded risk of cruel and unusual treatment that would result from a prohibition on leaving Iran, since the claimant has not shown, in a credible manner, that such a prohibition would likely be imposed on her in future.\nFinally, the claimant did not raise the issue of a danger of torture in Iran, and nothing in the evidence-especially given my findings on credibility-would allow me to have serious reasons for believing that she would incur such a risk.\n2- The claim of the minor child\nThe claimant said that the Iranian doctors took a long time to make a correct diagnosis of her son's disease; hence, in her opinion, the child has suffered enormously and to no avail.\nIn the absence of any clear evidence of wilfully malevolant acts directed against the young claimant, I cannot conclude that he was the victim of any persecutorial acts. It is evident that the attending physicians in Iran did not have the advanced expertise required to recognize and treat the symptoms of a disease that is, moreover, very rare.\nThe inability of doctors-or of a country-to provide adequate medical or health care, in the absence of evidence to establish that this lack or inadequacy of care is due to discriminatory policies or choices that have as their purpose to harm a claimant or a specific population, in whole or in part, cannot amount to persecution within the meaning of the Convention.\nFurthermore, according to section 97(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, where the risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment results from this incapacity, a person is not a \"person in need of protection.\"\nIn addition, nothing in the documentary evidence filed on the record, with which the claimant was duly confronted both on her own account and in her capacity as designated representative of her son, would allow a finding that her young son XXXXXX is at risk of being persecuted in Iran because he is a child or because he has a disability.\nFinally, since the claimant's allegations were found not to be credible in this regard, there is nothing to allow a finding that the Iranian authorities would refuse without due cause to allow the child to leave the country again if he were to require further specialized care not available in Iran.\nIn conclusion, let me note that in my opinion, the claimant will surely find, with the Minister or his representatives, an attentive ear that will enable her to extend her residence permit in Canada until completion of the treatment plan being followed by the physicians at the XXXXXX Hospital.\nCONCLUSION\nFor these reasons, I determine that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXX are neither Convention refugees under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act nor persons in need of protection under section 97(1) of the Act. Consequently, I reject their refugee protection claims.\nGilles \u00c9thier\nMe Gilles \u00c9thier\nOctober 28, 2002\nDate\nKEYWORDS - INADEQUATE HEALTH AND MEDICAL CARE - RISK TO LIFE AND RISK OF CRUEL AND UNUSUAL TREATMENT OR PUNISHMENT - NEGATIVE - FEMALE - MALE - MINORS - IRAN\nNo. dossier SPR \/ RPD file #: MA2-00613\nMA2-00614\n9\n",

He claims, first, to have a well-founded fear of persecution in Guinea by reason of his imputed political opinion and, second, to be a \"person in need of protection\"1 since, as he alleges, he is at risk of being tortured and of dying as a result of that torture.\nIn support of his claim, he alleged that he had been a XXX in Gueckedou. He sold XXXXX in bags that had his name on them to facilitate their identification during transportation from Conakry, where he purchased them, to Gueckedou, where he sold them.\nIn XXXXXX 2000, rebels from Liberia and Sierra Leone raided his shop and stole his bags of XXXX. Fearing for his life in a region where war was being waged between the Guinean army and the rebels, he returned to live in Conakry.\nIn XXXXXXX 2001, he was arrested and imprisoned by the army, which was seeking out accomplices of the rebel undesirables. The army claimed to have evidence that the claimant was providing rice to the rebels, who had come to destabilize Guinea. Indeed, the army had seized bags of XXXXXX bearing the claimant's name.\nDuring six months of imprisonment, the claimant allegedly endured an intense interrogation. Among other mistreatments, he allegedly had his elbows bound together and was beaten and forced to kneel in the sun. He claims that he was flogged four times a day to make him reveal his ties with the rebels. The more he denied it, the harder his alleged torturers were on him.\nHe allegedly managed to escape with the help of his friends. After two months of hiding, he left Guinea armed with a Canadian visa.\nDECISION\nThe panel considers that the claimant is a person in need of protection because there is a serious possibility that he would be subjected personally to a danger of torture.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\nThe panel concludes that the claimant has Guinean citizenship. This was established by his passport and a series of documents obtained from the Canadian embassy in Conakry.\nCredibility\nThe claimant gave a direct, detailed testimony in simple words. His testimony did not contradict the information contained in his Personal Information Form (PIF). The panel could therefore not reach a negative conclusion regarding the claimant's credibility.\nDanger of torture\nThe claimant, aware that he is being sought, alleged during the hearing that if he had to return to Guinea, he would be arrested, imprisoned and tortured by the security forces in order to make him admit his complicity with the rebels and give them the names of other people he is assumed to know.\nIn the panel's opinion, it is obvious that the harm feared is equivalent to torture.\nThe harm the claimant fears he would suffer resembles the detailed description he gave of the abuse he was subjected to in prison before escaping, in particular the flogging of his hips, his elbows being bound with rope and being exposed to the sun while on his knees and against a wall.\nIn any event, the panel is of the opinion that these are acts by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted for the purpose of obtaining a confession.\nThe documentary evidence in the file indicates that this humiliating treatment is inflicted by members of the security forces, as is shown by the following passage from Exhibit A-2:2\nSerious human rights abuses include: Extrajudicial killings; disappearances; use of torture, beatings, and rape by police and military personnel; and police abuse of prisoners and detainees. (...) Members of the security forces committed abuses with impunity.\nIt should be noted that if he were to return, the claimant would be subject to an extrajudicial procedure that heightens a risk that is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions.\nIn view of section 97, subsection 1, paragraph (a) which states that \"a person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally [...] to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture\", it is appropriate to examine the standard of proof under this section. This involves a consideration of the possible equivalence of the terms \"reasonable chance\", \"serious possibility\" and \"substantial grounds to believe\", since appears to the panel that the standard to be applied is that of a \"serious possibility\" and that it is the existence of such a possibility that the claimant must demonstrate.\nFirst, given that the risk involved is a prospective one, the panel is of the opinion that the standard to be applied should be the standard that prevails in the examination of claims for refugee protection based on the definition of \"Convention refugee\". In the present case, the prospective nature of the risk is based on the culture of violence within the Guinean police force.\nSecond, the panel considers that the standard of a \"serious possibility\" is increased by the fact that the danger of torture is, obviously, an aggravated form of the harm feared by the claimant.\nThe panel's conclusion with regard to the standard to be applied is based on international and Canadian case law on this subject.\nIt is worthwhile to mention this case law, beginning at the international level. In Kacaj,3 it appeared that the expressions \"reasonable possibility\", \"serious reasons to think\" and \"serious possibility\" indicate the same degree of risk as the term \"real risk\". The British tribunal that heard the case concluded that two different criteria or legal standards could not be applied to the same set of facts. This represents a requirement for logic and consistency.\nWith regard to Canadian case law on this subject, it is appropriate to note that in Suresh,4 the Supreme Court of Canada uses as equivalents the expressions \"substantial risk of torture\" and \"substantial grounds to believe\" he or she would be tortured on return.\nFurthermore, it should be noted that the expressions \"substantial risk of torture\" and \"real risk\" seem to be equivalent in meaning to those appearing in Adjei,5 specifically \"good grounds for fearing\", \"serious possibility\" and \"reasonable chance\" in the context of the definition of \"Convention refugee\".\nGiven the objectives set out in the current Act with regard to refugees, the panel does not believe that the legislative intent was to make access to protection more difficult for people at risk of torture than for those at risk of persecution. Indeed, allegations of possible mistreatment can meet both the definition torture, as set out in Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture, and the definition of refugee, as formulated in section 96 of the Act. If the legal standard were higher than the standard applied to claims for refugee protection based on the definition of \"Convention refugee\", people for whom there is a serious possibility of torture would not be protected. Consequently, the panel considers that the expression \"substantial grounds to believe\" refers to the existence of a serious possibility of torture, and the panel applied this standard to the facts of the present case.\nInternal flight alternative\nFollowing the claimant's testimony, which was deemed credible, the panel considers that the claimant has no internal flight alternative, given that he is being sought by the State regarding a matter of internal security.\nCONCLUSION\nThe panel finds that XXXXXXXXXXXX is a person in need of protection; consequently, his claim for refugee protection is allowed.\nJos\u00e9 wa Tshisungu Tshisungu\nJos\u00e9 wa Tshisungu Tshisungu\nAugust 7, 2002\nDate\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C.

He fled his country on XXXXXX, 2001, for fear of being imprisoned after a formal charge of libeling some directors of the XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX, of which he was an employee from XXXXXX to March XXXX.\nAccording to the claimant, under Argentine law an employer and employee who enter into an agreement about the employee's rights, for example in the case of a cessation of work, must, in order for that agreement to have legal effect, record it in writing and have it examined by a conciliator from the XXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXX before it can be certified.\nThe claimant said that his role under the law consisted of checking the identity of the parties, whether they were appearing voluntarily, whether the documentation was complete and, above all, whether the employee fully understood all the terms and effects of the agreement. If not, the claimant did not approve the agreement requiring certification.\nWith the advent of a new government at the end of 1999 and the arrival of a group of new directors at the Department, it seems that the policies and ways of acting of the XXXXXX XXXXX changed considerably. The focus was now on efficiency and faster certification of agreements. The claimant did not approve of that new focus on speed, which according to him was against the workers' interests, as many agreements presented did not grant the employees concerned all the benefits to which they were entitled. According to him, certifying agreements without close perusal meant closing one's eyes to the abuses and malpractices of many employers.\nThe claimant did not hesitate to give expression to his views on the new service guidelines. He continued to do his work \"by the book\", as he said, despite being rebuked by his superiors and ostracized by his colleagues. Soon he was being harassed by his superior officer and treated in a high-handed manner because he refused to change his attitude.\nOn XXXX, 2001, he was dismissed from his post, despite the fact that he was a public servant appointed by ministerial order. He said that by XXXX 2001 he had exhausted all his administrative recourses following what he considered his wrongful dismissal.\nIn XXXX 2001, he decided to write a notarized letter to the Argentine Minister of Labour to request an interview and reinstatement in his post. He denounced his superiors and the lawyers from the XXXXX XXXXXXX XXXXX in that letter, going so far as to accuse them of fraudulent tactics with regard to employees who had recourse to the Service, to the benefit of some dishonest employers.\nAt the hearing, the claimant admitted he had no material evidence to support his charges, but said the mere fact that agreements disadvantageous to workers had been accepted proved that there was collusion between the directors of the Service and some employers.\nThe claimant did not have his interview with the Minister. Then he discovered that an administrative inquiry about him had been ordered, for the purpose, he said, of blackening his reputation for good, thereby preventing him from holding any other position in the public service in Argentina. He does not know when that administrative inquiry took place, but thinks it may have been before his dismissal in XXXXX 2001.\nIn XXXX 2001, he was ordered to appear before the court to answer a charge of libel. He consulted a former colleague who told him no lawyer would want to defend him against the lawyers appearing for the XXXXXX XXXXXX. As he was due to appear on XXXXX, 2001 and was in a panic at the very idea of finding himself in an Argentine prison, the claimant decided to flee to the United States, as he did not need a visa to go there.\nHe therefore left his country on XXXXX, 2001. He stayed in the United States until March 2002 without claiming refugee status. He said he had consulted an expert in immigration who told him he risked being imprisoned if he applied for US protection, because he had greatly overstayed his permitted time on American soil. He consequently came to the Canadian border on\nMarch 7, 2002 and claimed refugee status.\nThe claimant fears imprisonment if he ever returns to Argentina. He knows that under the Argentine Criminal Code the sentence for libeling public servants varies from one to three years. He thinks he might be sentenced to the maximum because he was a public servant himself.\nHe says the prisons in Argentina are overcrowded, prisoners are brutally treated and torture is common. He thinks that his status as a public servant would make him even more vulnerable to cruel treatment by other inmates and by prison guards famous for their harshness, especially in the Province of XXXXXXXXX where he was charged.\nHe alleges he will be persecuted because of his political opinion and because he belongs to the social group of \"public servants\".\nANALYSIS:\n1. Exhibits and identity:\nAt the beginning of the hearing the panel refused to allow the claimant to use certain documents, as he had clearly failed to make reasonable efforts to file them at least twenty days before the hearing in accordance with Rule 29.\nHowever, his identity was satisfactorily established, as his passport and identity cards had been seized by the immigration officers and a certified copy of those documents was filed as Exhibit A-20.\n2. Credibility:\nThe panel did not draw a generally negative conclusion about the claimant's credibility because of his lack of diligence in filing his documents. His lack of concern seems to have been promoted by the inexperience of his counsel, who said it was the first time he had represented a client before the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB).\nThe claimant testified in a convincing manner, without contradicting himself, giving spontaneous answers to many often-difficult questions. He seemed sincere and was therefore found credible with regard to the facts alleged, which does not mean that the panel shares his interpretation of those facts or the conclusions he drew from them.\n3. The questions to resolve:\nShould the claimant be excluded because criminal charges are pending against him in Argentina?\nIf not, does he fear persecution on one of the grounds in the refugee definition or does he not rather fear a criminal charge (fear of persecution or fear of prosecution)?\nFinally, if he is not a \"Convention refugee\", is he a \"person in need of protection\" because he would personally be subject to the risk of torture, a risk to his life or cruel and unusual treatment if he were deported to Argentina?\nA. Exclusion:\nThe claimant is accused of libeling some directors of the government service that employed him and is liable in Argentina to a maximum sentence of three years in prison.\nIt is judicial knowledge that, in Canadian law, there is no provision for the crime of \"libel\" as such. However, certain crimes of a similar nature, such as malicious injury to reputation, defamation or laying false information with the police, which are qualified as public mischief, carry a sentence of less than five years in prison.\nThe length of the maximum sentence laid down in an Act or a Criminal Code for a crime or offence seems to be the most simple, straightforward and reliable criterion for assessing the seriousness of a non-political crime with regard to the exclusion clause, as the Act is supposed to reflect the values of society, especially in terms of the level of what the law finds reprehensible or unacceptable.\nIt thus seems justified, especially in light of the other pertinent provisions in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act relating to the admissibility of foreign nationals into Canadian territory, to hold that crimes or offences subject to a sentence of five years or less are not \"serious non-political crimes\" within the meaning of the exclusion clause in question.\nThere is thus no serious reason to think that this claimant has committed a serious non-political crime outside Canada. Consequently, the 1F(b) exclusion clause does not apply to him.\nB. Fear of persecution or fear or being indicted?\nThe claimant affirms that he was persecuted by his superiors in the XXXXX XXXXXX XXXXX because of his political opinion and his membership in the social group of \"public servants\". He considers that the criminal charge of libel pending against him in Argentina is a direct result or continuation of that persecution.\na) Social group:\nFirstly, with regard to the alleged social group, nothing in the evidence permits us to conclude that there is a social group of \"public servants\" in Argentina, whose members are exposed to persecution just because of their membership in the group. After all, members of the public service in that country do not share any innate or unchangeable characteristics just because they are state employees. The claimant's allegation is all the more unrealistic in that his alleged persecutors are members of the same public service as himself.\nClearly, the claimant's problems did not arise from his membership in that group or any other group. The cause of his troubles is too closely linked to his own actions, his personal attitude, his expression of disagreement and his refusal to follow the instructions of his superiors in his work, for us to conclude that he risks persecution because of his membership in a particular social group.\nb) Political opinion:\nThe opinions expressed by the claimant to his colleagues and superiors relate to the application of labour laws and policies and concern the role of the state in protecting Argentine workers' rights. Those opinions can be described as \"political\", as they obviously relate to \"state machinery\" in the broad and generous meaning given by the Supreme Court of Canada to the words \"political opinion\" in Ward.\nHowever, that does not mean that the claimant was persecuted because of his political opinion, or that he risks persecution if he returns to Argentina.\nFirst of all, he was clearly dismissed because he was not performing his duties according to the guidelines he had been given. The whole of the claimant's testimony confirms that way of seeing things. After many verbal confrontations with his superiors and colleagues about how cases should be dealt with, he had a meeting in XXXXX 2000 with the director of the service, who told him to stop repeating that workers were being abused because they were after all receiving some compensation and in any event the orders stating that cases should be dealt with expeditiously came from above and he must comply or face the consequences.\nThe claimant says he went on doing his work meticulously, without taking any notice of those guidelines. His employer dismissed him for that reason on XXXXX, 2001, thereby exercising his legitimate management rights. That dismissal does not constitute persecution in the circumstances.\nc) Fear of prosecution:\nMore than once, the claimant said he would not have left Argentina but for the criminal charges against him, implying that those charges are the only source of his fear of return.\nThe charges result from the libelous letter he sent to the Minister of Labour, in which he accused some of his superiors by name of dishonesty, without any proof other than his personal conclusions.\nThe persons libeled did not threaten him in return; they did not have him beaten up by thugs or take any persecutory action against him in the broad sense. They had recourse to the justice system. So they used legal channels to remedy an attack on their rights by the claimant. This is a far cry from the usual scenario where an agent of persecution takes justice into his own hands.\nFurthermore, the claimant is not accused of a political offence. The charge of libel is not a pretext to penalize him for his political opinion, but an act to punish him for his defamatory statements.\nAccording to my analysis of the evidence, the claimant does not risk persecution on any of the grounds in the definition and is consequently not a \"Convention refugee\".\nC. Person in need of protection:\nThe claimant alleges there are serious reasons to believe that he risks being subject to torture and cruel or unusual treatment if he is imprisoned in Argentina. He points out that the prisons in his country are overcrowded, the conditions of detention are appalling, torture by guards is systematic and the fact that he was a public servant would make him even more vulnerable to cruel and unusual treatment by the guards and the other prisoners.\nI was particularly struck by the claimant's pallor when he spoke of his possible incarceration in Argentina. His attitude reflected a genuine state of panic at the mere idea of finding himself in detention there. It must be said that a careful reading of the documentary evidence in the file fully confirms the validity of his apprehensions in that connection.\nHowever, we have to determine if those bad conditions in prison are not simply inherent in or incidental to the legitimate sanctions that would be imposed on him as a result of the charges of libel pending against him. But first, a word on the standard of proof necessary to analyse the evidence in the case.\na) Standard of proof:\nWith regard to torture and cruel and unusual treatment, I consider the standard of proof to be a \"serious possibility\", that is to say more than a mere possibility but less than a real probability. In that connection, I agree with the reasoning of my colleague Jos\u00e9 Tshisungu in his decision of August 7, 2002. The decision was rendered in MA2-00869, reported in the Reflex of September 5, 2002, No. 195, and based on the Act and pertinent Canadian and foreign caselaw. Like him, I think it appropriate to apply the same standard of proof in the case of refugee claimants and persons in need of protection, because, in the objectives of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the Legislator took care to put all claimants on an equal footing.\nFurthermore, the same forward-looking assessment process is followed both in assessing whether the risk of persecution is well-founded and in assessing the risk of torture or cruel and unusual treatment and, since in all cases a serious violation of fundamental rights is at issue, I feel it would be inappropriate, unjust and inequitable to impose on claimants fearing torture or cruel and unusual treatment a heavier burden of proof than on someone fearing persecution on one of the grounds in the refugee definition.\nKeeping that standard of proof in mind, therefore, in concluding whether or not there is a serious possibility that he will be tortured or suffer cruel or unusual treatment if he is deported to Argentina, I shall take into account not only the situation in Argentine prisons but also the claimant's personality.\nb) Situation in prisons:\nThe documentary evidence filed clearly states that torture is very prevalent in Argentine prisons and the problem is very serious. Many international agencies recognized and respected in the defence of human rights have concluded that such is the case and stressed the very poor overall quality of the detention conditions experienced by prisoners in that country.\nFor example, in Exhibit A-4, the 2001 Country Reports of the US State Department on Argentina, it is stated at page 1:\n\"Torture and brutality by police and prison guards were serious problems. In some cases the authorities investigated and sanctioned those responsible for abuses, but impunity is a problem.\"\nAt page 5, the same report explains:\n\"The Constitution prohibits torture, and the Criminal Code provides penalties for torture similar to those for homicides; however, torture and brutality by police and prison guards remain serious problems. Human rights organizations described widespread police brutality, the use of torture on suspects, and corruption within the prison and police forces. The Government often investigated reports of police brutality, but in some jurisdictions, such as Mendoza Province and greater XXXXXXXXX, threats to witnesses and advocates made prosecution of abuses and reform more difficult. On January 25, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture released a report that recalled concerns raised in the Commission's 2000 review of the third periodic report of the country under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In particular, it noted concern about allegations indicating that torture and excessive use of force by police officials were a 'widespread problem and that government mechanisms established to address it are inadequate' The U.N. Special Rapporteur expressed concern about prison conditions and cited specifically \"the severe overcrowding and the poor quality of basic necessities and services, including food, clothing and medical care.\nIn August (2001) three federal judges strongly criticized \"the generalized practice of torture in all its forms in a systematic way, in the area of investigations and the treatment of detainees, especially in the province of XXXXXXXXX, where there is a history of authoritarian style state violence.\" One judge described the situation as \"very serious\". (...) The judges' report was based in part on an 11-month investigation by the XXXXXXXXX provincial public defender, Mario Coriolano, who reported 602 cases of torture in jails and police stations in the province between March 2000 and June 2001. Most of these were punches and kicks to various parts of the body, baton blows, and threats ( some with firearms). There were also cases of applications of electric shock (a habitual practice from the military dictatorship) and \"dry submarine\"(asphyxia with a plastic bag). The judges, as well as the penitentiary system's own attorney, pointed to the few instances of complaints sustained in the courts because of the difficulty in obtaining proof due to prisoners' fear of reprisals. \" (My underlining)\nThat finding is confirmed by Human Rights Watch in its 2002 report, filed as Exhibit A-5. We read at page 116:\n\"Ill-treatment was common in police stations where young offenders were held in overcrowded and squalid conditions. Methods of torture reported including beatings, hooding with plastic bags almost to the point of suffocation, and the use of electric shock batons on sensitive parts of the body, techniques in widespread use when Argentina was under military rule. These practices were almost frequently reported in the populous greater XXXXXXXXX area. In July, Mario Coriolano, the chief state defense attorney attached to the criminal appeals court in the province of XXXXXXXXX, issued a report to the provincial Supreme Court giving details of more than six hundred complaints of ill-treatment and torture made from March 2000 until July 2001. By late October the court had information on more than 1,000 cases. In August, four respected federal judges publicly expressed concern about the prevalence of torture, asserting that the practice had become systematic in both police stations and prisons. \" (My underlining)\nc) Conclusions:\nThat eloquent documentary evidence from credible international observers permits us to consider the claimant's fears highly plausible, especially as he is charged in the province of XXXXX XXXX.\nThe acts described in the passages cited certainly constitute torture as they are committed by officers of the state who intentionally inflict severe pain or suffering on prisoners. Furthermore, it is reasonable to believe that the US State Department, Human Rights Watch and the United Nations Rapporteur, when they use the term \"torture\", are referring to the definition of torture in Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture,1 to which section 97(1)(a)2 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act also refers.\nThe claimant is right in saying that Argentine prisons are overcrowded, as the Country Reports cited above reveal, at page 6, that, according to the Argentine Minister of Justice, 43,174 prisoners were occupying the 30,703 places available in the country's prisons in April 2001.\nThose facts, added to the evidence of the poor detention conditions described by the United Nations Rapporteur, and the climate of violence and corruption prevalent in prisons, especially those in the province of XXXXXXXXX where he would probably be held, make it reasonable to believe that the claimant certainly risks suffering ill-treatment to a point beyond what Canadian public opinion would find acceptable in all conscience.\nWhen Argentine judges state that torture is systematic in prisons in their country, that means it may affect any prisoner. If that prisoner is also a stubborn person who has difficulty following orders, as the evidence shows the claimant to be, the risk of his being tortured certainly meets the standard of a \"serious possibility\", in view of all the circumstances.\nSentencing the claimant to imprisonment for the crime of libel would certainly be a lawful sanction in his country. But his exposure to cruel or unusual treatment or torture in prison could not be described as arising from, inherent in or incidental to that lawful sanction. That risk would rather arise from the dangerous prison system in his country and the systematic recourse by officers of the state to torture as a means of punishment within the prisons.\nThe evidence thus permits the conclusion that the claimant would personally be subject to cruel or unusual treatment and even a serious risk of torture, if he returned to Argentina.\nFor these reasons, I find that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is a \"person in need of protection\" and I therefore accept his claim for refugee protection.\nGilles \u00c9thier\nMe Gilles \u00c9thier\nSeptember 18, 2002\nDate\n\/np\n1 Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.\n1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term \"torture\" means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.\n2 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. (2001), ch. 27, reads as follows:\n\"97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\n(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or\n(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.\"\nNEXUS - Positive - Argentina\nEXCLUSION CLAUSES - ART. 1F(b) - SERIOUS NON-POLITICAL CRIME - POSITIVE - MALE - ARGENTINA\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRPD File # \/ No. dossier SPR : MA2-01726\n11\n",

He also claims Refugee Protection for fear of a risk to life, or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or torture.\nThe evidence included the claimant's Personal Information Form (PIF)1, his examination under oath, and the exhibits provided by both claimant's Counsel and Refugee Protection Officer (RPO), the latter of whom was not present at the hearing.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant is a Tamil farmer who lived his life in XXXXX, northern Sri Lanka, some seven kilometres away from XXXXX town. He has six years of education. He is married with three sons, who presently range in age from 17 to 22 years old. As a result of living in northern Sri Lanka through the 1990s to the present day, the claimant came into conflict with the various combatants in the Sri Lankan Civil War, namely the Sri Lankan Armed Forces (SLAF) and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). The LTTE used to \"borrow\" the claimant's tractor and attempted to extort funds from him. The army had detained him on several occasions, questioned the claimant and severely assaulted him.\nThe situation came to a head on the XXXXX 2002. The LTTE took the claimant's tractor, which was found later by the military with boxes of dynamite. The claimant was arrested and tortured by the military in their camp. He was detained until the XXXXX 2002, whereupon a bribe was paid. The LTTE came to see the claimant as they had been made aware that the claimant had given \"information\" to the army during his detention. Fearing for his life, the claimant went to Colombo and left Sri Lanka of the XXXXXX 2002, making the present refugee claim in Canada upon his arrival on the 18th of March 2002.\nDETERMINATION\nThe panel determines that as the claimant's evidence is lacking in credibility and trustworthiness, he is not a \"Convention refugee\", nor is he a \"person in need of protection\" for a risk to life, or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or torture.\nANALYSIS\nThe panel finds a general lack of credibility with respect to this claim.\nA critical issue in all refugee claims is one of identity. The claimant has an obligation to provide the panel2 with acceptable documentation to establish his identity, and if not to provide reasonable explanations. This was not so in the present case. The claimant' only identification document is a Birth Certificate3, which was issued in 1994. He did not provide any photo identification. He left Sri Lanka with his Sri Lankan National Identity Card (NIC) and Driver's License. According to the claimant, this was taken by the \"agent\" on the last leg of their flight to New York City. Why was this the case? The claimant testified that the agent advised him that being in possession of this documentation could put the claimant at risk, as he was travelling on a false identity. Where was this Birth Certificate? According to the claimant, it was in his pants pocket in his bag. Why was his Birth Certificate separated from his NIC and Driver's License? The claimant had no explanation. He was therefore asked, when he cleared the American customs at the airport of New York, why the agent did not give him back his documents. The claimant had no explanation; he said that the agent appeared to be in a hurry. The panel does not believe that the claimant is being truthful or that he is a credible witness. He has not met his obligation to provide acceptable documentation or reasonable explanations for their absence.\nIn other instances, there were also a lack of credibility and plausibility in his claim. For example, the explanation concerning how the claimant cleared customs at the Kennedy Airport in New York. The claimant alleges that he did not have to identify himself at the Kennedy Airport in New York. According to the claimant, the agent did all the talking for him and advised the US Immigration official that the claimant was too drunk to answer questions. His explanation was not believed by Canadian Immigration upon his arrival at the border4, nor is he believed by the panel. In light of September 11th, 2001, the panel does not believe it credible or plausible that an individual would have been able to enter the United States in such a manner, without raising suspicion and further investigation. The claimant is not a credible witness.\nThe claimant alleges that he lived all his life, until his departure in XXXXX 2001, some few kilometres from XXXXX town. Yet, when the panel asked the claimant what he recalled was going on in the Sri Lankan Civil War in the months of April, May and June of 2000, the claimant testified that there was some \"peace talks and then some bombing\". The claimant appeared to be completely unaware of LTTE operations and \"unceasing waves\", serious bombardments and displacements of thousands in and around XXXXX town during that period of time. The claimant's lack of recollection of these details, in the panel's mind, places further doubt on his credibility. The panel does not believe that the claimant was even in Sri Lanka in the year 2000.\nThe claimant also provided contradictory evidence during the course of his testimony. For example, the claimant was initially asked by the panel with what airline he flew into New York City. The claimant testified that it was American Airlines. The claimant was reminded that he did not tell Canadian Immigration, upon his arrival5, this information. The claimant testified that he was told by the agent not to reveal the airline that was taken to New York City. However, later in his testimony, when the claimant was asked what specific instructions the agent provided him when he left the airport in New York City, the claimant did not mention the issue of American Airlines. When confronted, the claimant had no explanation.\nThe claimant also provided contradictory evidence with respect to problems his son would have had with the SLAF. The claimant testified initially that on occasion, the army would come to the farm and ask some questions of the boys, and looked to see whether or not they had scars of battle. However, nothing further was done. When the panel (given especially the age of the boys) expressed surprise at this, the claimant then altered his testimony to say that on occasion, the SLAF threatened to take his sons from him. Again, the claimant is providing inconsistent and contradictory evidence. He is simply not a credible witness.\nCONCLUSION\nFor all the above-mentioned reasons, the panel concludes that the claimant, Mr. XXXXXXXXXXX, is not a \"Convention refugee\" within the meaning of Section 966 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, nor is he a \"person in need of protection\" as defined in Section 97(1) a) and b)7 of the same Act.\nMichael Hamelin\nMe Michael Hamelin\nAugust 27th, 2002\nDate\nD\/ar\n1 Exhibit P-1 : Personal Information Form of the claimant.\n2 Section 106 of the IRPA\n3 Exhibit P-2 : Birth Certificate of the claimant, with translation.\n4 Exhibit A-4 : Immigration documents.\n5 Ibid.\n6 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C.

He says that he fears for his life in his country because of the political opinion imputed to him by corrupt high-ranking members of the military and by former agents of the government secret services.\nThe evidence reveals that since XXXXX, 1999 the claimant had worked in the XXXXXXX XXXXXX department of the Bank of XXXXXX XXXX XXX whose majority shareholder was the XXXXXXXXXXXX for XXXXXXX XXXX XXXXX XXXXXX.\nIn XXXXX 2001, in connection with the investigations that the new government was conducting into the corruption that had been rampant under Fujimori and Montesinos and as part of the fight against laundering of drug trafficking dollars, the Bank's management collaborated with the government by undertaking a full compilation of large international transfers made since 1990.\nThe work was entrusted to the claimant, who was authorized to access computerized records and data. He resolutely accepted his new duties, as he was convinced of the justice of the fight against the profiteers of the former regime.\nIn XXXXX 2001, the claimant began to receive anonymous telephone calls at his office, then at his home. His callers, without identifying themselves, told him that they belonged to the intelligence service. They threatened him with death if he refused to hand over to them the originals of the compromising documents contained in the records he had to consult. Then he found himself shadowed when he moved about from place to place.\nThe claimant was worried because he knew that many civil servants and members of the military were being compromised in the research he was doing. He informed his superior, who told him to be careful, while encouraging him to continue with his work.\nOn XXXXXXX, 2001, when he had practically finished compiling information, he was intercepted on the road near his house by two individuals who identified themselves as members of the National Intelligence Service (SIN). They beat him and threatened to kill him, demanding that he turn over to them the originals of the records and documents that he was investigating. They searched his vehicle, but were forced to leave him alone when a private surveillance agent arrived, drawn to the scene by the noise of people shouting.\nAfter this incident, the claimant hastened to submit his report to his superior. The claimant was sure that the compelling evidence the report contained against a number of high-ranking individuals would definitely result in charges being laid against them. The claimant feared reprisals from these individuals, especially since he had been identified and had refused to collaborate with their henchman by handing the evidence over to them.\nThe claimant therefore took a few weeks of holiday-that was the official story-but actually went to hide at the home of a friend. It was there that he made the decision to flee Peru. On XXXXX, 2001 he went to the United States. Since XXXXX 2000, he had been in possession of an American visa, which he had obtained with the idea of possibly going on vacation.\nHe was therefore allowed into the United States for six months. On XXXXXX, 2002 he applied to have his permit of stay extended for another six months. In the meantime, he consulted three lawyers, who told him that he had no chance of obtaining refugee protection. He did not want to face the possibility of being illegally on American soil, and in surfing the Internet, he learned that he could come to Canada. He therefore came to the Canadian border on March 21, 2002 to seek refuge.\nAt the hearing, the claimant said that he feared vengeance from the important figures implicated by his report. The report contained a list of approximately 25 individuals and companies: members of the military, public officials, and business people and companies associated with them. The claimant's report was delivered to the Congress Committee, and charges were laid against the individuals in question. Some of them have been arrested, and an active hunt is in progress for others.\nThe claimant has had news of his family. There have been no calls to his home, but shortly before the hearing, his brother-in-law told him that bizarre individuals were lurking around the house.\nThe claimant said that he had never asked for the protection of the Congress because he doubted that he could have been, or would be, protected against the powerful personalities targeted by his investigation. The threats and aggression he has suffered lead him to believe that these people have the means to track him down and punish him. They have, he said, connections and contacts everywhere in the country. As evidence of this, he said it is highly probable that they have friends in the Bank because they knew he was responsible for the internal investigation of the Bank's records.\nDETERMINATION\nAfter analyzing all the testimony and documentary evidence, I find that the claimant has established that he is in need of Canada's protection.\nANALYSIS\nThe claimant testified in a frank and direct manner, answering all the questions, which were sometimes difficult, and providing many highly relevant details. He was able to satisfy me of the role he played in the Bank. His explanations concerning the manner in which he conducted his investigation of the Bank's records have persuaded me that what he said was plausible. Consequently, I have found the claimant to be credible.\nHis identity has been established satisfactorily.\nAlthough the claimant stated that he had agreed to undertake the investigation because he fully supported the government's fight against corruption and money laundering, I am not satisfied, based on the evidence, that the claimant was targeted because of his political opinion. Those who apparently wanted to attack him seem to have been motivated essentially by a desire for vengeance because he had refused to hand over, or to make disappear, evidence that was damning for highly placed individuals, or by their desire to prevent him from possibly testifying in court about the discoveries that had been made as a result of his investigation.\nNothing in the evidence would allow me to find that the claimant publicly expressed his opinion. Consequently, I find that the claimant is not at risk of persecution by reason of the opinion he has expressed or by reason of any political opinion that might be imputed to him.\nMoreover, the claimant was targeted by these individuals because of his work-what he did-not because of his membership in any particular social group.\nThe evidence therefore does permit a finding of a risk of persecution for one of the grounds enumerated in the definition of \"Convention refugee.\"\nHowever, the evidence does permit a finding that the life of the claimant would be at risk if he returned to Peru. The people who hold a grudge against him still have significant means and resources at their disposal, making it possible for them to track him down anywhere in Peru.\nIn this regard, even Jose Ugaz, the man in charge of the commission of inquiry into corruption, declared in January 2002-according to articles produced as Exhibit A-231-that Montesinos continues to threaten people though his emissaries. This allows me to find that there is indeed a serious possibility that former agents of the SIN and high-ranking military will want to do everything they can to relegate the claimant to the silence of the tomb.\nAny consideration of the claimant's long stay of several months in the United States, without claiming the protection of that country, would be irrelevant to these proceedings. The claimant has shown that he had legal status during his stay on American soil; he did not feel that he was in danger at that time because he did not fear being sent back to his country.\nFurthermore, the length of time that elapses before a person claims refugee status is always a useful factor in analyzing the existence of a subjective fear of persecution. In the present case, however, which concerns a person in need of protection, the text of section 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act does not require a claimant to prove that he has such a subjective fear, since the question of being personally subject to a risk to one's life is an issue to be settled by an objective analysis of the facts and circumstances.\nCONCLUSION\nFor these reasons, I determine that XXXXXXXXXXXX is a \"person in need of protection\" pursuant to section 97(1)(b) of the Act. Consequently, I accept his claim for refugee protection.\nGilles \u00c9thier\nMe Gilles \u00c9thier\nDecember 23, 2002\nDate\n1 Exhibit A-23, press clippings, in a bundle.\nKEYWORDS - RISK TO LIFE - POSITIVE - MALE - PERU\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nNo. dossier SPR \/ RPD file #: MA2-02104\n5\n",

On November 5, 2002, it rendered its oral decision and reasons on tape. In accordance with Article 62 of the Rules for the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), the Minister's counsel requested a copy of the written reasons.\nThe following is the written version of the oral decision and reasons, edited for grammar and syntax.\nThese are the reasons for the decision with regard to the claim of Mr. XXXXXXXXXXXXXX.\nThe claimant, Mr. XXXXXXXXXXXXXX, is a 20-year-old citizen of Pakistan. He alleges to have a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of the police and Mujahedin, by reasons of his political opinion. He alleges that he was an active worker of the Jammu and Kashmir People's National Party (JKPNP), at the village level. He alleges that he was threatened and detained by the Mujahedin, and that he was arrested and brutalized by the police on account of his political activities. He claims to have fled Pakistan because the police accused him on false charges, and a warrant is now out for his arrest. In addition, he claims to be a \"person in need of protection\", in that he fears a risk to his life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or torture in Pakistan.\nFirst, on the issue of identity, the claimant produced a national identity card (NIC),1 a birth certificate,2 a state subject certificate,3 and a school certificate,4 attesting to his identity. He was asked many questions about his birth certificate and state subject certificate. He was familiar with all the information appearing on both documents. He explained, to the satisfaction of the panel, why he had applied for his birth certificate and his state subject certificate, issued by the Azad Kashmir government. There was no question asked about his school certificate, and this document remains uncontested.\nExhibit M-15 is a copy of the claimant's NIC and translation, with analysis of the card from an immigration officer. The immigration officer, after examining the card, concludes that although the card appears to be authentic, it has been subject to alteration, providing certain findings that explained why she arrived at this conclusion. In response to Exhibit M-1, the claimant testified that he had personally obtained the NIC in Azad Kashmir.\nThe panel is aware that the authenticity of national identity cards from Pakistan has been regularly sent for expertise by Canada Immigration. The verification would normally be analysed by specialists for counterfeit documents. However, in this case, there is a lack of evidence to establish that the immigration officer is an expert or has background in analysing fraudulent documents. Thus, the panel is not prepared to give much weight to Exhibit M-1. Even if Exhibit M-1 raises doubt about the claimant's NIC, the panel finds his other identity documents sufficient to establish his identity.\nOverall speaking, credibility is the determinative issue in this claim. The panel finds no major contradictions between the claimant's testimony and his Personal Information Form (PIF),6 or between his testimony and the interview made by the Canadian immigration officer.7\nThe claimant was asked to describe the manifesto, the background, and the structure of the JKPNP. He was knowledgeable about these aspects of his party. His involvement in the party was corroborated by a membership card8 and a letter issued by the said party.9 He also produced a letter from a lawyer in Pakistan10 and a copy of his warrant of arrest.11 Both documents were examined, and questions were raised. The panel finds the claimant's testimony to be generally credible.\nMoreover, it is to be noted that the claimant's allegation of his police problem is not inconsistent with the documentary evidence. Documentation clearly shows that JKPNP is an organization which advocates for the independence of Kashmir, which would be free from the ruling of Pakistan.12 Documents13 also indicate that the Pakistani government and establishment in that country do not want Kashmir to emerge as an independent country. The document continues to say that Pakistan will never agree to an independent Kashmir.\nThe question here is: what would be the action of the government to the groups which advocate for the independence? Exhibit A-3 16.2314 states that those who believe in independent Kashmir are not in the good books of Pakistan, and when a person is perceived to be a threat to Pakistani interest, the government would implicate this person in local non-political issues, for example drug dealing, theft, robbery, etc.15 This is consistent with the alleged treatment of the claimant.\nFurther to the lawyer's letter, which gives the Penal Code for the claimant's offences, the claimant testified that the charges that he faces are for \"robbery\" and \"insulting people\". As a whole, the panel finds that the objective evidence supports the claimant's allegations.\nThere were some omissions in the claimant's evidence, particularly in his PIF. For example, in his PIF, he did not talk about the fact that he was beaten on two occasions. Exhibit P-816 does not reflect these incidents either. There was also an omission in the JKPNP letter about the claimant's role of collecting funds for the party at his store. The other issue is the plausibility of the claimant being personally targeted, when the other officials in his party were not having problems. Although the panel is not entirely convinced on this matter, it is willing to grant the claimant the benefit of the doubt, in light of his overall credibility.\nFor these reasons, the panel believes that the claimant is a credible witness. He has therefore established more than a mere possibility that he would be at risk of persecution should he return to Pakistan.\nHaving arrived at this conclusion, the panel finds it unnecessary to further evaluate the claim under Section 97(1)a) and b), as a \"person in need of protection\"17 in Canada.\nThe Refugee Protection Division (RPD) therefore comes to the conclusion that Mr. XXXXXXXXXXXXXX is a \"Convention refugee\",18 as defined in Section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nQueenie Hum\nQueenie Hum\nNovember 21, 2002\nDate\n\/jcbo\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - POLITICAL OPINION - DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE - MALE - POSITIVE - PAKISTAN\n1 Exhibit P-2: National Identity Card of the claimant.\n2 Exhibit P-3: Birth Certificate of the claimant.\n3 Exhibit P-5: State Subject Certificate of the claimant.\n4 Exhibit P-4: Secondary School Certificate of the claimant.\n5 Exhibit M-1: Copy of Pakistani Identity Card number XXXXX and translation with analysis of the card done by GOSSELIN, M\u00e9lanie (Immigration Officer) on August 17, 2002.\n6 Exhibits P-1 and P-1a: Personal Information Form of the claimant, Question 55, and amendments.\n7 Exhibit A-10: Immigration documents en liasse; Interrogatoire Front-End.\n8 Exhibit P-6: JKPNP Identity Card of the claimant.\n9 Exhibit P-7: Letter from the district president of the JKPNP, issued on XXXXX 2002.\n10 Exhibit P-8: Lawyer's letter issued on 25 September 2002.\n11 Exhibit P-9: Arrest Warrant, issued on XXXXX 2002.\n12 Exhibit A-3 16.7: Information Request PAK20262.E, 4 April 1995 (JKPNP\/JKLP: differences in ideology).\n13 Exhibit A-3 16.23: Information Request PAK33583.E, 7 January 2000 (Government's position on groups advocating independence of Kashmir).\n14 Idem.\n15 Supra note 13.\n16 Supra note 10.\n17 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C.

He says that death assuredly awaits him in his country because there are no dialysis machines to treat his serious problem of renal failure resulting from high blood pressure.\nThe claimant lived for 26 years in the United States, where he had permanent resident status. He lost that status because of his criminal convictions and was deported to his country on\nXXXXX, 1999.\nBeing unable to obtain the care required by his medical condition, he left St. Vincent on XXXXXX, 2001 and came to Canada via Trinidad, hoping to receive treatment here. He approached the local community service centre and was told he could not be treated because of his visitor status.\nHe therefore took a bus to the United States on XXXXX, 2001. He was arrested at Champlain and accused of unlawful entry by the US authorities. During his detention, he became so ill that he had to be treated at a hospital in Plattsburgh from XXXXXXX to XXXXXX, 2001. It was explained to him there that dialysis would now be his only salvation.\nAlso on XXXXX, 2001, the US immigration authorities returned him to the Canadian border. He has been in detention since his second arrival in Canada and has been receiving dialysis treatment three times a week at the hospital in XXXX.\nThe claimant completed his refugee claim on January 22, 2002. His application was referred to the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) on April 18, 2002. He filed his PIF on May 17, 2002.\nIn his PIF, he basically states that the St. Vincent authorities are making approaches to neighbouring countries in the archipelago to group their medical services together, partly with the aim of being able to offer dialysis treatment to citizens who urgently need it.\nThe claimant referred to documents stating that there is still no dialysis equipment in St. Vincent and his physical condition is such that he needs that treatment on a continuing basis if he is to remain alive.\nDuring his testimony, the claimant affirmed he would go back to his country immediately if dialysis equipment were available.\nThe claimant alleges he risks persecution in his country because of his membership in a particular social group: persons in St. Vincent suffering from renal failure and requiring dialysis.\nThe claimant also invoked the new provisions of the Act to the effect that his life will be threatened if he is deported to St. Vincent.\nDETERMINATION:\nAfter analysing all the evidence, both oral and documentary, the panel finds that the claimant does not qualify as a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\nANALYSIS:\nThe claimant established his identity in a satisfactory manner.\nThe evidence shows that the claimant first came to Canada for the sole purpose of obtaining treatment. The medical data in the file show he is going to die in the absence of regular dialysis treatment. St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a poor country in the Caribbean that does not currently have any dialysis machines. His country thus cannot offer the claimant the treatment his state of health requires, hence the real threat to his life if he returns there.\nDoes the claimant risk persecution because of his membership in a particular social group?\nAt first sight, the claimant's situation is rather unique and individual, making it difficult to conclude he belongs to a social group according to the Supreme Court of Canada's analysis in Ward of the meaning of that expression.\nHowever, the claimant stated that about twenty people with renal failure have died in St. Vincent in recent years for lack of dialysis treatment. Consequently, it is permissible to think that a certain number of individuals in that country share some unchangeable characteristics, in that they are all afflicted by chronic renal failure and risk immanent death in the absence of dialysis. It could thus be concluded that they form a particular group as they have certain characteristics in common.\nNevertheless, under Canadian refugee law as established by the Supreme Court in Ward, Canada has no obligation to give unlimited asylum and accept responsibility just because a group exists. The alleged persecution must result from the affiliation or membership in a particular social group, in other words the affiliation itself must render the members vulnerable to persecution. But it is clear in this case that the claimant is not vulnerable because of his affiliation or membership in a group; like all the members of his group, he is in danger because of his illness, his personal medical condition.\nEven if one were to conclude that there is a social group consisting of persons in St. Vincent suffering from renal failure and needing dialysis, as about twenty people have apparently died there for lack of kidney dialysis in recent years, there is no evidence to permit the conclusion that those persons are or were victims of persecution by the state or another agent of persecution. The inability of a third world country to offer its population adequate health services does not constitute persecution within the meaning of the \"Convention refugee\" definition.\nIt is true that the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 16, 1966, was ratified by St. Vincent and the Grenadines and that, under Article 12 of that Covenant, that state undertook to create conditions which would assure all its citizens of medical service and medical attention in the event of sickness. However, Article 2 of the Covenant reflects the desire of the international community to take into account the difficulties of many economically less developed countries, by indicating clearly that each state's undertaking should be carried out to the maximum of its available resources.\nFurthermore, the claimant himself alleges that the authorities in his country have started discussions with neighbouring states with a view to making dialysis treatment available. That indicates the opposite of malicious intent or desire to persecute the members of the social group suggested and defined by the claimant and his counsel.\nIt should also be pointed out that the claimant has no real fear of persecution, as he says he would return to his country immediately if a dialysis machine were available there.\nHaving determined that the claimant does not risk persecution in his country, it remains to be determined if he is a person in need of protection within the meaning of the new Act.\nIt has been established that the claimant risks certain death if he is removed to St. Vincent, as he will not be able to obtain there the treatment he needs. So he does not want to return there because he will be in danger of death anywhere in his country.\nHowever, in view of the requirement in paragraph 97(1)(b)(iv)1 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the claimant is clearly not a person in need of protection, given that the threat to his life is caused by the inability of his country to provide adequate health or medical care.\nAlthough this question was never raised by the claimant or the Minister's representative, it should be stressed that nothing in the evidence permits the conclusion that the claimant risks being submitted in St. Vincent to torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention against Torture.\nClaimant's counsel submits that the Act permits the panel to allow this asylum claim on humanitarian grounds. The panel considers it does not have that jurisdiction.\nCONCLUSION\nFor these reasons, the panel does not recognize XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (alias XXXXX) as a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\nGilles \u00c9thier\nMe Gilles \u00c9thier\nAugust 12, 2002\nDate\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. (2001), ch. 27, reads in part as follows:\n\"97.

She claims to have a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of unknown parties because of her family (who were Sandinistas) and at the hands of the Sandinistas by reason of her political opinion. In addition, she claims to be a person in need of protection because she would be subjected personally to a danger of torture or to a risk to her life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Nicaragua.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant alleges the following.\nThe claimant's parents were both deeply committed Sandinistas. Both served as messengers for the movement. Her mother was detained in 1979, cruelly mistreated and never heard from again. Her father fled in 1990, possibly to Cuba. The claimant was raised by her grandmother. In 1990, strangers came calling three times asking for her father. Following the last visit, the house was ransacked. The family received threatening notes thereafter.\nIn September 1999, she was asked by pro-Sandinista students at her university to join in a national student strike. She declined to do so, leading to recriminations that she was a coward. In XXXXXX 1999, her grandmother died. A month after that, she was visited by strangers again, asking about her father and whether she had been involved in the student strike. They left without doing her any harm. The claimant went to stay with a neighbour before deciding to join a relative in Canada. The strangers never identified themselves but allegedly kept the claimant under surveillance for ten years.\nANALYSIS\nThe claimant fears that these strangers, whose identity is unknown but who are anti-Sandinista, will harm her. However, the simple fact remains that they had ample opportunity to harm her in the ten years following her father's departure. No harm occurred. Can we, knowing this, say that there is a serious possibility of the claimant being harmed upon return to Nicaragua? We cannot.\nIn addition to the lack of any attempts at harm by the alleged agents of persecution, there is another reason why I do not consider the claimant's fear of serious harm to be well-founded. This reason has to do with state protection.\nIn Ward,1 the Supreme Court of Canada has linked the well-foundedness of fear to the adequacy of state protection. In its view, a claimant's fear is well-founded if no adequate state protection is available. Conversely, this fear is not well-founded if adequate state protection is available.\nI considered this claim not only from the point of view of whether the claimant is a Convention refugee (Section 96) but also whether she is a person in need of protection under Sections 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b) of IRPA. Since my finding is that state protection exists for the claimant in Nicaragua, my conclusion is that the claimant's fear of serious harm is not well-founded. By serious harm, in the context of this claim, I mean persecution, risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. I do not include torture in the categories mentioned here since there is no evidence of state involvement in the harm feared, as required by Article 1 of the International Convention on Torture.\nFollowing Ward,2 a presumption of adequate state protection exists in every claim unless there is \"clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.\" The claimant has presented no \"clear and convincing\" evidence of Nicaragua's inability to protect her. Her evidence is that she did not even approach the state police or any other state authority to seek protection. Her Personal Information Form (PIF) states that her grandmother told her not to do so for fear of further problems. In her oral testimony, she said that she had been afraid of going to the police. When asked why she had been afraid, the claimant's initial reply was that the police were corrupt. Instead of helping her, they could have\nmistreated her. When pressed further on the matter, she testified that her unseen tormentors had warned her in numerous notes not to go to the police.\nI do not believe the claimant with respect to the notes. I do so for a simple reason. She claimed that she received 200 notes a year for 10 years running. This makes it simply too implausible to be accepted. As for police corruption, she produced no documentary evidence to bear this out. Finally, with respect to her fear that the police could mistreat her, she could establish no basis for that fear.\nWith respect to a claimant's obligation to go to the state for protection, the Federal Court of Appeal has held in Kadenko,3 that\nWhen the state in question is a democratic state...the claimant must do more than simply show that he or she went to see some members of the police force and that his or her efforts were unsuccessful. The burden of proof that rests on the claimant is, in a way, directly proportional to the level of democracy in the state in question: the more democratic the state's institutions, the more the claimant must have done to exhaust all the sources of action open to him or her.\nThe claimant fell far short of what was required of her in terms of seeking protection, considering that Nicaragua is now a democratic state. If it was unreasonable for her to approach the state, she should have been able to show why it was unreasonable.4 She has not done so.\nNot having exhausted the avenues of protection available to her in her own country, the claimant cannot turn to the international community (and Canada, specifically) for surrogate protection.\nDETERMINATION\nBased on the foregoing analysis, I conclude that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is not a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. I therefore reject her claim.\n\"Harindar Aulach\"\nHarindar Aulach\nDATED at Toronto this 17th day of September 2002.\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - POLITICAL OPINION - PERSON IN NEED OF PROTECTION - FEMALE - NEGATIVE - NICARAGUA\nThe claimant's parents were both deeply committed Sandinistas. Her mother disappeared and her father fled Nicaragua. The claimant feared that she would be harmed by unidentified anti-Sandinistas. The Refugee Protection Division considered not only whether the claimant was a Convention refugee but also whether she was a person in need of protection under sections 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The Refugee Division noted that no harm came to the claimant in the ten years following her father's departure. Moreover, state protection was available to the claimant. She did not even approach the police or any other state authority for protection. The claimant was not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.

He claims to be a person in need of protection because he would be subjected personally to a risk to his life or to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Mexico. Counsel for the claimant conceded the claimant was not a Convention refugee, as there was no nexus to one of the enumerated grounds.\nThe claimant alleges the following:\nHe says that he was cutting wood one day at the end of November 2000 on the XXXXX Ranch where he worked. At that time, six men stopped him, pointing their guns at him. They beat him, threatened to cut his finger off, and told him to get off of their mountain.\nAfter pleading with them for his release, they said that they would forgive him but if he came back to their mountain they would kill him.\nHe realized that it must be a marijuana plantation and he ran away and went home. He did not report what he saw to the police because he was also afraid of the police. In testimony he alleged that these six men also warned him that if he contacted the police they would kill him.\nHe moved to Cancun a couple of days later where he remained until XXXX of 2001; some four months.\nNo problems arose in Cancun but because he was afraid these six men would find him there, he moved from Cancun to the United States where he remained until around XXXXXX of 2001. In XXXXX 2001, he crossed the border into Canada, making his claim approximately two weeks later.\nI find that the claimant is not a person in need of protection in that his removal to Mexico would not subject him personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nMy reasons are as follows.\nIDENTITY\nThe claimant's identity as a national of Mexico is established by his testimony and the supporting documentation file: a birth certificate, a marriage certificate, and a voter's identity card bearing a photograph of the claimant of his likeness. Consequently, I find that the claimant is who he says he is and he is a citizen of Mexico from the area of Chiapas.\nCREDIBILITY\nI have found the claimant to be a credible witness and, therefore, believe most of what he has alleged in support of his claim. He testified in a straightforward manner and the inconsistencies in his testimony I will attribute to his lack of sophistication. The claimant has only three years of formal education and gave a very basic presentation of his evidence. I take this into consideration in analyzing the claim.\nHowever, I have found problematic the claimant's conclusion with respect to one material point: the agents of harm seeking him out in Cancun. The claimant has surmised this based upon the threats that he received by these men in XXXXXXXXXX I do not feel that his conclusion is justified in the circumstances, particularly given the fact that he never saw these men again in Cancun or anywhere else after November of 2000.\nI accept that the claimant is afraid of these individuals; however, his fear that they will follow him throughout Mexico is not justified on the evidence.\nNEXUS\nFor the claimant to be a Convention refugee, his fear of persecution must be \"by reason of\" one of the five grounds enumerated in the Convention refugee definition.1 I find, and counsel for the claimant concurs, that the harm feared by the claimant does not fall within one of the five grounds enumerated in the Convention refugee definition. I find, therefore, that the claimant is not a Convention refugee because there is no a connection to any of the five enumerated grounds. In sort, there is no nexus.\nHaving found that the claimant is not a Convention refugee, I then considered whether the harm allegedly feared by the claimant would amount to a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture.\nI do not find that what the claimant fears amounts to a risk of danger of torture.\nMy reasoning for this is that the agents of harm are not public officials or other persons acting in an official capacity. Nor is the purpose of the harm, the severe pain or suffering which may be inflicted for purposes such as obtaining information or a confession, or punishment, intimidation or coercion for any reason based upon discrimination. Therefore, there is no serious possibility or reasonable chance that the claimant faces a danger of torture if he returns to Mexico.\nThat said, the only remaining ground upon which the claimant could be granted protection is under the category of risk to life, or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nHARM FEARED\nThe claimant alleged that should he return to Mexico he would be subjected to the following harm: namely, that he would be killed by the six individuals who threatened him in November of 2000. He claims that this constitutes a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. At issue in this claim is whether the harm which the claimant would allegedly face constitutes cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. The terms \"cruel and unusual\" are not defined in the Act. Canadian jurisprudence has interpreted the phrase \"cruel and usual\" as punishment or treatment that shocks the conscience.2 Treatment that is inhuman or degrading has been equated with cruel and unusual treatment.3 Inhuman treatment has been described as premeditated, applied for hours at a stretch and causing, if not bodily injury, intense physical and mental suffering. Degrading treatment has been described as arousing in its victims feelings of fear, anguish, and inferiority, capable of humiliating and debasing them, and possibly breaking their physical and moral resistance.4\nThe claimant fears six individuals who beat and threatened him once. He did as he was told and there have been no further consequences to his family nor to himself. He did not experience any problems in Cancun nor have any further problems been reported to him or to anyone since this incident almost two years ago.\nI find, then, that this was an isolated incident not likely to be repeated in the future. The threat by these individuals was predicated upon an act by the claimant. If he did not report this incident to the police and if he did not return to the mountain, presumably, they would not harm him in any way. Nor have they.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\nAs indicated above, the claimant experienced no problems in Cancun. I accept that he may have been fearful there, but I do not find that his subjective fear has an objective basis.\nOn the evidence before me, I find that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being subjected to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Cancun. The claimant moved to Cancun and worked there for four months without incident. While there, he did not see the agent of harm although he remained fearful that he might. He also indicated that he did not consider moving to another part of Mexico because of his fear, but he did not take any reasonable steps that a prudent person might to discover whether or not he would be safe in another part of Mexico.\nIn the refugee context if I find part of the country where the claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution, I would go on to consider whether it would be unreasonable, having regard to all of the circumstances of the claim, including those particular to the claimant, for the claimant to seek refuge in Cancun.\nI find that I cannot go on to consider the reasonableness of the potential IFA in the context of s. 97(1)(b) for the following reasons. Section 97(1)(b)(ii) of the Act speaks only of a risk faced by the person in every part of the country. It does not add a reasonableness element to the availability of a safe area in the country; an element that has been extensively interpreted by the Federal Court in the context of Convention refugee cases. In order to find, therefore, that the claimant has an IFA, I must be satisfied that the IFA is in an area of the country (1) which is reasonably accessible to the claimant and (2) where the claimant would not face a serious possibility of a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. I find, however, that the evidence presented in support of the claimant's allegations does not establish a serious possibility that he would be subjected to such harm in the IFA.\nFor the foregoing reasons, I conclude that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is not a Convention refugee and not a person in need of protection and I, therefore, reject his claim.\n(Signed)\n\"Paulah Dauns\"\nPaulah Dauns\n11 October 2002\nDate: (day\/month\/year)\nKEYWORDS - INTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE - RISK TO LIFE AND RISK OF CRUEL AND UNUSUAL TREATMENT OR PUNISHMENT - NEGATIVE - MALE - MEXICO\n1 As enacted by S.C. 2001 c.27.\n96.

Ms. Salehi is a 34-year-old citizen of Iran and the United Kingdom. Her sons, seven and ten years old respectively, are also citizens of both countries. Claims were made against both countries. The principal claimant was designated as the representative of her two sons.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe principal claimant alleges that she is the wife of an abusive husband who also abuses their two children. She fears that should they return to Iran she will, at worst, be unable to divorce her husband and that she will continue to be abused by him; if divorce were possible, by Iranian law, the principal claimant would have to leave the children in the care of their abusive father. The principal claimant states that she is afraid to return to and live in the United Kingdom (UK) as her husband would be able to locate her and her sons too easily. Should he do so, the principal claimant fears further abuse to her and her sons, perhaps even the loss of their lives.\nEVIDENCE\nThe written and documentary evidence considered in the claim is listed on the exhibit sheet on file. The claimant also testified orally. It is the claimant's evidence that she was badly abused over the fourteen years or so of her marriage to her present husband. After the two children were born, they too were abused. This was a result of their father's overly zealous attempts at discipline and teaching methods which included hitting, yelling and long periods of study at times past the children's normal bed time. The claimant suffered for a long time and eventually made up her mind to leave her husband. While her husband was on one of his many business trips, the principal claimant sold her jewellery and purchased tickets for her children and her to leave Iran. She already had a multiple exit permit for her and her sons as they travelled frequently with the principal claimant's husband. The claimants fled to England, travelled to Ireland, returned to England and made their way to Canada where they eventually made a claim\nfor refugee status. Although the claimant is a British citizen she did not remain in that country as she believed her husband would be able to track her down too easily. This fear was born out as her husband visited to two places at which the principal claimant and her children had stayed while in Britain.\nDETERMINATION\nI determine that the claimants are not Convention refugees or people in need of protection.\nREASONS\nClear and convincing evidence that refuted Britain's ability to protect the claimants was not adduced nor was it shown that protection would not have been available to the claimants or that it would have been, or would in the future be, unreasonable to expect the principal claimant to avail herself and her children of that protection in the United Kingdom.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\nThe claimant's travelled to Canada on British Passports. The female claimant also had an Iranian passport. These passports were copied by Canada Immigration and Citizenship (CIC) and certified copies were available at the hearing. I am satisfied that the claimants are the people they claim to be and that they are citizens of Iran and the United Kingdom.\nThe claimants were outside Iran for just over a month but the principal claimant did not seek protection from any of the places to which she travelled. These places included Italy, United Kingdom, Ireland and the Netherlands. The claimant explained that this was because she could not conceive of being anywhere in Europe and being safe there because her husband travelled often and had his company's assistance to procure visas and any other necessary travel documents. The principal claimant explained that the claimants stay in UK would have been much shorter but she had difficulty getting a flight after the terrorist attack in New York, USA on September 11, 2001. The principal claimant explained that she feels safe in Canada because Iranian companies do not do business with Canada and therefore she believes her husband's company could not assist her husband in getting a visa to come to this country.\nThe principal claimant and her son are British citizens. The claimants are obliged to have exhausted the protection available to them in any country of which they are citizens before they can expect to obtain protection from another country. Or they must adduce clear and convincing evidence that those countries are unable or unwilling to protect them or that it was and would be unreasonable for them to take advantage of the protection offered the citizens of their country of citizenship.\nThe principal claimant stated that she believed that protection would not be extended to her in Britain because she has not established residency there. Objective documentation of this belief was not adduced. The claimant further stated that she does not know how life in England is because she left there when she was just a few ears old. Although the claimant's explanation is understandable in her alleged circumstances, her fear does not relieve her of the obligation to seek protection from Britain. The claimant's unwillingness to approach British authorities for protection, no matter how subjectively reasonable given her alleged state of mind and fear at the time she was in Britain in 2001, does not remove the onus on her of rebutting the presumption that the state is capable of providing protection. Documents disclosed in Exhibit 6 reveal that harassment in Britain is governed by the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. This act prohibits harassment and makes harassment an offence. A victim has recourse through either or both criminal and civil law depending on the circumstances. The material speaks of restraining orders, for example. There are crisis lines, citizen advice bureaus and police are required to respond to emergency domestic violence calls. Such organisations cater not to just abused adults but to their children as well. The British Home Office maintains a web site that is dedicated to informing people who experience domestic violence of their rights and there are several organisations in Britain dedicated to the support and guidance of victims of domestic abuse either through providing refuge or through legal and personal counselling. The home office web page information states \"There are refuges specifically for women and children from particular ethnic or cultural backgrounds...\"\nThe principal claimant's fear of persecution of herself and her minor children is not objectively well founded in the United Kingdom.\nThe immigration consultant assisting the claimant pointed out that the information from the British Home Office included in exhibit 6 records that in England and Wales in 1997 47% of the 224 female homicides, or about 105 women, were killed by partners. He submitted that this is evidence that Britain is unable to protect the claimant from her abusive husband. These figures have to be considered in relationship to others. For example in 1995 6.6 million incidents of family violence were recorded and it is estimated that only a quarter of all domestic violence incidents are reported to police. Assuming that those figures remained the same in 1997, although shocking and all too many, 105 deaths are very few in relationship to the total number of domestic violence incidents. In 1998 it was estimated that domestic violence cost Britain about 278 million pounds. This is does not reflect a state unable to protect its citizens.\nState protection does not have to be perfect and indeed the immigration consultant pointed out that in Canada women still die as a result of domestic violence. The principal claimant testified that she did not even research or inquire about the possibility of finding protection in Britain. She did not provide clear and convincing evidence that protection would not be available to her and her two children. The claimant's therefore are not Convention refugees or people in need of protection.\nAs the claimants all are all British citizens and I have conclude that the evidence reveals on the balance of probabilities that Britain is able and willing to protect the claimants, it is reasonable to expect the claimant to seek that protection. No analysis was done on the claims against Iran.\nCONCLUSION\nHaving considered all the evidence, the Gender Guidelines1 and the Update and having heard the immigration consultant's submissions and for the reasons stated above I find that XXXXXXXXXXX (XXXXX) and her two minor sons XXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXX are not Convention refugees and they are not people in need of protection.\n\"Susan French\"\nSusan French\nAugust 16, 2002\nDate (day\/month\/year)\n1 Chairperson's Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimant's Fearing Gender-Related Persecution: Update, November 25, 1996.\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nVA1-03981\nVA1-03982\nVA1-03983\n4\n",

The evidence reveals that the claimant is a 63-year-old female citizen of India.\nSUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE\nThe claimant testified that since she married XXXXXXXX in 1954 she has experienced problems. She said that her husband is a heavy drinker who sold six acres of their property to another party and gave 22\/23 acres of it for lease to a third party. The claimant was able to recover most of the land that was leased out but in doing so she made enemies of those people from whom the land was taken. Some of these people are related to the claimant's spouse. For years the claimant was harassed, attacked and at times she had to be treated by the doctor. The claimant was able to obtain the assistance of the police or of the Sarpanch of her village. The incidents seemed to stop in 1997, however the claimant testified that she was fearful and always left her house accompanied. Finally, in 2000, the claimant's granddaughter got married in the United Kingdom, where her daughter and son-in-law live, and she was able to obtain a visitor visa that allowed her to go to the wedding. At the same time, the claimant asked for a Canadian visitor visa (CVV). She wanted to also visit her brother who has lived in Canada for 21 years. Armed with the two visas, the claimant first travelled to the United Kingdom where she sojourned with her daughter and family for four and a half months. On October 16, 2000, the claimant left the United Kingdom bound for Canada where she arrived on the same day. She stopped in Toronto, where her brother lives, and on December 12, 2000, the claimant made a refugee claim. Later she decided to move to Vancouver, where there are many people from her village who could help her get settled and find a job.\nDETERMINATION\nIn the determination of the claim I took into consideration the testimony of the claimant and all of the evidence adduced and listed in the Exhibit List. The observations of the Refugee Protection Officer (RPO) and counsel's submissions were also taken into consideration.\nThe determination of the panel is that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nISSUES\nThe following issues were identified and explored: third country status, nexus, credibility, delay in claiming, failure to claim elsewhere, objective basis, and state protection. Only the determinative issues will be analyzed.\nEVIDENCE AND ANALYSIS\nThe panel's task is to determine if the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution and\/or if she is a person in need of protection.\nCredibility\nI find the claimant credible. She testified in a spontaneous honest manner even though at times she tended to exaggerate her story. I, therefore, have no problems with the credibility of the claimant whose testimony was consistent with the content of her Personal Information Form (PIF)1 and with the information she gave to the Immigration Officer (I.O.) when she made her refugee claim at Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC)2. The testimony was also consistent with the information contained in the documents provided by the claimant and contained in exhibit 4.\nNexus\nThe main issue in this claim is nexus. I note that in Leon,3, the Court stated:\nA determination with respect to \"nexus\" is largely a question of fact and therefore entirely within the tribunal's expertise to make.\nThe claimant testified that she is afraid of those people with whom she has been in a dispute over her lands. There are two parties: the XXXX family (her husband's relatives) and the people to whom some of the property was leased and from whom she retrieved the land. The panel, in examining the nexus, notes that the claimant is not persecuted in India for any of the grounds contained in the Refugee Convention.4 The panel considered the ground of Membership in a Particular Social Group and notes that in Ward5 the Supreme Court of Canada identified three possible categories of particular social group:\n(1) Groups defined by an innate or unchangeable characteristic;\n(2) Groups whose members voluntarily associate for reasons so fundamental to their human dignity that they should not be forced to forsake the association; and\n(3) Groups associated by a former voluntary status, unalterable due to its historical permanence.\nIn clarifying the categories, the Court stated that:\nThe first category would embrace individuals fearing persecution on such bases as gender, linguistic background and sexual orientation, while the second would encompass, for example, human rights activists. The third branch is included more because of historical intentions, although it is also relevant to the anti-discrimination influences, in that one's past is an immutable part of the person.6\nNone of the above categories applies to this claim. I find that the claimant is a victim of crime and that the only reason why she was harassed by her enemies was because she had taken the land away from them. The claimant admitted that if she had to sell the land to her enemies, the problem would stop but they would not pay enough for the land and her son would not have a job. I also note that in regard to victims of crime, the Federal Court in Leon7 supported the finding of the CRDD that victims of crime do not have a nexus to the Convention refugee definition. The Court found that Mr. Leon was targeted not because he was a union member per se, but rather because of his efforts to protect his father's economic interests. The claimant before me was likewise targeted because she was defending her own economic interests. I, therefore, find that there is no nexus to this claim.\nState Protection\nThe claimant testified that she often went to the police and they almost always helped her. In the case law we find that the protection of a country of which protection is sought is only considered \"surrogate protection\" and as articulated in Villafranca:8\nNo government that makes any claim to democratic values or protection of human rights can guarantee the protection of all citizens at all times. Thus it is not enough for a claimant merely to show that his government has not always been effective at protecting persons in his particular situation ... where a state is in effective control of its territory, has military, police and civil authority in place, and makes serious efforts to protect its citizens... the mere fact that it is not always successful at doing so will not be enough to justify a claim that the victims ... are unable to avail themselves of such protection.\nIn Ward the Supreme Court stated that:\n... Absent a situation of complete breakdown of state apparatus, such as that recognized in Lebanon in Zalzali it should be assumed that the state is capable of protecting a claimant.9\nTo rebut the above presumption, the claimant must provide \"clear and convincing\" proof of the state's inability to protect. This onus has been described by the Federal Court of Appeal as one that is \"...difficult, though not insurmountable\".10 In this respect, it was stated in Ward that the claimant's burden of presenting \"clear and convincing\" proof of the state's inability to protect should not be an impossible burden:\n... it would seem to defeat the purpose of international protection if a claimant would be required to risk his or her life seeking ineffective protection of a state, merely to demonstrate that ineffectiveness.11\nIn her testimony the claimant said that the police always assisted her and that only after 1997, was she advised by the Sarpanch to stop going to the police. However, the claimant testified that after 1997 she did not experience any incidents. The claimant also testified that she went to court a few times and the court always ruled in her favour. I, therefore, find that the claimant was not able to rebut the presumption that the state can protect her.\nCONSOLIDATED GROUNDS\nI also examined the claim to decide whether the new Consolidated Grounds in the new Immigration and Refugee Protection Act12 (section 97(1)(a) or (b) applied to the case and I find that the claimant is not a person in need of protection. The Risk to Life ground does not apply to her claim because she can find state protection. As for Danger of Torture, there was no argument advanced that the claimant fears being tortured.\nCONCLUSION\nOn the totality of the evidence, I find that the claimant has not established a well-founded fear of persecution, that there is no nexus to the claimant's story, that she has not given \"clear and convincing\" proof that she has no state protection in India and that she does not have a reasonable chance of being persecuted, for the reasons enunciated at the hearing, should she return to India.\nIn conclusion, although I find that the claimant could be an asset for Canada, as submitted in various letters of support from her community,13 I find that XXXXXXXXX is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n\"Anna Terrana\"\nAnna Terrana\nDATED this 9th day of September 2002.\nKEYWORDS - STATE PROTECTION - RISK TO LIFE AND RISK OF CRUEL AND UNUSUAL TREATMENT OR PUNISHMENT - NEGATIVE - FEMALE - INDIA\n1 Exhibit 1.\n2 Exhibit 2.\n3 Leon, Johnny Edgar Orellana v.

Both claimants are citizens of Costa Rica.\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\nThe claimants are both male homosexuals and have cohabited together as a couple in a sexual relationship since 1996, both in Costa Rica and latterly in Canada.\nIn late 1997, they were evicted from their residence, which they occupied jointly with a friend, because of complaints by some of their neighbours. The claimants then moved to another residential area of San Jose, where they continued to reside together until they left Costa Rica some years later.\nIn XXXXX 2000, the claimants were assaulted and robbed by policemen in downtown San Jose. In XXXX 2001, they both left Costa Rica and came to Canada. In December 2001, they made refugee claims here.\nDETERMINATION\nThe panel determines that these individuals are not Convention refugees. They are also not persons in need of protection, as they would not personally be subject to a danger of torture or to a risk to their lives or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Costa Rica.\nANALYSIS\nThe first issue to determine was the credibility of the claimants' evidence. The panel is aware that testimony that is given under oath is presumed to be true, unless there is valid reason to doubt its truthfulness.1 However, there is valid reason to doubt and reject the truthfulness of some of the allegations made by these claimants. Their evidence contained a number of inconsistencies2, contradictions, omissions3 and exaggerations in their Personal Information Forms (PIFs)4, in their statements to Canada Immigration5, and in their oral testimony. In addition, the claimant, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, had previously provided incorrect information to the visa officer at the Canadian Embassy in San Jose in his unsuccessful application for a student visa to come to Canada. As well, the documentary evidence was preferred to the claimants' testimony on the basis that the sources were reputable and independent and had no interest in the outcome of these particular claims.6 In these circumstances, the claimants' testimony was also rebutted by the failure of the documentary evidence to mention what one would normally expect it to mention.7\nThe panel accepted that the claimants are citizens of Costa Rica. It was also accepted that they are both male homosexuals, who have cohabited together in a sexual relationship both in Costa Rica and in Canada.\nAccording to their PIFs, their first real problems arose in late 1997. For the following reasons, the panel does not find their evidence about those allegations to be credible or trustworthy. According to their PIFs and their testimony, unknown individuals put excrement on their doorstep and broke a window in their home, motivated by their opposition to the claimants' sexual orientation and that\nof their fellow roommate. However, both claimants gave different versions of what had happened to them in Tres Rios in their separate interviews8 with Canada Immigration when they initially commenced their refugee claims. XXXX version was that some people in their neighbourhood insulted them. They also had \"thousands\" of messages left on their telephone. He said that they moved from that area in XXXXX 1998\/XXXXX 1999. XXXX's version was different. He said that the \"neighbours took reprisals against them. They put excrement on the walls [emphasis added] and threw rocks at them.\" He did not mention insults, telephone calls, or a broken window. He also stated that they moved from there in XXXXX 1998. They also provided completely different versions of what they did about these problems in their interviews. According to XXXXX, they \"notified police\". In contrast, XXXXX stated that they \"Did not [emphasis added] notify the police\". However, they later included new allegations in their PIFs that they had also received death threats, both in telephone calls they personally answered and also in the messages left on their telephone answering machine. Neither of them had previously mentioned such threats. It is not unreasonable to have expected that both of these claimants would have provided a consistent version of these events in their interviews with Canada Immigration, in their PIFs, and also in their testimony.\nAlthough the claimants did file some documents9 that they claimed to relate to the incidents in Tres Rios, they were not given any weight because the claimants' evidence was not credible about what happened to them. As well, the documents themselves do not confirm those incidents, nor were they independently proven to be truly genuine.10\nThe claimants next moved to Guadelupe, another residential area of the capital city, San Jose. There was no evidence that their sexual orientation created any\nproblems for them to obtain such new accommodation. It also proved to be a satisfactory residence for them because they lived there for successive years until they came to Canada. In addition, it was also noted that the claimants' sexual orientation had not prevented them from achieving personal goals of a good education (including a university scholarship) and steady employment during the time that they lived in Costa Rica.\nIn addition, there was no credible evidence that they had experienced any problems in that new area of San Jose where they lived until the end of XXXXX 2001. In their Immigration interviews, neither of them had mentioned having received a death threat in a telephone message there in 1998. It was first mentioned only later in their PIFs, in which they stated that the threat greatly concerned them. If so, it was again not credible that they would not have recalled such a serious threat in their earlier interviews. Although XXXXX, in his oral testimony, did mention minor problems they had experienced with their neighbours, the panel does not give that evidence any weight. No specific allegations about even minor problems with their new neighbours were made previously in their interviews with Canada Immigration. His PIF only mentioned some questions they were asked by their neighbours shortly after they moved there, but no specific problems or concerns about their neighbours were mentioned after that time. They chose to not move from that location during those subsequent years. If they were having any problems with their neighbours in Guadelupe, it is reasonable to have expected that they would have taken the opportunity to mention those specific problems earlier, but they omitted to do so. It was also relevant that XXXXX testified that he thought their neighbours in Guadelupe did not even know they were a gay couple. This is contrary to their allegation that they are both visibly gay and from the time they began to live together, they were identified as a gay couple to the general public and suffered on-going discrimination.\nThe claimants' evidence was also not reliable about the alleged incident that occurred in XXXXX 2000 in downtown San Jose. It was late at night in a downtown area when they alleged that two police officers attacked them and stole their money. They both gave differing versions of what actually happened to them on that occasion in their interviews with Canada Immigration, in their Personal Information Forms, and in their testimony. According to their PIFs and their testimony, they were robbed, beaten and sexually assaulted. However, in their interviews with Canada Immigration, they only alleged that they were robbed and called derogatory names. They provided no satisfactory explanations for their joint failure to mention at that time that they were sexually assaulted. XXXXX was also unable to explain why he had not previously mentioned that they were beaten. Those were allegations of serious mistreatment that they both experienced together. It is reasonable to expect that they would both have provided a consistent and complete account of this incident from their first interview onwards. Their failure to do so simply added to the conclusion that their evidence was not credible about their mistreatment in Costa Rica.\nImmediately after this incident, the claimants said that they had gone to the closest police station to make a report. Their evidence was also not consistent about what actually happened at the station. XXXXX said the young police officer laughed at them when he realised their sexual orientation and told them to go home without taking a formal report. However, it is noted that in the interview with Canada Immigration, XXXXX simply stated that the police \"gave no importance to what happened\".\nThe claimants testified that after the incident with the police in XXXXX 2000, they were forced to totally change their lifestyles in various ways because of fear. However, it is also noted that neither of the claimants mentioned previously in their Personal Information Forms that they were in fear or had to change their lifestyles during that period of time after the XXXXX incident. Although XXXXX testified that they were in hiding, the evidence was clear that they both continued to work at their existing jobs. He even had to admit that he was actually working full-time at two different jobs while he was living in Guadalupe\nand he continued to do so until he left Costa Rica. It was noted that he had not fully disclosed this employment information in his PIF, although he was required to do so. The panel does not find that they were living in fear or in hiding after XXXXX 2000.\nThese claimants provided reports11 of attacks on several transvestites in Costa Rica. Only one of those incidents occurred after 1998. It is not clear just what the motive was for any of those attacks and whether they were related at all to their sexual orientation as transvestites. Although the claimants say that their friend (Minor) was not a transvestite, the panel prefers the news report, which clearly states that he was. Those reports also indicate that the police (OIJ) are investigating the incidents. In any event, these claimants admitted that they are not transvestites.\nThere was also an extremely long delay before the claimants left Costa Rica. There was no credible evidence they had any further problems of any kind in the intervening thirteen months between the alleged incident in XXXXX 2000 and their departure in late XXXXX 2001. The panel is not satisfied that the incident they related in XXXXX 2000 actually occurred. Certainly, if it had occurred and they were living in fear as they alleged, that lengthy delay before they left Costa Rica was grossly excessive. That delay not only adversely affects the credibility of their evidence, but it also indicates their lack of any subjective fear.\nIn addition, it was also noted that XXXX only obtained his passport in XXXXX 2001. It was in XXXXX 2001 that XXXXX first applied for a student visa in order to take a six-month education course in Canada. As previously mentioned, it was disturbing that he gave inaccurate information to the visa officer at the Canadian Embassy in San Jose. He also did not provide complete information later when he completed his PIF. Those actions further damaged his credibility.\nThere were further delays. As of XXXXX 2001, both claimants already had passports. As Costa Ricans, they did not require visitors visas to travel to Canada. In spite of that, they still delayed their departure further until the end of XXXXX 2001. There was a further delay once they were in Canada before they initiated their refugee claims. They failed to advise Immigration at the airport here that they had fled from Costa Rica and come here to seek refuge. Instead, they waited for another six weeks longer before they notified Canada Immigration in mid-December that they wished to make refugee claims.\nThe claimants did not provide satisfactory explanations for any of those lengthy delays. They were in a unique position to leave Costa Rica for Canada much earlier than they did. As citizens of Costa Rica, they are nationals of one of the few countries in Latin America not required by Canada to obtain visitors' visas to travel here. The claimants are also intelligent and well educated. Even more surprising, XXXXX already had a Costa Rican friend in Canada who had already been granted refugee status here in 2000. XXXX was in communication with this person on a regular basis from Costa Rica. However, both claimants alleged that they did not know anything about how to make a refugee claim in Canada when they left Costa Rica. They also said that it was not until a month after their arrival here that they were first able to locate this friend. XXXXX claimed that he did not bring this person's address in Vancouver with him from Costa Rica. He also testified that after they did contact him, there was a further week's delay before they found out from him about how to initiate a refugee claim.\nThere were a number of reasons why the panel did not accept their explanations for this lengthy delay as reasonable. If these claimants fled from Costa Rica because they were in such fear after XXXXX 2000, it is completely implausible that they would not have ensured that they brought that friend's contact information with them. They also had ample time prior to their departure to have made the necessary inquiries with their friend, allegedly already a successful refugee claimant here, so he could offer them advice in advance of their departure\nabout the opportunity to make refugee claims here immediately upon their arrival. It was implausible that they would not have inquired with him before their departure. XXXXX also testified that they notified officials at the airport here upon their arrival that they had come here as tourists. He initially claimed that they did not mention that they were here to seek refuge because were afraid of the officials here and did not trust them, just as they did not trust Costa Rican officials. When he was challenged as to why they would have even come here if they already believed that Canadian officials could not be trusted, he then retreated from his previous allegation. This further damaged their credibility. Those further delays were completely excessive and were additional indications of their lack of subjective fear in Costa Rica.\nThe panel also considered the documentary materials on Costa Rica that were filed in these claims. According to the U.S. Department of State Country Reports12:\nCosta Rica is a long-standing, stable, constitutional democracy. ...\nThe government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law and judiciary provide effective means of dealing with individual instances of abuse...but reports of police abuse of authority or misconduct decreased during the year. ...\nAn effective mechanism for lodging and recording complaints of police misconduct exists. The Ombudsman's office serves as a recourse to citizens that have complaints about violations of their civil and human rights and about deficiencies in public and private infrastructure. It investigates complaints and, when appropriate, initiates suits against officials.\nUnlike their comments concerning other countries in Latin America, the U.S. Department of State Country Reports does not mention problems concerning sexual orientation in Costa Rica.\nIn addition, other documentation that the panel finds helpful, particularly the documentation dealing with events from 1998 onwards, indicates that the situation in Costa Rica concerning sexual orientation has improved considerably in recent years. According to comments13 from the Director of the Agua Buena Human Rights Association in San Jose, (a group working to improve the situation of the gay, lesbian and transgender communities in Costa Rica), he was:\n...unaware of any cases involving gay men being harassed, assaulted, raped or extorted to pay a bribe by police.\nHe also stated that:\nI find that the situation for adult, urban gays has changed quite dramatically in the past several years. Personally, at this point I know dozens, and, less intimately, hundreds of gay and lesbian couples, who are living in San Jose, have good jobs, and a variety of receptions from their families, reacting from rejection to tolerance to support and closeness.\nIf you are talking about being able to live comfortably, there are relatively few problems for gay and lesbian couples in the urban area, and discrimination is not a government or police policy. There is a kind of 'live and let live' attitude here. Gays and lesbians here share apartments and homes, have good jobs, and can go out to any one of 25 bars and discos, five to ten gay-friendly restaurants, and maybe 50 to 100 other gay-friendly businesses. And same-sex couples go all the time to any restaurant in any part of the city, with no problems whatsoever.\nThe Supreme Court outlawed bar raids three years ago, and ordered in 1997 that the government provide the new AIDS medication to 500 people, most of them gay men. Also, there is a new law that outlaws discrimination based on sexual orientation.\nMy overall impression is that Costa Rica has become, with some exceptions, a relatively good place, in comparison to other Central American countries, for many, but not all, gay and lesbian people.\nIn addition, other, more recent materials indicate a similar positive situation. For example, homosexual acts between consenting adults are legal in Costa Rica.14 Another publication indicates that:\nThe gay scene in Costa Rica is also beginning to blossom. In San Jose, you can choose among any of a dozen downtown bars and clubs, four saunas, an Internet caf\u00e9 and more than a handful of gay-friendly restaurants, hotels, and other businesses.15\nThe claimants alleged that they were attacked by police officers in XXXXX 2000. None of the documentation covering the period of time from 2000 up to the present indicates that there have been any reports of attacks by the police in Costa Rica against persons because of their sexual orientation.16 It is reasonable to assume that in an open, stable democracy such as Costa Rica, where human rights groups and groups advocating for the rights of sexual minorities operate freely, that reports of such incidents, would be well-known and well-publicised if they had occurred, particularly in San Jose. The lack of such information is another factor in the panel's assessment that the claimants' evidence is not credible.\nThese claimants alleged that they only went to the police on that one occasion in 2000 when they spoke to a young officer. When they did not receive any satisfaction from him, they did nothing further. They did not attempt to report this incident to any higher police or government official. They also completely failed to seek assistance by reporting this incident to any human rights group or to any gay advocacy group. According to that U.S. Department of State Country Reports:\nVarious human rights groups operate without government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials are cooperative and responsive to their views.\nThey also failed to seek assistance and redress from any governmental agency or organization. Noticeably, they failed to approach the office of the Ombudsman. Country Reports also states that:\nThe Ombudsman's office is part of the legislative branch, ensuring a high degree of independence from the executive branch. The law provides for the functional, administrative, and judgmental independence of the Ombudsman's office.\nAnother very recent document17 indicated that:\nThe Ombudsman of Costa Rica (Defensor\u00eda de los Habitantes) includes persons with a \"distinct sexual preference\" (con distintas preferencias sexuales) as one of the various vulnerable groups that face or could face a violation of their rights (10 Apr. 2002). The Ombudsman reports that its Special Protection Directorate, with a team of eight lawyers, assists vulnerable groups to achieve full enjoyment of their rights before state institutions and within society (ibid.).\nThe latest report on the \"Lesbian, Gay, Transgendered and Bi-Sexual (LGTV) Population\" of the Special Protection Directorate available to the Research Directorate indicates that a complaint raised by the owner of the hotel taking part in the international gay and lesbian festival, regarding the \"discriminatory attitudes\" (actitud discriminatoria) of local government officials, was \"favourably resolved\" (se hab\u00eda ... resuelto favorablemente) by the Office of the Ombudsman (ibid. 10 Aug. 2000).\n...\nThe Ombudsman addressed a complaint made in 1999 by a resident of Alajuela province, who reported police abuse in the form of arbitrary detention, as well as verbal and physical abuse; as a result, the Ombudsman issued a recommendation to the Public Security Ministry asking for: disciplinary action against the police officers involved in such abuse, addition of sensitivity training at the National School of Police, and a special effort top involving the Alajuela police command and other institutions under the Ministry's jurisdiction for more inclusive practices (ibid.).\nThat same document also noted that :\n...there are various organizations in Costa Rica that fight for the rights of sexual minorities, some of them focusing on specific subjects and some of them dealing with more general matters. (ibid. n.d.c.) The source lists some of these government institutions and non-government organizations: In government, although a number of bodies can help protect rights if these are threatened, the most prominent ones are the Ombudsman and the Constitutional Court; among the non-governmental organizations, the most prominent ones are ...Agua Buena....\nThe issue of state protection is important because there is a presumption that a state can protect its citizens. If the claimants' evidence had been accepted as credible regarding that incident in XXXXX 2000, they made only one initial attempt to seek redress and then did nothing more. The onus on the claimants is to provide \"clear and convincing\" proof of the state's inability to protect. These claimants have clearly failed to meet that onus. The documentary materials are clear. There are institutions available to assist them, even if every case brought forth may not be successful.\nThe documentary evidence indicates clearly that there are rights available to homosexuals in Costa Rica and those rights have been improving since the early 1990's. This continuum of improvement has been primarily achieved through legal means and governmental institutions, including the Ombudsman and the Constitutional Court. It does not mean there might not be problems for some gay or lesbian individuals in Costa Rica in the future. However, the panel does not accept that these claimants made even the minimal attempts to seek redress.\nAs previously noted, their evidence was unclear and unreliable about what happened in XXXXX 2000 and the panel cannot rely upon it. Even if the panel accepted their evidence as credible that they had been victimized in that one incident, it was caused by two rogue police officers. Clearly, their actions did not involve carrying out any aspect of state policy. It is clear that Costa Rica and its' governmental institutions are opposed this type of abuse and do attempt to provide redress whenever such incidents are brought to their attention. It was unreasonable for these claimants to not properly seek protection. The level of democracy in a country indicates the level that a claimant must go to seek protection. In this case, Costa Rica, as \"a longstanding, stable, constitutional democracy\", requires them to do much more than they claim to have done. As the Federal Court of Appeal stated in Kandenko:\nWhen the state in question is a democratic state ... the claimant must do more than simply show that he or she went to see some members of the\npolice force and that his or her efforts were unsuccessful. The burden of proof that rests on the claimant is, in a way, directly proportional to the level of democracy in the state in question: the more democratic the state's institutions, the more the claimant must have done to exhaust all the courses of action open to him or her.18\nAccording to the claimants, the only people they told in Costa Rica about that XXXXX incident were some of their closest friends. After observing these claimants during the hearing, neither of them appeared to be persons who would be too intimidated, incapable or unwilling to seek redress. Their inaction was completely unreasonable in view of the options for redress that were available and accessible to them. They did not rebut the onus that reasonable state protection19 was available to them in Costa Rica, rather than leaving to seek protection abroad.\nThe Convention refugee definition is a forward-looking concept. If these claimants should return to Costa Rica in the future, there is nothing more than the merest possibility, certainly not a \"serious possibility\"20, that they would suffer persecution for any Convention reason, including their sexual orientation.\nThe panel has also considered whether the claimants are in need of protection under section 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. It was not argued that the claimants would be personally subjected to a danger of torture in Costa Rica and there was no evidence to support such a finding. Although it was argued that they would personally be subjected to a risk to their lives or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if they should return to Costa Rica, the panel finds that there is no \"serious possibility\" of that occurring. They also have reasonable state protection available to them in Costa Rica.\nCONCLUSION\nAfter having considered all of the evidence, including counsel's oral submissions, the panel determines that these claimants are not Convention refugees. In addition, they would not be personally subjected to a danger of torture or to a risk to their lives or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nTherefore, the panel rejects the claims of XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX to refugee protection.\nI.W.

She claims to have a well founded fear of persecution at the hands of male Sinhalese neighbors and Sinhalese men in general because of her ethnic background and her gender. In addition, she claims to be a person in need of protection as a person at risk of losing her life or being subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Sri Lanka.\nTHE EVIDENCE\nThe Federal Court of Appeal states in the Maldonado1 decision that when a claimant swears to the truthfulness of his or her evidence, a presumption exists that that evidence is true unless there is a good reason to conclude otherwise.\nThe Federal Court of Appeal has given further direction to the RPD in Rajaratnam2 in which it states:\nA refugee claimant is not, therefore, absolved of the duty of telling the truth. The tribunal hearing his evidence is entitled to disbelieve him and to base its decision on that assessment, but is required to give reasons for a finding of lack of credibility in 'clear and unmistakable terms.'\nIn the decision of Shahamati,3 the Federal Court of Appeal states:\nContrary to what has sometimes been said the Board is entitled, in assessing credibility, to rely on such criteria as rationality and common sense.\nThe claimant gave evidence at the hearing, as did her mother, XXXXXXXXXXXXX (by telephone from Sri Lanka). There are good reasons for disbelieving some parts of the evidence. The portions of the evidence found wanting are set out in the following synopsis of the testimony and review of the documentation filed.\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nThe claimant's identity has been established by her own evidence and by means of a valid Sri Lankan passport4 issued in her name.\nMs. XXXXXXX and a half years of age. She gave evidence under oath and in what she described as her first language, English. At the time she completed her Personal Information Form (PIF)5 she had 10 years of education. She last attended a Catholic girl's school at the XXXXXXXXXX. She has never worked.\nHer mother XXXXXXXXXXXXX and two younger brothers, age 15 and 8, remain in Sri Lanka. The claimant's father, XXXXXXXXXXX, is a landed immigrant in Canada and acted as the claimant's designated representative.\nThe claimant alleges that she is a member of a small ethnic minority group in Sri Lanka known as Burghers. According to a publication from the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies (IPCS),6\nBurghers are a miniscule but important ethnic group in Sri Lanka. They are descendants of children of Portuguese and Dutch marriages with Ceylonese.\nThe claimant alleged that Burghers are identifiable in Sri Lanka because they have lighter skin and speak English as their first language. She alleged that Burghers are harassed because they are considered to be very low caste.\nThe panel accepts that the claimant is Burgher. However, the documentary evidence filed does not indicate that Burghers are considered low caste, nor does it indicate that Burghers are subjected to discriminatory treatment. The report from IPCS states that the \"...community is non-controversial and has not been marginalized.\"7\nThe claimant alleges that from an early age she could not use public transport to go to school because she was constantly harassed by young Sinhalese men in her neighbourhood. She states in her PIF that \"...all the girls in our school were harassed from time to time but it was particularly bad for girls who were Burghers.\"8 In about 1997 or 1998 a Sinhalese man grabbed her breasts while she was walking through a market. She states that this would not have occurred had she not been Burgher. Sometime in 1998 the claimant was kissed by her cousin while she was at the home of her aunt. She did not appreciate the advance.\nThe claimant complains of being the target of name calling in her neighbourhood because she was Burgher. Some chickens she and her siblings owned were killed, according to her, by Sinhalese. These same persons are also alleged to have taken her dog.\nThe claimant states in her PIF that a young Burgher girl she knew was taken away by some Sinhalese men who gave her alcohol and took nude pictures of her.\nOn one occasion a Sinhalese man came looking for the claimant outside the grounds of her school. A friend of the claimant's told the man that she was not there. The claimant raised this incident as an example of the harassment she faced by Sinhalese men. When asked if she let her teachers at the school know of this event, she stated that she did not. Her reasons were that she was embarrassed, and that even if she told her teachers they could not help her. The panel does not accept the allegation that the teaching staff of a girls' convent school would not, on the balance of probabilities, protect her from unwanted attention from males in the near vicinity of the school. She cannot allege a lack of assistance from this source if she never sought it. In any event, the claimant alleges that she told her mother of the incident, but her mother never told the nuns. Her mother's evidence contradicts this version of the story.\nThe claimant's mother allegedly received phone calls from Sinhalese men who demanded money. The claimant alleged that because her father worked in Canada these men assumed the family was rich. No evidence was given that money ever changed hands.\nThe claimant alleges in her PIF that in August 1999, to get away from the harassment, the family moved from Dehiwala to Attidiya. Both locations are suburbs of Colombo. The claimant did not change schools, but continued to attend school. When asked why the family did not change schools to further cut ties with her old neighborhood, the claimant answered that she could change schools but it would be really hard at the mid-term point. In the panel's view, if the claimant and her family moved to flee persecutorial treatment, they would have taken the obvious (but not onerous) step of changing schools.\nThe claimant alleges that the harassment got worse after the move. Her mother and an aunt who lived with her received threatening phone calls. The key incident in the claim occurred after the move to Attidiya.9\nOne day about three in the afternoon, five or six Sinhalese men came to our house. I hid under the bed but I could hear the men ask my mother where I was. They said that they would take me away and rape me and that she would never see me again. They finally left when they did not find me but my mother and I remembered what had happened to XXXXXX and we took their threats very seriously. After this incident, my mother did try to go to the police but the police said that they would warn the Sinhalese men. However, the harassment continued.\nAt her hearing, the claimant stated that her mother told her that the men were drunk when they barged into the house. When asked why these men acted in this manner, she replied that it was because her family was low caste Burghers whom these men said did not belong in Sri Lanka.\nShe did state at one point in her testimony that her father and grandmother in Canada had no idea of the problems she was facing in Sri Lanka. When asked why this was the case she stated that she and her mother thought the problem would go away. As well, her father and grandmother could do nothing as they were far away in Canada. Again, her mother's evidence differs on this point. She did confirm that her mother went to the police to complain of the incident.\nThe claimant stated that it was her intention to return to Sri Lanka when she first came to Canada. She did not decide to stay until after she had received several extensions on her Canadian visitor's visa.10 She did so because she heard from her mother that the harassment in Sri Lanka continued. She alleged that although her antagonists originally wanted her to leave Sri Lanka, once she left they demanded that she return so that they could attack her. Their announced intention was to rape her.\nThe claimant has visited Kandy, a major city in south central Sri Lanka, with her mother. In fact, her mother comes from the Kandy area and has relatives living there. The claimant alleged that her protagonists in the Colombo area would find her in Kandy, as one of them knows a lot of people in Sri Lanka. In any event, she alleged that as all Sinhalese men were of the same ilk, the problems would repeat themselves. The claimant stated that there was nothing stopping her mother from moving to Kandy. Mrs. XXXXXX was not working in Colombo as she and her children were supported by remittances sent by her husband.\nDOCUMENTATION\nThe claimant presented a one page fax document11 of what are alleged to be police reports about some of the incidents she described. The claimant noted that the originals were with her mother. A fax had been sent because the claimant was in a hurry to obtain the documents. When asked if the originals could be mailed, the claimant stated it was possible. The fax document as translated is difficult to decipher and is of an irregular composition. The name of the complainant is given as XXXXXXXXX, a name unknown to the claimant or her mother. The nature of the complaints are given as: \"abuse and threats\" and \"threat.\" It contains what appear to be three dates: \"2000\/XXXX,\" \"2001.XXXX,\" and \"2001.XXXX.\" No where on the form does the name or address of the police force that issued the document appear, nor the address of the complainant.\nLate in her evidence the claimant's mother stated that the document sent to her daughter was one page but contained three separate complaints. She asked for a copy of the report from the main event of the home invasion, but as she did not know the report number the police would not give it to her.\nFax documents are as susceptible to manufacture and modification as photocopies. This consideration alone diminishes the weight that can be given this document. The originals were allegedly available long before the date of the hearing but were not sent. This also raises concerns about the documents' authenticity.\nThe claimant presented no documentation on country conditions suggesting that Burghers suffer discrimination of a persecutory nature. The document noted earlier in these reasons indicate that Burghers are neither controversial nor marginalised.\nThe documentation does indicate that violence against women is a serious problem in Sri Lanka.\nXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nMrs. XXXXXX gave evidence over the telephone from Sri Lanka. She described the incident when the five men entered her home, demanding to know where her daughter was so that they could rape her. She stated that the men were in the house for about a half an hour. She knew the names of several of them and knew where they were from. She described the men as being drunk, banging on doors and walls, and shouting obscenities, all the while looking for the claimant. For some reason, they did not discover the claimant hiding under the bed, one of the more obvious places a person would hide. The witness simply said the men never went into the bedroom where her daughter was hiding. The incident ended when the owner of the house who lived next door came to see what the disturbance was about. The witness was asked if she sought police protection after this incident. She stated that she went to the police, who arrested the men concerned. Her evidence was that the men were taken to the police station and warned not to make further threats. The witness stated the police helped her on this occasion because she paid them. She alleged that despite the warning the harassment continued after the men were released. She alleged that the men paid the police to leave them alone. She stated she heard this from another police officer. She herself did not have the money to pay the police each time help was needed.\nShe did state that her husband and mother-in-law knew about this attack at her home well before the claimant came to Canada. This is contrary to the claimant's evidence. The probative value of this aspect of the evidence is severely diminished due to the contradiction.\nMrs. XXXXXX also noted that after the incident in which a man asked for her daughter at her school, she stopped sending the girl to classes. School staff contacted her to find out what the trouble was and she told them what happened. Again, this contradicts the information given by the claimant.\nMrs. XXXXXX stated that she could move to Kandy, but her children were not used to living in that area. A Burgher girl, according to her, can not live peacefully anywhere in Sri Lanka. Her daughter would suffer because there was no man to protect her.\nXXXXXXXXXXX\nThe claimant's father's situation in Canada is in dispute. According to the claimant, he never applied to sponsor her to emigrate to Canada because he could not afford the processing fees.12 According to documents filed by Canada Immigration, when he was landed in Canada on XXXXX 1991, he indicated that he was single and had no dependants other than his mother who was accompanying him.13 The claimant was not asked about this allegation at the hearing and Mr. XXXXXX was not called as a witness.\nANALYSIS\nCounsel for the claimant argued that two of the Immigration and Refugee Board Chairperson's guidelines applied in the circumstances of this case: \"Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution\"14 and \"Child Refugee Claimants: Procedural and Evidentiary Issues.\"15 The panel has considered these guidelines in coming to its decision.\nCredibility\nThe panel agrees that some of the discrepancies in the evidence are explainable by the relative age and maturity of the claimant when some of the events occurred. A child of 11 or 12 years of age cannot be expected to have the same degree of recall as an adolescent of 17. However, not all of the discrepancies can be explained by this factor alone. For example, I do not accept the claimant's evidence that her father was not told about the home invasion and attempted gang rape for the reasons she alleges. Her mother's evidence was that he was told. This discrepancy calls into question whether the incident occurred as described.\nAs well, it is my view, that allegation that her antagonists want her to return to Sri Lanka to attack her, lacks rationality and common sense. That they would announce such a demand and their intention is simply not plausible or credible.\nDelay in Leaving Sri Lanka and in Claiming Refugee Status\nThe claimant was allegedly the target of an attempted gang rape sometime between August and November of 1999. She did not apply for a visa to leave Sri Lanka until XXXX 2000, and did not leave the country until XXXXX 2000. She appeared to be in no hurry to leave Sri Lanka.\nIt is difficult to understand what of any significance changed while the claimant was in Canada. She had allegedly been the victim of an attempted gang rape by known assailants. Ongoing police protection was allegedly unavailable. It is unclear what other incident could be required to spur her to seek protection. If she and her parents truly believed these men were responsible for such an attack, she would have had no reason not to have claimed refugee status much earlier. I find the delay in leaving and seek protection indicate a lack of a subjective fear of persecution or risk of harm.\nInternal Flight Alternative\nThe claimant and her family could move to Kandy. There is no evidence beyond speculation that her protagonists could or would follow her there. A blanket statement that all Burgher girls are unsafe throughout Sri Lanka at the hands of Sinhalese men is not supported by the country documentation. In my view it would be reasonable for the claimant and her family to relocate.\nNo credible case was made that the claimant was at risk of losing her life or being subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Sri Lanka. In any event, she could move to Kandy and face no more than a mere possibility of risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nDECISION\nFor all these reasons, I find that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is not a Convention refugee and not a person in need of protection and I therefore reject this claim.\n\"Kurt Neuenfeldt\"\nKurt Neuenfeldt\nDATED this 13th day of August 2002.\n1 Maldonado v.

Oral submissions from counsel were heard on July 2, 2002 via teleconference and the matter was reserved for decision. Pursuant to section 191 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) this matter was dealt with under the new legislation.\nTHE ISSUE\nThe only issue to be determined is whether the claimant's refugee claim should be declared abandoned pursuant to section 168 of IRPA and Rule 58(2) of the Refugee Protection Division Rules.\nBACKGROUND\nThe following is a chronology of events pertaining to this claim.\n1. The claimant arrived at the Vancouver International Airport on March 21, 2002 and made a refugee claim. The claimant was determined eligible by a senior immigration officer, (SIO), issued a conditional departure order and referred to the Immigration and Refugee Board on the same day. The claimant was provided a blank Personal Information Form (PIF) in person on the same day. The claimant had left no address with Citizenship and Immigration Canada and there was no counsel of record at the time the claim was referred to the Refugee Protection Division.\n2. On March 27, 2002 the Refugee Protection Division in Vancouver received a faxed letter from claimant's counsel, Mark Fromkin, Barrister and Solicitor, seeking the Port of Entry (POE) notes for the claimant that are normally provided to the Board by Citizenship and Immigration Canada and seeking a one month extension of time for the claimant to file his completed PIF. Accompanying counsel's letter were a Notification of counsel, a Notification of address and an Application for a Change of Venue to Toronto. All three forms were signed by the claimant. No decision was taken by the Board in regard to the extension request and on April 23, 2002 the Board wrote to counsel reminding him that the claimant's PIF was due on April 25, 2002. On April 23, 2002 the Board wrote CIC requesting a copy of the POE notes.\n3. On April 22, 2002 the Board received a faxed letter from claimant's counsel again seeking an extension of time to file the PIF and again seeking the POE notes. On May 14, 2002 the Board wrote to counsel to advise him that an extension of time to file the claimant's PIF had been granted to May 20, 2002. The Board's letter further indicated that should the PIF not be filed by May 20, 2002 a Notice to Appear for the commencement of abandonment proceedings would be issued.\n4. A completed PIF was not received from the claimant by May 20, 2002 and a Notice to Appear for an abandonment proceeding on July 2, 2002 was issued to the claimant and counsel on June 6, 2002. On June 5, 2002 the Board wrote to claimant's counsel disclosing the requested information from the Minister.\n5. A completed PIF was received from the claimant on June 18, 2002. The abandonment proceeding was held by teleconference with the claimant and counsel's agent in Toronto and the panel and interpreter in Vancouver.\nANALYSIS AND CONCLUSION\nHaving reviewed the whole of the record and considered the evidence of the claimant and the submission of counsel in this matter, the panel concludes that the claimant has failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for the delay in submitting his PIF and I am not satisfied that there are sufficient reasons to establish that the claimant has not abandoned his claim.\nAt the hearing, counsel for the claimant was represented by an agent, Hart Kaminker, Barrister and Solicitor who made a submission that the claimant failed to file his PIF within the required timeframe because claimant's counsel was awaiting a copy of the Port of Entry Notes from the Board. Counsel's agent further stated that the claimant was ready to proceed with his claim and never intended to abandon his claim. When counsel was asked if he intended to bring forward evidence from the claimant in the matter he responded that he did not.\nI am not satisfied with the explanation of the claimant. Rule 6(1) stipulates that the completed Personal Information Form must be filed no later than 28 days after the claimant received the form. This provision is the same as the provision contained in the Rules of the Convention Refugee Determination Division which were in force at the time the claimant's refugee claim was referred to the Board and it is clearly set out on the front page of the PIF. There is no provision in the Rules for the Board to automatically or necessarily extend the time for filing of the PIF until the claimant or the claimant's counsel receives the CIC Port of Entry notes from the Board.\nI accept that the claimant may, on the day of the abandonment hearing, have been ready to continue with his claim. However, while I give weight to this factor, I do not consider that the mere submission of a completed Personal Information Form nearly four weeks after it was due and the presence of the claimant at an abandonment proceeding is in itself sufficient to establish that the claimant has not abandoned his claim. Indeed, should I decide otherwise in this case, such a decision would make a mockery of the timelines set out in the CRDD and RPD Rules.\nIf the claimant wished additional time, beyond the more than four weeks already extended, it was open to him to seek a further extension but he failed to do so until the day of the abandonment proceeding. As I have mentioned, at the abandonment hearing the claimant did not provide an explanation beyond the submission of counsel's agent that counsel was awaiting the POE notes.\nI understand why counsel wrote the Board seeking the POE notes. Indeed the Board sought and disclosed the POE notes in the most expeditious manner possible. However, I do not find that the absence of such notes, in and of itself, provides sufficient reason to delay the filing of the claimant's PIF within the required timeframe nor do I find that there is an obligation on the part of the Board to provide POE notes to counsel prior to the expiration of the PIF filing period. The claimant's obligation to file the PIF within the required timeframe is mandatory and in the absence of an extension of time granted by the Board, the claimant cannot simply decide not to file the PIF in a timely fashion. It is always possible for the claimant to file amendments to the PIF if necessary, but it is not open to them to unilaterally decide to file the PIF late and expect that no consequences would follow..\nThe record indicates that the claimant did little or nothing to advance the prosecution of his claim until after he had received a notice for the abandonment hearing. I do not consider that the claimant has acted to prosecute his refugee claim with the vigour that can be reasonably expected of someone seeking Canada's protection.\nThe filing of the claimant's PIF was not done in compliance with the timeframes that are clearly set out in the documents provided to the claimant by CIC or in compliance with the extension of time provided by the Board. The record indicates that at the time the claimant was determined eligible by CIC, the claimant signed a declaration stating that he fully understood the nature and effect of the documents provided to him. These documents included a blank PIF and a Notice to Appear, both of which, clearly stipulate the 28 day time frame. In addition, the claimant was represented by experienced counsel from March 27, 2002, nearly 30 days prior to the date the completed PIF was due at the Board.\nDECISION\nThe claimant has failed to comply with Rule 6(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Division Rules. The claim of XXXXXXXXX is therefore declared abandoned pursuant to Section 168 of IRPA and RPD Rule 58.\n\"Richard Jackson\"\nRichard Jackson\nDate (16\/07\/02)\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - ABANDONMENT - PERSONAL INFORMATION FORM - LATE FILING - PRACTICE - PROCEDURE - MALE - CHINA\nThe claimant failed to file his Personal Information Form (PIF) on time, even after receiving an extension of time. A completed PIF was not filed until after a Notice to Appear for abandonment proceeding was issued. At the hearing, counsel for the claimant stated that the claimant failed to file on time because counsel was awaiting a requested copy of the Port of Entry Notes from the Board, and that the claimant was prepared to proceed with his claim. The claim was declared abandoned. There is no provision for the Board to automatically or necessarily extend the time for filing the PIF until the claimant or his counsel receives the Port of Entry Notes, and the absence of the Notes did not in itself provide sufficient reason to delay filing the PIF. The filing of a completed PIF before the abandonment hearing and the presence of the claimant at the hearing was not in itself sufficient to establish that the claimant had not abandoned his claim. The record indicated that the claimant did little or nothing to advance the prosecution of his claim until after he had received a notice for the abandonment hearing. The panel did not consider that the claimant acted to prosecute his refugee claim with the vigour that can be reasonably expected of someone seeking Canada's protection.

She claims to have a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of government agents who wish to extract information from her with respect to dealings made by her late husband.\nDeath squads allegedly persecuted the claimant's family in the 1960s because of their perceived political opinion. When her parents died, care for her was turned over to her father's friend who later raped her. In 1973, when she was only 14 years old, her stepfather's grandson also raped her. She bore a child from this rape and lived with him in a common law relationship. She bore three more sons from this relationship.\nIn XXXXX 1995, seven men, allegedly members of the government forces G-2, barged into their home one night demanding that they turn over to them the cocaine they claimed the claimant's husband had in his possession. They fired bullets at the claimant, at her husband, and at her son XXX and later, at their two dogs. As a result of this incident, the two dogs died and XXX lost his sense of hearing. The claimant's husband subsequently died of complications from the bullet wounds after three years (in 1998).\nSeveral other men came looking for them during and after they were released from the hospital, but they were able to evade them by going into hiding in various places, including moving the whole family to El Salvador where they lived illegally. When the claimant's husband's health worsened, they returned to Guatemala where he eventually died.\nAt the funeral, two well-dressed men allegedly approached the claimant with a remark that \"the first one had died, so she should not play the fool\". When she inquired as to the meaning of his remarks, the man stated that she \"should know\" what they were talking about.\nAt the first sitting, the claimant further disclosed an incident that occurred on XXXXX, 2000 which she had been allegedly never told anyone else, this information withheld even from her counsel. Because she seemed highly emotional as she was about to recall this traumatic incident, and also because the incident she was disclosing was new to her counsel, the panel decided to adjourn the hearing to enable counsel to discuss this new evidence with the claimant.\nAt the second sitting, the claimant described the details of the XXXX, 2000 incident. According to her, while she was waiting for a bus at the Quatepeque market, two men grabbed her and forced her into a van, covered her head with a small bag that contained powdered insecticide, and tied her neck with the string of the bag forcing her to inhale the insecticide. They demanded her to tell them \"who the others are\". When she replied that she did not know, they raped her and kept hitting at her feet causing them to be battered so badly that up to this date, she has no nails on her feet. They then left her in a dark isolated street at 2 am and threatened that they will again force her to reveal the information they wanted by abducting one of her children.\nWhen the claimant arrived home that morning, her face was so badly swollen and her body so badly battered that her children did not even recognize her. The following day, the claimant left Guatemala for El Salvador with her four children. The claimant proceeded to Mexico from on XXXX, 2000, arriving in the United States on the same day. She made her way to Canada arriving on October 31, 2000. She made her refugee claim ten days later, on November 11, 2000.\nAfter the claimant arrived in Canada, unknown persons reportedly grabbed her eldest son XXXX, but he managed to run away from them.\nAnalysis\nI find the claimant's evidence, with respect to her being a victim of persecution from persons seeking information from her late husband which they believe she possesses, to be credible. There were no major contradictions, inconsistencies and implausibilities in her evidence with respect to the harm she fears other than her omission of the XXXX 2000 incident. The omission of the XXXX 2000 incident has been explained to my satisfaction. Her demeanour in recounting the XXXXX 2000 incident and the psychological report quoted below corroborates the fear she alleges.\nHowever, when Ms. XXXXX began to speak of her torture, she became extremely distraught and had difficulty relating the details. Her respiration accelerated, she began to tremble and wring her hands, and she often looked at the floor as if in a daze. She also had a facial expression of fear when recalling the bag placed over her head and required frequent breaks to catch her breath and compose herself. During this period, her tone of voice became low and shaky. It was evident that she had to make considerable efforts to disclose details of her torture in Guatemala.\nGiven the traumatic nature of the torture, it is not surprising that Ms. XXXXX had difficulty disclosing the details to the lawyer or during the hearing. Because she suffers from PTSD, she avoids any thoughts or conversations associated with the trauma. Individuals who suffer from PTSD try to distance themselves and avoid disclosing details for fear that their emotional display may be too overwhelming for them to control. Therefore, when Ms. XXXXX attempts to recall and speak of the torture, she is overwhelmed by feelings of profound fear and anxiety. Her fear was evident even in the non-threatening environment of my office where she began to relive her trauma as she disclosed it.\nI believe Ms. XXXX would emotionally collapse if she were compelled to return to Guatemala.1\nI, therefore, accept that the claimant was and continues to be a victim of persecution. However, for reasons below, I do not accept her allegations that her perpetuators are agents of the government.\nWhen asked if she knew exactly who was constantly harassing her and her family, the claimant at first stated that she believed that they were government G-2 forces. When asked what was the basis of this allegation, the claimant replied that this was what they told her husband and her when they came barging into their home on XXXX 1995. However, when asked why the government authorities would continue to harass her and her family given that her husband is now dead, she replied that she does not know why. She told the panel that she had on several occasions, inquired from her husband, even at his death bed, what it was that the men wanted from him. According to the claimant, her husband replied that it was better for her not to know anything, as things would be worse if she knew. He then asked for her forgiveness, warned her that the threats would continue, and advised her to run away from Guatemala.\nThe claimant submitted as evidence a newspaper clipping describing what happened when the alleged government agents came barging into their home in 1995.stated that:\nFour members of the family two under age are under attack with gun fire when they were sleeping in their house. This happened in the town of Tecun Uman San Marcos....2\nAll the neighbours from the green colony, they told the authorities what happened at 2:00 in the morning on Thursday. The bandit's faces were covered with masks and it was very impossible to get a good description of what they looked liked.3 [emphasis added]\nNowhere in the article was there any indication that this was a government raid. In fact, the article described the attackers as \"bandits\" with their faces covered with masks. I do not find it likely, on a balance of probabilities, that the article would call the attackers bandits if they were really government agents. I also do not find it likely, on a balance of probabilities, that the government agents, if they were truly acting on official government orders, would be dressed up like bandits, with masks covering their faces.\nI also do not find it plausible that government agents would speak in vague terms, such as \"the first one had died, so do not play the fool\" and to have replied \"you know what we are talking about\" when she consistently inquired as to what they mean and what information they wanted from her. On a balance of probabilities, I find that government agents would more likely inform her of her husband's involvement and why they believe her husband has the information they wanted. I find that, had they told her the details of her husband's likely illegal dealings, she would have believed that she was helping the government in their pursuit of the law and she would have likely told them who he used to hang around with, if she could not specifically name the people they wanted to know.\nNeither do I believe that government agents would attempt to abduct her eldest son in Retahueleu and then do nothing after he had managed to run away from them. In my opinion, the actions of her persecutors are more typical of criminals rather than government agents. I therefore find that, on a balance of probabilities, her fears are from common criminals demanding to know details of her late husband's transactions, specifically, who her late husband had been dealing with. Accordingly, I find that her fears do not have any nexus to the grounds in the Convention definition.\nRisk to Life and to Cruel and Unusual Treatment and Punishment\nSection 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) states that:\n97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\na) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or\nb) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\ni. the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that country,\nii. the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,...\nAccordingly, I have to assess whether the claimant faces a risk to her life or to a treatment or punishment that is cruel and unusual.\nIn assessing the risk, I have considered what standard of proof to be applied: whether to use the standard of proof of a \"reasonable chance or serious possibility\", or a higher standard. The Act is silent as to the appropriate standard of proof to be used. I note that the CIC Guidelines issued for Post-Determination Refugee Claimants in Canada (PDRCC) Reviews, the precursor of the section 97(1)(b) provisions, set the standard of proof at \"less than a clear probability, or even a balance of probabilities, but greater than a mere possibility.\"4\nIn my opinion, the standard of proof to be used is that set out in Adjei5, i.e., whether the claimant faces a \"reasonable chance or serious possibility\" of a risk to his or her life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. I consider it to be the logical choice as it is consistent with the standard of proof for establishing a well-founded fear of persecution under the Convention. Both the Convention ground and this ground deal with a prospective risk of serious human rights violations and the harm contemplated under section 97(1)(b) is no less serious than the harm to be protected against under the Convention. Therefore, in my opinion, a claimant should not have to establish the prospective risk to a higher degree of certainty than under the Convention.\nIn addition, there is a compelling argument that the standard of proof should be consistent among the three grounds as all grounds deal with a prospective fear of human rights violations. In fact, the U.K. Immigration Appeal Tribunal in Kacaj6 noted that the various expressions used in reference to the legal test for asylum cases, namely \"reasonable chance,\" \"substantial grounds for thinking\" and \"serious possibility\" were taken to refer to the same degree of risk as a \"real risk.\" In addition, it noted the practical difficulty of applying two legal tests to the same set of facts in a given hearing.\nTherefore, I have used the standard of proof as set out in Adjei7 as the standard that should be applied under section 97(1)(b).\nGiven the continuous and relentless pursuit of extracting information from the claimant, I find that there is a serious possibility that the claimant faces a risk to her life or to a cruel and unusual treatment should she return to Guatemala. However, in order for the claimant to be determined a person in need of protection, she must meet all the elements of the definition, meaning that there is no State Protection and\/or an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) reasonably available for her.\nState Protection\nThe Immigration and Refugee Protection Act requires that for a claimant to be determined a person in need of Canada's protection, he should be able to provide \"clear and convincing\" evidence of an absence of state protection.\nThe claimant has not made any report or denunciation of the harm she experienced in Guatemala to any agent of the government because she believed that her perpetuators are government agents. Under these conditions, I find her actions of not availing the protection of her state to be reasonable.\nThe test given in Villafranca8 is as follows:\n\"...where a state is in effective control of its territory, has military, police and civil authority in place, and makes serious efforts to protect its citizens from terrorist activities, the mere fact that it is not always successful at doing so will not be enough to justify a claim that the victims of terrorism are unable to avail themselves of such protection.\nThe questions before me are: Are there \"serious efforts\" being made by the Guatemalan government to protect its citizens? Does the Guatemalan government have effective control of its territory? The documentary evidence states:\nIn many cases, the prosecutorial and judicial system was unable to ensure full and timely investigations, fair trials, or due process. Arbitrary arrest and lengthy pretrial detention continued to be problems. Judges and other law enforcement officials are subject to intimidation and corruption. In May the U.N. Special Rapporteur for Justice noted a deterioration in the security of justice sector workers. Threats against judicial personnel, journalists, witnesses, labor organizers, and human rights workers heightened public insecurity. Parallel investigations, the obstruction of justice, threats, and intimidation also were traced to groups related to the Government. The MINUGUA noted that the majority of human rights violations were the result of the failure of the state to investigate and punish those who break the law. An estimated 15 percent of the violations derive from the obstruction of justice, particularly by police officers whose only punishment was to be rotated away from assignments where there were problems. Efforts to reform the judiciary continued; however, impunity remained a serious problem. 9\nThe Government achieved convictions in a few important cases involving past human rights violations; however, most human rights cases remained pending for lengthy periods without being investigated or languished in the courts as defense attorneys took advantage of the inefficient judicial system and filed numerous baseless motions and appeals to delay trials.10\nDuring the year, the Supreme Court ordered the Prosecutor's Office to conduct a new investigation into the 1993 murder of newspaper publisher and former presidential candidate Jorge Carpio Nicolle and associates. Suspect Francisco Ixcoy Lopez, former Civil Defense Patrol member, remained at large, despite the fact that the Carpio family had located him and informed the authorities of his whereabouts. The criminal case remained open, but the Prosecutor's Office made no efforts to advance the case and the victim's family withdrew the charges. The case before the IACHR for the Government's failure to provide justice remained pending. The family of Jorge Carpio also requested the IACHR send the case to the Inter-American Court, since they believed that justice was not being served in the Guatemalan courts. The Court accepted the petition in November. It is estimated that the Court may call as witnesses 20 or more former military officers and civil patrollers, as well as high-level government officials. 11\nWhile some high profile cases, such as the 1998 assassination of Bishop Juan Gerardi, saw the arrest and conviction of the perpetuators of the crime, the appeal process has bogged the whole justice process down. I am therefore satisfied that a poor widow like the claimant at bar would not be able to avail of the protection of her state.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\nI have considered whether the risk faced by the claimant is limited to part of the country and whether there are other parts of the country, reasonably accessible by the claimant, where the claimant would not face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nThe evidence is clear that the perpetuators appear to be relentless in pursuing the claimant in order to obtain the information they believe she possesses. When the claimant could not be located, they attempted to abduct her eldest son who lived in Retahueleu, about forty-five minutes from Quatepeque where she lived. While it is true that the claimant can buy time by staying with her other children in Santo Tomas (three hours from Quatepeque) or San Antonio (two hours by bus), I find, given time, they would likely hear that the claimant had return to Guatemala should she return today. I find it likely that they would again harm her in order to obtain the information they appear to indefatigably want.\nAccordingly, based on the evidence before me, I find that there is no IFA reasonably available for the claimant.\nConclusion\nFor all the above reasons, the Refugee Division determines that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is a person in need of protection.\n\"Milagros J.

It is not that they would not be happier here in this country that over the period of a few decades has become a veritable paean to multiculturalism. The claimant is Chinese, the wife is Spanish - Toronto for example would be an ideal place for them. It is simply this: their difference in ethnicity causes them no more than harassment or personal inconvenience in Costa Rica and difficulties in their families, even on a cumulative basis. It does not cause them harm; it does not cause them persecution.\nLet me here briefly give their background. XXXXXXXXX is a Chinese born in Vietnam in 1955. He came to Costa Rica to work in his uncle's restaurant in 1980. His family was the only Chinese family in Cartago. He began dating XXXXXXXXXXXX and married her in XXXXX 1989. The marriage caused great tension in the families. It also created dissension in the small community. In 1995, the family decided it best to go to China, where they stayed on a yearly residential permit. Forced to leave in 2000, they decided to come to Canada.\nIt is the situation of the minor boy, XXXXXX, that causes me great concern. I decided that it was important that XXXXXX testify at the hearing.\nHe was very quiet, very soft spoken. He told me of the lonely life he had led at school. He never had a friend to call his own. As was the only Chinese student, he would be called names and teased mercilessly. The children beat him up and spat on him because he was not one of them - he was not \"really\" Costa Rican.\nThere were days when it became so difficult to go to school that he would lock himself in his washroom and cry. He did not like the day that waited outside for him. He did not like people he would have to meet. And when school ended, he would come home crying, not understanding why the other kids had been so cruel to him. I could see that the simple act of recalling his school-life in Costa Rica caused him deep personal anguish.\nI asked him about his school in Canada and his eyes lighted up. He would have gone on talking about his Canadian school if I had allowed him to do so. And then I brought him back to reality.\nI asked him how he felt about a possible return to Costa Rica. A crest-fallen look replaced the sunshine on his face. A look of ineffable sadness entered his eyes. And he uttered just one word, a remarkable word because he was a boy so young in years. He answered \"Suicide.\"\nWas his school experience persecutory? From the lordly perch of an adult, one could say it was not. The reason for such a view is, of course, that the Convention refugee definition and its evolving law is mostly about adults.1\n\"Persecution\" - the single most important concept in refugee law takes adult situations into account. For example, a series of detentions in prison is deemed to be persecution.2 This is because the adult cherishes freedom. The regime of rights that adults have developed is in response to adult needs, the unjust denial of which is tantamount to persecution.3\nI believe, however, that the term \"persecution\", needs to be made relevant to the world of the child as well. In a prior decision,4 I have written thus about minors under seven years of age\nIn literature on child development, especially on children up to seven years of age, one need amongst the many mentioned is repeated constantly. It is the child's need for the love and attention of parents. The greatest fear of a child of five, it is mentioned, is of losing the mother. Thus for a child of five, the prospect of going to jail is of little consequence; it is the prospect of losing the mother that matters. The fear of persecution, as far as the five-year old is concerned, is the fear of losing the mother.\nHaving had a look at the minor claimant, a minor who is sixteen years of age, it is clear to me that peer rejection had, in his particular circumstances, caused him intense pain. That pain cannot be dismissed as trivial. It ought not to be devalued simply because it is not traceable to an adult cause. Pain is integral to persecution. The children who reviled this boy, who spat upon him, who pushed him around were as much agents of persecution, from a child's perspective, as a policeman beating a prisoner is from an adult's point of view. It is not only of the pain they cause that we speak about. It is also the long-term effects of peer rejection. An article on child development5 has this to say,\nGiven the significance of friendships to children, imagine what it would be like to spend over 40 hours a week in school and after-school programs with lots of other people your own age, but to have few of them like you or want to be with you...Peer rejection in childhood often brings with serious emotional difficulties. Rejected children are frequently discontent with themselves and with their relationships with other children. Many of these children experience strong feelings of loneliness and social dissatisfaction. Rejected children also report lower self-esteem and may be more depressed than other children. Peer rejection is also predictive of later life problems, such as dropping out of school, juvenile delinquency and mental health problems.\nMy finding: the minor claimant suffered persecution at school by reason of his ethnicity. His fear of persecution is well-founded for the same reason. He is determined a Convention refugee. I accept his claim.\nHowever, it is my finding that neither of is parents have provided me with sufficient proof to conclude that they are either Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. Accordingly, I reject their claims.\n\"Harindar Aulach\"\nHarindar Aulach\nDATED at Toronto this 19th day of December 2002.\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - PERSECUTION - ETHNIC PERSECUTION - HARASSMENT - MINORS - MALE -FEMALE - POSITIVE - NEGATIVE - COSTA RICA\n1 The comments here are basically the comments are made in an earlier CRDDD Decision, No. 99-02651 dated 7 October 1999\n2 James C.

The minor claimants' father, XXXXXX, was their Designated Representative.\nThe claimant alleges fear of persecution from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrillas because of his perceived political opinion. He states that in 1998, he wrote a letter \"Letter from a citizen to the guerrillas\" where he told the guerrillas to give up their violent means of trying to achieve their political agenda. The claimant concluded his letter saying:\nIt's a time to think. We still have this rich and beautiful country in a condition that it could be rebuilt without violence. And if one could work in peace anywhere, there will be work for everyone and so we will be able to live in peace. There is no doubt that we all fit in here and there is enough for everyone.1\nHe stated that, in spite of his attempts to have this letter printed in a major newspaper, it was only printed in a local, limited circulation, newspaper called \"XXXX XXXXX\" in XXXXXX, 1998. He also made photocopies of this letter, circulated about 5,000 of these letters to anyone he knew or met and posted it in public places.\nIn early 2000, he saw a television program where the host invited citizens to write a letter to the guerrillas. He then sent his letter to them via an e-mail address provided by the television station. According to the claimant, he believes that many other citizens of Colombia also responded by sending e-mail letters.\nIn March 2000, the claimant allegedly received a call at his apartment from someone who identified himself as FARC, telling him that \"people with big mouths had to keep them closed and that he should say goodbye to the world\".\nIn XXXX 2000, an attempt was made to kidnap the claimant's children. A man in a white car came to the apartment complex and told the porter that he was there to pick up the XXXXXX children. It so happened that this was not a day in which the children were going to school, as they had a doctor's appointment. Thus, when XXXXXX went down to meet the persons in the white car, the man left the complex upon seeing XXXXXX. XXXXXX then gave instructions to the porter that henceforth, the children are not to be allowed to leave the complex unless accompanied by her or the claimant. The porter was also instructed not to give anyone information on whether they were or were not home.\nThat same night, the caller stated that even if they did not succeed that time, that they would succeed the next time. After this, the claimants went out of the apartment only if it was necessary. The children were taken to the schools and picked up by either XXXXXX or the claimant.\nTwo weeks later, someone came to the apartment complex asking the porter for the children. The porter, as told, did not give out any information about their whereabouts.\nIn June 2000, two strange men, again in a white car, came to the children's school and called XXXXXXX by her name. XXXXXXX was then waiting for their mother to pick them up. XXXXXXX was inside the school grounds playing. XXXXXXX ran inside the school building and left only after her mother arrived and when she was assured that the white car was gone.\nThat evening, the claimant received another call, telling him to say goodbye to XXXXXXX.\nIn July 2000, the claimant noticed a motorcycle following him, but luckily he was able to lose it by running through red lights.\nThus, on XXX, 2000, the claimant abandoned his business and took XXXXXXX with him to Miami. XXXXXX took the other children to a friend's house. However, after two weeks, the callers managed to track XXXXXX down at their friend's place. At first they would hang up, then in August 2000, they identified themselves as being from the FARC.\nXXXXXX then joined the claimant in Miami. They filed an asylum case in the USA, but were advised to go to Canada instead. On May 1, 2001, the claimants came to Canada where they made refugee claims at the border.\nAnalysis\nI found the minor claimant XXXXXXX testimony with respect to the kidnapping attempts to be credible. As it was only in a mid-hearing conference that the suggestion to call XXXXXXX to testify was made, I find her testimony quite compelling given that it was spontaneous and not likely coached. She testified in a direct and straightforward manner and her testimony was consistent with her father's evidence. There were no contradictions and implausibilities in her evidence. I also found XXXXXXX and XXXXXX demeanour when XXXXXXX was relating the kidnapping attempts to be consistent with one who has experienced the attempted kidnapping (or in the case of XXXXXX, with one whose daughter had experienced these attempts). I, therefore, accept that the minor claimants are victims of attempted kidnapping.\nHowever, for reasons to be given below, I do not find persuasive the claimant's evidence that these kidnapping attempts were made by FARC for the reasons he has given, i.e., his open letter and\/or his e-mail sent to the guerrilla.\nThe letter was published in XXXXX, 19982 in an obscure local newspaper. Yet, no harm was made to the claimants until XXXXX 2000, more than two years after its publication. When asked for an explanation as to why it took FARC so long to respond to his letter, the claimant stated that, maybe, they only learned of this letter after two years. I do not accept this explanation, as it is not consistent with the documentary evidence on the level of sophistication that FARC currently possesses3 with respect to their intelligence and communication networks. I do not believe that it would take FARC more than two years to find out about the existence of a letter, nor do I believe that it will take two years for FARC to react on a given letter.\nThe claimant further explained that the delay in reprisals from the FARC could be their reprisal to his e-mail in early 2000. I reject this explanation because the claimant's e-mailed letter was a response from a call to the general public. There is no evidence that other e-mail senders were similarly harmed. According to the claimant, he believes that many people had sent e-mail letters to FARC as well. The claimant, however, is not aware if any of the other e-mail writers experienced any reprisals from the FARC.\nThere is nothing in the documentary evidence indicating that any of the e-mail writers were similarly harmed. The call to write letters was a public announcement aired on television. It is reasonable to expect that had there been adverse repercussions against the e-mail writers who had responded to this call, that these repercussions would have been reported in the media. In connection with the failure of the documentary evidence to mention what one would normally expect it to mention, we are guided by the Federal Court of Appeal decision of Adu4 that states:\n...The \"presumption\" that a claimant's sworn testimony is true is always rebuttable, and, in appropriate circumstances, may be rebutted by the failure of the documentary evidence to mention what one would normally expect it to mention.\nAs stated above, the claimant's open letter was printed in an obscure newspaper with limited local circulation. Its impact upon its readers, especially after more than two years, appears to be minimal. Its message of wanting peace and ending violence is no different from the sentiment of most Colombians, including the leaders of the FARC themselves. In an interview with a Canadian journalist, FARC Commander Raul Reyes5, stated:\n...despite the attitude of the oligarchy, the CARC-EP has never stopped raising the banner of a political solution to the national crisis. True peace is born of living together with tolerance, fundamental human rights, job security, housing, medical attention, good public services, education, mutual respect, and a proud stance against imperialism. This above all is the deepest desire of the people.\nBecause of the above reasons, I reject the claimant's evidence that the FARC will now harm the claimant in retaliation for his letter made in 1998 and\/or his e-mail made in early 2000.\nI believe, on the other hand, XXXXXXXX testimony with respect to the several attempts to kidnap her and her siblings except that I have no persuasive evidence that the persons attempting to kidnap the children are from the FARC.\nIn addition to my reasons stated above for not finding that the FARC would seek reprisals against the claimant for his open letter, I do not find it likely that the FARC would give up its kidnapping attempt just because the children's mother were present. In all instances, the abductors reportedly fled when they saw XXXXXX --- at the lobby of their apartment and at the entrance to the school. The FARC is known to have kidnapped children even in front of their parents.\nFurther documentary evidence talks about many child abductions by the FARC in order to train them to be child soldiers6. While the minor claimants do not necessarily fit into the typical profile of children being recruited as child soldiers (i.e. rural, indigenous, poor children), I still considered this possibility in my analysis. If it were FARC's intention to forcibly recruit the XXXXXX children to be soldiers, would not the then 11-year old XXXXXXX be the better recruit than the then 8-year old XXXXXXX? Yet, according to the claimant's evidence, the caller specifically identified XXXXXXX as their target.\nI find, on a balance of probabilities, that the kidnapping attempts were not made by the paramilitary units. The only logical abductors, therefore, who may have attempted to kidnap the children were common criminals. The documentary evidence states:\nEduardo Delgadillo, a researcher who authored the study \"Kidnappings in Colombia\" told IPS the armed groups carry out the abductions for political ends and extortion. But he indicated other causes have led to an increase of kidnappings perpetrated by groups of common criminals.7\nOn a balance of probabilities, I find the agents of persecution likely to be common criminals. Therefore, I find that there is no nexus between what the claimants fear and the grounds in the Convention definition. Accordingly, I cannot find the claimants to be Convention refugees.\nRisk to Life and to Cruel and Unusual Treatment and Punishment\nGiven the persistence of kidnapping attempts against the minor claimants, I find that there is a serious possibility that they will be kidnapped should they return to Colombia. The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) states the following with respect to persons who could be determined to be in need of protection:\n97 (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\na) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or\nb) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\ni. the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country,\nii. the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\niii. the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\niv. the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.\nGiven the above mandate, I have assessed the risk that the minor claimants face should they return to Colombia.\nIn assessing the risk, I have considered what standard of proof to be applied: whether to use the standard of proof of a \"reasonable chance or serious possibility\" or a higher standard. The Act is silent as to the appropriate standard of proof to be used. I note that the CIC Guidelines issued for Post-Determination Refugee Claimants in Canada (PDRCC) Reviews, the precursor of the section 97(1)(b) provisions, set the standard of proof at \"less than a clear probability, or even a balance of probabilities, but greater than a mere possibility.\"8\nIn my opinion, the standard of proof to be used is that set out in Adjei9, i.e., whether the claimant faces a \"reasonable chance or serious possibility\" of a risk to his or her life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. I consider it to be the logical choice as it is consistent with the standard of proof for establishing a well-founded fear of persecution under the Convention. Both the Convention ground and this ground deal with a prospective risk of serious human rights violations and the harm contemplated under section 97(1)(b) is no less serious than the harm to be protected against under the Convention. Therefore, in my opinion, a claimant should not have to establish the prospective risk to a higher degree of certainty than under the Convention.\nIn addition, there is a compelling argument that the standard of proof should be consistent among the three grounds as all grounds deal with a prospective fear of human rights violations. In fact, the U.K. Immigration Appeal Tribunal in Kacaj10 noted that the various expressions used in reference to the legal test for asylum cases, namely \"reasonable chance,\" \"substantial grounds for thinking\" and \"serious possibility\" were\ntaken to refer to the same degree of risk as a \"real risk.\" In addition, it noted the practical difficulty of applying two legal tests to the same set of facts in a given hearing.\nTherefore, I have used the standard of proof as set out in Adjei11 as the standard that should be applied under section 97(1)(b).\nI note that the country documentation shows the prevalence of lawlessness in Colombia12 and that Colombia has been dubbed the \"number one kidnap capital in the world\". The documentary evidence states the following:\nMOD figures indicated that approximately 200 children were killed due to the conflict during 2,000. Children suffered disproportionately from the internal conflict, often forfeiting opportunities to study as they were displaced by conflict and suffered psychological traumas.13\nAccording to UNICEF, approximately 25,000 children --- 16,000 of them between 8 and 12 years of age --- are victims of sexual exploitation.14\nColombia is a source country for trafficking in women and girls to Europe, the United States, Asia and other Latin American countries.15\nThe issue here is whether there is a serious possibility that the minor claimants will each be subjected personally to a risk to their lives or to cruel and unusual treatment. While the qualifiers \"cruel and unusual\" are not defined in the Act, jurisprudence from cases dealing with s.12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms are helpful in determining what kind of treatment is cruel and unusual. In R. v. Smith16 standards such as treatment or punishment which shocks the conscience was found to be cruel and unusual.\nTreatment that is inhuman or degrading has been equated with cruel and unusual treatment.17 Inhuman treatment has been described as premeditated, applied for hours at a stretch and causing, if not bodily injury, intense physical and mental suffering. Degrading treatment has been described as arousing in its victims' feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them and possibly breaking their physical and moral resistance.18\nAccording to the above documentary evidence, children who are kidnapped will be deprived of education, will be subjected to death, rape, prostitution, girl trafficking, and psychological trauma. I find this treatment to be inhuman and degrading as it shocks the conscience and can be considered to be equivalent to cruel and unusual treatment.19 It is also a risk to life.\nThe Convention on the Rights of the Child 199020 states the following:\nArticle 6: State Parties recognize that every child has the inherent right to life.\nArticle 37: State Parties shall ensure that\n(a) No child shall be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment without possibility of release shall be imposed for offences committed by persons below 18 years of age;\nThe binding authority of the above international covenant is clearly enunciated in the IRPA legislation that states the following:\n3. (3) This Act is to be construed and applied in a manner that ...\n(f) complies with international human rights instruments to which Canada is a signatory.\nClearly, the kidnapping of the minor children will expose them to the possibility of degrading, inhumane and cruel treatment --- a breach of the international covenant on the rights of the child. I, therefore, find the minor claimants to be persons in need of protection.\nWith respect to the adult claimants, should any of their children be kidnapped and harmed, the question before me is, will they themselves be subjected to a cruel and unusual treatment or punishment as a result of this harm? In answering this question, I note Mr. Justice Lamer's statements in R. v. Smith21 that the criteria usefully synthesized by Professor Tarnopolsky in an article entitled \"Just Deserts or Cruel and Unusual Treatment or Punishment? Where Do We Look for Guidance?\"22 can provide guidance. The criteria mentioned are:\n* Is the punishment such that it goes beyond what is necessary to achieve a legitimate penal aim?\n* Is it unnecessary because there are adequate alternatives?\n* Is it unnecessary to a large segment of the population?\n* Is it such that it cannot be applied upon a rational basis in accordance with ascertained or ascertainable standards?\n* Is it arbitrarily imposed?\n* Is it such that it has no value in the sense of some social purpose such as reformation, rehabilitation, deterrence or retribution?\n* Is it in accord with public standards of decency or propriety?\n* Is the punishment of such a character as to shock general conscience or as to be intolerable in fundamental fairness?\n* Is it unusually severe and hence degrading to human dignity and worth?\nI find the adult claimants to be caring and loving parents. They both manifested a deep concern for their children's security and well being. The adult claimants restricted the minor claimants to only activities of the school or those that are deemed necessary and in places where there are only relatives and friends. After the first kidnap attempt, they cancelled the bus pickups for their children. Instead, they made sure that one of them brought their children to school and picked them up from school. Shortly only after the second try to kidnap XXXXXXX, the claimant took her away to Miami. The claimant is a self-employed businessman and XXXXXX is a Coordinator of a corporation. They both gave up an established profession and a good income to come to Canada to risk starting all over again.\nShould any of their children be kidnapped and harmed, the adult claimants will likely suffer severe psychological trauma. The mere recounting by XXXXXXX of the kidnapping attempts at the hearing brought emotional distress upon their parents. XXXXXX in particular could not contain her sobbing. If the adult claimants returned to Colombia and find any or both of their daughters kidnapped, they will both be tormented by the reasonable belief that their daughters, once kidnapped, will face the risks of murder, rape, of being forced into prostitution, or of being psychologically devastated. These, in my opinion, are treatment that meets three of the guiding criteria suggested by Mr. Justice Lamer above, namely, a) that the treatment is against public standards of decency or propriety, b) that the punishment is of such a character as to shock general conscience and, c) that it is unusually severe and hence degrading to human dignity and worth.23. Hence, I find the adult claimants also face a serious possibility of risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. They are therefore also persons in need of protection.\nState Protection\nBefore a claimant can be found to be a person in need of protection, he or she must be able to meet all the elements of the definition which include an assessment of State Protection and an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA). The following documentary evidence24 describes the inability of the state to have effective control of its territory against armed insurgents and armed criminals.\nThe government continued to face serious challenges to its control over the national territory, as longstanding and widespread internal armed conflict and rampant violence --- both political and criminal --- persisted25.\nI, therefore, find that there is clear and convincing evidence before me that the state is unable to protect the claimants.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\nI have also considered whether the risks faced by the claimants are limited to part of the country and whether there are other parts of the country, reasonably accessible by the claimants, where the claimants would not face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. However, based on the evidence before me, I find that there is no internal flight alternative for the claimants because most common criminals in Colombia have extensive contacts and networks all over the country. Once declared to be a target, they will manage to find the claimants in other parts of the country. This is exactly what happened when XXXXXX took the remaining children to XXXXXX XXXXX (a friend) home on XXXXX, 2000 after the claimant and XXXXXXX left Colombia. Two weeks after they went into hiding, the perpetrators phoned, looking for them. I, therefore, find that IFA is not reasonably available for the claimants.\nConclusion\nFor all the above reasons, the Refugee Division determines that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, and XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX are persons in need of protection.\n\"Milagros J.

He bases his claim on his fear of crime and violence in Guyana.\nIn order to be determined to be a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, the evidence must establish that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution for a Convention ground or must establish that their removal to their country of nationality would subject them personally (a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or (b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nIdentity\nThe claimant's identity is established by the certified true copy of his passport which was forwarded to the Board by the Immigration department1 and a new passport issued by the Consulate General of Guyana in Toronto which he presented at the hearing.2\nCredibility\nThe claimant's testimony was credible and trustworthy. He was honest and straightforward and did not embellish his claim.\nEvidence\nThe claimant does not wish to return to Guyana. He stated that crime and violence affect everyone's life and have increased dramatically in the three years since he left his country. He fears that because he is Indo-Guyanese he will be harmed by criminal elements from the Afro-Guyanese population. He stated that Indo-Guyanese, are more often the targets of the criminal element as they are more affluent. He also stated that the police themselves have been beaten by bandits and that several police officers have been killed in the past few months. He is concerned that if he returns to Guyana, he will be perceived as being wealthy because of having lived in Canada and that this will lead to his being robbed.\nAnalysis\nThe panel finds that the claimant fears general levels of crime and violence. Although the claimant states he is at risk because he is Indo-Guyanese, the documentary evidence indicates that not only Indo-Guyanese are at risk of violent crime, but all persons living in Guyana are at risk.3 The Indo-Guyanese are the group who are most often targeted for robbery as they are the most affluent of the two major racial groups.\nThe police in Guyana are facing a very difficult situation with the increase in violent crime but the documentary evidence indicates that the police do not discriminate with respect to the protection they offer Guyanese citizens.\nA Response to Information Request4 states that in the view of the Guyana Human Rights Association (GHRA):\n\"The police do not discriminate on grounds of race or political affiliation in its handling of complaints and crimes. There were concerns about police bias based mostly on political affiliation or ethnicity before 1992, but the situation as regards equality of rights and freedoms has constantly improved since then, and the police are now perceived to be neutral on questions of ethnicity and political affiliation. However, there is a serious problem with violent crime, which has been steadily increasing in both numbers and violence. In Guyana, a country of some 750,000 inhabitants, about two violent home invasions take place every week, and most of the victims are Indo-Guyanese victims. The increase in violent crime is attributed mostly to illegal drugs and persons seeking to finance their consumption. The disproportionate victimization of Indo-Guyanese is attributed to their proportionally grater affluence, since they are a major component of the business and trading 'class', and many are relatively prosperous farmers.\"\nIt continues:\n\"The police response to violent crimes has been inadequate; rather than an ethnic or political motivation for this incapacity to cope, it is widely perceived that the police force does not have the necessary manpower, training and salaries to ensure an effective action against the increasing crime.\"\nThe claimant is Indo-Guyanese and it is the party that represents the Indo-Guyanese, the PPP that is in power and has been since 1992. The President is Indo-Guyanese. While the security forces and the police are made up for the most part of Afro-Guyanese, the government has attempted to recruit more Indo-Guyanese into the security forces but has met with little response. Most Indo-Guyanese prefer business, farming or professional careers. The government has made efforts to reduce racial tension. The government has sponsored various forums for discussion of racial problems and supported the work of NGO's that deal with these concerns.5 There is no evidence to suggest that the government has turned a blind eye to the serious problem of violent crime. On the contrary, the government is formed by the party that represents the Indo-Guyanese and the evidence indicates it is attempting to protect its constituents.\nThe persons the claimant fears are criminals and he fears general levels of crime and violence. It is a serious problem faced by all citizens of Guyana. I find that Indo-Guyanese citizens are not discriminated against by the police and are not less likely to receive protection than other citizens of Guyana.\nIn order to be determined to be a Convention refugee, a claimant must establish that he has a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of their race, religion, nationality, and membership in a particular social group or political opinion. In this case, the harm the claimant fears is not based on one of these grounds but is instead based on a fear of the general levels of crime and violence prevalent in Guyana today. I find that the claimant has not established a connection or nexus to one of the grounds of the Convention refugee definition.\nWith respect to his fear of a risk to his life, any risk that he may face is similar to that of other citizens of Guyana, as he fears a risk of random indiscriminate violence. The claimant has not established an identifiable risk that is distinguishable from that of the general population as required by section 97(1)(b)(ii) of the Immigration and Refugee Act. I find that the claimant fears a generalized risk, one that is faced by all citizens of Guyana. There was no evidence lead to support a finding that the claimant faces a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture.\nConclusion\nThe Refugee Protection Division determines that XXXXXXXXXXXXXX is not a Convention refugee, nor is he a person in need of protection. The panel rejects his claim for refugee protection.\n\"Fay Sims\"\nFay Sims\nDATED at Toronto this 17th day of October 2002.\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - NEXUS - GENERALIZED RISK - MALE - NEGATIVE - GUYANA\n1 Exhibit M-1.\n2 Exhibit C-2.\n3 Exhibit R-2, GUYANA-Racial\/Political Violence, November 2001, inclusive.\n4 Exhibit R-2, Response to Information Request, GUY29864.E, August 17, 1998.\n5 Exhibit R-3, United States Department of State, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices Guyana 2001, March 4, 2002.\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n4\n6\nTA1-11637\nTA1-11637\n",

XXXXXXXXXXXX), a 29-year-old citizen of Jamaica. The hearing for this claim was held pursuant to section 170(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act1 (IRPA) on December 4, 2002, at Toronto, Ontario.\nHe is alleging the need for protection because he fears drug dealers upon return to Jamaica.\nIn order to be determined to be a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, the evidence must establish that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution for a Convention ground or must establish that his removal to his country of nationality would subject him personally either, (a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or (b) to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nThe claimant stated that in XXXXXX 1999 two known drug dealers from Ocho Rios approached him with the request to sell marijuana, as he was a bartender in a holiday resort and had access to tourists. He told them that he would consider the request; he was approached again and denied their offer. They started to threaten him and he went to the police station to report the threats. It was suggested that he should accept the offer and that there was nothing that could be done to help him. Two other constables, who are the claimant's friends, but who were not working in the station when he reported the threats, cautioned him that constables at the station could be in cohoots with the drug dealers, and to be careful. When the drug dealers approached him again, he was able to persuade them to wait in order for him to care for his sick mother, but went into hiding instead. The claimant knew at that time that he was approved to come to Canada as a farm worker and stayed in hiding until his departure on XXXXX 1999. He stated that the drug dealers are still coming to his mother's house threatening to \"get him\" because he reported them to the police.\nAnalysis:\nIdentity:\nThe claimant's passport and other identity document's were available, therefore I accepted his identity and nationality.\nCredibility:\nI assign the benefit of doubt to the claimant's story about recruitment attempts and threats by drug dealers. He provided persuasive documents showing that he worked as a bartender at the resort during the period in question. It was established that the letter from Constable XXXXXX2 had to be given weight; both he and XXXXXXX are constables in Jamaica.3 The claimant did not present me with contradictions, omissions or embellishments and his story is plausible in the Jamaican context.4\nI also find that the issue of delay is not applicable in this case, as the claimant was not aware that he could claim for refugee protection when he arrived in Canada. He thought that refugee status would only be granted to persons with political problems. He had made alternative arrangements because he feared returning to Jamaica and did not want to be deported. He married a Canadian citizen. However, she disappeared before a sponsorship application materialized and he had problems getting a divorce in order to marry his common law Canadian wife, with whom he has a child. A second sponsorship application is now in process. The claimant asked for refugee protection in July 2001, after he came to the attention of Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) due to a police investigation, which was discontinued.5\nIFA and State Protection\nI find that this claim has to fail because of availability of an internal flight alternative (IFA) and, in so finding, I am guided by Thirunavukkarasu6 and Rasaratnam.7 I further find that there is adequate state protection8 within the IFA.\nThe claimant stated that there is no safe place for him in Jamaica and that these two drug dealers are moving up and down the coast and have criminal connections everywhere, which might be plausible. However, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that every police station in the country is on the \"take\" and that he would not receive protection from these two criminals anywhere else. His own evidence shows that not every constable in Jamaica is corrupted; his friend who wrote the letter in support of his claim is an example. Proof of lack of state protection must be clear and convincing9 and it is not for our court to establish a high standard of state protection for other countries. Reality has to prevail. Protection may not be perfect,10 and a test of whether the system is adequate considering the circumstances of this case has to be applied.11\nThe International Narcotics Control Strategy Report 1999,12 indicates that the Government of Jamaica together with the Jamaican Constabulary takes drug trafficking serious and has taken steps to protect citizens against organized crime. It tries, for example, to curb police corruption. During 1999, 32 police officers were arrested for criminal violations, and seven were charged with drug-related offences. In September 1999 the police commissioner transferred the entire 91-member special anti-crime task force because of allegations that some members were involved in unprofessional and possible criminal conduct.13 However, it is noted that more needs to be done to root out corruption.14 The Government of Jamaica prosecutes individuals who by reliable evidence are linked to drug-related activities.15 I find that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the claimant's complaints about threats from the drug dealers would not be taken serious in any constabulary outside Ocho Rios.16 Therefore, there is not a serious possibility or reasonable chance of serious harm should the claimant relocate within Jamaica.\nHaving considered the totality of the evidence, the relevant statutory provisions and jurisprudence, I find that the claimant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. Therefore, the Refugee Protection Division rejects the claim of XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (a.k.a. XXXXXXXXXXXX) for refugee protection.\n\"Elke Homsi\"\nElke Homsi\nDATED at Toronto this 16th day of December 2002.\nKEYWORDS - INTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE - RISK TO LIFE AND RISK OF CRUEL AND UNUSUAL TREATMENT OR PUNISHMENT - NEGATIVE - MALE - JAMAICA\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibit C-2.\n3 Exhibit R-3, Reply to Acquisition of Information Form (AIF).\n4 Exhibit R-2.\n5 Exhibit M-1.\n6 Thirunavukkarasu v.

The claimant is a twenty-two year old citizen of Trinidad and Tobago.\nIn order to be determined to be either a Convention refugee or a Protected person, the evidence must establish that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution for a Convention ground or must establish that their removal to their country of nationality would subject them personally either, (a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or (b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nBasis of the Claim\nThe claimant came to Canada and the United States in the summer of 1998 on a vacation with her mother. She was eighteen years old. While they were in the United States, her mother married an American citizen and decided to remain there. The claimant returned to Canada with an aunt and has been here ever since.\nThe claimant does not wish to return to Trinidad, as she believes her only option is to return to live in the family home where she had previously lived with her mother. This house is home to her grandmother and six of her mother's siblings. One of them, an uncle, is a cocaine and crack user. The uncle's use of drugs caused innumerable problems for the family, as he would steal from them to obtain money to buy drugs and his unsavoury friends would come to the house. The claimant stated she would have to return to the family home as she has no other place to go. She stated it is difficult to find a job in Trinidad and that if she did find one, it would not pay enough for her to be able to live on her own. She stated she had no other family member to go to.\nIdentity\nThe Department of Immigration provided a certified true copy of the claimant's passport to the Board. Identity is therefore established on a balance of probabilities.\nAnalysis\nThe claimant's reasons for not wanting to return to Trinidad are financial. She does not fear any person or persons. She does not fear she will be persecuted or harmed for one of the reasons or grounds set out in the Convention refugee definition. The grounds are race, religion, nationality, and membership in a particular social group or political opinion. She is not a member of a particular social group as her situation is not innate or unchangeable. Any difficulties that she would face returning to Trinidad would be based on her economic position and the fact that she is now alone while she had lived with her mother previously. While her situation could be difficult, it is not persecutory nor does it place her at a risk of torture or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nThe claimant has not established a nexus or connection to any harm she may fear and a ground of the Convention Refugee definition. Nor has she established a risk of torture or a risk to life or a risk of cruel or unusual treatment or punishment.\nThe Refugee Division determines that XXXXXXXXXX is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. The panel rejects her claim to be a protected person in Canada.\n\"Fay \"Sims\"\nFay Sims\nDATED at Toronto this 5th day of September 2002\nKEYWORDS - RISK TO LIFE - NEGATIVE - FEMALE - TRINIDAD\n3\nTA1-13760\nTA1-13760\n",

In addition, they claim to be persons in need of protection because they are at risk of losing their lives or being subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Syria.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe male claimant alleges to be a contractor who financed the construction of apartment buildings by borrowing extensively from private moneylenders against the security of the apartments and the claimants' home. Commencing in 1997 the Syrian economy fell into recession and according to the claimants the apartment buildings and their home plummeted in value. After the lenders called in their loans and foreclosed on the apartment buildings and their home, the claimants remained indebted to the moneylenders in the amount of 3.5 million Syrian pounds. According to the claimants, they were penniless and that not even a lifetime of work would generate enough income to repay their debt.\nThe claimants allege that on at least 3 occasions armed security forces threatened them and their adult children with death if the debt was not repaid. On the final occasion, the male claimant was dragged from his home to the offices of the moneylenders. According to the male claimant an armed security officer put a gun to his head and threatened to kill him and his son if the money remained unpaid. On the single occasion that the male claimant sought the protection of the police, he indicates that he was rebuffed.\nFearing for the lives of their son and daughter, the claimants allege that they made arrangements for them to leave Syria. A second daughter who remains in Syria is afforded some protection, according to the claimants, by reason of having assumed her husband's surname. Having ameliorated the risks to their children, the claimants fled to Canada.\nDETERMINATION\nThe panel finds that the claimants are persons in need of protection in that there is a serious possibility that they will be subjected personally to a risk to their lives or to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Syria.\nANALYSIS\nThe panel finds that the claimants have failed to establish a link between their fear of persecution and any of the five Convention refugee grounds; accordingly, the claim is being considered under section 97(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \"Act\").\nThe claimants' identities as nationals of Syria are established by the testimony and the supporting documentation, namely, the claimants' passports and their Certificates of Birth and Baptism.\nThe male claimant testified on behalf of himself and his wife. The panel finds that he was a credible witness and therefore believes what he has alleged in support of their claims. He testified in a straightforward manner and there were no relevant inconsistencies in his testimony or contradictions between his testimony and the other evidence before the panel.\nThe central issue in this claim is whether the claimants would be subjected personally to a risk of the harm contemplated by section 97(1)(b) of the Act, namely, a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, should the claimants return to Syria. The Act, however, is silent as to the appropriate standard of proof to be used in assessing the risk of harm as contemplated by section 97(1)(b).\nThe panel is of the opinion that the standard of proof as set out in Adjei1 and as applied to the Convention refugee definition is the standard that should be applied under section 97(1)(b) of the Act. Both the Convention grounds and the grounds under section 97(1)(b) deal with prospective risks of serious human rights violations and the harm contemplated under section 97(1)(b) is no less serious than the harm to be protected against under the Convention. Therefore, a claimant should not have to establish the prospective risk of harm under section 97(1)(b) to a higher degree of certainty than under the Convention. Accordingly, the panel has applied the Adjei standard to the facts of this claim.\nHaving regard to the foregoing, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility that the claimants would be subjected personally to a risk to life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment should they return to Syria.\nThe evidence reveals that the claimants are unable to repay a sizeable debt to money- lenders. In retribution, their lives and the lives of their children have been threatened by armed security officers. The claimants have responded to these threats by sending two of their children out of Syria. The consummation of these vindictive threats is, on a balance of probabilities, likely, given the moneylenders' interest in setting a visible example to those who fail to pay their debts. The panel finds that there is a serious possibility that such treatment will recur and that the claimants will be killed should they return to Syria.\nA further issue is whether the Syrian security forces acted on behalf of or on the directions of the moneylenders.\nThe panel finds that the Syrian security forces do act in concert with the moneylenders.\nThe testimony revealed that the moneylenders use Syrian security force members to collect bad debts and to intimidate debtors and their relatives. The documentary evidence makes it clear that the powerful role of the security services extends beyond security matters, that they operate outside the legal system and that their members commit serious human right abuses.2 The panel finds, on the balance of probabilities, that the security services do act on behalf of the moneylenders and that the moneylenders are sufficiently financed to enable them to bribe security members.\nThe question arises as to whether the state can provide the claimants protection from the moneylenders.\nThe panel finds that state protection is not available.\nThe male claimant allegedly sought protection from the authorities on one occasion but it was summarily denied. The panel finds that, given the security forces act in concert with the moneylenders, the state would not protect the claimants should they return to Syria.\nFinally, at issue is whether an internal flight alternative is available to the claimants. The panel finds, on the balance of probabilities, that there is no internal flight alternative for the claimants.\nThe evidence indicates that the moneylenders have ties with the state security forces.3 Under those circumstances, it is more likely than not that they have the ability to use their security forces contacts to track down the claimants anywhere in Syria.\nCONCLUSION\nOn the basis of the foregoing, the panel concludes that XXXXXXXXXXXXX and his wife, XXXXXXXXXXX, are persons in need of protection and therefore the panel accepts their claims for refugee protection.\n\"Keith Brennenstuhl\"\nKeith Brennenstuhl\nDATED at Toronto this 4th day of October 2002.\nKEYWORDS - STANDARD OF PROOF - RISK TO LIFE AND RISK OF CRUEL AND UNUSUAL TREATMENT OR PUNISHMENT - POSITIVE - MALE - FEMALE - SYRIA\n1 Adjei v.

Her father attempted to sponsor her but because she was already nineteen years of age at the time she was turned down. She remained in Canada illegally, eventually applying under the Humanitarian and Compassionate program in 1998. She was refused on December 19, 1998, the decision-maker finding that \"her H & C grounds do not warrant favourable consideration. No unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship would be caused were she to leave Canada and apply from abroad\".1 This decision was reviewed in November 2000 and again refused, the officer finding that the claimant's mother, her primary caretaker, remained in Jamaica and again that the claimant had not \"become established to the point where it would cause her undue and disproportionate hardship to leave Canada and seek an immigrant visa in the normal legislative manner\" (Ibid). This last refusal led to the current claim to refugee status, a last effort to remain in Canada.\nThe claimant fears returning to Jamaica because of the violence and crime that obtain in that country and because she anticipates that she might have difficulty finding a job as the economy is not thriving.\nAnalysis\nIn order to be determined to be a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, the evidence must establish that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution for a Convention ground or that her removal to her country of nationality would subject her personally either (a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or (b) to a risk to her life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nAt the outset of the hearing, the panel explained that the nexus put forward by counsel, namely, \"member of a lower income group\" did not conform to the criteria of particular social group set out in the Ward2 decision. The member explained that \"lower income\" is not an innate or unchangeable characteristic, neither is it fundamental to one's human dignity. The member therefore was not able to find that the claim had any nexus to the Convention refugee definition. She said that she was prepared to hear the claim taking into consideration the new consolidated grounds found in section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, which make allowance for claims with no nexus.\nThe panel was satisfied that the claimant is who she says she is having seen the claimant's original passport, issued in Canada on October 28, 1998 when her old passport expired, and the copious notes in the CIC material (Exhibit M-1). The issues that remained to be dealt with were: 1) credibility 2) delay in claiming, and 3) well-foundedness including agent(s) of persecution, the harm feared and protection.\nThe claimant testified to being in ongoing contact with her mother in Jamaica. Her anxieties about what might happen to her if she returned to Jamaica come from what she has heard from her mother and other individuals about the general situation there. She testified to having grown up in the neighbourhood of XXXXX known as XXXXX, a lower-income neighbourhood where robberies and other crimes including shootings go on and where the criminals more often than not go unpunished. She testified at one point to having, in her words, \"basically been raped\" when attacked by five young men when she was fourteen. No mention of this incident was made in the claimant's Personal Information Form3 (PIF). When asked why, she stated that she didn't think she had to, she just decided to tell the panel member on the spot. She testified that she didn't tell her mother at the time nor since. The panel does not believe this incident occurred. It believes the claimant put this in to attempt to bolster her claim. The panel simply does not believe a 14-year-old who had been assaulted and raped would not have told her mother. Everything about the claimant indicates a positive caring relationship with her mother. Nor did the claimant offer a satisfactory explanation for omitting this information from the PIF. The rest of her testimony was purely speculative: she might have to go back to school to get a job, she no longer has friends in the neighbourhood and might be more vulnerable as someone who is a stranger and has lived abroad for so long.\nThe claimant could not name any specific individual or group who might be interested in her. The panel has no evidence before it to indicate that she fears anyone in particular. Neither does it have evidence to indicate that what she fears is more than a vague generalized concern about crime that would be shared by any individual in a society such as Jamaica where crime and violence are indeed very high. As such, it would fall under section 97(1) (b) (ii) of the Act4 and not entitle her to advance a claim based on a risk to life, there being no evidence of a danger of torture in this case. The claimant was asked why she could not live and work elsewhere in Jamaica, i.e. outside of XXXXXXX. She was unable to answer other than to say she would need a reasonable income. The panel does not find this a satisfactory explanation. The panel recognizes that Jamaica is a small place. As it does not find the claimant to have established that she faces a well-founded fear of persecution or a risk to life in XXXXX an IFA does not really come into play.\nHaving considered all the evidence before it, the panel finds that the claimant has not established that she would face a serious possibility of persecution for a Convention ground nor a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual punishment nor a danger of torture should she return to Jamaica. The panel therefore rejects the claim to refugee protection of XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.\n\"Mindy Avrich-Skapinker\"\nMindy Avrich-Skapinker\nDATED at Toronto, this 26th day of August, 2002.\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - CREDIBILITY - NEXUS - PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP - PERSON IN NEED OF PROTECTION - GENERALIZED RISK - WOMEN REFUGEES - GENDER -FEMALE - NEGATIVE - JAMAICA\n1 Exhibit M-1.\n2 Ward v.

She claims to have a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of her membership in a particular social group, namely women who refuse to follow traditional practices, and on her perceived political opinion. On the former ground, she fears persecution at the hands of members of her own and her husband's family, from whom no state protection is available. On the latter ground, she fears persecution at the hands of agents of the government of Zimbabwe.\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, 4, a citizen of Zimbabwe, claims to have a well-founded fear of persecution based on her identity as the minor female child of her parents. She fears persecution at the hands of her grandparents, from whom state protection is unavailable to her and at the hands of agents of the government of Zimbabwe.\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, 30, the male claimant, also a Zimbabwean citizen, claims to have a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of his political opinion. He fears persecution at the hands of agents of the government of Zimbabwe.\nSummary of allegations, principal and minor claimant\nThe principal claimant alleges that, in 2000, her then husband, XXXXXXXXXXXXXX, facing persecution for his political beliefs, disappeared. As a result of his disappearance, she was forced into a levirate marriage with his brother by her own and her husband's parents, following tradition. Her prior refusal to comply and pleas to police for assistance met with no success.\nHer new husband proved to be a brutal man who mistreated her emotionally and physically, issuing death threats against her and once even holding a knife to her throat to force her submission to him. Fearing for her life and her daughter's well-being, she took the child into hiding until arrangements were completed for their departure from Zimbabwe.\nSummary of allegations, male claimant\nThe male claimant alleges that, because he was a member of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and was employed by a well-regarded non-governmental organization (NGO) doing community-related work, he received death threats and became the target of government agents. He escaped the fate of five MDC members who were killed by fleeing into hiding, having been tipped off by community members. At this point he lost contact with his family. Government agents tracked him down and beat him to unconsciousness. MDC members rescued him and took him to a hideout where he remained until they completed arrangements for his departure from Zimbabwe.\nDetermination\nThe Refugee Protection Division determines each of the claimants to be a Convention refugee because each has a well-founded fear of persecution.\nPreliminary matters\nAs a preliminary matter, I note that the principal claimant acted as designated the representative of the minor claimant after establishing that she was the child's mother and would act in her best interests.\nI note as a further preliminary matter, that the principal claimant and the minor claimant arrived in Canada and claimed Convention refugee status prior to the male claimant. Their Personal Information Forms1 (PIF) identified him as husband and father, respectively and indicated that his whereabouts were unknown. The three claims were joined after the male claimant made his claim.\nI note that neither of the two counsels (one representing the principal and minor claimants and the other the male claimant) objected to the joinder. I note as well, that, after the joinder, no separate file screening form for the male claimant had been prepared and that his counsel triggered his Notice to Appear by calling the Division to advise that he had received none. Counsels had not disclosed all the relevant documents concerning their clients to each other and appear not to have contacted each other in that regard. Nevertheless, with the cooperation of counsel and the assistance of the Refugee Protection Officer (RPO) in arranging the photocopying of numerous documents and counsels being allotted time to peruse them, the hearing was completed.\nFinally, I note that written observations from the RPO were received by the August 26, 2002 due date, with written reply by counsel for the principal and minor claimants being received on August 30, 2002, and a document requested from counsel for the male claimant was received August 23, 2002.\nAnalysis\nIn considering the claims of the principal and minor claimants, I have borne in mind the Chairperson's guidelines regarding female2 and minor claimants.3\nThe determinative issues in this matter are the identity of the claimants, including political identity for the male claimant and the subjective and objective bases for a well-founded fear of persecution for all three claimants.\nIdentity: Principal claimant and minor claimant\nBased on their valid passports, I accept that the principal claimant4 and minor claimant5 are who they say they are and are citizens of Zimbabwe. Based on the minor claimant's birth certificate,6 I accept that the principal claimant and minor claimant are mother and daughter.\nIn light of the principal claimant's passport indication that her occupation is civil servant and her University diploma in Education7 I am satisfied that she was as she stated, a teacher employed by the Zimbabwean Ministry of Education.\nIdentity, male claimant\nDocuments corroborative of the male claimant's identity,8 including his Certificate of Birth,9 school documents,10 his university diploma11 and his photo ID national identity card,12 Zimbabwe National Registration13 are before me. Based on them, and a balance of possibilities, I accept that he is who he says he is and is a citizen of Zimbabwe. I accept based on the principal claimant's credible testimony that she and the male claimant were married in a XXXXX 1998 traditional ceremony. I also accept, based on the minor claimant's birth certificate14 and the observable familial similarity, that he and the minor claimant are father and daughter. Further documentary corroboration of the male claimant's identity is a letter tendered post-hearing confirming his employment.15\nThe male claimant tendered no documentary evidence of his MDC activism. He was knowledgeable about MDC and its activities in his stated constituency. However, without the principal claimant's corroborative evidence in this regard, certain credibility concerns canvassed below might have led me to question whether his knowledge came from direct experience. For the reasons below, I am satisfied that the male claimant was an active opponent of the government of Zimbabwe, based on the principal claimant's PIF mention of his political persecution.\nI accept that, when the principal claimant signed the PIF in October 2001, she had no expectation of seeing the male claimant again, having had no word of him for over a year and a half. She makes no allegation that either she or her daughter risk persecution because of his political activities. Rather, she bases her claim on gender, including being forced into a levirate marriage because of her then husband's lengthy disappearance. I read her mention of the male claimant's political problems as incidental, included solely as a possible explanation for his disappearance. Given the circumstances of their claims, I see no other benefit of such mention to her or her daughter. I accept, based on her PIF narrative, and a balance of probabilities that the male claimant was an active government opponent. As well, I accept that he was an MDC activist, based on the principal claimant's credible oral evidence.\nCredibility, principal claimant\nIn my view, the principal claimant was a credible witness. Her oral and written stories were, on balance, mutually consistent.\nI accept that she remains very angry with the male claimant, missing for 1 1\/2 years, for not somehow contacting her in Zimbabwe to let her know he was still alive and that she blames his failure to do so for the persecution that befell her. I accept too, that she knew nothing of his arrival in Canada until a mutual acquaintance advised her of it; that they have always lived separately here and that she has no intention of reuniting with him.\nThe principal claimant did hesitate when asked whether her fear of persecution might be removed if she and the male claimant together presented themselves to their parents. In my view, her hesitation was not evasion but rather resulted from her deliberating about the appropriate response, since she had already put aside all consideration of reconciliation or reuniting with him. I found her manner of testimony to be generally straightforward, particularly in light of the claims being heard together.\nI accept as reasonable her explanation that she went to South Africa in search of her missing husband after being told that he was there and, failing to find him after two months, returned to Zimbabwe, the problems with his family having not yet surfaced. Her evidence in this regard was detailed and, to my mind spontaneous. I believe her. In my view, her return did not constitute reavailment.\nThe principal claimant was able to offer a satisfactory explanation for the significant discrepancy with the Port of Entry notes.16 Her forced marriage, her fear of her own and of her husband's family, including his abusive brother, now her husband, are omitted in the story recorded by the Immigration Officer. The principal claimant's explanation for the omission was that, although she had attempted to communicate her whole story, the Immigration Officer advised that it was too long and that the claimant could fill out the details for her claim after seeing a lawyer. I find her explanation reasonable for the following reasons. The Immigration Officer has noted as the first item in the claimant's account the claimant's separation from her husband and the difficulty of raising a child alone. I find this to accord with her oral evidence of ostracization as a means of forcing levirate marriage. I do not doubt that the account the principal claimant gave the Immigration Officer was long and complicated or that the story might have been confused given the claimant's exhaustion after traveling for hours with a 3-year old. I note that the Immigration Officer has attempted to assist by posing questions to the claimant. However, I note as well, that all of the questions regarding Zimbabwe relate to the claimant's relationship with her husband. I am satisfied that these key omissions are the result of the context of the interview rather than an attempt to mislead on the part of the claimant or inaccuracy on the part of the Immigration Officer.\nI find credible the principal claimant's testimony that, with her husband's disappearance, her attempts (noted earlier) to find him and with no word of him for 11\/2 years, he was presumed dead by her and his parents. Her evidence regarding her forced marriage to the claimant's brother was detailed and, to my mind, credible. Furthermore, her evidence regarding the customary practice of levitate marriage in Zimbabwe is consistent with the documentary evidence.17 It shows18 that, despite legal prohibitions, women are still vulnerable to entrenched customary practices, including the forcing of a widow to marry her late husband's brother.\nMoreover, I am satisfied that the threat of ostracization by both families if she refused the levirate marriage was effective because of the economic consequences for her and her daughter. The documentary evidence19 reports that women married under customary law are not allowed to own property jointly with their husbands. Although the claimant was employed as a teacher, I accept that this posed insufficient security for her as the mother of a young child. The documentary evidence shows escalating violence against teachers by government agents20 and increasingly widespread economic chaos. I find the claimant's testimony credible in this regard.\nAs well, the documentary evidence21 is supportive of her allegation that she was unable to gain protection from her new husband's brutality. Spousal abuse is reported as endemic in Zimbabwe with society generally accepting of it and police not responding to women's requests for assistance.22\nIn light of all of the above, I find the principal claimant to be a credible and trustworthy witness. I believe her account.\nCredibility, male claimant\nNumerous credibility and plausibility concerns remain in my mind about the male claimant's evidence. For example, I find not plausible his testimony that, because he did not want to jeopardize her safety, he failed to get word to his wife of his welfare. He spent his lengthy time in hiding on the outskirts of Bulawayo, the city where she lived. He was in contact with MDC members who were apparently sufficiently competent in underground work to hide him and then to get him out of the country. I do not know why he did not send some sort of message to her, but I find not credible the reason he gave.\nNor am I satisfied that his emergence in Canada only weeks after his wife and daughter arrived in this country was entirely coincidental. To my mind, his testimony that he did not know they were in Canada before he came to this country strains credulity.\nHowever, there was one aspect of his testimony about which I have no doubt, namely that his wife will not forgive him and will not reconcile with him. His evidence in that regard was blurted out and his repeated supplications that it should be possible to put the past behind them lent credence to his testimony about their relationship, in my opinion.\nRegardless of my outstanding concerns about the trustworthiness of the male claimant's testimony, I have accepted that he is who he says he is; that he was an MDC member and an anti-government activist.\nObjective basis for a well-founded fear of persecution, principal claimant\nIn my opinion, the principal claimant has established an objectively well-founded fear of persecution on a Convention ground. As noted earlier, the documentary evidence is supportive of her allegation that forced levirate marriage is a customary practice in Zimbabwe and that state protection is unavailable to her either from her parents, her in-laws or from her abusive second husband.\nI have accepted that she will not reconcile with the male claimant, who because of his failure to contact her, she holds responsible for her past persecution. However, even in that unlikely event, no evidence is before me that the stipulated agents of persecution would change their minds about the legitimacy of her levirate marriage.\nGiven all of the foregoing, I find her fear of persecution in Zimbabwe to be objectively well-founded.\nObjective basis for a well-founded fear of persecution, male claimant\nFor the following reasons, I find the male claimant has established an objectively well-founded fear of persecution based on his political opinion. The documentary evidence23 reports state-sanctioned attacks by government supporters such as war veterans and members of the ruling ZANU PF party against political opponents and perceived opponents, with army and police lending assistance to those conducting such violence and knowingly permitting such activities. The documentary evidence shows numerous instances of such attacks particularly on members of the opposition MDC, including beatings and torture24 and violent beatings resulting in death.25 I have accepted that the male claimant is an MDC activist. In my view, his fear of persecution by reason of his political opinion is objectively well-founded.\nObjective basis for a well-founded fear of persecution, minor claimant\nI find the minor claimant has established that her fear of persecution as the minor female child of her parents is well-founded on an objective basis. I accept the principal claimant's evidence that the minor claimant was at risk of emotional harm because of the brutality of the step-father with whom she and the principal claimant were forced to live lest they be ostracized from both families. The documentary evidence reports the deprivation suffered by women in such circumstances26 and the dire consequences suffered by children who are without economic support.27 Moreover, as the daughter of a government opponent and a member of MDC, the documentary evidence28 shows that the minor claimant is at risk of persecution at the hands of government agents.\nIn my opinion, each of the claimants has an objectively well-founded fear of persecution on a Convention ground. I conclude that there is more than a mere possibility of persecution were any of the claimants to return to Zimbabwe.\nAccordingly, the Refugee Protection Division determines XXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXXXX to be Convention refugees.\n\"S.E.

The male claimant alleged a fear of persecution by reason of his political opinion. After the male claimant, facing persecution for his political beliefs, disappeared, the female claimant was forced into a levirate marriage with his brother against her will. Her new husband mistreated her and threatened to kill her. The male claimant was a member of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change and was employed by a non-governmental organization doing community-related work. He went into hiding after five MDC members were killed. The evidence of the female claimant regarding the practice of levirate marriage was consistent with the documentary evidence, which shows that, despite legal prohibitions, women are still vulnerable to entrenched customary practices, including the forcing of a widow to marry her late husband's brother. Spousal abuse is endemic in Zimbabwe and the police do not respond to requests for assistance. As for the male claimant, the documentary evidence contains numerous instances of violent and sometimes fatal attacks on MDC members. Both claimants had a well-founded fear of persecution.

They are both citizens of Argentina, and claiming the need for protection as they have a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of being threatened by the female claimant's father. I have taken the Gender Guidelines1 into consideration before rendering a decision in this claim.\nThe female claimant stated that her father mistreated her when she was growing up. She ran away when she was 17-years-old and lived with her mother, who had left her father when the claimant was a small child. The claimant testified that her father tried to have her returned to his care, however, the courts granted her mother custody in XXXX 1997 and her father received order to say away. The judge in her case also recommended psychological treatments. The claimant declared that her father did not obey the court order and continued to threaten her and her mother. They moved a few times but the father would trace them by threatening other relatives. The male claimant testified that the female claimant's father threatened and attacked him after they lived together. He stated that they moved out of Buenos Aires shortly before coming to Canada to live with one of his relatives, however, the female claimant's father found them. The claimants stated that they waited until the female claimant was 21-years-old, and could obtain a passport without the consent of her father, in order to join her mother who had left for Canada earlier and had claimed for refugee status together with many other relatives. The claims were rejected. The claimants stated that her father was protected by the police, because he was their friend, and therefore, state protection was not available for them.\nAnalysis:\nIdentity:\nThe certified true copies of both claimants passports are on file,2 therefore, I accepted their identities.\nCredibility:\nI find that the credibility of the two joined claims was tainted because of the failure to present relevant documents and significant omissions in the testimony. In addition, the claimants did not establish clear and convincing evidence that state protection would not be forthcoming. I have taken the following into account; that the claimants are young; their education background as stated in their Personal Information Form (PIF) (even though they chose not to submit any education documents in support of this statement); communication is through an interpreter; and cultural differences.\nDocumentation:\nThe claimants were asked why they did not produce documents, such as their national identity cards, education documents or the court order, which allegedly was issued in reference to the female claimant in 1997. The claimants indicated that they did not see any necessity for producing any documents from Argentina, as such documents would not be of value in Canada and they had their passports to establish their identity. They insisted that no documents they possessed would be relevant to their claims. Regarding the court documents, the female claimant stated that she tried to obtain them without success. She dismissed the question with a very brief reply and did not offer any further information about her efforts to obtain documents, which allegedly put her under protective court custody in 1997. Claimants cannot always be expected to produce corroborating documentation in support of their claims, however, here the claimants did not provide the basic information such as where they lived in Argentina, or their education background. They did not offer further explanation why they could not produce their identity cards or similar documents, even though both have many relatives living in Argentina. In addition, the female claimant's mother, together with her uncle and other relatives claimed for refugee status before the claimants, which is an indication that the claimants were aware of the onus they had to fulfil. I find that the claimants only produced their passports because their claim is not based on the truth.\nOmissions:\nBoth claimants omitted from their PIF narratives that they moved to the province before coming to Canada because they feared the female claimant's father who traced them and threatened the family they lived with. The male claimant omitted from his PIF narrative that her father with two other men attacked him and broke his nose; that he was attacked and stabbed with a screwdriver on another occasion; and that he was threatened with a gun at his sister's home. He also omitted to state in his PIF narrative that he required medical treatment for his broken nose. They explained that they were advised at a centre for Spanish speaking person to keep their PIF narrative short, as they will have an opportunity to explain their situation at the hearing. As the claimants did provide details, such as the male claimant's dog that was outside the house and started barking loudly,3 I find their explanation not persuasive and trustworthy. Why mention that a dog is barking, but omitting that one is stabbed with a screwdriver. If brevity was recommended by the centre, then why mention that the female claimant lived jwith different aunts with Buenos Aires,4 but not point out that both claimants had to move to the province. I find that the omissions indicate that the claimants tried to embellish their claims during the oral testimony.\nState Protection:\nIn M.C.I. v. Kadenko, the Federal Court of Appeal held that,\nWhen the state in question is a democratic state ... the claimant must do more than simply who that he or she went to see some members of the police force and that his or her efforts were unsuccessful. The burden of proof that rests on the claimant is, in a way, directly proportional to the level of democracy in the state in question: the more democratic the state's institutions, the more the claimant must have done to exhaust all the courses of action open to him or her.5\nI find that it is not sufficient in the context of Argentina to show that state protection is not available, because members in one police station refused to help. There must be more. Argentina is a federal constitutional democracy with an executive branch headed by an elected president, a bicameral legislature, and a separate judiciary. In 1999, voters elected President Fernando de la Rua in generally free and fair elections. After major protests in December he resigned and was succeeded briefly by three interim president before the Legislative Assembly elected Eduardo Duhalde to serve out the remainder of the de la Rua term.6\nI recognize that the human rights record of the police in Argentina is not perfect;7 however, documentary evidence shows that the Government of Argentina has undertaken serious measures to combat inter alia, graft, corruption and professional misconduct within the police forces, with considerable success.8 I find that the claimants did not take steps reasonable in the circumstances to seek a solution to their alleged problems in Buenos Aires, before seeking international protection in Canada. Complaints about assaults, physical or psychological mistreatments by any member of a family can be registered before a judge competent in family affairs with a request that preventive measures be taken under the federal government promulgated law No. 24.417.9 The law is not perfect as there are no apparent sanctions for those who fail to comply with the terms of the court order.10 However, there are victims assistance centres established by the Province of Buenos Aires which deliver programs and services,11 which can be approached for help. The claimants declared only the station close to their father's residence can provide help, however, a judge placed the female claimant under protective custody and issued a restraining order against her father in 1997. I find that the claimants offered evasive and partly incoherent explanations why they did not register a complaint at a court or accessed any other help. I find that there is adequate state protection available for persons who find themselves in the claimants alleged scenario. Their testimony of unavailability of protection reinforces that their claims are not built on the truth.\nI recognize that none of the credibility concerns raised herein are sufficient on its own to negate the claim. However, in my opinion, the cumulative effect of all of them is such that I do not have sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence upon which to base a determination that the claimants are Convention refugees12 or persons in need of protection.\nTherefore, the Refugee Protection Division rejects the claims of XXXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXXX for refugee protection.\n\"Elke Homsi\"\nElke Homsi\nDATED at Toronto this 10th day of October 2002.\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - WOMEN REFUGEES - GENDER - PARTCICULAR SOCIAL GROUP - GENDER-RELATED PERSECUTION - DOMESTIC VIOLENCE - EVIDENCE - CREDIBILTIY - DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE - DOCUMENTATION - OMISSIONS - STATE PROTECTION - FEMALE - MALE - NEGATIVE - ARGENTINA\n1 Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution: Guidelines Issued by the Chairperson Pursuant to Section 65(3) of the Immigration Act, IRB, Ottawa, March 9, 1993, Update: November 1996, as continued in effect by the Chairperson on June 28, 2002 under the authority found in section 159(1)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n2 Exhibit M-1, Photocopies of passports.\n3 Exhibit C-1, PIF, question 37, paragraph 13.\n4 Ibid., paragraph 9.\n5 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v.

She claims to have a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of her deceased husband's son and of her own family members by reason of her membership in a particular social group, namely women subject to forced levirate marriage.\nSummary of Personal Information Form allegations\nThe claimant alleges that the death of her father in 1985 resulted in her XXXXX 2000 forced marriage in a traditional ceremony to XXXXX, a much older man, to whom her father had promised her in compensation for a loan. In XXXX 2001, her husband died and his son, XXXX, an influential man, insisted that the claimant marry him since the loan was not re-paid.\nMr. XXXXX insistence that she undergo circumcision, his physical mistreatment of her and threat of death if she did not comply with his wishes and her realization that he had the support of her family led her to flee into hiding in XXXX City. There she found assistance at a church whose pastor reported her difficulties to police. They, however, refused to intervene on the basis that her problems were domestic and cultural matters. The claimant remained in hiding until arrangements were completed for her to leave Nigeria.\nDetermination\nI find the claimant to be a Convention refugee because she has a well-founded fear of persecution in Nigeria on a Convention ground.\nAnalysis\nThe issues in this matter which were identified at the outset of the hearing are credibility, personal identity and the objective basis for a well-founded fear of persecution, including state protection and internal flight alternative. In considering this claim, I have borne in mind the Chairperson's guidelines on female refugee claimants.1\nCredibility\nIn my opinion, the claimant was a credible witness. While she was very reserved in answering questions, often giving monosyllabic or short responses, even to questions posed by her own counsel, I find that her manner of testimony may reasonably be explained by an observable natural reticence rather than an attempt to evade or dissemble.\nThe claimant was able to explain to my satisfaction her possession of certain identity documents that raised both credibility and identity concerns. Documentary evidence2 shows that documents found on the claimant at the port of entry included a Canadian Certificate of Landing, a Canadian social assistance card and a TD Access bankcard.3 The three documents are all in the name of XXXXXXXXXXXXXX.4 I accept, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant's explanation that these documents were furnished by the contact person in Canada of the agent who accompanied her to Canada and upon whose advice she depended in matters relating to her departure from Nigeria, travel to and arrival in this country. I accept that she has no other knowledge of their origin. The claimant carried her own birth certificate5 and identified herself to the examining immigration officer in her own name.6 I accept that the false documents were provided by the agent's Canadian contact and that their sole utilization on the claimant's behalf was as travel documents.\nAt the port of entry, the claimant was in possession of education documents7 and a birth certificate8 in the name of XXXXXXX. As is indicated below, she provided post-hearing documentary evidence9 of her own graduation from the same university as her brother. I find reasonable her explanation that, in her rush to leave, she inadvertently grabbed the education documents of her twin brother instead of her own.\nI find the claimant's evidence regarding treatment by her family and by Mr. XXXXXX to force her levirate marriage to him to be internally consistent. In my view, her evidence is consistent as well with her signed, written statement to the interviewing immigration officer.10 I believe her story that members of her own family and her deceased husband's son were intent on forcing her to submit to a levirate marriage to him, following Edo cultural norms in Ewu, Edo State.\nIdentity\nThe identity documents tendered by the claimant at the hearing had certain apparent deficiencies. Her student photo identity card11 was unsigned by the registrar. The date given in the university letter of her graduation12 differs from that given in her Personal Information Form (PIF) as does the name of the university.13 For that reason, the hearing was reserved pending the receipt of further documents that were received post-hearing.14\nI find the claimant to be who she says she is. I am satisfied that the claimant is a citizen of Nigeria and an indigene of Edo state, based on a balance of probabilities, having considered her testimony and the documentary support of her certificate of national origin.15 Furthermore, I am satisfied, for the same reasons, that the claimant's tribal affiliation is Edo from the Ewu area16 of that state.\nI accept that XXXXXX University, where the claimant began her university studies in 1998, was re-named XXXXXXXX University and that she graduated from that institution in 2001, based on the letter received post-hearing from the university.17\nObjective basis for a well-founded fear of persecution\nFor the following reasons, I find the claimant's fear of persecution to be objectively well-founded.\nShe described to me scars she bears as a result of Mr. XXXXXXX beatings. Her testimony in that regard is supported by a doctor's letter18 in which he confirms that the scars he observed are consistent with her story of having been beaten.\nThe documentary evidence is in my view supportive of her evidence of levirate marriage in Nigeria. It shows that marriage in Nigeria is governed by customary law, by Islamic law and statutory law.19 I have accepted that levirate marriage is a traditional Edo practice in the home area of her family and of Mr. XXXXXX, namely Ewu in Edo State. There is no evidence before me of laws proscribing forced or levirate marriage in Edo State. The documentary evidence20 quotes a representative of the Widow's Development Organization who states that she cannot provide information specific to Edo widows as her work is focused in Enugu State. However, she offered the general comment that there are no federal or state laws prohibiting leviration in cultures where forced marriage is practiced. The documentary evidence reports that police and government authorities do not get involved when a woman refuses since they treat it as a family matter.21 I find the documentary evidence22 to be supportive of her claim that even when the assisting church pastor reported the claimant's situation to police in XXXXX City, Edo State, police cited family matters as the reason for refusing assistance to her. I accept that state protection is not available to her in XXXXX City.\nLagos was canvassed as a possible internal flight alternative. While the city's sheer size might make it difficult for the claimant's family or Mr. XXXXXX to find her, the claimant's testimony, which I have found credible, was that she has no friends there to whom she might turn for emotional or financial support. The church, whose members afforded her brief protection in XXXXXXX City and arranged for her departure to Canada, has no branch in Lagos. Moreover, although the claimant has a university degree, she has no work experience. Given the above, internal flight to Lagos is not, in my opinion, a reasonable option open to the claimant.\nIn light of the evidence before me, I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has established an objectively well-founded fear of persecution. I conclude that there is a serious possibility of persecution were she to return to Nigeria.\nI find XXXXXXXXXXXXXX to be a Convention refugee because she has a well-founded fear of persecution on a Convention ground.\n\"S.E.

At the onset of the hearing on August 13, 2002, the panel asked and was duly informed that the minor claimant intended to proceed without counsel. Therefore, the panel explained the Convention definition and the new consolidated grounds and the hearing process in detail. The designated representative decided the minor claimant to give testimony under oath. He also testified.\nIdentity\nAt the onset of the hearing, the panel accepted that, on a balance of probabilities, the minor claimant was who she claimed to be and a citizen of Romania based on the copy of her passport1 stamped \"certified true copy\" by Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC). There was no evidence before the panel that the passport was fraudulent or obtained fraudulently. Possession of a national passport creates a prima facie presumption that the holder is a national of the country of issue, unless the passport itself states otherwise,2 which it did not in this case.\nAllegations\nThe minor claimant testified that she feared her father if she were to return to Romania.\nThe panel finds that a major portion of her evidence was internally and externally inconsistent. She failed to provide reasonable explanations for most of these inconsistencies, creating further inconsistencies. The panel finds that her testimony was exaggerated to boost her claim. Therefore, minimum weight was assigned to her testimony.\nThe minor claimant alleged that her father, an alcoholic, routinely beat her as well as her mother and her other siblings. She missed school several days per week. Her father chased and threatened them with a knife, and locked them in the house on many occasions. She came to Canada to visit her grandmother.\nIn support of her allegation, the minor claimant provided a medical certificate.3 The panel assigns no probative value to this document. Firstly, to the naked eye, the date of issue appeared to be altered. The designated representative was unable to provide a reasonable explanation as to why this was done. He stated he was surprised and had not realised it.\nSecondly, the minor claimant was unable to provide a reasonable explanation regarding the omission from her narrative of the incident mentioned in the medical certificate. Although she explained that she had mentioned it in the Romanian version4 of her narrative, the Romanian version, which was reviewed at the hearing by the interpreter, did not mention it and the visit to the doctor.\nFurthermore, the panel gives no probative value to the certificate from the Ministry of the Interior, dated XXXX, 2002. This is written on a ripped piece of paper with no letterhead. The panel finds that the content of the letter is not logical. It states that the minor claimant \"has filed several complaints with this police department against her parents, regarding domestic violence.\" It is not reasonable to expect the Romanian police to have registered several complaints by a minor in the absence of an adult. Additionally, it is not reasonable to accept the minor claimant to have filed a report against her mother when her testimony revealed that on many occasions she tried to protect her mother from her father's abuse.\nThe panel gives no probative value to the letter from Romania District of XXXXXX, dated XXXXX, 2002, written on a paper without a letterhead which is normally associated with official letters, and an address, after the minor claimant's arrival and sent by her mother. The content of the letter appears to be self-serving indicating that \"there are no placement centres or shelters for children and minors victims of domestic abuse, violence or mistreatment.\"5\nThe panel finds these documents to be self-serving, created for the purpose of the hearing.\nThe designated representative's demeanour during his testimony displayed a genuine concern about the minor claimant. He stated that he was aware that his brother abused his wife, however, he did not know and was surprised to hear after his niece came to Canada that his brother beat her as well. He called his sister-in-law and she confirmed the beatings.\nThe panel finds persuasive the designated representative's belief that his niece was a victim of domestic violence and child abuse. Accordingly, benefit of doubt is given to the designated representative's evidence whose statements were coherent and plausible. The panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the minor claimant was a victim of child abuse.\nAnalysis\nNotwithstanding whether the minor claimant's past experiences amount to persecution, as Pratte J., stated in Mileva:6\n... the question raised by a claim to refugee status is not whether the minor claimants had reason to fear persecution in the past, but rather whether he at the time his claim is being decided, has good grounds to fear persecution in the future.\nTo assess whether the minor claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution so as to satisfy the definition of Convention refugee, it is necessary to examine the subjective fear and its objective basis. Mr. Justice Heald, in Rajudeen states:7\nThis court, as well as the Supreme Court of Canada, has made references to the subjective and objective components necessary to satisfy the definition of Convention refugee. The subjective component relates to the existence of fear of persecution in the mind of the refugee. The objective component requires that the refugee's fear be evaluated objectively to determine if there is a valid basis for that fear.\nIn evaluating the forward-looking aspect of the minor claimant's subjective fear and the objective evidence, the minor claimant stated that if she were to return to Romania, she feared violence by her father.\nThe independent, international and NGO documentary sources8 indicates that Romania is a constitutional democracy with a multiparty. The Government generally respected the rights of its citizens; however, serious problems remained. Child labour was a problem and trafficking in women and girls for the purposes of forced prostitution was another problem.\nAdditionally, the documentary evidence9 indicates:\n...the Government administers health care and public education. There are no perceptible societal patterns of abuse against children. Nevertheless, large number of impoverished and apparently homeless, but not necessary orphaned, children can be seen on the street of the larger cities.\nIn line with the European Commission to establish a single authority that would be responsible for setting appropriate standards for all childcare institutions, the National Agency for the Protection of Children's Rights was established in July 2000. It is directly subordinated to the Prime Ministers and is responsible for the elaboration, co-ordination and monitoring of reform policies. The Agency is in charge of ensuring that agreed standards and levels of care for several childcare services have been established and agreed by the order of the President of the Agency.\nAccording to documentary evidence10 , in Romania domestic violence is on the increase and there is no organised state-run network for victims of domestic violence. Children are the most affected by domestic violence. A joint study by the world Health Organisation (WHO), UNICEF and the World Bank found that almost half of the 1,556 families surveyed beat their children and 38 percent humiliated or verbally abused them. According to the study, almost one in 10 Romanian children have been sexually abused and about half of the country's 5.1 million children suffer from severe neglect. According to Ioana Popescu, psychologist, many children are prevented from going to school and forced to work, take care of siblings or beg.\nAccording to the same documentary evidence, faced with the rise in domestic violence, local authorities are trying to cope with the situation. The newly appointed Minister of Justice, Rodica Stanoiu, the first woman in such a position, said,\n... domestic violence should be treated as a separate offence under the criminal code, now subject to changes under a reform package of the justice system. However, Romania has yet to align its legislation to Western standards in its bid to join the European Union.11\nHaving considered all the objective evidence, while the panel is mindful and does not minimise all the positive steps taken by the Romanian government to improve the situation of the children in Romania, it is not persuaded, that at the time of the hearing, the recent government's actions in this respect amount to \"serious efforts\" to protect the victims of domestic and child abuse.\nDECISION\nIn view of the foregoing, given that the definition is forward-looking, the panel finds that in the circumstances of this case, the age and the sex of the minor claimant, there is sufficient \"objective basis\" to support the minor claimant's \"subjective fear\" and there is more than a mere possibility12 that she would face persecution if she were to return to Romania.\nFor these reasons, the Refugee Protection Division determines that the minor claimant, XXXXXXXXXXXX, is a Convention refugee. The panel accepts her claim for refugee protection.\n\"F. Mortazavi\"\nF.

He is claiming the need for protection as he has a well-founded fear of persecution because of his perceived political opinion, which gives his claim a nexus to a Convention ground.\nCounsel's post-hearing submissions dated October 21, 2002 and October 29, 2002, have been taken into consideration before rendering a decision in this claim.\nThe claimant testified that he rented a room in his house to a Mr. XXXXXXX, a prominent member of the Radical Party, who used it for occasional political meetings. The claimant stated that, because of this arrangement, he was persecuted by supporters of the Peronist Party and had to flee his country.\nAnalysis:\nIdentity:\nThe copies of the claimant's identity documents are included in Exhibit M-1 and therefore I accepted his identity as a citizen of Argentina.\nCREDIBILITY\nCaselaw shows that a panel may reject testimony which is uncontradicted if that evidence does not accord with the probabilities affecting the case as a whole. In this respect, the British Columbia Court of Appeal stated in Faryna v. Chorny that.\nIn short, the real test of the truth of the story of a witness in such a case must be its harmony with the preponderance of the probabilities which a practical and informed person would readily recognize as reasonable in that place and in those conditions.1\nThe Federal Court of Appeal, also has pointed out in Orelien that.\n[O]ne cannot be satisfied that the evidence is credible or trustworthy, unless satisfied that it is probably so, not just possibly so.2\nI find that the above applies to this claim. Before making a credibility assessment in this case I have taken the following into account: the claimant's age (49-years-old); his educational background (he has 7 years of primary school education); communication through an interpreter; and cultural differences. However, for the following reasons, I find that the brevity of the Personal Information Form (PIF) narrative, combined with the lack of documentation, which could have been reasonably forthcoming, and signs of tailoring the evidence, taint the credibility of this claim. I find that the posthearing disclosure, dated October 29, 2002, of handwritten letters and typed notes, is an attempt to bolster this claim for protection.\nThe PIF Narrative:3\nCaselaw establishes that all relevant details should be provided in the written Personal Information Form4 (PIF) narrative which was not done here. The gist of the claimant's explanation indicated that he wanted to provide further details in his oral testimony and then added significant evidence such as the events of August and November 2001. As the claimant was given an opportunity to amend his PIF at the beginning of the hearing before swearing to its accuracy, I find the oral additions not persuasive or trustworthy. The claimant was represented by experienced and competent counsel, and he should have let counsel know well in advance of the hearing that amendments or even additions to his PIF were necessary, which I gladly would have accepted, but nothing was forthcoming.\nDocumentation:\nI took into account rule 7 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules and the Commentary to that rule, when coming to the following findings. The claimant bases his fear of persecution on a relationship with a Mr. XXXXXXXX. After perusing the documentary evidence submitted in this claim, I find that there is insufficient evidence before me to conclude that a Mr. XXXXX exists. The claimant submitted a handwritten note from a XXXXXXXX, which was included within a letter from his family, in support of the existence of such a person. I find that this note cannot be used as an indication that this claim is built on the truth. The note and the accompanying correspondence could be written by anybody, including the claimant. It is also noted that the name of Mr. XXXXX is spelled differently in the signature of the note and in the narrative. As the claimant stated that Mr. XXXXX was a prominent and well known elected government official who was in charge of XXXXX, either as the XXXXX or XXXX, I find there is no reason why the claimant would not have submitted either newspaper articles or party publications where Mr. XXXXXX name was mentioned. Mr. XXXX allegedly offered his support and friendship in the note, dated June 14, 2002.5 As support and friendship was available, why not have his family members approach him and ask for a statement on either party or government letterhead, which could have been verified by the Research Directorate of the Immigration and Refugee Board (DIRB). However, nothing was forthcoming, even though the claimant used the additional time after the hearing to submit documentation, including handwritten letters from his family and typed cryptic threats, which are undated and unsigned. I find this late disclosure not persuasive or trustworthy, as stated earlier in this reason, they could have been written by anybody. The letters were supposedly written long before the hearing (the handwritten letters are dated February 26, March 28, May 20 and June 14, 2002).6 The claimant provided insufficient testimony at the hearing of the existence of these letters and the written threats. If this material was available before the hearing, why not state it, as he did regarding the existence of the deed for his house.\nThe Hospital Stay:\nThe claimant was asked about his hospital visits. Orally he first stated that he did not go to the hospital, only his wife went. Then, after it was brought to his attention that the port-of-entry notes contained his statement of four or five visits,7 he shifted his testimony and declared that he went together with his wife, but her injuries were more severe than his. Later on, in redirect, he repeated the port-of-entry statement of four or five visits. He explained that he did not understand the question. I find that the claimant's many versions of his replies indicate that he was not truthful, and not, that he did not understand the question.\nI recognize that none of the credibility concerns raised herein is sufficient on its own to negate the claim. However, in my opinion, the cumulative effect of all of them is such that I do not have sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence upon which to base a determination that the claimant is a Convention refugee8 or a person in need of protection.\nHaving considered the totality of the evidence, the relevant statutory provisions and jurisprudence, the Refugee Protection Division rejects the claim for protection. Therefore, XXXXXXXXXXXXXX, is determined not to be a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\n\"Elke Homsi\"\nElke Homsi\nDATED at Toronto this 5th day of November 2002.\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - CREDIBILITY - PERSONAL INFORMATION FORM - EVIDENCE - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION RULES - MALE - NEGATIVE - ARGENTINA\n1 Faryna v.

The principal claimant, XXXXXXXXXXXXX was appointed the designated representative for the two minor claimants, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. All of the claimants are citizens of Guyana. The claimant's base their claims for refugee protection on the grounds of risk to life because of increased criminality and violence in Guyana.\nThe evidence consisted of the oral testimony of the principal claimant and his spouse, their Personal Information Forms1 (PIFs), and documents submitted by the claimants,2 by Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC),3 and by the Refugee Protection Officer (RPO).4 Observations from the RPO were also considered. The claimants were not represented by counsel.\nThe issue before the RPD is whether, based on the evidence adduced at the hearing, the claimants are Convention refugees or persons in need of protection, as defined in sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IPRA). In order for the claimants to be determined Convention refugees or persons in need of protection, the evidence must establish that the claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution for a Convention ground or must establish that their removal to their country of nationality would subject them personally either (a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or (b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nA number of issues were identified at the beginning of the hearing. These included: 1) identity, 2) nexus, 3) delay, 4) re-availment, 5) agents of persecution, 6) state protection, 7) the consolidated grounds, and 8) credibility concerns arising from the claimants' evidence. While all the issues were canvassed, the panel finds that the determinative issue in these claims was state protection.\nFor the reasons provided below, the panel finds that the claimants did not discharge the burden of proof for establishing that they are Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.\nTESTIMONY AND ANALYSIS\nIdentity\nThe claimants presented their passports issued by the government of Guyana. There were no birth certificates for the children or marriage certificate for the parents. Nevertheless the panel accepts that they are who they claim to be and that they are citizens of Guyana.\nCredibility\nThere were no credibility concerns arising from any of the claimants' testimony. The oral testimony was consistent with the PIF. The questions were answered in a spontaneous manner. The panel noted the emotional distress expressed by the principal claimant as he recalled an incident in his youth when his father was attacked by Afro-Guyanese.\nNEXUS\nBased on the PIF narrative as well as the oral testimony of the principal claimant and his spouse, the panel finds that the claimants fear criminal activity in Guyana. The principal claimant recounted multiple experiences of random robberies and threats to his life because he is seen as a successful businessman. Additionally, there was continued harassment and threats directed at him and members of his family by a neighbour, XXXXXXXXX. The panel finds that the evidence failed to establish that there is a link between the basis for the claimants' fear and a Convention ground. Accordingly, the panel finds that there is not a nexus.\nRe-availment\nThe principal claimant made two trips alone to Canada on holidays in 2000 and 2001 respectively. He spent time in the Toronto\/Mississauga area. Then he returned to Guyana although he claimed that he had been experiencing problems since the early 1990s. The panel does not find it reasonable that some one who feared for his life and that of his family, would leave his family in Guyana while he came to Toronto to look around for two weeks on two occasions. The panel finds that the re-availment undermines the principal claimant's subjective fear of persecution in Guyana.\nDelay\nThe claimants arrived in Canada on December 23, 2001 but did not file a claim for protection until two months later, in February 2002. The explanation given for the delay was that the principal claimant did not know what to do and so relied on a friend to help him. When CIC was eventually contacted, the principal claimant was advised by mail that as of January 15, 2002, CIC no longer mailed out the forms to refugee claimants. Given that the claimant had been in Canada in August 2001 and had spent time in the Toronto area looking around, it is not reasonable to believe that if he were really fearing persecution that he could not have used some of the time to find out what steps he needed to take in order to obtain protection in Canada. By his own testimony, the principal claimant is someone who had taken initiative in Guyana to leave farming when he encountered problems and move to another place and start a business. He and his family had obtained multiple Canada Visitor Visas (CVV). According to the principal claimant, he closed his business in XXXXX 2001 and came with his family to Canada with the intention of staying. That being the case, the panel does not accept the claimant's explanation for the two-month delay in filing a claim as being reasonable for someone with a well-founded fear of persecution.\nAgents of persecution\/state protection\nThe principal claimant testified that he fears Afro-Guyanese who have stolen his farm produce, robbed his grocery store, held him up at gun-point and threatened him and his family with death. His family fears the harassment and threats levelled at them by their neighbour, XXXXXXXXX. The principal claimant stated that he went to the police about forty times to report various incidents and that the police responded on about ten of those times. He could not identify the persons who robbed the store, robbed him in person or held him up at gun-point. However, when he reported the problems with his neighbour, the police came and investigated. Following one of these investigations, XXXXXX was arrested and there was a court hearing. The Magistrate released XXXXX with a warning for him to desist from his threatening and harassing behaviour. Nevertheless, the behaviour continued and on a number of occasions when the claimant or his spouse called or went to get the police, XXXXXXXXX would hide or run away so that he could not be found when the police arrived.\nThe documentary evidence5 states the following:\nin Guyana there is a serious problem with violent crime which has been steadily increasing in both numbers and violence. The increase in violent crime is attributed mostly to illegal drugs and persons seeking to finance their consumption. Most of the victims are Indo-Guyanese. The disproportionate victimization of Indo-Guyanese is attributed to their proportionally greater affluence, since they are the major component of the business and trading \"class\" and many are relatively prosperous farmers.\nThe police response to violent crimes has been inadequate; rather than an ethnic or political motivation for this incapacity to cope it is widely perceived that the police force does not have the necessary manpower, training and salaries to ensure an effective action against the increasing crime.\nHowever, as per Villafranca,6\na guarantee of protection for all citizens at all times is not to be expected. Nor is protection perfect. Where a state is in effective control of its territory, has military, police and civil authority in place and makes serious efforts to protect its citizens, the mere fact that it is not always successful will not justify a claim that the state is not providing protection.\nOn a number of occasions, when the claimants were able to identify the individual who was harassing and threatening them, the police responded, investigated and arrested the individual in question. In other instances, the principal claimant was the victim of random robberies, attacks and threats and he could not identify the persons who perpetrated the crimes. Furthermore, sometimes he would be warned by the criminals not to report the crime to the police or else his family would suffer. In these instances, the principal claimant testified that he was scared and so did not report these particular incidents to the police. The principal claimant took other steps to obtain protection. He testified that he went to see a Mr. XXXXXXX, who was an Assistant XXXXXXXX at the Police Headquarters, in order to report his problems and seek greater protection. This was not forthcoming because Mr. XXXX told him that neither transportation nor police were available. Considering the claimants' actions and police response in the light of current social conditions in Guyana, the panel finds that state protection is available.\nConsolidated grounds\nThe panel finds that the claimants face a generalized risk arising from increased criminal activity in Guyana. That risk is one of random criminality which falls outside of a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual punishment by virtue of s.97 (1) (b) (ii), as it is one faced generally by others in that country. In the instance where it seems that the claimants have been personally targeted by their neighbour, state protection is available. Accordingly, the panel finds that the claimants do not face a reasonable chance or a serious possibility of a risk to their life or of a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nNo evidence was presented that would lead the panel to find that the claimants would be subjected personally to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of the Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture.\nDetermination\nThe minor claimants and older daughter relied on the testimony of their parents. Because the parents' claim failed, so do the claims of their children.\nFor all the above reasons, the Refugee Protection Division determines that XXXXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX are not Convention refugees nor are they persons in need of protection.\n\"Kamala-Jean Gopie\"\nKamala-Jean Gopie\nDATED at Toronto, this 11th day of December, 2002.\nKEYWORDS - GENERALIZED RISK - RISK TO LIFE AND RISK OF CRUEL AND UNUSUAL TREATMENT OR PUNISHMENT - NEGATIVE - MALE - FEMALE - GUYANA\n1 Exhibits C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5.\n2 Exhibit C-6.\n3 Exhibit M-1.\n4 Exhibit R-1.\n5 Exhibit R-1, item 3.6, GUY29864.E Guyana: Whether police refuse to pursue or follow-up on complaints of crime due to race or political affiliation of the complainant, 17 August 1999.\n6 M.E.I. v.

By Notice of Motion dated October 15, 2002 (the \"application\"), the claimant applied to have his claim re-opened. The grounds and facts upon which the application is based are set out in the application, an affidavit of the claimant dated October 15, 2002, and written submissions of counsel dated October 15, 2002. For the purpose of these reasons, I do not repeat the contents of all of that here. However, I have considered all of it and all of the rest of the evidence on the claimant's file before me.\nFor the following reasons, I am not persuaded that the claimant's claim should be reopened. The highest relevant legal authority before me, Longia1 suggests that all decisions of the CRDD (now the Refugee Protection Division (RPD)) are final. The power to reopen a claim hinges solely on whether a claimant has been denied natural justice.2\nFor the following reasons, I am not persuaded that the claimant has been denied natural justice in the abandonment proceedings under review. The claimant admits that he received prior personal notice of the abandonment (\"show cause\") hearing scheduled for June 24, 2002. Furthermore, that notice specifically warned the claimant as follows:\nYou failed to provide the Immigration and Refugee Board with your completed Personal Information Form within 28 days after the date on which you were served with the Personal Information Form.\n. . . a hearing into your failure to provide your completed Personal Information Form within the period provided for the filing of your PIF will take place on June 24, 2002 . . .\nIf you fail to appear at that time and place to explain why your claim should not be declared abandoned, the Refugee Division may declare your claim to have been abandoned.\nIt is true that the claimant did file the Personal Information Form (PIF) by the time of the show cause hearing, doing so five days before, on June 19, 2002. However, this was over two months after the PIF was due, a lengthy delay that would certainly call for explanation, even more so given the fact that the narrative turned out to consist of less than 100 words. Moreover, the claimant had been clearly notified that the issue at the show cause hearing was going to be the reason as to why the PIF was late and that the claimant himself had a personal obligation to appear to provide the explanation. The claimant's language is English and he does not require an interpreter. Thus it cannot be said that the claimant was without any fault in choosing not to attend the proceedings.\nThe claimant as much as admits this in his application material, but blames his failure to attend on bad advice he received from his previous counsel. However, as claimants are responsible for proving their claims and retaining counsel of choice to that end, claimants bear all loss caused by counsel error, except when counsel's negligence is so gross and obvious that it has shaded over a very high threshold into that rarely seen black territory known as incompetent counsel denial of natural justice. Clearly, that is not this situation: counsel incompetence is neither explicitly alleged nor clearly proven by the claimant in the application,3 and there is nothing before me to suggest that the claimant has sued previous counsel, or intends to. Finally, if the RPD were to accept these excuses in these circumstances, it would lose control of its own process. Claimants must never be led to believe their counsel may excuse them from their obligation to attend hearing dates.\nAny allegation that the claimant may have a well-founded claim is irrelevant to this motion. The issue here is not whether the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution. The issue is whether the claimant has been denied natural justice. For all of the previously stated reasons, I am not persuaded that this claimant has been.\nFor all these reasons, the claimant's application to reopen his claim is dismissed.\n\"Joel A.

They claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of membership in a particular social group. In addition, they claim to be persons in need of protection as persons in danger of being tortured or at risk of losing their lives or being subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Costa Rica.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimants allege the following.\nOne evening, around 7 o'clock, XXXXXX heard a knock on the door. She opened the door slightly to find a \"normal looking man\" standing outside. He wanted some information on properties for sale in the area. Since the development was a new one and since the main office had closed, XXXXXX was willing to give the information. She opened the door. No sooner had she done this than the man rushed in. He produced a gun and told her to go to the washroom. Once there, he pushed her inside. Then he robbed the house, along with an accomplice.\nFollowing the robbery, XXXXXX went to the OIJ (Organismo de Invetigacion Judicial), a special investigation unit, to file a report along with her husband XXXXX. They gave the police the serial numbers of some of the electronic alliances that had been stolen. XXXXXX also identified her attacker from the scores of photographs she was shown.\nA year passed. Then a letter arrived for the claimants to show up at the Penal Court. There they were informed that the police had been unable to find the thieves. They were asked if they would agree to close the case. They agreed to do so. However, a few days later they were informed that the Penal Court judge had decided that since a weapon was involved in the robbery, the case would not be closed.\nAround November 2001, XXXXXX began receiving threatening calls at work. The caller asked that the robbery charge be withdrawn, otherwise the claimant would be killed. XXXXXX received six or seven calls in the next few months. XXXXX received three or four calls during the same period. He was urged to get his wife to withdraw her complaint to the police.\nOne day in December 2001, as the two claimants were walking down a street, a car sped down the street towards them. They were able to jump out of the car's path but barely.\nIn January 2002, three men wearing masks came up to XXXXXX as she was opening the front door. They forced her inside the house. One of the men whom she recognized to be her original assailant in spite of his mask told her to withdraw the robbery charges. She told him she had tried to, but the police had not co-operated. He began molesting her. She does not know what this might have led to but for the chance return of her next-door neighbors. She began screaming and the three men ran away.\nThe two claimants then moved to XXXXXX mothers home where they stayed for a few weeks before leaving for Canada.\nANALYSIS\nCounsel made it very clear that they were not seeking recognition as Convention refugees.1 They were, however, asking to be accepted as persons in need of protection. This is what the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act states about persons in need of protection:2\n97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally\n(a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or\n(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that country.\n(ii) The risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) The risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) The risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care.\nThe provision with respect to torture, as laid out in Section 97 (1) (a) does not apply. No state agent is involved directly or indirectly in the alleged harm, as required by Article 1 of the Convention against Torture.3\nWith respect to Section 97 (1)(b) I agree with counsel that the claimants' fear is not of criminals in general but of one criminal in particular. I do not, however, agree with her contention that state protection was not available to the claimants.\nFollowing Ward,4 a presumption of adequate state protection exists in every claim unless there is \"clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.\" In my view, the claimants have not presented such evidence. The evidence I have before me states rather that \"the law and judiciary provide effective means of dealing with individual instances of abuse.\"5\nWith respect to a claimant's obligation to go to the state for protection, the Federal Court of Appeal has held in Kadenko6 that\nWhen the state in question is a democratic state...the claimant must do more than simply show that he or she went to see some members of the police force and that his or her efforts were unsuccessful. The burden of proof that rests on the claimant is, in a way, directly proportional to the level of democracy in the state in question: the more democratic the state's institutions, the more the claimant must have done to exhaust all the sources of action open to him or her.\nThe claimants fell far short of what was required of them in terms of seeking protection, considering that Costa Rica is a long-established democracy.7 The claimants went to the police once, when they were robbed. They did not go to police when more serious incidents occurred i.e. when the threatening calls were made or when the speeding car nearly killed them or when the female claimant was assaulted. It is simply not enough for them to say that everyone in Costa Rica knows that the police cannot do anything. If they went to the police for a robbery, they ought to have gone to the police for serious matters. Their neglect in doing so cannot be used to condemn the police.\nDETERMINATION\nAccordingly, I reject the claims of XXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX for refugee protection.\n\"Harindar Aulach\"\nHarindar Aulach\nDATED at Toronto this 6th day of November 2002.\nKEYWORDS - GENERALIZED RISK - RISK TO LIFE AND RISK OF CRUEL AND UNUSUAL TREATMENT OR PUNISHMENT - NEGATIVE - MALE - FEMALE - COSTA RICA\n1 I can understand her reasons for doing so as the anticipated harm cannot be linked to a Convention ground. Considerations of race, religion and nationality do not motivate the alleged tormentor. Neither is political opinion, actual or perceived, a causative factor. As for membership in a particular social group, the following reasoning applies, following the schemata laid out in Ward.1 Do they belong to a collectivity defined by an innate and unchangeable characteristic that invites persecution? They clearly does not. Alternatively, do they belong to a collectivity, targeted for persecution, that they cannot forsake for reasons of human dignity. Again, the answer has to be that he does not. Finally, do they belong to a collectivity that existed in the past whose membership has a historical permanence creating problems in the present. As with the other two dimensions of social group, the answer to this dimension, too, has to be in the negative.\n2 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27.\n3 Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, G.A. res. 39\/46 [annex, 39 U.N. GAOR (No. 51) at 197, U.N. Doc. A\/39\/51 (1984)].\nArticle 1(1) For the purposes of this Convention, the term \"torture\" means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions [emphasis added].\n4 Canada (Attorney General) v. Ward, [1990] 2 F.C. 667; 67 D.L.R.

He alleges he fears persecution because of his political opinion and his membership in a particular social group - the Hazara ethnic group.1\nThe Federal Court of Appeal states in the Maldonado2 decision that when a claimant swears to the truthfulness of his or her evidence, a presumption exists that that evidence is true unless there is a good reason to conclude otherwise.\nThe Federal Court of Appeal has given further direction to the CRDD (now RPD) in Rajaratnam3 in which its states:\nA refugee claimant is not, therefore, absolved of the duty of telling the truth. The tribunal hearing his evidence is entitled to disbelieve him and to base its decision on that assessment, but is required to give reasons for a finding of lack of credibility in 'clear and unmistakable terms.'\nIn the decision of Shahamati,4 the Federal Court of Appeal states:\nContrary to what has sometimes been said the Board is entitled, in assessing credibility, to rely on such criteria as rationality and common sense.\nThe claimant admitted during his hearing that he gave false evidence to the panel. There were documents filed by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration that were in conflict with his story. After close analysis of the testimony and documentation filed, it is my conclusion that there are serious reasons for doubting the claimant's credibility in material areas.\nThe claimant alleges in his Personal Information Form (PIF)5 that he was born in , Afghanistan on XXXXX 1970. He is well schooled, with 15 years of education, including what he describes as a \"B.Sc.\" He is unmarried. His mother, father three sisters and four brothers were all residents of XXXXX, but with the exception of one sister who lives in Iran, he alleges current whereabouts are unknown. He alleges he has worked as a XXXXX since leaving school.\nAccording to his PIF, from XXXX 1998 until XXXX 2000 he lived in Islamabad, Pakistan. However, he had no status in Pakistan during that period. He alleges he left Pakistan in XXXX 2000 and arrived in Canada two days later. He made a claim to refugee status immediately upon arrival in Canada. The identity documents he had when he fled Afghanistan were an international driver's licence6 and an Afghani identity card.7 Originals of the documents were provided to the panel.\nThe basis for his claim as alleged in his PIF is as follows. The claimant's father, a businessman, had always been active in the Hazara and Shia community. He also gave his financial support to the Islamic Unity Party, a party supported by the Hazara. Both the claimant and his father attended meetings for the party held in their mosque. The claimant's cousin and friend, XXXXXX, was also active in the Islamic Unity Party.\nSeveral Response to Information Requests filed at the hearing confirm that Hazara speak a type of Persian or Farsi, and are adherents of Shia branch of Islam. The documents also confirm that the Islamic Unity Party is a Hazara political organisation.\nAt his hearing the claimant added that he too donated money to the Islamic Unity Party but had not been as active as his father. When he was asked why he did not mention this information in his PIF, he stated he had written things down as well as he could remember. One of the exhibits includes the claimant's hand written statement in Farsi8 which when translated into English became the narrative statement in his PIF (question 37). Donations to the party are not mentioned in that statement.\nIn his PIF the claimant states that in XXXXX 1998, the Taliban attacked and beat the claimant in the XXXXX shop where he worked. He was beaten so badly it took him four days before he could return to work. When they beat him they told him that he should stop his activity in the Islamic Unity Party or he would be jailed or killed. A short time later the Taliban came to the claimant's home, demanding to see him. Since he was not home, they beat the claimant's father and took him away. The claimant's father has not been heard from since.\nWhen the claimant came home that particular evening, his mother told him \"...that Taliban took my father and they beat them up and forced her to reveal the whereabouts of her son.\"9 The claimant alleges he was shocked by the turn of events and immediately decided to flee to Pakistan. He did not stay in Kabul to look for his father or assist his family. There was no indication what impact his father's disappearance had on the rest of his family. The claimant alleged that his attempts to contact his family from Canada had been unsuccessful.\nIn his PIF he states that for his entire time in Pakistan he was in Islamabad.10 In his hearing he stated that he was moved first to Peshawar, where he stayed for 18 months, and then went to Islamabad. At his hearing he stated that the reference to two years in Islamabad was an error.\nAt his hearing the claimant confirmed that he worked for XXXXXX. He filed a letter from that firm to confirm his employment from August 1998 until February 2000.11 The letter contains some odd phrasing, in that it states he was employed as \"a product Incharge.\"\nAccording to his PIF, the claimant's cousin XXXXXX also fled to Pakistan where he continued to work against the Taliban. At his hearing, he stated that XXXXXX had left Afghanistan one month before he did.\nHe states in his PIF that in February 2000 he found out that XXXXXX was killed by the Taliban in Pakistan. The claimant decided the country was not safe for him and he eventually fled. He stated at the hearing that he went from Peshawar to Islamabad, where he made arrangements to leave Pakistan. He added that he paid a smuggler $10,000 to get him out of Pakistan. He did not care where he went. It was the agent's choice to send him to Canada.\nThe claimant alleged at the hearing that he was given a false passport to travel to Canada. He did not know the country of issue. He did not know what airline he used for his travels. He did not know what countries he passed through. He did not know if any of the people he saw at one transit stop were Chinese.\nHe did remember that before he left Pakistan the agent told him needed a large number of pictures. Two distinct photographs were taken. It was unclear at the hearing how many copies of the two pictures were produced, either 16 or 24. He did not know what the need was for so many pictures. He alleges he kept eight copies of one of the pictures for himself.\nThe claimant alleged that the smuggling agent went with him through the baggage check-in at the Islamabad airport. No one questioned the claimant or the agent. The claimant alleged that he had no idea which airplane to go on. He was simply told \"Just follow the people. Wherever they go, you go with them.\"12\nThe following exchange took place between the presiding member and the claimant.13\nQ. So you had no idea what plane you got on?\nA. No.\nQ. And you had no idea where it was going.\nA. No.\nThe claimant alleged that his only interest was to get out of Pakistan. When asked how he knew the plane was not simply going to another city in Pakistan, he replied that he did not know as he had never flown before.\nHe then alleged that he never looked inside the \"blue\" passport at any time during his travels to Canada. The claimant alleged he got of the airplane after a six and 1\/2 hour flight and entered an unidentified country. No one asked said anything to him beside \"welcome.\" He was then asked what he would have answered had someone asked him his name. He replied:14\nI don't know what I would have done. I mean the smuggling agent only gave me the passport at the time when I boarded the plane.\nWhen asked why he did not simply open the passport and read the name in it he replied that he had panicked.\nThe claimant then said the plane landed in Dubai. He alleged in his evidence that no one asked him any questions when he entered the country. By apparent coincidence or chance he ran into a number of associates of the smuggler. The first told the claimant to go to sleep, and not be concerned with where he was. When the claimant woke up, this person told him that he was in Dubai. Next the claimant went outside the airport and met up with another person who was an associate of the smuggler. This person took him to a room for the night. Next morning he boarded a plane without speaking to anyone, and flew to an unknown city, carried on to another city, changed planes, and travelled on to Canada.\nThe panel stated at the hearing that the claimant was an incredibly lucky person, and was able to do something almost no one else is able to do. He was able to travel half way around the world, never be asked a question and not know who he was or where he was from.\nAt this point in the hearing a short mid-hearing conference was held. After conferring with his counsel, the claimant continued to give his evidence. He told the panel that he had been lying about how he travelled from Pakistan to Canada. He alleged he did so on the instructions of the smuggling agent. The agent told him that if he told the truth about his travels the agent would be found out by the police. The agent allegedly told him not to 'rat out.' Nowhere in the evidence does it appear the agent threatened the claimant with harm.\nThe claimant alleged the true story was that he left Pakistan using a Moroccan passport with a tourist visa for Dubai. In Dubai, he met a representative of the smuggling agent who took the Moroccan passport and gave him a different passport. The agent told him the new passport had a 'genuine visa' and that no one was going to bother him. The replacement was, according to the claimant, a photo-substitute Afghani passport under the name XXXXXXXXXXXXXX.\nPrior to the hearing, the claimant was asked to consent to enquiries being made about him in the United Arab Emirates under three different names, including the name XXXX XXXXX XXXXXX. Counsel for the claimant advised the Board that the claimant would not consent to such a search under aliases. The letter from previous counsel states \"My client categorically denies that he used any of the names mentioned.\"15 This refusal to allow a search under the assumed name may have been an attempt on his part to follow his agent's directions. However, it may also have been an attempt to hide the claimant's activities in the UAE.\nThe claimant went on to state at his hearing that the agent told him to board a plane for Bahrain. He was told there would be a half hour stop-over after which the plane would go on to Hong Kong. When he arrived in Hong Kong he states he was questioned about his identity, but was allowed to continue on to Canada. He allegedly destroyed the Afghani passport on the plane on the instructions of the agent shortly before it arrived in Vancouver.\nDOCUMENTS\nTwo identity documents were presented by the claimant. One is an international driver's licence.16 According to the claimant it was issued in 1996 in Kabul by the Taliban regime after it took over the government earlier that year.\nHe was asked why he obtained the international driver's licence. He stated that because of the danger and the restrictions on travel for Hazara, he thought it might come in handy somewhere. He alleged that when he applied for it, he had to turn in his internal Afghani licence. The claimant also stated that in Afghanistan people use an internal driver's licence.\nWhen it was pointed out to the claimant that the English portions of the document are full of spelling errors, he replied that when the Taliban took over the government, they fired all the civil servants and would not accept anything from the past. He was asked why the licence makes no reference to the word 'Islam' in its title, he replied that the Taliban can do whatever they want because they are illiterate.\nThe claimant did not provide a plausible explanation for surrendering his domestic driver's licence if he continued on in Afghanistan from 1996 until 1998. It is of note that the document, allegedly issued by the Taliban government, states that it is issued by the \"Republic of Afghanistan.\" In my view, the document can be given little weight due to its highly suspect contents and the fact that it was allegedly issued by the Taliban but makes no reference to their Islamic republic.\nAnother document presented by the claimant is an identity booklet.17 The claimant stated he obtained it so that he would have ready proof of his age and carried it with him while he lived in Afghanistan. The issue date is 1985.\nIt is difficult to reconcile his use of this document with his earlier statement that pre-Taliban documents were not recognized. In any event, this document notes in a line entitled \"Nationality\" that he is a Hazara. The first page of Response to Information Request AFG27852.E18 sets out the various documents issued by the Afghanistan from April 1973 to 1992. The claimant's document complies with the sample for the 1978 to 1987 period. What is noticeable about the document is that is shows almost no signs of wear, despite it being approximately 17-years-old and a document the claimant says he regularly carried with him.\nAnother document filed by the claimant is a letter from the TAA Afghani Association XXXXXX XXXXXX dated 14 March 2001. It states that the claimant is indeed an Afghan national. This conclusion was reached after members of the organisation interviewed the claimant, among other things verifying his language and accent to be consistent with being an Afghani national. The authenticity of the associations letter of endorsement was verified with that organisation, as well as the methods by which it conducts its identification interviews.19 I accept the materials from the Afghani Association XXXXXXXXXX as having probative value. I find that the claimant is an Afghani national.\nAnother letter20 indicates that the claimant is a member of the XXXXXXXXXXX, and has attended prayer and religious meetings since September of 2000.\nThe Minister of Citizenship and Immigration participated in the hearing to the limited extent of filing documents. One package of documents consisted of materials prepared by an Immigration Examining Officer, Denise Kilpatrick.\nMs. Kilpatrick begins her Declaration by stating that she examined the claimant on 22 August 2000, the date he arrived in Canada. She goes on to state that through subsequent contact with overseas visa offices, new information came to light \"demonstrating that XXXXXX has multiple aliases and current immigration proceedings in process.\"\nThe information she received indicated that the claimant had been living in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) since 1997, not Pakistan, as he had told her. This was established, according to her, by his application for a Canadian visitor visa issued on XXXXX 2000 from the Canadian Embassy in the UAE. The Declaration contains a photocopy of his application and several photographs attached to it. Although one of the three photocopies of the photographs in the attachment to the Declaration is of poor quality, two are clearly pictures of the claimant. The application is under the name XXXXXXXXXX, the alias the claimant first categorically denied using and then later admitted to using for his travel from Du Bai in the UAE to Canada. The form states that he was born in XXXX on XXXXX1971. It also notes his passport number is XXXXX, and that he is the owner\/manager of a XXXXX factory. It states he had been in the UAE from March of 1997.\nThe records kept of his contact with the Canadian Embassy in Abu Dhabi are of note. The entry for \"SCC 20-Jun-2000\" is as follows:\nAfghani national. Businerss (sic) owner. 3yrs in UAE. Going to explore and assess Canadian market for future business.\nApplicant was refused a CVV from here last year (XXXXXX). Did not admit to this in application. Conflicting info as stated that he has been in UAE since 1997 while in previous application stated period as 7 yrs.\nQuestionable intentions. No credibility.\nDo not recommend approval.\nThe entry for \"XXXXXX 2000\" is as follows:\nHas applied for immig visa thru Damascus in XXXXX. Yet to be screened. To go to CDA Prob due to EN2 Appln for exploratory trip\/attend seminar. Seems to have good business. Wonder if alone in business or with parents\/siblings. Lack of admission to prev refusal in '99 and inconsistent info certainly raises concerns. Pending interview with JWM. Will have to be called as send info by courier. To NMA to advise. Then to ALF for Narvit 5 working day waiting period. [Emphasis added]\nThe entry for \"XXXXXXX-2000\" is as follows:\nSays 3 yrs in UAE. Claims said 7 yrs prev because he had included time in Iran. Says took XXXXX degree from '90-'94 in XXXXX Univ and then worked 2 years in trading company in Tehran. Says all of his family (parents and 8 siblings) reside in Afgan. Says is only owner of business here. Says average income from bus is 20 K AED per month. Claims going to CDA for 7-10 days to investigate possib. Of starting business. Subj speaks English fairly well. Says he was refused CVV last yr. Claims made mistake about quest re being refused CVV.\nHave decided to give BOD and issue CVV as seems to be legit businessman who is trying to immigrate by normal channels. Has decent savings. No adverse info recd from Narvit.\nThe notes from the CVV application go on to note that a visa was issued on XXXXX 2000.\nI understand these interview notes to indicate that 'JWM' met the person applying for the visa at the Canadian Embassy on XXXXX 2000. The claimant's pictures would have been on the file. There is no suggestion in the notes that the photographs were of a different person. Some of the other details of the claimant's background recorded by 'JWM' fit with what the claimant has said. There are eight siblings in the family. The claimant and the person in the application both have XXXXX degrees. However, the claimant says in his PIF that he got his degree in Kabul while the CVV applicant stated he got his degree in Tehran.\nA second document attached to Ms. Kilpatrick's Declaration is an application for permanent residence submitted to the Canadian Embassy in Damascus. The document was received by the Embassy on XXXXX 2000. It repeats some of the information in the Abu Dhabi CVV application. It was submitted under the name XXXXXXX. The claimant's picture appears in a partial copy of an Afghani passport included with the application. The passport21 indicates it was issued on XXXXXX 1997. It gives the claimant's date of birth as XXXX 1971. Two stamps in the passport indicate it was extended by the Embassy of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. The passport also contains a residency permit effective from XXXXX 1997 until XXXXX 2000.\nThe claimant was asked how a passport issued in 1997 could contain a photo that the claimant alleged was taken three years later. He said he had no idea - the smuggler did what he did.\nFinally, the Kilpatrick Declaration notes that personel from XXXXXXXXXX Airlines had notified her that \"XXXXXXXXX,\" born XXXXXX 1971, travelled from Hong Kong to Vancouver on XXX XXXX 2000. The individual had a passport with the number XXXX and a Canadian Visitor's visa, issued on XXXXX 2000.\nThe claimant again categorically denied making an application for a Canadian visitor's visa in the UAE or an application for permanent residence in Canada through the Canadian Embassy in Damascus. His only explanation was that he did not know what the smugglers might have done with the extra pictures taken of him.\nIn my view, the preponderance of evidence suggests the claimant was living in the UAE for a number of years, and applied for a Canadian visitor's visa after he applied for permanent residency. His evidence to the contrary is not credible.\nCounsel for the claimant filed a number of documents on current country conditions.22 The material suggests the situation in Afghanistan is unstable and confused.\nANALYSIS\nThe claimant has shown himself to be willing to mislead the panel as to his travels from Afghanistan to Canada. Only after being confronted with the incredibility of his testimony did he tell what he described as the real story of his travels. Categorical denials of his use of alias proved to be untrustworthy.\nThe evidence from Canada Immigration that suggests the claimant was not living in Afghanistan when he says his father disappeared or when he and his cousin were allegedly forced into exile.\nCounsel for the claimant suggested in his submissions that there were credible reports of staff in some Canadian visa offices abroad producing fraudulent travel documents. However, there is no persuasive evidence before the panel that any of the materials submitted to it from Canadian visa offices in the UAE or Damascus were produced by fraud. Counsel also noted that there was no logical reason for the claimant to enter Canada with false documents when he had been issued a valid visitor's visa from UAE. There is one explanation that is of note. He could not claim in Canada that he was fleeing persecution from Afghanistan if he had been living peacefully in the UAE for many years.\nCounsel for the claimant also argued that the claimant had lied about his travels to Canada because he was told to lie by his smuggler. However, the claimant put forward no credible or persuasive explanation for why he would choose to follow the smuggler's instruction and thereby risk the consequences of lying to this tribunal.\nAfter reviewing all the evidence, I find that the claimant is probably an Afghan national of Hazara ethnicity. However, I find that he was not in Afghanistan during the relevant time periods he claims to have been in his PIF, but had been living outside Afghanistan for many years. I find that he did not flee Afghanistan for Pakistan in 1998 after the disappearance of his father as he alleges. I accept as credible the evidence of the Minister's Representative that he was living in the UAE at that time.\nAs noted, the situation in Afghanistan remains unsettled. However, in my view this does not in itself give rise to a well founded fear of persecution for this claimant. His fear is of a generalized nature. He has no recent history or profile in Afghanistan that suggests he faces more than a mere possibility of persecution.\nDECISION\nFor all these reasons, I find that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is not a Convention refugee.\n\"Kurt Neuenfeldt\"\nKurt Neuenfeldt\nDecember 17, 2002\nDate\n1 Exhibit 1, Personal Information Form, Addendum question 1.\n2 Maldonado v.

She claims a well-founded fear of persecution based upon membership in a particular social group; in particular as a family member who has witnessed the murder of a loved one.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe following is a synopsis of the claimant's story taken from her Personal Information Form (PIF)2 and supplemented by the evidence at her hearing.\nThe claimant is a 32-year-old citizen of China. She and her husband owned and ran a chicken farm in XXXXX. On XXXXXXX, 1995 they sold all their chickens and had a lot of money on hand. That evening a gang of five Hunanese criminals burst into the house and killed her husband. They accomplished this by using the butt of a knife to stuff mosquito netting down his throat as far as the middle of his chest. He suffocated. At the time, the claimant was with her husband and their daughters who were aged two and five. The children witnessed this event. All had been gagged and tied. Eventually the eldest daughter wriggled herself free and the police were called.\nThe police investigated the incident and a few months later had the claimant come and positively identify three of the five criminals. They were locked up and remained in detention until the claimant left for Canada on XXXXXXX, 2001. The other two were never caught. Beginning in 1997 and lasting until she left the claimant, although moving frequently, received telephone calls from a person she presumed to be one of the two criminals who had not been arrested. This person threatened to kill her if she gave testimony against members of the gang. She never did, but that was because she had never been asked by the police to do so.\nThe claimant reported these telephone calls to the police, who told her that they did not have sufficient manpower to provide protection, rather they advised her to not go out at night and to lock her doors.\nDETERMINATION\nAlthough counsel argued that the claimant was a Convention refugee he did not argue s. 97 grounds. The panel has not considered the Convention refugee grounds as it has determined that the claimant is a person in need of protection under s. 97 (1) (b) of the Act. The panel found her to be a credible witness. In arriving at this determination the panel has considered all the evidence submitted, including the claimant's identity, her testimony at the hearing, and counsel's submissions.\nANALYSIS\nRisk to Life or Risk of Cruel Treatment\ns. 97 (1) (b) of the Act states:\n97. (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally...\n(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if\n(i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail\nthemselves of the protection of that country,\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country\nand is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\n(iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless\nimposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and\n(iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide\nadequate health or medical care.\nCentral to the analysis of this case is what harm is feared by the claimant. Clearly it is a risk to her life, given what was done to her husband, or at the very least a risk of cruel treatment - once again given the manner in which her husband was killed. Either of these constitutes a violation of a fundamental right, namely the right to security of person.3 The agents of harm are the remaining uncaptured members of the Hunanese gang that killed her husband.\nThe Hunanese gang members want to stop the claimant from testifying against them for the murder of her husband. This is a risk faced specifically by the claimant but not generally by members of the population of China. It brings her within the ambit of s. 97 (1) (b).\nState Protection\nIn Ward, the Supreme Court of Canada articulated the \"rationale underlying the international refugee protection regime\" as follows:\nThe international community intended that persecuted individuals be required to approach their home state for protection before the responsibility of other states becomes engaged. For this reason, James Hathaway refers to the refugee scheme as \"surrogate or substitute protection\", activated only upon failure of national protection... ..4\nThe Supreme Court underscored that the issue of whether the state is able to provide protection from persecution is as follows:\nAbsent a situation of complete breakdown of state apparatus, such as that recognized in Lebanon in Zalzali, it should be assumed that the state is capable of protecting a claimant.5\nThe Supreme Court held that this presumption may be rebutted where the claimant \"provides\" or \"advances\" \"clear and convincing proof\" or \"clear and convincing confirmation\" of the state's inability to protect.6\nThe claimant has the onus of rebutting the presumption that her state is capable of providing protection. As for the quality of protection to be afforded by his state, while the Supreme Court has made reference the protection being \"effective\",7 it is also clear that:\nNo government that makes any claim to democratic values of protection of human rights can guarantee the protection of all of its citizens at all times.8\nWhat is the situation with the claimant? She has gone to the police who have told her that they cannot protect her. They did not state that they could not protect anyone. In fact, an effort was made by these police to apprehend the criminals. They were, in fact, successful in apprehending three of the five. However, it is the other two who threatened her and as to these the police told the claimant they could not protect her from them.\nWhat standard of protection could she have reasonably expected? Twenty-four hours a day protection in a country of 1.2 billion people where criminal gangs run into the tens of thousands would be expecting too much. However, as counsel for the claimant pointed out, no effort was made to protect this claimant. No watch was set up, no telephone tap was suggested; rather she was, in effect, told to fend for herself.\nIn Mendivil,9 the court held that while a state may be able to protect most of its citizens it may not be able to protect a specific individual.\nThe Board members do not appear to have considered the possibility that persons specifically targeted, who may qualify as members of a particular social group, might still have good grounds for fearing persecution when a state is capable of protecting ordinary citizens but incapable of protecting members of that particular social group.10\nHere is such a case. The state has actually stated that it cannot protect this individual. Upon a consideration of the present claim the panel finds that this claimant has advanced \"clear and convincing proof\" of China's inability to protect her in order to rebut the presumption that China is capable of providing protection.\nInternal Flight Alternative\nIn the panel's view this gang has demonstrated that it could track her down wherever she moved. It is clear, given the death penalty that is frequently meted out to convicted criminal gang members, that the gang would have a serious interest in keeping this woman quiet. Perhaps, it is only her frequent moving about that prevented their success. Because of this the panel finds that the claimant does not have an internal flight alternative where she could be safe.\nCONCLUSION\nThe panel found the claimant to be a credible witness. As a result, the panel is of the opinion that there is more than a mere possibility that should the claimant be returned to China there would be a risk to her life pursuant to s. 97 (1) (b) of the Act.\nFor the reasons given and upon consideration of the whole of the evidence, the Refugee Protection Division determines that XXXXXXXX is a person in need of protection pursuant to s. 97 (1) of the Act.\n\"Michael A.

He alleges a well-founded fear of persecution based on his membership in a particular social group. Specifically, he fears persecution as a practitioner and follower of Falun Gong.\nThe hearing was held on his claim on July 3, 2002. Final submissions were received from his counsel on August 1, 2002.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant entered Canada illegally in June 1998 to join his second wife, XXXXXXX, who is the sister of his first wife. Ms. XXXXX is a Canadian citizen and had returned to China in 1995 to marry Mr. XXX. She then returned to Canada and tried to sponsor Mr. XXXX admission to Canada, but Canada Immigration refused that application. As he wanted to be with his wife, the claimant came to Canada and lived here without status for 3 years, until he made his refugee claim in June 2001.\nIn 1999, the claimant began practicing Falun Gong to help him cope with health problems related to the stress of being in Canada illegally and unable to work. Initially he practiced with others in XXXXXXX Burnaby. From XXXX 1999 until XXXX 2001, the claimant and his wife lived in XXXXXXX on Vancouver Island. There he practiced Falun Gong on his own. In XXXX 2001 they returned to Vancouver and the claimant began to practice with others and participate in public Falun Gong activities.\nAs a committed Falun Gong practitioner, the claimant fears persecution in China. His counsel referred to country documentation which shows the Chinese government has been engaged in a serious crack-down on Falun Gong since 1999, which has included very harsh treatment of Falun Gong leaders and practitioners.1\nDETERMINATION\nI find the claimant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution in China based on his involvement in Falun Gong. Therefore, I find the claimant is not a Convention refugee. As well, I find the claimant is not a person in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\nI find the claimant took up Falun Gong to establish a basis to stay in Canada. I find he does not have a strong commitment to Falun Gong, and could easily give it up if he returned to China.\nPrior to arriving illegally in 1998, the claimant tried to enter Canada through sponsorship by his second wife. Canada Immigration denied that application as they said it was a sham marriage. Canada Immigration said his second wife had divorced her husband in Canada to marry the claimant for financial gain. She had been living in Canada and returned to China for a very short time to marry the claimant. She then returned one day after the marriage to Canada. Although Ms. XXXXX married the claimant and tried to sponsor his move to Canada, Canada Immigration said she continued to live with her ex-husband. After the sponsorship application was refused, the claimant entered illegally and remained here without status until 2001 when he made a refugee claim.\nI do not accept that the claimant tookup Falun Gong in 1999, prior to the ban on Falun Gong in China. There is nothing to confirm his story that he began Falun Gong at that time. He said he started doing Falun Gong exercises for health reasons related to his illegal status and inability to work. However, he never saw a doctor for his health problems so, again, there is nothing to confirm his story. Further, at the hearing he admitted he had worked illegally in Canada in 1998 and 1999, so he was not without a job or income at that time. Finally, he admitted he also worked in XXXXXXXXXX. He said he practiced Falun Gong from 1999 to 2001 on his own in XXXXXXXXXX. Again, there is nothing to confirm this story. Given the claimant's clear history of entering a marriage that Canada Immigration has called a sham, and then coming to Canada and remaining here illegally for 3 years, I do not accept his story that, once here, he began the practice of Falun Gong starting in 1999 for health reasons. There is nothing to confirm his involvement in Falun Gong prior to July 2001. Further, he did not make a refugee claim until 2001, although if his story is true, he could have made a claim much earlier. I find it much more likely that the claimant tookup Falun Gong when he returned to Vancouver in 2001, in order to create a basis for a refugee claim.\nThe claimant says he practices Falun Gong regularly, attends other Falun Gong activities and has read the Falun Gong books. He says Falun Gong has improved his physical condition, given him more direction in his daily life, and causes him to do good things for others. He says Falun Gong teaches him truthfulness but, upon questioning, he admitted he had lied to Canada Immigration about his employment history in Canada and the existence of his step-son XXXXXXX. He could not explain why he had not been truthful. The claimant was asked about his step-son, XXXX, who was born in 1997. The claimant said his wife's ex-husband was the father of XXXX. When asked why his wife had a child with her ex-husband after she had married the claimant, the claimant said he did not know as he did not ask his wife about it. He said he and his current wife had decided not to have children until his status in Canada was resolved. This is not a credible story. The claimant claims to be married to his second wife, yet she subsequently had a child with her ex-husband and the claimant claims to know nothing about that. His evidence is supportive of the Canada Immigration conclusion that his current marriage is a sham. It also shows the claimant is not following the truthfulness principle of Falun Gong.\nThe claimant says he is involved in other Falun Gong activities, but listed only one such activity in his Personal Information Form (PIF).2 At the hearing, he listed other events he had attended since he filed his PIF. This reinforces my opinion that the claimant is using Falun Gong as a means to stay in Canada, and has tried to improve his claim by increasing his involvement in Falun Gong activities prior to the hearing. He had a photograph of himself taken at a XXXX 2002 demonstration, but was unable to say who had taken the photograph. He said he did not know other people at the demonstration and just asked someone for a photograph of himself. I find all the evidence shows the claimant has used Falun Gong to construct a refugee claim, and does not support his story that he is a committed Falun Gong practitioner.\nWhen asked if he was concerned that he might have come to the attention of the Chinese authorities for his involvement in public demonstrations in Vancouver, the claimant said no. He said he had never given his name or other I.D., so he had not been identified for his involvement. He said he did not think he would be targeted for his Falun Gong activities in Canada. He feels he would be persecuted in China for practicing Falun Gong there. However, according to his story, he practiced Falun Gong alone in XXXXXXXXXX for two years. Thus, it seems the claimant can practice Falun Gong by himself without the need of any public display or involvement with others.\nIn summary, I find the claimant does not have a strong connection to Falun Gong. It is not like a religion for him, as he made no reference to any spiritual aspect. He said it helped him do good things, but the only examples he could provide were helping a person with his wheelchair and donating money on one occasion. The health benefits he has experienced are relatively minor, as he never had serious health problems. There is nothing to confirm his evidence on this point. Thus, I conclude the claimant is not part of a particular social group of committed Falun Gong practitioners who should not be expected to give up their commitment to\/and practice of Falun Gong. The claimant is using Falun Gong to try and establish a way to stay in Canada. Nothing he said made me think he would continue to practice Falun Gong and face persecution if he returned to China.\nCONCLUSION\nBased on all the evidence and submissions and the above analysis, I find the claimant not credible about his history, involvement and connection to Falun Gong. He has not been truthful with Canada Immigration in the past, and I find that he was not truthful in his refugee claim. As a result, I find there is not more than a mere possibility the claimant would be persecuted in China because of his Falun Gong activities, or will face a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or will face a danger of torture if he returns to China.\nTherefore, the Refugee Protection Division determines that XXXXXXXXX is not a Convention refugee and is not a person in need of protection.\n\"Thomas Kemsley\"\nThomas Kemsley\n13 September 2002\nDate (day\/month\/year)\nREFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - CREDIBILITY - RELIGION - REFUGEE SUR PLACE - MALE - NEGATIVE - CHINA\n1 Counsel's submission dated July 31, 2002.\n2 Exhibit 1.\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nVA1-02469\n5\n",

Although this claim was filed under the provisions of the former Immigration Act1 it has also been considered under the provisions of the new Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.2\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant says that three of her children, now all adults, have been alienated from her due to the various actions of both individuals and state and private agencies in the United States over the past decades.\nWhen her daughter, XXXXXX, was nine years of age in 1977, she was taken from her custody by a court order and placed in the care of an agency. Her son, XXXXX, has been in conflict with the criminal justice system in the United States since he was fifteen years of age. He has repeatedly experienced prolonged hospitalisation in various mental institutions for ongoing paranoid schizophrenia. Her other son, XXXXX, has had ongoing problems related to drug and alcohol addiction.\nAll three of her children continue to reside in the United States. XXXXX lives in New Jersey, and XXXXX and XXXXX live in Washington State.\nDETERMINATION\nThe panel determines that the claimant has failed to provide sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to find that she is either a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\nAlthough Mrs. XXXXX was unrepresented by legal counsel at the hearing, she voluntarily proceeded to personally present her case. She filed considerable documentary materials in support of her claim. Those materials reflect that she has already repeatedly and extensively litigated similar actions regarding her children in various levels of the court system in the United States. In some of her applications, legal counsel represented her. However, in most of the actions, she was capable enough to have represented herself.\nShe has initiated claims in the local courts of New Jersey and other states. She has also litigated her claims in the federal court system, including both the United States District Court and the United States Courts of Appeal, in both the District of Columbia and in the Ninth District (West Coast). In addition, on XXXXX, 2000, the claimant's action for relief was denied by the United States Supreme Court.3\nThe claimant appeared to be a concerned woman who was attempting to remedy wrongs that she believes have occurred to her and her children over the past three decades. From her own evidence, she suffered from problems relating to alcohol and some psychological problems in her younger life. Her twin sons, XXXXX and XXXXX, were born in 1963. She described them as hyperactive children and difficult for her to raise.\nIt appears that her daughter, XXXXXXX, has a learning disability and may also suffer from developmental disabilities. Shortly after XXXXXXX birth, the claimant voluntarily gave her into foster care for some five years. Thereafter, XXXXXXX was only in her custody for some two years before she was taken away, this time under a court order. The claimant has not had any direct contact with her since that time.\nAnother adult daughter, XXXXXXX, spoke by telephone to XXXXXXX in 1999. Although XXXXXXX told her that she was her sister and wanted to meet with her, her overture was\nrebuffed. XXXXXXX has also shown no interest in having contact with the claimant. Her unsuccessful and repeated litigation in various courts have been motivated by her wish to regain custody of XXXXXXX, as she believes that her daughter was taken away from her by illegal or improper means.\nIn her most recent legal action that she undertook in the Superior Court in Newark, Essex County, New Jersey, the Court dismissed her claims and, because of her numerous previous legal actions, barred her from filing further lawsuits in that Court without prior judicial approval4. All of her various other lawsuits and appeals, including the U.S. Supreme Court, have also been repeatedly dismissed.\nHer two sons, XXXXX and XXXXX, have lived in Washington State since the 1980's. XXXXX has a history of mental illness and is currently a patient in the XXXXXX Hospital in XXXXXXX, Washington. He has been a repeat patient at that institution for prolonged periods of time. It would appear that he has been an involuntary patient, who was committed under various court orders, because of his inability to function outside of an organized, institutional setting. The claimant has had sporadic contact with XXXXX. Most recently, she admitted that he had failed or refused to speak to her when she telephoned him at that hospital. According to Mrs. XXX, the problem is that XXXXX cannot function for any length of time on his own and outside of a structured setting. When he cannot cope, he has been repeatedly hospitalized. She believes that he actually needs one-on-one care, treatment that she claims is not available to him in the United States. She believes that his condition may improve if he is allowed to come to Canada to live with her, rather than continue to be incarcerated in that system in the United States.\nHer other son, XXXXX, now receives a disability pension as a result of his alcohol and drug problems. She also has limited contact with him. The claimant herself was frank in admitting her own past problems. She was apparently homeless herself on and off from 1979 until 1985. She did work for nine years at the XXXXX Hospital in New York City until she retired in 1997. She is now receiving a pension from the United States government.\nAccording to Mrs. XXXXX, she came to Canada for two reasons. Her main reason was to try and make proper arrangements for XXXXX' care. The other reason was because she was never able to get a proper place to live in New York City. In Canada, she believed she would not continue to be persecuted as she had been in the United States, where her rights as a parent had been denied. She wanted to start a new life here because she feels that her past life experiences have been unfair to her in the United States and Canada feels calmer to her.\nWhen she filed her Personal Information Form (PIF)5, the claimant originally alleged that her refugee claim was based upon her race and her membership in a particular social group, as a low income African American. Prior to the hearing, she indicated that she no longer wanted to make her claim under those grounds and she advanced no evidence in support of them at the hearing. Instead, she proceeded with a claim of indirect persecution from mental torture inflicted upon her by the mistreatment, harassment and imprisonment of her children. In effect, she expanded her claim to include the consolidated grounds of the new Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and claimed that she was a person who was in danger of torture, as well as a person who faced a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nAs previously mentioned, the claimant filed voluminous materials relating to her past court proceedings in the United States. It would appear from those documents that she has alleged that past improprieties were committed by certain officials relating to her daughter, XXXXXXX. In addition, she believes that XXXXX has been improperly treated as a criminal, when he is a person only suffering from on-going mental problems.\nThe panel has considered the claimant's case and also considered the situation in her country of citizenship. The United States is an advanced democratic country with a well-established legal system. The claimant has already had the greatest opportunities to pursue her claims under the statutes of those various jurisdictions and in the local, state and federal courts. There is no evidence that there is any conspiracy by any government officials against her. It would appear that the courts have found that she has not been able to establish that state authorities have carried out their duties regarding her children in a manner that is not lawful, even if she strongly disagrees with their actions.\nThe panel notes the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal of Canada in Satiacum6, concerning the legal system in the United States. Satiacum dealt with a refugee claim initiated by a citizen of the United States, who alleged he faced persecution after he was convicted there of a number of criminal charges. Although his refugee claim ultimately failed, the Court dealt with the question of state persecution in the context of a democratic state's judicial processes. The Court stated:\nIn all but the most extraordinary circumstances all the events leading up to a prosecution and all of the events of a trial in a free and independent foreign judicial system must be taken to be merged into the judicial process and not open to review by a Canadian tribunal. Extraordinary circumstances would be those, for example, which tended to impeach the total system of prosecution, jury selection or judging, not discreet indiscretions or illegalities by individual participants which, even if proved, are subject to correction by the process itself.\nThe Court also stated:\nIn the absence of exceptional circumstances established by the claimant, it seems to me that in a Convention refugee hearing, as in an extradition hearing, Canadian tribunals have to assume a fair and independent judicial process in the foreign country. In the case of a non-democratic State, contrary evidence might be readily forthcoming, but in relation to a democracy like the United States contrary evidence might have to go to the extent of substantially impeaching, for example, the jury selection process in the relevant part of the country, or the independence or fair-mindedness of the judiciary itself.\nIt was also mentioned by the Court that:\nAgain, in the absence of proof by the refugee claimant, Canadian tribunals must assume a fair trial. The notion of a fair trial in a fair and independent judicial system must make allowance for the self-correcting mechanisms within the system, e.g., the trial judge's control over the excesses of the participants, and the control of the appellant courts over any errors of the trial judge.\nIn this claim by Mrs. XXXXX, none of the credible evidence substantially impeached the legal processes to which her children have been subjected. Over the last three decades, the claimant, both with and without legal counsel, has continued to pursue her remedies for redress in all levels of the court system in the United States.\nMrs. XXXXX genuinely feels that she has suffered unfairly because of the past actions of individuals and organisations concerning her children. She came to Canada because of that dissatisfaction with the United States and also as a result of her inability to attain proper living accommodation in New York City. She decided to try and make a new life for herself here. She received advice that one way to attempt to stay in Canada was to make a refugee claim and she did so. However, the evidence she has presented has failed to establish a causal link between her past treatment and the Convention definition. She has had full access to a fair and independent judicial process in the United States over a long number of years.\nObviously, it was very clear that Mrs. XXXXX's primary concern is for her three children, who are still in the United States. As a mother, she feels frustrated with her inability to retain a close relationship with her children. All of her children, undoubtedly, have had and continue to have serious personal problems. It is clear that it was her intention that if she could remain lawfully in Canada, she could then arrange for appropriate care for them here. Then, she hoped to rekindle a close relationship with her children. However admirable her intention may be, there is no nexus to any Convention ground in her claim and she is not a Convention refugee.\nIn addition, there is insufficient evidence to find that she is a person who is in need of protection under section 97(1)b of the new Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. She would not personally be subject a risk of torture in the United States, as it is defined in the Convention Against Torture. There is also insufficient evidence that she would personally be subject to a risk to her life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the United States.\nAlthough Mrs. XXXXX would like to stay in Canada, her ability to do so is not within the jurisdiction of the Refugee Protection Division. She may wish to pursue other possible remedies that may be available to her to remain here and not return to the United States. She is obviously a sincere individual, who is concerned about her children's welfare. This has been exhibited by her many past efforts to seek legal redress on their behalf.\nCONCLUSION\nHaving considered all of the evidence, the panel determines that this claimant is not a Convention refugee because there is less than a \"serious possibility\"7 that she has a well-founded fear of persecution if she should return to the United States. In addition, there is also less than a \"serious possibility\" that she is a person in need of protection.\nTherefore, the panel rejects the claim of XXXXXXXXXXXXXX to refugee protection.\n\"I.W.

Before leaving the United States, he obtained identification in the name of a deceased person, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. He entered Canada as a visitor under that name. He subsequently travelled on a number of occasions outside of Canada on vacation and then returned here on a US passport in the name of XXXXXXX. He married a Canadian citizen in 1999. His wife then applied to sponsor him for permanent residence. After the authorities here discovered his true identity, he was arrested in 2001. He then made his refugee claim.\nDETERMINATION\nThe panel determines that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is not a Convention refugee and is not a person in need of refugee protection. There is also no credible basis to his claim.\nANALYSIS\nThe first issue to determine was whether there was a nexus to a Convention refugee ground in this claim. It was put forth on behalf of the claimant that there was a nexus by way of an imputed political opinion. In this regard, it was important to determine if the claimant faced persecution or prosecution in the state of Wisconsin, U.S.A. There, the claimant currently faces three charges involving marijuana: manufacture, delivery and failure to affix tax stamps. Are they validly enacted laws of general application in the state of Wisconsin?\nIn considering that aspect, the panel notes that in Zolfagharkhani:1, the Federal Court of Appeal stated :\n...some general propositions relating to the status of an ordinary law of general application in determining the question of persecution.\nThe Court also stated that:\n...an ordinary law of general application, even in non-democratic societies, should ... be given a presumption of validity and neutrality, and the onus should be on a claimant, as is generally the case in refugee cases, to show that the laws are either inherently or for some other reason persecutory.\nThe claimant failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish that laws dealing with the manufacture or delivery of marijuana or other similar laws enacted by a democratic body have any intent but to achieve general societal benefit. Such laws must, on their face, apply to all sectors of the population without being targeted at specific groups within that population. There was insufficient evidence to find that these criminal laws only target certain groups.\nAnother question to determine is whether the claimant would be punished for a breach of a law that does not violate human rights and does not differentiate, either on its face or in its application, adversely on a Convention ground. One other consideration is whether the claimant's actions might contravene criminal laws in which the enforcement or punishment of such laws might infringe upon human rights and adversely differentiate between individuals. All national states, including inferior levels of government within a national state, have the right to enact laws that contribute to the functioning of the state and its subordinate organizations. Violation of a law which regulates behaviour implies that there will be a commensurate penalty for the violation of that law. It is not because of this claimant's political opinion that such laws conflict with his activities. In that sense, such criminal laws are neutral and not persecutory.\nAccording to the claimant, the only evidence to support these charges would appear to be information provided to the Wisconsin authorities by an individual who was involved in that criminal enterprise. That individual, XXXXXXXX, subsequently pleaded guilty and was sentenced to prison. XXXXX apparently wanted to obtain revenge because the claimant had started a relationship with a woman who had been romantically involved with XXXXX. The claimant alleged that he had no involvement whatsoever in that criminal enterprise. His brother approached XXXXX after he was released on parole and obtained an affidavit from him. In the affidavit, XXXXX attested that he had wrongly and falsely implicated the claimant in the crimes. According to the claimant, the Wisconsin authorities have, to date, indicated that they still intend to proceed with his charges.\nThe claimant conceded that he has the right to a jury trial on those charges. It is clear that he also has the right to apply to have reasonable bail set before his trial. He also has the right to have legal representation at all steps in the criminal proceedings against him in the state of Wisconsin. Based upon the evidence advanced before this panel, it would appear that there is no reasonable evidence upon which a jury could convict him of such offences.\nThere was much made of the penalties that the claimant might face if he is convicted. It is noted that two of the charges carry a maximum jail term of ten years and a minimum jail term of one year. However, it is also noted that on both charges, a jail term is not mandatory because, as an alternative, a fine may be imposed in lieu of any imprisonment. The third charge has a potential penalty of a fine or imprisonment, with no minimum penalty required. According to the evidence, any criminal penalties that might be imposed (in the very remote possibility that he would be convicted of any of these criminal offences in Wisconsin) only provide for a possible lengthy period of imprisonment as a maximum punishment. In that sense, there was insufficient evidence to find that laws of general application, such as the laws at issue in this case in the state of Wisconsin, are persecutory because their penalties are not disproportionate to the objectives of the laws.\nThe claimant speculated that he would be detained for a lengthy period of time before his trial. He also speculated that he would suffer harm if he was sent to jail after a conviction for any of these charges. Evidence was presented of abuses that have occurred to some inmates incarcerated in some of the various components of the vast American prison system. However, this claimant would only be liable to being tried and sentenced according to the laws of the state of Wisconsin, as there was no evidence presented that he currently faced any other outstanding criminal charges in the USA, either at the federal, state or local level. There was insufficient evidence presented to find that there is anything more than the merest possibility that he might suffer harm if he was imprisoned or detained in a prison facility operated by the state of Wisconsin.\nAs previously noted, the claimant's allegations are based primarily upon speculation on his part as to the likelihood of being imprisoned or convicted. The evidence before the panel would indicate there is only the merest possibility that he might be convicted. There is also nothing more than the merest possibility that he might suffer any harm from the penalties, whether they are fines or imprisonment, which might be imposed upon him after conviction.\nAs far as the allegations that the claimant might not receive a fair trial if he returned to the state of Wisconsin, the evidence is also deficient in that regard. The claimant admitted that he did not know if there was a lack of judicial independence regarding the campaign in the United States against the use of illegal drugs. There was certainly no evidence that there is any such lack of judicial independence in the state of Wisconsin. At most, he faces trial under a democratic state's functioning legal system, where he has a full right to a public trial for his criminal charges before a jury of his peers and an independent judiciary. He does not face any penalty that is disproportionate to the offences charged. He also has the right to appeal the outcome of his trial. There is no more than the most remote possibility that he might face treatment in prison, before or after his trial, that could be harmful or persecutory.\nOn the issue of a fair trial and the overall legal system that the claimant may face in Wisconsin (or elsewhere in the United States of America); the panel notes the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Satiacum.2 In that decision, the Court said:\nIn all but the most extraordinary circumstances all the events leading up to a prosecution and all of the events of a trial in a free and democratic foreign judicial system must be taken to be merged into the judicial process and not open to review by a Canadian tribunal. Extraordinary circumstances would be those, for example, which tended to impeach the total system of prosecution, jury selection or judging, not discreet indiscretions or illegalities by individual participants which, even if proved, are subject to correction by the process itself.\nThere is certainly nothing in the evidence in this claim to place it within the \"extraordinary circumstances\" envisaged in Satiacum for finding state persecution in a democratic state's judicial process.\nIn Satiacum, the Court also stated:\nIn the absence of exceptional circumstances established by the claimant, it seems to me that in a Convention refugee hearing, as in an extradition hearing, Canadian tribunals have to assume a fair and independent judicial process in the foreign country. In the case of a non-democratic State, contrary evidence might be readily forthcoming, but in relation to a democracy like the United States contrary evidence might have to go to the extent of substantially impeaching, for example, the jury selection process in the relevant part of the country, or the independence or fair-mindedness of the judiciary itself.\nThe Court continued:\nAgain, in the absence of proof by the refugee claimant, Canadian tribunals must assume a fair trial. The notion of a fair trial in a fair and independent judicial system must make allowance for the self-correcting mechanisms within the system, e.g., the trial judge's control over the excesses of the participants, and the control of the appellant courts over any errors of the trial judge.\nIn the panel's view, none of the evidence produced substantially impeaches the process in which the claimant is being sought by the state of Wisconsin. There was no evidence that the authorities there had any improper motivation in their dealings with the claimant. Charges were laid against him by the Wisconsin authorities only after evidence was provided by his alleged accomplice, XXXXX, who later admitted his own criminal involvement and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment. There was no evidence that XXXXX ever tried to appeal his sentence because he considered it to be excessive or improper. After serving one-third of his sentence, he was released on parole. Although the claimant alleged that the affidavit from XXXXXXXXXXX was presented to the requisite prosecution authorities in Wisconsin by his lawyer there, he said they have still refused to drop the charges. It was reasonable to have expected that he would have provided some evidence from his Wisconsin lawyer that such was the case, but he did not do so.\nIn any event, his trial can only proceed once the claimant is within the jurisdiction of Wisconsin. At that time, the authorities there will undoubtedly have to reconsider their intention to proceed with these charges. Unless they do have other evidence to present of his guilt, they would appear to have an overwhelming burden to overcome in obtaining a conviction against him, as their only witness has repudiated his previous accusation. He has now attested that he incriminated the claimant to seek revenge against him and he did so at a time when he was under duress.\nIt is clear from the evidence before the panel that there is no imputed political opinion involved in this claim. As such, there is no nexus between the credible evidence and the Convention definition. At most, this claimant is a victim of a personal vendetta initiated solely by Mr. XXXXX\nAs noted in the Handbook of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees:\nPersecution must be distinguished from punishment for a common law offence. Persons fleeing from prosecution or punishment for such an offence are not normally refugees. It should be recalled that a refugee is a victim - or potential victim - of injustice, not a fugitive from justice.3\nFrom the evidence before this panel, Mr. XXXXXX is clearly only a fugitive from justice and nothing else. He was not fleeing from persecution in the United States of America.\nA further indication that the claimant was not fleeing persecution concerned the lengthy delay before he sought refugee status. It was some five years after he fled from the United States and not until after he was apprehended by the Immigration authorities here in 2001 that he first made known his claim to Convention refugee status. According to him, he made no efforts to seek (or to investigate) refugee status here prior to his apprehension because he felt safe here using that assumed name. It is reasonable to expect that a person who has fled from their country, allegedly with a well-founded fear of persecution, would seek permanent protection in the first foreign country in which he resides. The panel prefers to find that this claimant's inaction for a period of some five years before he sought such protection is clearly indicative of his lack of any subjective fear of persecution in the United States of America.\nThe panel has also considered, under the new provisions of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act4, whether the claimant is a person in need of protection. Does he face a danger of torture, or is he a person facing a risk to his life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment? After a consideration of all of the evidence, the panel finds that there is much less than a serious possibility that this claimant is such a person in need of protection.\nCONCLUSION\nHaving considered all of the evidence, there is much less than a \"serious possibility\"5 that this claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution for any Convention refugee reason or that he is a person in need of protection, whether from a danger of torture or a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nThe panel finds that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is not a Convention refugee nor is he a person in need of protection. In the panel's opinion, because there was no credible or trustworthy evidence on which it could have made a favourable decision, it is appropriate to also make a finding of no credible basis6 in the circumstances of this claim.\n\"I.W.

Clague\nDATED this 17th day of September 2002.\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - POLITICAL OPINION - PERSECUTION - PROSECUTION - NEXUS - PERSON IN NEED OF PROTECTION - CREDIBLE BASIS - MALE - NEGATIVE - USA\nThe claimant faced criminal charges involving drugs. The Refugee Protection Division found that the laws under which the claimant was charged were validly enacted laws of general application. The claimant had the right to reasonable bail, to counsel and to a jury trial. The man who implicated the claimant in the offences now claimed that he had done so falsely, on the basis of a personal grudge. It appeared that there was no reasonable evidence upon which a jury could convict the claimant. If he was convicted, the penalties which he faced - between one and ten years' imprisonment - were not persecutory as they were not disproportionate to the objectives of the laws. The claimant's fears of the harm he might suffer in jail were purely speculative. There were no extraordinary circumstances in this case which would justify a finding of persecution in a democratic state's judicial process. There was no nexus between the claim and the Convention definition. The claimant was a victim of a personal vendetta. The claimant's five-year delay in making a refugee claim was inconsistent with a subjective fear of persecution. There was no credible basis for the claim, and the claimant was not a person in need of protection. RPD VA1-03216, Clague, September 17, 2002.\n1 Zolfagharkhani v.

She also claims she is a person in need of protection in that she is at risk of losing her life or being subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Mexico.\nTheir daughter, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, is seven years of age. Her father, XXXXXXXXXXXXX, was the Designated Representative for his daughter.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe allegations are essentially that the principal claimant was a member of the police force in XXXXXX, Michoacan. He had the rank of XXXXXX, from 1982 to 1986, participating in the XXXXX Program to fight narco trafficking and auto theft. He was based in XXXXXX, Apatzingan and worked there and in the Pacific area, and the mountains of XXXXX. In this capacity he participated in different operations and clashes with narco traffickers.\nFrom 1986 to 1991 he worked with the XXXXXXXXXXXXXX, the XXXXX, as a criminal investigator investigating primarily thefts and homicides. He worked with the XXXXXX until 1991 when he became an informant also known as a Madrina for the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, the XXXXXX. As a Madrina he used the names XXX and XXXXXX, and his job was to infiltrate the gangs that smuggled merchandise from the United States into the Federal District (in the XXXXXXXX) and to inform when and where contraband was to arrive. He also investigated arms smuggling and acted as an intermediary to get to the gang leaders. He worked at pubs, brothels and other places, and informed to the authorities so that they could take action, when a crime was about to take place.\nSometimes he would report the gang leader but the gang leaders would pay large sums of money to corrupt police officers for their release. The job was a very dangerous one, but it was one that he did willingly because he felt morally obligated to fight the war against drugs.\nIn XXXXXXX 2000, on his last assignment, he was retained by the XXXXX of XXXXXXX in the office of the XXXXXX, XXXXXXX, with whom he had assisted in several previous investigations. He was asked to infiltrate the distributors of cocaine in XXXXXX. Initially he refused because XXXXXX is his hometown, and many of those implicated were people with whom he had grown up and known for many years. Because he was offered a substantial amount of money (5,000 U.S.) he decided to accept this last position. It was his plan to move with his wife and child to a farm that he had purchased some years previously, and to stop this dangerous job of being a Madrina.\nIn late XXXXXX 2001 he informed Ms. XXXXXX of five cocaine houses which were distribution operations, where they were located, and the names of the people involved. Fifteen days later there was an operation where the army, the XXX and the state judicial police stormed into the houses and arrested people in three of the five houses. Large quantities of cocaine and money were seized. The claimant does not know how many people were arrested but believed that at least four had been detained.\nA short time later two of the leaders were freed he believes, as a result of having paid a police bribe. It is his view that they would not have been released otherwise. These two men were known colloquially as XXXXX and XXXXX. He began to be very concerned information would be leaked to these two leaders that he was the informant, particularly because he was known to the people in XXXXXX, his hometown. He noticed that cars without licence plates were near his farm, which caused him concern. He asked the police XXXXXXX to offer him some protection because of his vulnerability, given he was involved in the arrest of XXXX and XXXXX. The police XXXXXXXX refused to offer him police assistance and the claimant became fearful that if he insisted on and received police assistance, corrupt police would simply turn him over to the narco traffickers for their own personal profit.\nWhen he advised Ms. XXXXXX what was happening she said that she could not help him officially because he did not exist to her. However, she agreed to meet him in a park and gave him $750 U.S., telling him to move to the United States until things calmed down. (The claimant spoke to his wife and left the country four days later fearing that he would be killed as an informant).\nIt is his view that he would be killed by the narco traffickers as an example to others who might be inclined to inform on drug dealers. He believes that the narco traffickers have the financial resources necessary to purchase information through police and other state agents who have access to state information resources. In this way, if he became employed, sought medical treatment or voted anywhere in Mexico, he could easily be located and killed. It is his position that the narco traffickers remember for a very long time, the trails of others, that caused in difficulties for them. As a former XXXXX and informant, he would be viewed with contempt by the narco traffickers and believes that they would not forget him, until he was killed.\nHis wife claims that before her husband left he warned her that he was going to have to leave the country. He also told her to obtain passports for she and the daughter, in case they had to leave to join him at some time. His wife did not find this unusual because the claimant would be gone on assignment sometimes two and three months at a time. He did not explain to the claimant what he did for a living and it was not until the hearing that the claimant heard the word Madrina used in reference to her husband's activities. She became visibly upset during the hearing when she realized the danger, she and her daughter had been placed, as a result of her husband's job.\nThe claimant was approached on three occasions. In XXXXX of 2001 three or four men came to her home. They were armed, and they refused to identify themselves. They wanted to know her husband's whereabouts. The second was at the end of XXXXX 2001 when she and her daughter were waiting for a bus. Two men got out of a car and enquired about her husband's whereabouts. She told him that she had lost contact with her husband three months before. They told her that they were not going to stop until they found her husband and it would be better for her to co-operate with them. They threatened that if she did not co-operate with them they would hurt her where it hurt most, with one of them patting her daughter on the head as the threat was uttered.\nShe reported this to the judicial police and Public Ministry Office in XXXXXX and told them that she was being followed by men who were looking for her husband. She told them about the threat and they said that there was nothing that they could do to help her. They mocked her and told her that this was a risk faced by the spouse of a former XXXXXXX. They also made enquiries about her husband's whereabouts and she told them that she did not know where her husband was, which was the truth.\nLater, in XXXXXX of 2001, on her way to work a truck stopped and four men got out of the vehicle. Two of them approached her calling her by name and told her that she had to accompany them. One of them grabbed her by the arm and tried to push her into the truck. She managed to break free and ran towards her home. At this time the men grabbed her by the hair and she started to scream but they pulled her, resulting in bruising to her body. Because this was her home neighbourhood, several people in the area started trying to help her, shouting for the police and creating a general fracas. The men fled at this point and the claimant was too afraid to report this incident to the police. She contacted her husband through his sister, XXXX. Her husband told her to leave as soon as possible and that his mother would arrange for travel tickets. She quit a job of 20 years as a XXX and left the country with her daughter on XXXXX, 2001.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\nThe claimants' identity as nationals of Mexico was established by their testimony which was forthright and credible on this point and by the supporting documentation filed, namely, authentic international Mexican passports for all three claimants. Additionally, electoral cards, a transit card and identification from the Secretary of Education were filed to establish the claimants' identity. I am satisfied that the claimants possess acceptable documentation establishing their identity.\nHarm Feared\nThe claimants allege that if they return to Mexico they would be killed or beaten so severely as to be hospitalized. I find that the kind of risk alleged by the claimants is a risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment described in section 97(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nThe claimants testified in a very forthright and candid way. They point to the situation of other Madrinas who have been killed or beaten for informing on narco traffickers. The fact that the female claimant was grabbed and an attempted kidnapping took place has caused them to be very concerned about their safety. Justifiably so, in my view.\nRisk of Harm\nIn addition, there is a serious possibility that the claimants will be either killed or seriously injured should they return to Mexico. They have been threatened personally by individuals who have been provided information about the fact that the claimant is an informer.\nThe realization by the principal claimant that the narco traffickers are vengeful and ruthless is, on the balance of probabilities, likely to result in grave risk to his life, given their interest in setting a visible example of those who inform on narco traffickers. The documentary evidence suggests that traffickers in Mexico form a large, well-organized group sufficiently well-financed to be able to bribe police officers, and would want to safeguard the viability of such an established network by ensuring that their credibility as traffickers is not undermined by informants like the principal claimant.\nState Protection\nI agree with the principal claimant that the state will not protect him should he return to Mexico. It is obvious from the evidence that the local police are on the payroll of the criminals. We have evidence at Exhibit 9.1 The specific question asked for this case was for information about a drug seizure of cocaine in XXXXXX involving the state judicial police and the Attorney General of the Republic, Procuraduria General de la Republica (XXX) including number of arrest charges and whether those arrested were released.\nThe Response to Information says as follows:\nWithout mentioning a specific date a report by XXXXXX disclosed to the arrest of seven persons at the \"XXXXX\" market in the historical centre of XXXXXX (XXXXX 2001). The Federal Judicial Police (Policia Judicial Federal, PJF) confiscated 60 \"grapas\" (local unit of measurement of cocaine) and one ounce of cocaine. (ibid.).\nThe commander in charge of the investigation, XXXXX XXX XXXXX, said the operation took \"some 50 minutes\" (unos 50 minutos) as PJF agents arrested seven persons, (including three women and one minor), for selling various quantities of cocaine (ibid.).\nMoreover, the same report states this was the second anti-drug operation in the municipality of XXXXXX since XXXXXX 2000. (ibid.). In the XXXXX seizure, the Mexican Amy in collaboration with the Attorney-General of the Republic (Procuraduria General de la Republica, XXX) and the Attorney-General of Justice(Procuraduria General de Justicia, PGJ), searched approximately 15 houses (ibid.). In 11 of the houses searched the agents discovered drugs, arms, communication equipment and counterfeit money (ibid.)..\nAt Exhibit 10 the claimant has provided a photograph of himself in XXXXX uniform dating back to 1986. However, he does not have any other photographs more recent, to confirm the fact that he was, in fact, a XXXXXX. I accept his testimony is credible and I accept that he was initially a XXXXXXX, and then later, a XXXXX.\nAt Exhibit 12 counsel filed a document from the World Policy Papers entitled \"Democracy and Human Rights in Mexico\" by Andrew Redding from 1995.2 At page 25 of that document I read the following:\nA further source of abuse is the widespread use of covert agents known as Madrinas (\"godmothers\"), or meritorios (\"deserving ones\"). Though often heavily armed these agents are kept off the books. Because they do not act in an official capacity they can be used to circumvent the law. The judicial police use them to do their dirty work, then deny any responsibility. The fact that Madrinas are not on a regular payroll also fosters corruption. Since they cannot be paid out of the public funds they are often paid out of the proceeds of drug busts or protection money supplied by drug traffickers and other criminals.\nFurthermore, in reviewing the Federal Court Trial Division's decision in Zhuravlvev3 Judge Pelletier held that:\nWhere the evidence, including the documentary evidence situates the individual claimant's experience as part of a broader pattern of state inability or refusal to extend protection, then the absence of state protection is made out. The question of refusal to provide protection should be addressed on the same basis as the inability to provide protection. A local refusal to provide protection is not a state refusal in the absence of evidence of a broader state policy to not extend state protection to the target group. Once again, the documentary evidence may be relevant to this issue. There is an additional element in the question of refusal which is that refusal may not be overt; the state organs may justify their failure to act [page 18] by reference to various factors which, in their view, would make any state action ineffective.\nThe Refugee Protection Division must, therefore, assess the bona fides of these assertions in light of all the evidence.\nIn this case a persistent failure to take action, while not necessarily justifying a finding of a lack of state protection, does require a close examination of the reasonableness and bona fides of the police action, particularly where a citizen's right to internal movement is limited.\nIn this case the claimant submits that his right to internal movement is limited by virtue of the accessibility of the police to his personal profile.\nIt is my view that the issue of state protection will very often turn on the credibility of the claimant. Where a state is in effective control of its territory, has military, police and civil authority in place, as in Mexico, and makes serious efforts to protect its citizens, the mere fact that it is not always successful in doing so may not be enough to justify a claim that the claimants are unable to avail themselves of such protection.4\nWhile it is clear that Mexico is in effective control of its territory, we need to analyze further whether the protection to be offered to this claimant is effective in this case. I accept the claimants' evidence as credible. Having done so, I accept that he has a subjective fear.\nIn this case the subjective fear of persecution and risk combined with the state's inability to protect the claimant and his family, creates a presumption that his fear is well-founded. Additionally, we have information about particular groups who are at risk in Mexico, including members of the judiciary and informants.\nI, therefore, agree with the claimants that the state will not protect them should they return to Mexico.\nInternal Flight Alternative\nI find, on the balance of probabilities, that there is no internal flight alternative for these claimants. As they have stated in their testimony, the narco traffickers have ties with government officials who provided them with information with respect to both the claimant's whereabouts and his role as an informant. If the narco traffickers are this well organized it is more likely than not that they have the ability, as the claimants suggest, to use government and police contacts to track he and his family down and ensure that he is punished for his reporting of their activities and informing the police of a drug bust, in advance, resulting in a substantial loss of revenue. The claimants would essentially be living in hiding in other parts of Mexico, making IFA unreasonable in the circumstances.\nThere was a substantial loss of income and drugs for which the claimant will be forced to atone. His family is also at risk by virtue of the high incidence of kidnapping in Mexico. We read that the kidnapping situation in Mexico is second only to Colombia. It is not difficult to accept the possibility that the young, minor claimant could be kidnapped as a way to ferret out the principal claimant so that he can be made to suffer for being an informant. Given the veiled threat made to Mr. XXXXXX about the daughter XXXXXXX, this fear is justified.\nCONCLUSION\nBased on the foregoing analysis I conclude that XXXXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX are persons in need of protection. I, therefore accept their claims for refugee protection.\n\"Paulah Dauns\"\nPaulah Dauns\n30 September 2002\nDate (day\/month\/year)\nKEYWORDS - REFUGEE PROTECTION DIVISION - PERSON IN NEED OF PROTECTION - STATE PROTECTION - INTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE - MALE - FEMALE - POSITIVE - MEXICO\nThe principal claimant feared drug or narco traffickers. He and his family feared that if they returned to Mexico, they would be killed or severely beaten. The Refugee Protection Division found that the claim involved a risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment within the meaning of section 97(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. There was a serious possibility that the claimants would be killed or seriously injured if they returned to Mexico. Given that the local police are on the payrolls of criminals, state protection would not be available to the claimants. They did not have an internal flight alternative (IFA) as the drug traffickers had the ability to use government and police contacts to track them down. The principal claimant's family was also at risk by virtue of the high incidence of kidnapping in Mexico. The claimants were persons in need of protection.
