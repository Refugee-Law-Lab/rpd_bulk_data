It can hold a second hearing only in limited circumstances, namely, only when there has been a failure to observe a principle of natural justice. Furthermore, section 170.2 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act states that the RPD does not have jurisdiction to reopen a claim for refugee protection in respect of which the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) or the Federal Court has made a determination.\n[3] Similarly, subrule 62(9) of the RPD Rules states that, if the application is based on the \"same or similar grounds\" as a pending application before the RAD, the RPD can \"allow the application to reopen if it is necessary for the timely and efficient processing of a claim, or dismiss the application.\"\n[4] In this case, the uncontested evidence is that the applicant has not been served with the application to withdraw certain exhibits in this file.1\n[5] In this case, the applicant filed an appeal before the RAD and raises the same question. Consequently, given that this is not an application where there has been a failure to observe a principle of natural justice, without any in-depth analysis, the Division is of the opinion that it is appropriate to allow the RAD to rule on the appeal.\nDECISION\n[6] The application to reopen filed by the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness is DISMISSED.\nMichael Hamelin\nMichael Hamelin\nFebruary 21, 2017\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 Paragraph 4 of XXXX XXXX's affidavit, respondent's motion, pages 7 to 13, Exhibit N.\n---------------\n---------------\n---------------\n---------------\nRPD File No. \/ No de dossier de la SPR : MB4-04036\n",

She seeks refugee protection against Afghanistan pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] This claim was based on the following allegations. The claimant seeks protection on three grounds. First, the claimant alleges she is targeted by a male relative who is trying to force her into marriage. The claimant opposes the marriage, and the male relative has been threatening the claimant with violence. These events started in 2015 and continued into the spring and summer of 2016. The claimant alleges persecution as a member of a particular social group, namely, women who are vulnerable in the oppressive patriarchal society of Afghanistan.\n[3] The second ground of persecution is that the claimant's mother works for an organization called the XXXX XXXX Organization for the Rule of Law. Being the daughter of the XXXX XXXX XXXX, the claimant is at risk.\n[4] The claimant's third allegation is that she has fled to Canada and engaged in a peacebuilding conference in the United States, so she would be at risk upon her return to Afghanistan as someone who is associated with Western and anti-Islamic values. The claimant fled Afghanistan on XXXX XXXX, 2016 to attend the conference in the United States. After the conference, the claimant came to Canada on August 16, 2016. She signed her Basis of Claim (BOC) form on August 25, 2016.2\n[5]\nThe panel took into consideration The Chairperson's Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution and the Guidelines on Child Refugee Claimants when considering the process of the hearing and the facts in this case.3 The claimant entered Canada XXXX XXXX XXXX before her 18th birthday. All relevant factors, such as social and cultural context in which the principal claimant found herself, along with the issue of state protection and changing country conditions were examined with consideration of the Chairperson's Gender and Child Refugee Guidelines.\nDetermination and Reasons\n[6] The identity of the claimant was established on the basis of her Afghan passport, the original of which was seized by the Minister.4\n[7] This claim is dismissed. For the following reasons, the panel finds that this claim was not credible:\na. On a balance of probabilities, the claimant was not faced with a forced marriage to her cousin. Critical inconsistencies, vagueness, and embellishments in the claimant's evidence undermine the allegation of threats from her cousin.\nb. On a balance of probabilities, the claimant's mother did not work for the XXXX XXXX organization as alleged.\nc. The claimant failed to claim protection in the United States despite having a reasonable opportunity to do so. The claimant's eligibility in Canada, being a minor at the time of her claim, does not justify the failure to seek protection in the United States. The preponderance of evidence suggests that the claimant was asylum shopping. This failure to claim indicates a lack of subjective fear.\nd.\nThe claimant is not credible that she would be at risk of having been perceived as \"Westernized.\" The claimant's lack of credibility, lack of subjective fear, asylum shopping, and failure to establish herself within a risk profile undermines that allegation.\nANALYSIS\nThe Forced Marriage to XXXX XXXX\n[8] The claimant was not credible with respect to the forced marriage and threats that she faced from her cousin, XXXX XXXX.\n[9] The claimant alleged and testified that her father left to work in Iran in 2011, when the claimant was approximately 13 years old. The family heard from him once shortly after he left, then never again. In 2015, the claimant's paternal aunt (XXXX mother) approached the claimant and her mother (XXXX XXXX, hereinafter \"XXXX\") with a proposition of marriage for the claimant to XXXX. Because the claimant's father had been gone for so long and had apparently disappeared, the aunt's argument was that because the claimant was without a male protector, the claimant must marry XXXX. The claimant was 17 years old at the time. XXXX was 17 years older than the claimant and already had another wife.\n[10] The claimant and XXXX refused the marriage proposition, but the aunt and XXXX continued to push the issue, thinking that the claimant and XXXX were simply observing the customary tradition of refusing the first advance. When the claimant and XXXX continued their refusal, however, XXXX became angry and aggressive. He began a campaign of harassment and threats against the claimant. On one occasion, as the claimant testified, XXXX threw a water glass at the claimant's older sister. XXXX would follow her to and from school and would try to touch the claimant sexually.\n[11] On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2016, the claimant went to the police.5 They did nothing, saying that it was a domestic matter that it should be dealt with by the elders. The claimant and XXXX submitted the matter to the elders. The claimant testified that she could not remember exactly when the elders' meeting occurred, but it was approximately 2-3 weeks after the police report. The elders determined that the claimant should marry XXXX. Failing that, the claimant testified that she researched the XXXX program and then applied for the XXXX conference in the United States to secure her visa and flight out of Afghanistan.\n[12] There were a number of serious credibility concerns in the claimant's evidence surrounding this narrative.\n[13] The claimant was inconsistent in her evidence about the timeline of how these events unfolded. Each event was dependent upon the preceding event. The claimant was clear in her testimony that she went to the police on XXXX XXXX, 2016. The police report was dated XXXX XXXX, 2016.6 The meeting of the elders was 2-3 weeks later, and then when that failed, she researched and applied for the XXXX program after that. The XXXX program acceptance came within approximately one week after she made the application.\n[14] Given that timeline of events, the earliest that the claimant would have even applied for the XXXX program was XXXX XXXX XXXX 2016. That would put the claimant's acceptance to the XXXX program at approximately XXXX XXXX, 2016. However, the acceptance letter to the XXXX program was actually dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2016.\n[15] The claimant explained that it was a hectic time in her life, so there was uncertainty about the timelines. Her mother XXXX had made many of the arrangements, such as the elders' meeting. The claimant also changed her testimony and stated that, in actuality, she had already been researching and applied to the XXXX program. However, when that contradiction was put to her, the claimant's testimony became muddled and incomprehensible. The claimant then further improvised and stated that her mother knew the program organizer at XXXX, so once the claimant applied for the program, the claimant was quickly accepted within less than one week.\n[16] The claimant also submitted that consideration must be given to the Child Refugee and Gender Guidelines, in that such vulnerable persons are to be afforded consideration for imprecise recollections of events owing to traumatic events.\n[17] The panel does not find these explanations are credible.\n[18] The panel has considered the Guidelines and the claimant's relationship thereto. This was not a claimant who required the benefit of the Guidelines. The claimant was 17 years old at the time of the events, and she turned 18 years old XXXX XXXX XXXX after she entered Canada. This was a grown woman, not a child. Her mother testified that it was the claimant's decision to flee to Canada instead of the United States, and not anyone else's. The claimant did all of her own research, made inquiries, used her mother's connections, and carefully weighed her options about making a claim in Canada over the United States. The claimant was a strong, intelligent, and articulate woman with a strong personality and high ambitions for her future, her education, and her ideas about bringing peace to Afghanistan. At one point she stated: \"XXXX and nobody can stop me from doing what I feel like doing, from being an educated person. I want to be educated and a citizen of the world.\"\n[19] The purpose and intent of the Guidelines is to acknowledge and consider that a child or female claimant may be imprecise in their recollection of events owing to their age, social and cultural vulnerabilities, and their experience of traumatic events. The credibility concerns raised throughout this hearing are not explained by the claimant's failure to recollect events or details. The concerns raised throughout this case undermine the fabric of the narrative and allegations themselves.\n[20] For example, the inconsistency in the timeline outlined above cannot be attributed a failure to recollect events whereas the claimant was so fundamentally clear during her testimony that one event preceded and then precipitated another event. The documentary evidence simply does not accord with the claimant's testimony, even if concession is made for imprecision. The panel does not find it credible that this claimant, being an educated and extremely intelligent woman, would have made a mistake about the length of time between the police report, the elders meeting, and the XXXX acceptance letter. The changes in the claimant's testimony appeared improvised to deal with these inconsistencies. The testimony that the claimant's mother knew the program manager at XXXX through her work \"connections\" appeared improvised and unrealistic. The panel is supported in this finding given the panel's further findings below that the claimant's mother did not likely work for XXXX XXXX at all.\n[21] The panel draws a negative inference against the claimant due to this inconsistency in the timeline. The claimant's vague, inconsistent, and obfuscating testimony continued throughout the hearing in many different respects, as further outlined below, and it was not only limited to the claimant herself either, it was also typical of XXXX testimony.\nThe Elder's Meeting\n[22] The timeline of events aside, the evidence about the meeting of elders was vague and inconsistent. The claimant testified that she did not know who the elders were, or whether they were relatives or not. The claimant's mother testified that she never told the claimant who was involved in the elders' meeting. XXXX did not want to bother the claimant with this. As it turned out, it was largely the same relatives who were trying to force XXXX marriage upon the claimant. XXXX testified that she had no choice and was forced to submit to the elders meeting. The panel does not find that credible. Given that these were the same people trying to force the claimant's marriage in the first place, there is no credibility that XXXX was forced to submit to the elders. The meeting was a sham and should have been noted as such.\n[23] Further, the elders meeting did not consist of persons distant and unknown to the claimant as the claimant tried to convey. It was her father's family and direct relatives, the same ones who were trying to force the marriage in the first place. Given this, and given how deeply involved the claimant's mother was, it simply lacks credibility that the claimant and her mother would not have had a conversation about who was sitting on the meeting of elders. The claimant and her mother were strategically making efforts together to refuse XXXX. The elders' meeting was set to decide the claimant's life. Given the panel's assessment of the claimant's personality as outlined above, the claimant was not a woman who would likely be unaware of the close relatives who were deciding her fate. The panel draws a negative inference from the claimant's vague description and inability to describe the persons who sat on the meeting of elders.\nOther Discrepancies in the XXXX Narrative\n[24] There were other significant discrepancies in the narrative surrounding XXXX on critical points which undermined the overall credibility of this claim.\n[25] For example, the claimant and XXXX were inconsistent with each other regarding how many times XXXX mother came to see them. In the BOC narrative and in her testimony, the claimant indicated that it was many times. XXXX stated it was only once, however. Then XXXX changed her testimony and stated it was two times. There was no comprehensible explanation for this inconsistency and the explanation for who visited from XXXX family only appeared vague and muddled. The panel draws a negative inference against the allegation that XXXX or his family ever made marriage propositions to the claimant.\n[26] The claimant and XXXX were also inconsistent about the nature of the claimant's relationship with the claimant's father. This was significant because it speaks to the claimant's status in Afghanistan as an unaccompanied female. The claimant tried to convey the impression that she had no memory of her father and that she spent little time with him. XXXX contradicted that by saying the claimant's father loved his children and his own extended family and was home most evenings. XXXX attempted to minimize this inconsistency by saying that the claimant's father was not a sociable person, but that still does not explain the extent of the claimant's complete lack of recollection of her father. The panel finds that the claimant's discussion of her father was embellished to emphasize the appearance that she was an unaccompanied female in Afghanistan. The panel draws a negative inference against the claimant's allegation that she was an unaccompanied female.\n[27] Another significant discrepancy was that XXXX could not identify that XXXX had thown a water glass at the claimant's older sister XXXX. The panel finds that lacks credibility, given the extent of XXXX involvement, and given that the incident was the most extreme instance of violence that the claimant could speak about that XXXX had exhibited. XXXX explained this by stating perhaps the claimant and XXXX had not told XXXX everything. The panel rejects that explanation considering how extensive XXXX knowledge of the incident was otherwise. For example, XXXX knew the details of the conversation that XXXX had with XXXX, and that XXXX had pulled XXXX hair during the fight. It is not credible that XXXX would be unaware of the water glass. The panel draws a negative inference from XXXX inability to credibly corroborate this incident.\nConclusion with Respect to XXXX\n[28] The inconsistencies, embellishments, and vague testimony exhibited by the claimant and XXXX as outlined above were in relation to critical parts of the narrative and allegation of a forced marriage. Owing to these credibility concerns outlined above, the panel draws a negative inference against the claimant's allegations that she was persecuted as a result of her gender and in relation to a forced marriage to XXXX.\nXXXX XXXX\n[29] The panel does not find the claimant's allegation that she was at risk due to her mother's employment at XXXX XXXX as credible. The claimant's mother was not, on a balance of probabilities, employed by XXXX XXXX.\n[30] This hearing was held over three sessions on October 12, 2016, November 3, 2016, and December 19, 2016. XXXX testified during the second and third session of this hearing via teleconference from Afghanistan.\n[31] The claimant alleged that XXXX is the XXXX XXXX XXXX. However, XXXX name is not reflected on the website of XXXX XXXX, even though several other employees are listed on the website, including the XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX. The claimant and XXXX explained that the website was out of date, and they were working on a new one.\n[32] The website had actually been updated between the second and third hearing, so the website issue was put to the claimant and XXXX again. XXXX confirmed she was still working there. XXXX explanation was that the organization was not updating the names of its employees on the website anymore, for their security. XXXX name was still on the website because XXXX was out of the country, and there was no longer any concern for XXXX security.\n[33] The panel rejects these explanations. It is not credible that an organization dedicated to the rule of law would protect XXXX by not publishing her name, yet would continue to publish the names of other individuals and put them at risk, whether they were former employees, current employees, or out of the country or not. There are at least three other employees who still had their names published on the updated website. XXXX explanation was convoluted and designed to obfuscate the panel. The website itself is not consistent with XXXX explanation that the organization was trying to shield its employees from security threats.\n[34] Further credibility concerns severely undermined both the claimant's and XXXX testimony about the XXXX XXXX organization.\n[35] For example, XXXX lacked credibility when she gave a convoluted and obfuscating answer about why XXXX XXXX published its address on the website. The explanation, in summary, was that XXXX XXXX did not publish their real address for security reasons, but the panel rejects this because it makes little sense why it would publish any address at all then. Before XXXX testimony, the claimant had testified that XXXX XXXX was constantly moving its offices for security purposes. XXXX improvised on that by stating XXXX XXXX had not moved in fact since XXXX had joined. XXXX gave a convoluted and incomprehensible explanation about how the actual office of XXXX XXXX was located 5 or 6 blocks away from the published address. She explained that the address was somehow associated with a restaurant and the general area itself. The panel draws a negative inference against the claimant for the failure to clarify something as simple as the XXXX XXXX address.\n[36] Before XXXX testified, when the panel asked the claimant about the threats that had been experienced by the staff at XXXX XXXX, the claimant testified that the threats were not to the people, but to the organization itself. She stated: \"to our knowledge, the Taliban never directly threatens anyone, the threat is to the organization, not the individual.\"\n[37] The panel finds this to be an embellishment on its face. The panel does not see how an organization can credibly be targeted without the members themselves being targeted. An organization is made up of its membership. The UNHCR Guidelines certainly are clear that threats to an NGO are comprised of threats to the individual members of the NGO itself.7 This is why persons fall into a given risk profile. The panel draws a negative inference against the claimant for having made such an embellishment and without being able to point to a specific threat that had ever been made against XXXX XXXX. When the panel asked both the claimant and XXXX about what specific threats had been directed to XXXX XXXX or its members in the past, they both provided the same answer: there were none.\n[38] Even if XXXX employment in XXXX XXXX were credible, which it clearly is not, the threat to XXXX XXXX would be a generalized risk that any NGO faces in Afghanistan. The UNHCR Guidelines identify that employees of NGOs face a heightened risk of persecution.8 However, a generalized risk is not sufficient. The claimant must establish how she herself has been targeted and distinguished as a family member of an NGO employee. The claimant has failed to establish how her mother is targeted, let alone herself. Given these circumstances, the claimant does not fit the risk profile of a person targeted for their association with an NGO in Afghanistan.\n[39] On a balance of probabilities, the claimant's mother did not work at XXXX XXXX. The panel draws a negative inference against the claimant's allegation that she was persecuted due to her relationship with an NGO employee.\nFailure to Claim and Claimant's Fear of Return\n[40] The credibility concerns outlined above are severe and adversely determinative of this claim. However, these concerns are all compounded further still by the fact that the claimant failed to seek protection in the United States at the first reasonable opportunity. This failure to claim demonstrates a lack of subjective fear.\n[41] The claimant explained that she made the decision to make a claim in Canada prior to even leaving Afghanistan. She did her research and made inquiries. She considered the merits of claiming in Canada over the United States. The United States would take too long. She determined that Canada was the best place to protect women. She applied to the XXXX program and obtained her American visa, all with the intention of coming to Canada. It was her best chance of getting away from her problems in Afghanistan. She never intended to make a claim in the United States. The claimant had no one in Canada who could assist her, but she did have connections and friends in the United States through her mother. She stayed with friends of her mother for approximately one week after the XXXX conference, and then she entered Canada XXXX XXXX XXXX before her 18th birthday. She was found eligible by CBSA officers because she was still a minor on the day she arrived.\n[42] These are not the actions of a genuine refugee, and the panel finds it irrelevant that the claimant was a minor and eligible to claim in Canada. Given the panel's findings about XXXX XXXX and XXXX, the panel gives no weight to the claimant's testimony that the XXXX program was the best option to flee the threats. The preponderance of evidence suggests there were no threats. By the claimant's own admission of carefully weighing the merits of the American and Canadian refugee systems, she was asylum shopping, and when that is compounded by the severe credibility concerns throughout this narrative, the preponderance of evidence suggests that this was a premeditated plan to immigrate to Canada through the refugee system. The claimant has no subjective fear, and the panel draws a negative inference against the claimant's failure to seek protection in the United States where she had more than ample opportunity to do so. She also had more reason to do so, whereas she had no connections in Canada, but she did in the United States.\n[43] The panel gives no weight to the claimant's allegation of fear for having travelled to the United States. The UNHCR Guidelines identify that persons returning to Afghanistan may be accused and targeted for being spies and having adopted \"Western\" values.9 However, the Guidelines also specify that this risk is heightened particularly when a person also falls under a particular risk profile, such as humanitarian and development workers, and women in the public sphere. This claimant has certainly not been credible about falling into the risk profiles that she alleges. It is tenuous at best that the Taliban would necessarily discover or target this claimant for having travelled to the United States. The claimant's failure to seek protection in the United States and lack of subjective fear further undermines her submission in that respect. Asylum shopping is not consistent with a person who fears returning to their country simply for the fact of having been abroad.\nCONCLUSION\n[44] This claim is not credible. The claimant and her witness, XXXX, were inconsistent and vague throughout their testimony. The claimant's disposition to embellish aspects of this claim and her testimony severely undermined her credibility. She was not a credible witness, and neither was her mother. The claimant was not targeted by her cousin XXXX. The claimant's mother was not an employee of XXXX XXXX, and the claimant is not at risk through such an association. The claimant's failure to claim in the United States showed a lack of subjective fear that was adversely determinative and constituted an act of asylum shopping.\n[45] For these reasons, the claimant's fear is not well founded. The claimant does not face a serious possibility of persecution if she returned to Afghanistan. The claimant is not a Convention refugee. The claimant does not face a risk to her life, nor a risk of torture, nor cruel or unusual treatment or punishment. The claimant is not a person in need of protection. This claim is dismissed.\n(signed)\n\"D. McKeown\"\nD.

They allege they face persecution because of their religion, outlining several instances of discrimination in their Basis of Claim forms. They remained in Iraq until the principal claimant was threatened by Islamic extremists from an unknown group following an altercation at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimants used existing U.S.A. visas and continued on to Canada. They fear the persons who threatened them will kill or otherwise seriously harm them if they returned to Iraq.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] I find that the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor a persons in need of protection. My reasons are as follows.\nANALYSIS\n[5] While the panel had some credibility concerns with regard to the claim, it finds the determinative issues in this claim are state protection and subjective fear and objective risk.\nState Protection\n[6] The precipitating events that gave rise to the claimants leaving Iraq were an altercation with individuals at the principal claimant's workplace, followed by two phone-based threats, and an incident they believe is related where the claimants' son's car was run into by another car while driving. Accepting that these took place, the panel considered whether the presumption of state protection had been rebutted - have the claimants shown that the state would be unable or unwilling to protect them from the unknown assailants.\n[7] States are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens except in situations where the state is in a state of complete breakdown. The presumption that a state is capable of protecting its citizens underscores the principle that international protection comes into play only when a refugee claimant has no other recourse available.\n[8] While certain areas of Iraq are in a state of ongoing, protracted war, the KRI is distinguished throughout the documentation as unique. It maintains its own elected government, enforces restrictions on who can enter and remain in the region, and has its own security forces. In the panel's view, the KRI, who maintain the authorities to whom citizens of Iraq living in their region would turn to for protection, is not in a state of complete breakdown, and as such the claimants have the burden to rebut the presumption that state protection is available to them.\nState protection in KRI\n[9] The panel notes the documentary evidence referred to by the claimant's counsel refers to a UK home office report that states that the provision of effective state protection from non-state agents, such as those the claimants fear, is \"likely to be limited in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq\"3. In the panel's view, this does not suggest that state protection is not available, but rather that a careful consideration of the evidence is required. The panel notes the same sentence contrasts the situation in other areas of Iraq where protection is \"unlikely.\"\n[10] Many documents refer to the KRI as relatively safe or secure compared to other areas of Iraq. A recent report by the Danish Immigration Service4 speaks in great detail about the situation in the region. It notes that:\nThree sources emphasised that the Kurdish security apparatus is strong and to some extent able to foster a secure environment in KRI.123 In line with this, Journalist Osama Al Habahbeh, PAO\/KHRW informed that representatives of the security apparatus are present everywhere in KRI. Moreover, two sources said that ordinary citizens in KRI report on each other, for example based on suspicion of terrorist activities.124 One of these sources along with another source said that thanks to the well-established intelligence service, the Peshmerga forces and the Kurdish police forces are able to pursue their targets within KRI and other Kurdish controlled areas.125 In line with this, Human Rights Watch said that Kurdish parties in government126 and their affiliated forces, with the support of the coalition led by the United States, have generally been able to provide security to their own people from the Islamic State incursion, but that there is no effective protection of human rights in KRI.\n[11] The report goes on to state that5:\nVisiting Scholar Renad Mansour said that the Peshmerga has been effective in its own respective areas and that, within the Kurdish territory, the Peshmerga forces are able to target wanted groups. This perception was backed by an independent researcher who said that, to a larger extent, the Peshmerga forces and the Kurdish police forces are able to pursue their targets. According to Visiting Scholar Renad Mansour, there is an efficient intelligence service in KRI helped by taxi drivers among whom it is said that several of them are informants for the regime. Visiting Scholar Renad Mansour added that, outside KRI, in other Kurdish controlled areas, it gets more complicated to pursue targets and it is mainly possible in pro Kurdish pockets.\n[12] Further details from the same report confirm the information above, that there is a functioning police and security apparatus in the KRI6:\nHuman Rights Watch said that compared to south and central Iraq, the effectiveness in terms of law enforcement in KRI is higher. An international humanitarian organisation characterized law enforcement in KRI as exceptionally effective but said that it varies in other Kurdish controlled areas. The international humanitarian organisation added that law enforcement in Kirkuk is very effective but that, in some Peshmerga controlled areas outside KRI, there are many pockets with lack of law enforcement, especially in a westward direction of KRI towards Anbar.\nAccording to two sources, the Kurdish authorities have the potential to provide very effective security in the areas that they control.137 Being one of these sources, the international humanitarian organisation, however, stated that if Kurdish authorities do not want to protect an individual, they can also enforce that very effectively. Correspondingly, Journalist Osama Al Habahbeh said that the possibility to receive protection from KRI authorities depends on who the persecutor is. Journalist Osama Al Habahbeh explained that the authorities would not protect an individual in case the person had a conflict with a politician. In line with this, Human Rights Watch characterized the Kurdish court system as being under political influence and used to stifle dissent and target critical voices, including journalists.\nAccording to UNHCR, there is very little regard of law enforcement among the local population in KRI and people do not make use of the police or the courts. UNHCR said that the courts are not seen to respond, even though, in principle, they have a number of excellent laws meeting international standards. In addition, UNHCR explained that access to rule of law is dependent on ethnic and religious affiliation, tribe, connections, family and relatives, and it is very difficult, if not impossible, for an individual to stand up for his rights by himself.\n[13] The panel notes that other documentary evidence supports that security services have been able to provide a level of safety in the KRI and Erbil in particular that is not enjoyed in other areas of Iraq. For example, a recent response to information request states7:\nSeveral sources describe the current security situation in the city of Erbil as \"safe\" (Project Consultant 24 Jan. 2016; KRG 21 Jan. 2016; US 19 Jan. 2016). In a telephone interview with the Research Directorate, an official from the US Department of State who specializes in security in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq reported that \"most people enjoy a normal day; they go to work, go shopping and go out at night\" (ibid.). According to the same source, no major incident occurred in 2015 apart from the 17 April attack (see section 2) (ibid.). Similarly, in correspondence with the Research Directorate, a research fellow at the French Institute of the Near East (Institut fran\u00e7ais du Proche-Orient, Ifpo) in Erbil [1], who has published several articles on the history of the Kurdish people, reported that [translation] \"few violent incidents occurred in 2015\" (research fellow 19 Jan. 2016). On its \"Iraq Travel Warning\" webpage, the US Department of State indicates that \"[t]errorist attacks within the Iraqi Kurdistan Region (IKR) occur less frequently than in other parts of Iraq\" (US 4 Dec. 2015).\n[14] The panel finds that, while some evidence suggests there are some problems with access, the preponderance of evidence suggest that there is a functioning police and security system in the KRI.\n[15] The panel considered the claimant's testimony that they did not access protection as concrete barriers in front of police stations indicate that even police are afraid for their lives, and so are unable to protect citizens. The panel prefers the documentary evidence above, which indicates that police and security do respond to crime and security concerns within the region.\nOther factors\n[16] The panel went on to consider whether the claimant's personal circumstances suggest that protection would not be forthcoming. There is some evidence, as noted above, that protection can be variable based on personal or political connections. The panel has no evidence to suggest that the claimants hold political or personal connections that would either harm or help them access police services. Having considered the evidence, the panel finds that, while personal connections may aid in accessing police or security services, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that protection is unavailable for those who do not have such connections.\nProtection as Christians\n[17] The claimants are also Christian. As will be discussed, discrimination against Christians exists in the KRI. The panel considered whether their religion would result in protection not being forthcoming.\n[18] The above noted RIR includes a quote by a UN official that states8:\nHowever, the UNHCR representative stated that\n[l]aw enforcement agencies and the judiciary are reported to be prone to interference and the availability of effective protection may depend on the person's ethnicity, religion, as well as family, tribal or political connections. IDPs and refugees in the KR-I [Kurdistan Region of Iraq] would most often lack such connections or affiliations and as such lack access to effective recourse. Displaced persons (refugees and IDPs) may also be arbitrarily arrested, detained and deported based on security-related suspicions. (UN 26 Jan. 2016)\n[19] The Danish report states the following9:\nPAO\/KHRW explained that, as Saddam Hussein repressed the Kurds, the Kurds are now repressing minorities in their own region. Journalist Osama Al Habahbeh also referred to lack of protection of minority groups by authorities and said that it manifests itself in IDPs creating ghettos based on ethnic affiliation inside the camps and in other areas where they live. As an elaboration to this picture, Visiting Scholar Renad Mansour said that, traditionally, it has been more difficult for minorities to trust the Peshmerga, but, nevertheless, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) has been keen on showing that it protects minorities, especially Christians.\nAccording to Visiting Scholar Renad Mansour, measures are taken by Kurdish authorities in order to prevent incidents of disputes based on ethnic affiliation. In line with this, Human Rights Watch stated that, on a political level, the Kurds are trying to make room for minorities; for example, a seat for a Jewish representative has been added in the Ministry of Religious Affairs. Human Rights Watch also said that either the level of harassment is very low or the government is good at controlling it. ERC confirmed the ambition of the Kurdish authorities to prevent discrimination against minorities by stating that the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) does not differentiate between IDPs from different ethnic groups. Additionally, ERC outlined that in order to mitigate potential conflicts; ethnicity and religion of IDPs are not registered.\nAccording to UNHCR, the possibility to seek protection from the authorities in KRI and other Kurdish controlled areas in case of harassment based on religious and\/or ethnic affiliation, however, depends on the personal connections of the person in question. Correspondingly, Visiting Scholar Renad Mansour said that the Kurdish forces would protect Kurds before other minorities. Osama Al Habahbeh said that he expected that KRI authorities would offer protection to individuals in a private conflict irrespective of the individual's ethnicity.\n[20] The panel finds this and other evidence suggests that they may face difficulty in accessing police or security services because of their religion, but are distinguishable from internally displaced Christians or others who have additional barriers to protection which the claimants do not share. The preponderance of the evidence suggests that there may be difficulties, but that Christians are not precluded from obtaining protection from authorities.\nProtection against victims of extremist groups\n[21] The panel also takes into consideration the specific problem the claimants are facing - threats from unknown persons described as akin to ISIS, in their extremist and violent actions against minorities. The panel finds that the evidence suggests that security forces in KRI and Erbil appear to take the threat of ISIS and similar groups seriously. The above noted documents and many others before the panel outline many instances of Kurdish security forces have responded to such threats. The documentary evidence establishes that the region is close to where ISIS has held territory, and yet suffers from significantly lower levels of attacks from the group or other similar groups than the rest of the country. This indicates to the panel that security forces take seriously the threats from such groups.\n[22] The panel notes that there is evidence that it is not just explicitly ISIS, but also others who may be aligned or espouse the same views within the country that are subject to state intervention. The Danish report notes10:\nAccording to two sources, there are some religious clerics in KRI who are Islamic State sympathisers or even members.118 In line with this, an independent researcher said that during a period starting in 2014, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) began monitoring and controlling the curriculum of some religious schools where doctrines similar to the doctrines of Islamic State have been taught. The independent researcher explained how the concerned Islamic scholars and their followers have begun meeting behind closed doors.\nAsked about the risk of Islamic State sleeper cells in KRI and other Kurdish controlled areas, the Head of the General Security Directorate, Esmat Agurshi, answered that Asayish is following all suspicious groups. In case terrorist sleeper cells are discovered, the Asayish will not spend time to sort this out through the court system, but will take them out right away.\n[23] The claimants allege they were threatened by members of an Islamic group who were espousing violence. The panel finds that the actions of similar groups are reported to be monitored and of interest to security forces, such that, should an individual bring forward information about such a group or activities, it is more likely than not that police or security forces would take action to mitigate against violence espoused by or taken by the group or its members.\nClaimant's personal evidence\n[24] The claimants did not make any attempts to access protection in KRI. They did not report any of the incidents or threats to the authorities. As such, they have no personal evidence to suggest that they would not obtain protection should they request it.\nState Protection\n[25] As the panel has found that the documentary evidence does not evince a situation where adequate protection would not be forthcoming in their personal circumstances, and the claimants made no efforts to obtain protection from security forces in KRI prior to leaving Iraq, the panel finds the claimants have failed to rebut the presumption of state protection against the threats they received from an Islamic extremist group in Iraq.\nRisk of Harm as Christians\n[26] Having found the claimants did not rebut the presumption of state protection when it comes to the events that led them to leave, the panel considered whether they face persecution as Christians in any other manner that may be subject to a different state response. The panel finds the claimants do not have a well-founded fear of persecution as Christians in the KRI.\nSubjective Fear\n[27] While the claimants allege they faced discrimination prior to the events that led them to leave Iraq, they stated that they did not feel it was so serious as to require them to leave the country. Both claimants had travelled outside of the country and returned. The panel finds the claimants' statements and actions belie a subjective fear of return to Iraq based on the treatment they face as Christians prior to the alleged attacks.\nObjective Risk\n[28] The claimants described treatment they faced as Christians including being called bad names and being scared to wear certain clothing or attend church. However, they continued to be able to attend church, although allegedly with less frequency, had long-serving government employment from which they retired, and had housing.\n[29] Documentary evidence establishes that the situation in the KRI is clearly differentiated from other areas of Iraq. For example, the UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Asylum-Seekers from Iraq (Guidelines)11, under the risk profile religious minorities, cites the violence faced by such communities in areas of central and southern Iraq in particular Baghdad, Ninewa (Mosul and Ninewa Plains) and Kirkuk, and notes in contrast that in the Kurdistan Region, the rights of religious minorities are generally respected and groups can worship freely without interference. The KRG Ministry of Education funds public schools at the elementary and high school level in the Aramaic language. The curriculum in the Kurdistan Region does not contain religion or Qur'an studies. A significant number of religious minorities, in particular Christians, have sought refuge in the region.\n[30] While UNHCR \"considers that, depending on the particular circumstances of the case, members of minority religious groups in central and southern Iraq are likely to be in need of international refugee protection,\" they make no such statements about religious minorities (except for converts to Christianity) in the KRG area nor do they cite specific concerns for such groups.\n[31] With regards to Christians specifically, the UNHCR goes on to note that:\nIn the three northern governorates of Sulaymaniyah, Erbil and Dahuk, the rights of Christians are generally respected and a significant number have sought refuge in the region: in particular, in the Governorate of Dahuk, from where many originate, and the Christian town of Ainkawa, near the city of Erbil. In early December 2011, however, a mob allegedly shouting anti-Christian slogans reportedly attacked mainly Christian and Yazidi-owned liquor shops and businesses in and near the town of Zakho (Dahuk). The attacks were allegedly triggered by an inflammatory Friday prayer sermon condemning \"un-Islamic\" businesses. Reportedly, up to 30 liquor shops, hotels and a massage parlour were vandalized or burned down. An attempt to attack the Christian quarter in Zakho was reportedly prevented by the security forces. Affected shop owners reportedly found leaflets on the shop walls, threatening them if they were to reopen the shops. Motives for the violence remain unclear. In 2011 several kidnappings of Christians were reported in Ainkawa, spreading fear among the community and resulting in internally displaced Christian families fleeing abroad.\n[32] Documentary evidence supports that some discrimination and violence exists against Christians in Kurdistan. The most significant event appears to have been the incident in 2011 where Christian businesses were attacked in certain places.12 The government of the Kurdistan region later provided compensation to victims of this attack, and there does not appear to be reports of similar incidents13. According to a Response to Research Request:14\n\"Quoting the archbishop of the Armenian Church of America, the US International Religious Freedom Report for 2012 indicates that the KRG welcomed newly arrived Christians and that Christians were \"'comfortable'\" in the Kurdistan Region (US 20 May 2013, 11). The same report indicates that there have been reports of government abuses of religious freedom but that the KRG generally respects religious freedom (ibid., 6).\"\n[33] Evidence also shows that Christians and others from neighboring regions have fled to Kurdistan region over many years. Such internally displaced persons have been accepted into Kurdistan and supported by the Kurdistan regional authorities, with acknowledged limitations that appear largely due to their capacity to provide support to such large groups of persons.15 Documents largely suggest the problems for Christian and other IDPs to Kurdistan relate to finding accommodation, jobs, and other such issues, although security is also mentioned.16 The documents establish in the panel's mind that the situation is different in the Kurdistan region than other areas or Iraq. There are some reports of violence, but it is not widespread or common. Christians hold office,17 attend places of worship, and have been welcomed and offered protection from other areas of Iraq.\n[34] The panel finds the claimants faced discrimination, as other Christians similarly face in Kurdistan region in Iraq. Discrimination must amount to serious harm in order to amount to persecution, and an individualized assessment is necessary. While the concept of persecution is not defined in IRPA, serious harm is generally accepted to be when a denial of a core human right is engaged. The Supreme Court has defined the concept of persecution as a \"sustained or systemic violation of basic human rights demonstrative of a failure of state protection.\"18 The panel finds this is not the case for the claimants. They failed to rebut the presumption of state protection regarding the most serious of the problems they faced, and other difficulties did not result in a core human right being denied - they were able to attend school, find and maintain government employment, have housing, and attend their place of worship. The discrimination they and others face is certainly wrong and problematic, but is not, in the view of the panel, serious enough to amount to persecution.\n[35] The panel notes that many of the references in the documents referred to by counsel for the claimants in her submissions do not distinguish between the situation for Christians in Iraq in general and the situation in the KRI. The panel prefers the evidence that speaks directly to the situation in the KRI to that which does not make this distinction.\n[36] Upon thorough review of the evidence, the panel finds that the situation reported in the documents and by the claimants is not such on a balance of probabilities that the claimants, as Christians, would face more than a mere possibility of persecution, or that they would likely face a danger of torture, risk to life, or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nCONCLUSION\n[37] There is not a serious possibility of persecution and the claimants would not be subjected personally, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture, should they return to Iraq. Accordingly, the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n[38] The claims are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"K. Pike\"\nK.

Kung (documents only)\nConseil du (de la) ministre\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nALLEGATIONS\n[1] The claimants state that they are citizens of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The claimants fear returning to DRC due to their real or imputed political opinions.\n[2] The claimants state that XXXX XXXX XXXX, the husband of the principal claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX, and father of the minor claimants, was kidnapped by Congolese authorities in XXXX, 2013, due to his political membership in the Christian\nDemocratic Party.\n[3] The claimants arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2015, and made a refugee claim XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. They allege that the government of DRC will arrest them if they were to return to DRC. The claimants state that they would not be able to receive protection from the state in DRC, and that there is no safe place for them anywhere in DRC.\nClaimants' Identities\n[4] The claimants have provided three Angolan passports1. These are the passports the claimants travelled with to reach Canada. The claimants all state that the Angolan passports were improperly obtained, and that none of the claimants are citizens of Angola. The principal claimant XXXX XXXX has provided her voter's card (carte d'\u00e9lecteur] from the DRC2. She has also provided a replacement marriage certificate3, and her school records4. The documentary evidence5 indicates that the Congolese voter's card is regarded as the most common reliable document to prove one's identity in the DRC.\n[5] The principal claimant presented her membership card in the Christian Democratic (CD) Party6. The CD membership card contained the photo of the principal claimant and was issued in 2012, before the principal claimant left the DRC. She stated that it was sent to her by her brother-in-law after she had arrived in Canada.\n[6] On a balance of probabilities, the principal claimant XXXX XXXX is more likely a citizen of DRC than not. The panel accepts that the claimant is who she says he is.\n[7] The minor claimants XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX presented Congolese birth certificates7 and Angolan passports8. According to the claimants themselves, the passports are authentic passports issued by the government of Angola. The claimants maintain that their passports were improperly issued to the claimants because the claimants are not citizens of Angola and are therefore not legitimately entitled to passports from Angola.\n[8] The claimants provided an affidavit9 from XXXX XXXX XXXX, a relative by marriage of the principal claimant. In the affidavit, the deponent asserts that XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX are citizens of the DRC. The basis for this conclusion is not explained, nor is any evidence advanced that the deponent has any personal knowledge of the citizenship of the minor claimants. There is no explanation in the affidavit of how long the affiant has known or indeed if she knows the minor claimants. Ms. XXXX did not testify and was therefore not available to give details about her knowledge of the minor claimants and their citizenship. The affidavits of Ms. XXXX and her husband Mr. XXXX10 were of little assistance to the panel in establishing the identities of the minor claimants.\n[9] The minor claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX presented a Congolese birth certificate11 and an Angolan passport12. The affidavit13 from XXXX XXXX XXXX purports to identify Ms. XXXX as a citizen of Angola. There was no evidence before the panel as to whether XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is one and the same person as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX The panel assumes and accepts that it was the intention of the deponent to identify the same person. For the same reasons as given in the case of the minor claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the evidence is not convincing that XXXX XXXX has established her citizenship.\n[10] The panel analyzed the birth certificates, as well as the commentary provided by the Canada Border Services Agency14. The birth certificates are of questionable origin. The certificates are not duplicates of documents issued concurrent with the birth of the minor claimants. Instead, they are documents issued in 2015 without the minor claimants or either of their parents being present. The evidence is that no supporting documents were provided to the issuing authority to confirm the identities of the minor claimants. The documents appear to have been issued to the uncle of the minor claimants based on his declarations alone.\n[11] The birth certificates bear a number of anomalies which the claimants were unable to explain. There are superfluous punctuation marks; there are improper capitalizations of words that should not be capitalized in French; there are accents missing where the French language ought to be spelled correctly, and the documents contain changes of fonts in the middle of the documents. The claimants were unable to explain any of these abnormalities. The panel did not accept the documents as authentic, and the birth certificates were given no weight.\n[12] Section 106 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act) states:\nThe Refugee Protection Division must take into account, with respect to the credibility of a claimant, whether the claimant possesses acceptable documentation establishing identity, and if not, whether they have provided a reasonable explanation for the lack of documentation or have taken reasonable steps to obtain the documentation.\n[13] Similarly, Section 11 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules (the Rules) requires that:\nThe claimant must provide acceptable documents establishing identity and other elements of the claim. A claimant who does not provide acceptable documents must explain why they were not provided and what steps were taken to provide them.\n[14] The minor claimants were unable to provide any reliable documentation relating them to the DRC. They did not provide school records, birth records, or copies of any medical or pharmacy receipts. On a balance of probabilities, the minor claimants XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX are more likely citizens of Angola than citizens of the DRC.\nCredibility\n[15] The determinative issue in this claim is the credibility of the claimants.\n[16] There is a presumption that the sworn testimony of a claimant is true unless there are reasons to doubt it. In assessing the credibility of these claimants, the panel sought explanations for the numerous inconsistencies and contradictions in the evidence.\n[17] The principal claimant stated that she had lost a number of identity documents when her house was ransacked on XXXX XXXX, 2013. She and her children fled from the house and never returned there to look for any documents.\n[18] The principal claimant XXXX XXXX stated that she was born on XXXX XXXX, 1969. She did not know if a birth certificate had been issued to her parents at her birth. She had never been in possession of a passport from the DRC. She obtained a birth certificate15 which was issued in 2015 while she was living in the United States. The birth certificate was obtained by her brother-in-law, who did not have any identity documents of the principal claimant in support of his application for her new birth certificate. The claimant did not know what process had been followed to obtain her birth certificate or the birth certificates of her children. She did not know who had issued the birth certificates.\n[19] The principal claimant gave contradictory answers on whether she had previously had a birth certificate. At first, she stated that the 2015 birth certificate was not her first birth certificate, but she could not be certain that any birth certificate had ever been issued prior to 2015.\n[20] The principal claimant stated that she received her marriage certificate16 and her voter's card17 from her brother-in-law while she was in the United States in XXXX, 2015. The claimant stated that she was married in 1993, but her marriage certificate was dated 2010. She was unable to produce an original or a duplicate of her original marriage certificate. She stated that she obtained the voter's card in XXXX, 2011. She explained that it was not destroyed or stolen in the 2013 ransacking of her house because she had left it with her mother.\n[21] The principal claimant's marriage certificate18 (Certificat de marriage) was issued on XXXX XXXX, 2010. Curiously, the marriage certificate does not indicate a date of marriage. The claimant testified that she and her husband were married in 1993. The panel attributed no weight to the marriage certificate, as it was not issued contemporaneously with the marriage, nor did it indicate a date of marriage.\n[22] The principal claimant completed an application form to join the CD party in XXXX, 201219. On her application form, she listed her residence address as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, in the XXXX suburb of Kinshasa. This was consistent with the address found on her voter's card20, which was issued in XXXX, 2011. The address in XXXX XXXX was inconsistent, however, with the address given in her Schedule A21. In Schedule A, the claimant stated that she resided at XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX of 2005 to XXXX of 2014.\n[23] The principal claimant was asked why she had provided different addresses to the Canadian authorities from what she had provided to the Congolese authorities. The claimant replied that XXXX XXXX was the actual place of residence, whereas XXXX XXXX was the address of the family compound. The question was repeated, as the question was simply where the claimant had resided in the period 2011-2012, and which of the answers she had given previously was correct. The claimant could provide no coherent explanation as to why she gave the wrong residential address to Congolese authorities as to where she was living at the time her voter's card and her CD party membership card were issued. The panel drew a negative inference as to the credibility of the principal claimant.\n[24] The principal claimant testified that her mother had eleven children. She was asked why her Basis of Claim form (BOC) only disclosed one sister, one half-brother and one half-sister. The claimant stated that it only came into her mind to write three names. She stated that it was not necessary to write down the other names. The panel rejects this explanation, as it was clear that the claimant was required to answer all questions completely. The claimant declared on page 10 of her BOC that the information provided was complete, correct and true. The testimony of the claimant and the identity card of her mother proved that the information provided by the principal claimant was not complete with respect to the composition of her family, and yet she had signed the BOC and confirmed at the outset of the hearing that the BOC was complete, exact, and correct. The principal claimant's explanation that it was not necessary to write down the names of all her siblings detracted from her credibility. The panel concluded that the testimony of the principal claimant was unreliable.\n[25] The principal claimant was asked why her mother's national identity card22 declares a different father (XXXX, born in 1966) to the claimant than the father declared in her BOC (XXXX XXXX XXXX, born in 1938)23. The claimant was unable to provide an explanation. The failure to explain detracted from the credibility of the principal claimant.\n[26] The claimant identified herself as being the second child listed on her mother's identity card. The second entry under the children born to her mother appears to read XXXX XXXX XXXX-6? (last number illegible). The claimant was asked why her mother's identity card would indicate a different birth date (XXXX XXXX) than the birth date declared by the claimant (XXXX XXXX). The panel noted that the voter's card24 indicated that her birth date is XXXX XXXX, 1969. She repeated her contention that she was born on XXXX XXXX, 1969, but was unable to explain why her mother's national identity card would not have the same date of birth for the claimant, her second child. The panel could not rely on the claimant's testimony as being truthful, as it contradicted the documentary evidence, and as the discrepancy remained unsatisfactorily explained. The inability of the principal claimant to reconcile these contradictory documents undermined her credibility.\n[27] The principal claimant told the psychologist25 that her husband was kidnapped by the Congolese authorities as he attended a political meeting on XXXX XXXX, 2013. In her BOC narrative, however, the claimant had stated that her husband was kidnapped on XXXX XXXX, 2013. The claimant was asked why she had provided different dates for the kidnapping to the psychologist than she had provided in her BOC. She insisted that she had not told the psychologist that her husband was kidnapped on XXXX XXXX, and she said that it was on XXXX XXXX that soldiers had come to her house and kidnapped her husband and three of her children. These inconsistencies detracted from both the usefulness of the psychological report and the claimant's testimony.\n[28] The claimants all crossed into Cabinda, Angola in XXXX of 2014. They state that they had no identity documents when they crossed the border into Cabinda. They received a laissez-passer from the Congolese soldiers at the border. They did not produce the laissez-passer at the hearing.\n[29] The claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX testified. The panel was cognizant of the fact that the lad was only 15 years old when the claim was begun but, given the fact that his mother had suffered a stroke, and that she tired easily, it was deemed essential by the claimants, their lawyer and the Designated Representative that the testimony of the minor claimant XXXX ought to be heard.\n[30] XXXX testified that he attended \u00c9cole XXXX (phonetic) in Kinshasa. He stated that he completed grade 6 at age thirteen, and that his grade teacher was Mr. XXXX. He provided no documentation to link him to his school or to having resided in the DRC. The testimony of XXXX XXXX did not assist the panel in arriving at the truth of what happened to the family in Congo. The minor claimant XXXX XXXX was unable to explain the many inconsistencies in the testimony of his mother XXXX XXXX.\nPsychological report\n[31] The claimants also provided a psychological report in which the principal claimant was consulted and was assessed by a psychologist26. According to the psychological report, the claimant told the psychologist that there were eight children in her family, i.e. that she had seven siblings. The panel asked the claimant why she had declared to the tribunal that her parents had eleven children while she only told the psychologist that her parents had had eight children. The claimant did not remember giving a different number of siblings to the psychologist than she had declared in her BOC.\n[32] Also in the psychologist's report, the claimant had stated to the psychologist that she could not rely on her relatives for help because all of them had moved to provinces other than Kinshasa. The claimant was then asked why she had declared in her BOC that the three siblings which she had listed there were stated to be residents of Kinshasa when the information given to the psychologist was that they had all moved away. The claimant had no explanation for having provided different information to different persons at different times. The panel concluded that the claimant was not telling the truth, and her credibility was thereby negatively affected.\nMinister's intervention\n[33] The Minister intervened on October 29th, 2015, with a document analysis report27. The report consisted of an examination and analysis of the three birth certificates of the three claimants. The birth certificate of the principal claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX was issued on XXXX XXXX, 2015. As previously discussed, the birth certificates were issued in Congo in their absence, and without any supporting documentation, and apparently based solely on the words of XXXX XXXX XXXX, the principal claimant's brother-in-law. At page 4 of exhibit 8, the Minister noted a number of alleged anomalies in the birth certificate of the claimant, including capitalized letters in the middle of sentences, words missing accents (example ete instead of \"\u00e9t\u00e9\" and donnee instead of \"donn\u00e9e\". There is also a word at the beginning which ought to have been capitalized, and a double comma in the middle of the document. The Minister has submitted the conclusion of its analyst28 that the document is apocryphal, meaning that its authenticity is uncertain.\n[34] The name of the officer who performed the documents analysis is listed on page 2 of Exhibit 8. The qualifications or expertise of the analyst are not given, especially with regard to the analyst's knowledge of alleged grammatical errors in the French language. There is no analysis per se, that is no explanation as to what the alleged errors might be. No analyst testified to having performed the examination of the document or as to why certain alleged anomalies were highlighted. In the absence of such information, the panel did not base its conclusions as to whether the birth certificates of the claimants were authentic on the report of the Minister's representative. The panel used common sense and its knowledge of the French language to note several irregularities in the birth certificates, which were not accepted as authentic. The claimants were unable to explain the anomalies, having not been present themselves at the issuance of these documents, as they were then residing in the United States.\n[35] The principal claimant was also asked to explain why her birth certificate, which was issued on XXXX XXXX, 2015, had a higher serial number (XXXX) than the birth certificate of the minor claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX, (serial number XXXX) which was issued on XXXX XXXX, 2015. The claimants were unable to explain this anomaly. Given the numerous uncertainties with respect to the birth certificates, the panel can give no weight to the said documents as establishing the identities of the claimants.\nDocumentary evidence\n[36] The principal claimants presented a voter's card (carte d'\u00e9lecteur)29 from the DRC. According to the NDP (National Documentation Package), the voter's card is regarded as reliable proof of Congolese citizenship30.\n[37] The claimants also presented an article31 indicating that XXXX XXXX XXXX, the usband of the principal claimant and father of the minor claimants, was kidnapped and disappeared on XXXX XXXX, 2013. While the article clearly states that Mr. XXXX was arrested by the authorities, that he is affiliated with the opposition Christian Democratic Party, that he made a speech that was critical of the government, and that his whereabouts are unknown, there is no reference to any risk to family members which would corroborate the allegations of the claimants. In light of the numerous credibility problems raised by the contradictory and inconsistent testimony of the claimants, and given the submission of questionable documents by these claimants, as outlined above, the panel cannot find that this article in and of itself substantiates the alleged risk to the claimants.\nPsychological assessment\n[38] The panel has taken note of the mental health assessment of the principal claimant carried out by Dr. XXXX XXXX, a doctor pf psychology32. Dr. XXXX has concluded that the principal claimant suffers from severe depression and severe anxiety. The panel does not dispute the conclusion, but there could be many reasons for the symptoms reported by the claimant to her assessor. There is no clear connection between the violence alleged to have been committed against the family of the principal claimant and her depression and her anxiety. As seen above, the principal claimant's inability to tell her psychological assessor a story consistent with the story told to the panel undermines her credibility.\n[39] As stated in Danailov33, with respect to the assessment of a physician's evidence and the question of the assessment of credibility, \"that opinion evidence is only as valid as the truth of the facts on which it is based.\" Given the multiple findings of lack of credibility, the panel was unable to attribute any weight to the psychological report.\nPersons in need of protection - Section 97\n[40] Having rejected the claim of the principal claimant under Section 96, the panel must assess the claim on the basis of Section 97 of the Act. In order to establish their claims under Section 97, the claimants must establish that that there are substantial grounds to believe that they would be tortured, or at risk of losing their lives or be subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if they returned to their home country.\n[41] The panel assessed whether, on a balance of probabilities, should the claimants be returned to the Congo, they would be in danger of torture, or a risk to their lives or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. Given the findings of lack of credibility, the panel finds that it is more probable than not that the claimants would not face a danger of torture, or a risk to their lives, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, if they were to return to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The panel therefore rejects these claims under Sections 97 of the Act.\nCONCLUSION\n[42] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, and on the basis of the totality of documentary evidence disclosed, as well as on the basis of findings and negative inferences noted above, that the minor claimants have not established their identities, nor have they satisfied the panel that they are citizens of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Even if the panel is wrong on the determinative question of identity, the panel also finds that the minor claimants have not provided credible and trustworthy evidence to support a well-founded claim of persecution in Congo (DRC).\n[43] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel determines that the claimants have not established that there is a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground or that, on a balance of probabilities, they would personally be subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if they were to return to DRC.\n[44] The panel therefore concludes that the claimants XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, are not Convention Refugees, nor are they persons in need of protection, and the Division rejects their claims.\n(signed)\n\"R.

He worked as a XXXX for XXXX bank. He reports that he received calls and letters from the Taliban threatening to kill him if he did not quit his job. He reports that on XXXX XXXX, 2014 his car was being followed by another car. He sped up and lost control of his car and crashed. He also alleges that his former fianc\u00e9's family threatened him because they are Pashtun and he is Hazara.\n[3] He travelled to the United States to study in XXXX 2014. He made an asylum claim there in XXXX 2015. That claim was still pending when he travelled to Canada and made a claim at the border on XXXX XXXX, 2016.\n[4] The claimant provided packages of documents in support of his claim.3 These included several documents corroborating his employment and education, a police document regarding the XXXX 2014 accident, a psychiatric report, a letter from his former fianc\u00e9 and an affidavit from himself. An affidavit from his mother4 was presented later. Counsel also provided a copy of the claimant's application for asylum in the United States including a draft of the narrative he was preparing with his counsel there but had not yet filed.5\n[5] The Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada intervened in writing alleging that the claimant's delay in making an asylum claim in the United States and the abandonment of that claim are indications of a lack of subjective fear and inconsistent with his allegations.\n[6] The claimant testified at the hearing. The claimant's mother was present at the start of the hearing but only for the purpose of support for the claimant. Because the Panel was considering calling her as a witness, she was excluded during the claimant's testimony. She was not called as a witness.6\nDETERMINATION\n[7] The Panel finds that the claimant is not a Convention refugee. The determinative issue is credibility.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[8] The claimant presented the Afghan passport he had used to travel to Canada. The Panel finds this document sufficient to establish the personal identity and nationality of the claimant.\nCredibility\n[9] The onus is on the person making a refugee claim to present evidence that is credible, on a balance of probabilities, to support the allegations which form the basis of their claim. Statements given under oath are presumed to be true. That presumption can be rebutted by contradictions or inconsistencies in the evidence.7 As the decision on a refugee claim is made after an oral hearing, the Panel's assessment of the credibility of the claimant's evidence includes a consideration of how the claimant testified at the hearing.\n[10] In this case, the Panel finds that the claimant has not met the onus of presenting credible evidence to support the allegations which form the basis of his claim.\n[11] There were several points where the claimant's evidence lacked credibility. These included significant differences between the allegations set out in the narrative filed with his Basis of Claim form in Canada and the statement drafted to submit with his United States asylum claim; inconsistent evidence regarding the death of his father and inconsistent evidence regarding the XXXX 2014 incident. The claimant's delay in making his claim in the United States and later abandoning that claim to file this claim in Canada also raise questions of the credibility of his allegations of risk in Afghanistan.\nUnited States asylum claim documents\n[12] The draft narrative8 the claimant had prepared for submission in his asylum claim in the United States before coming to Canada contains one aspect which differs from the claim made in Canada, two which were left out of the Canadian version and one major omission of another aspect which is a significant basis of his claim in Canada.\n[13] The earlier narrative gives the claimant's ethnicity as Tajik in both the application form itself and in the draft narrative. In his Canadian refugee claim he alleges that he is Hazara. In fact the claimant's ethnicity is presented in his Canadian claim as one of the reasons he fears returning to Afghanistan. Specifically, he alleges that his former fianc\u00e9e's relatives are going to kill him because they are Pashtun and they objected to the marriage. When asked by the Panel why he had not mentioned this aspect of his claim in his previous narrative, the claimant stated that he did not tell his American lawyer because it was personal. He was unable to explain why he told his counsel here in Canada. The letter presented as being from his former fianc\u00e9 does state that her relatives were going to kill the claimant because of their objections to the marriage. The Panel noted that the letter was dated only two weeks before the hearing. It stated that even though the writer and the claimant had separated, her family would still kill him. The Panel asked the claimant when he and his fianc\u00e9 had ended the engagement as this detail was not provided in his narrative or the letter. The question had to be asked twice before the claimant, after a long pause stated that he \"would say it was XXXX 2014.\" The Panel finds this vagueness troubling and notes that the letter writer was not presented to answer questions about it.\n[14] The claimant also alleges that his ethnicity generally puts him at risk due to treatment of the Hazara minority by majority Pashtuns. At the end of counsel's submissions, during which she made no reference to evidence supporting the claimant's alleged Hazara ethnicity, the Panel asked her to address this issue. She submitted that the claimant's ethnicity could be identified by his appearance and speech. There was no explanation as to how the claimant's appearance and speech identified him as Hazara aside from vague statements from the claimant. The Panel is not an expert on what speech or appearance markers would identify the claimant as Hazara and therefore cannot make the finding he is Hazara based merely on his appearance or speech.\n[15] Considering the claimant's general lack of credibility, his contradictory allegation regarding his ethnicity in his United States claim, and the absence of any mention of the harm he feared due to his ethnicity in that claim including the specific harm alleged to be coming from his fianc\u00e9's family, the Panel finds that the allegation of Hazara ethnicity is an embellishment added to provide an additional basis of claim which was in actuality an invention. The obvious answer to why he did not include the allegations regarding his former fianc\u00e9 in the previous narrative in his United States claim is because when he made that claim he was alleging a different ethnicity. This is a significant change in the claimant's allegations and making the change impugns his credibility.\n[16] In earlier narrative the claimant alleges that after requests from the Taliban to assist them in making a suicide attack on customers at the bank he was visited by three people who made the same request in person. On the draft of the narrative there is a note, apparently from his American attorney stating that this part of his story was a problem and that his failure to report this approach by the Taliban put other people's lives in danger. The narrative the claimant filed in Canada made no mention of this part of his story. His explanation at the hearing was that he left it out because he did not have proof. The Panel noted that he did not have specific proof of other aspects of his story but yet included them and therefore does not accept the claimant's explanation as reasonable. This omission from his Canadian narrative impugns the claimant's credibility.\n[17] In the American narrative, the claimant alleges that his father was killed in an attack by the Taliban.9 The narrative he filed with his Canadian claim, while referring to the death of his father and citing the resulting need to support his family as the reason why he had to work at a job that put him at risk, makes no mention of the circumstances of his father's death. The death certificate filed with the supporting documents10 gives the cause of death as a heart attack. An affidavit filed eleven days before the first sitting of the hearing into the claim repeats the allegation that the claimant's father was killed in an attack by the Taliban but that he had told his mother it was a heart attack to spare her feelings, that in the circumstance it would be too great a shock to her. At the hearing, the claimant testified that his mother still did not know the true cause of death of her late husband. Considering that the claimant had initially had his mother present in the hearing room for support and she was only excluded by the Panel because she may be called to give testimony to corroborate the claimant's allegations, the Panel asked how he was planning to deal with his mother hearing about the true cause of his father's death. His answer was that if the Panel asked questions about his father's death he would ask his mother to leave. The Panel pointed out that once the question was asked his mother would already know and it would be too late to ask her to leave. The claimant then stated that he did not know the question would be asked. Considering that the claimant knew that there were inconsistencies between his mother's narrative and his on this issue and had filed an affidavit to address the inconsistencies and considering that he had initially left this part of his previous narrative out of his current narrative, the Panel does not find the various explanations from the claimant on this point reasonable and this inconsistency further impugns his credibility.\nXXXX 2014 incident\n[18] The claimant alleged in his narrative that on XXXX XXXX, 2014 his car was followed by another car containing two people. In the course of trying to elude the other car, the claimant crashed his car into a statue and the car following him drove off.11 He testified that he believes that the people in the other car were Taliban and were going to attack him. He presented a document which he testified is a copy of the report he made to police regarding the incident. The Panel pointed out to the claimant that the report made no mention of a car following him nor who he believed was in that car and that, according to the report, he had a collision with another car, again, with no mention of crashing into a statue. The claimant, in response, testified that after he crashed into the statue, he was hit by the car mentioned in the report. When the Panel asked why he did not include the alleged Taliban car following him in the report, he testified that he did not mention it because he did not have any proof. The Panel then asked what he was hoping to achieve by reporting to the police but leaving out the most important detail. He replied that he wanted the police to investigate the people who were following him. He then testified that he had told the police about the car following him. The Panel reminded the claimant of his testimony of a moment previous when he had said that he had not told the police because he did not have any proof. He then restated that he had mentioned it to the police. Later in the hearing, in reply to questions from his counsel, the claimant testified that the police had written down his statement and then he signed it but he did not read it before signing. The statement presented in the alleged police report runs less than six lines and therefore would take seconds to read. Aside from the obvious evolution and contradiction in the claimant's testimony regarding the XXXX 2014 incident and the document presented to corroborate it, the Panel finds this final explanation - that he did not read the report to police - particularly absurd. The Panel finds that the claimant did not report being followed by the Taliban to the police. The Panel finds that in light of the credibility issues with the evidence regarding this incident, on a balance of probabilities, the incident likely did not occur or at the very minimum did not have anything to do with the alleged targeting by the Taliban. It was simply a car accident which the claimant tried to embellish into something more.\nSubjective Fear\nDelay claiming in the United States\n[19] The claimant arrived in the United States in XXXX 2014. He did not make a refugee claim until XXXX 2015. The claimant was asked by the Panel why he waited, since his allegation was that the alleged incident in XXXX 2014 and the looming threat from his then fianc\u00e9's family were the primary reasons he had fled Afghanistan - the student visa was a means to that end. He testified that he had received advice from friends who told him if he made an asylum claim his student visa would be cancelled. The Panel asked if he was concerned about being able to stay in the United States, why not consult an attorney. He replied that he did not know the law. This explanation for the claimant's delay is not reasonable since, as was pointed out to the claimant when he gave it, rationally, not knowing something is the reason one makes inquiries. It is not an excuse for not making inquiries. The Panel finds that the claimant's delay in making a claim in the United States is more consistent with an intention which was primarily to go there to study and that it was the asylum claim which was collateral to that intention rather than the other way around as alleged by the claimant.\nAbandoning US claim\n[20] On XXXX XXXX, 2016 the claimant arrived at a port of entry and was permitted to enter Canada and make a refugee claim as an exception to the safe third country agreement between Canada and the United States because his mother was living here. His claim in the United States was still outstanding and, through his attorney, he terminated that claim. At the hearing, he explained that he had come to Canada abandoning his United States claim because his mother needed his help here. This explanation is consistent with the affidavit filed by his mother in this claim where she alleges that her family here is not willing to help her. This explanation, however, is inconsistent with her previous behaviour when, in XXXX 2015, she gained entry into Canada based on having relatives here to support her, to make a refugee claim in Canada rather than in the United States where she was visiting the claimant, her son.\n[21] The Panel asked why his mother had not made a claim in the United States if she needed his support. His replied that he did not have a house or job in the United States so he could not support his mother so she came to Canada where she has family. He went on to state that in Canada, it was the Canadian government who helped his mother. The Panel does not find it credible that the claimant abandoned his asylum claim in the U.S. to come to Canada to help his mother; who had declined to make a claim when she was with him ten months previously, because she preferred to make a claim in Canada. The Panel asked the claimant if he felt he was at risk of harm in the United States and he replied that he was not. Considering the totality of the circumstances, the Panel agrees with the submission of the Minister that this is a case of asylum shopping - the claimant would prefer, based on his mother's experience, to make a claim in Canada, and this is inconsistent with having a genuine fear and thus undermines the credibility of his claim.\nCONCLUSION\n[22] Considering the totality of the evidence and the credibility and subjective fear findings set out above, the Panel finds that the claimant has established that he is a citizen of Afghanistan. He has not established by evidence, which is credible on a balance of probabilities, that he has been targeted by the Taliban in the past and therefore faces more than a mere possibility of being sought by them on his return to Afghanistan. The Panel finds that the claimant's alleged Hazara ethnicity was more likely than not an invention for the purposes of strengthening his claim and that therefore the claimant faces no risk due to his ethnicity. The Panel acknowledges that there is some evidence that other employees of the XXXX bank have been targeted by various factions in Afghanistan but does not find that the situation is such that merely being a former employee of the XXXX bank causes a person to be at a reasonable chance of persecution in accordance with section 96 of IRPA.\n[23] Regarding any claim to be a person in need of protection in accordance with section 97 of IRPA, the Panel finds that the same credibility findings apply to a claim under that section. The claimant has not established by evidence credible on a balance of probabilities that he has been or will be personally targeted and therefore faces a risk of harm as set out in that section, also on a balance, on his return to Afghanistan. In the absence of such personalized targeting, the general lawlessness and instability in Afghanistan would be a matter of generalized risk.\n[24] The Panel has found that core allegations have been invented and that the claimant has been \"attempting to gain refugee protection through falsehood\" which \"go(es) to an important part of the refugee claim\"12 the Panel finds that this is a manifestly unfounded claim in accordance with s 108.1 of IRPA.\n(signed)\n\" David Young \"\nDavid Young\nJanuary 6, 2017\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96, 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b).\n2 Exhibit 2.\n3 Exhibit 4.\n4 Exhibit 8.\n5 Exhibit 7.\n6 Further discussion of the significance of this below.\n7 Maldonado v.

It had been indicated in the Basis of Claim forms (BOCs)3 of the minor claimant that she is relying on the BOC narrative of the principal claimant4.\n[3] The principal claimant was appointed designated representative for the minor claimant after confirming at the hearing that she understood and accepted the role and responsibilities.\n[4] The claimants' claims are based on their alleged risk of harm from XXXX XXXX, the principal claimant's husband and minor claimant's father. It is alleged that Mr. XXXX physically and emotionally abused both claimants, in particular the principal claimant, and that he was also sexually abusive towards her during the course of their marriage.\n[5] It is alleged that the claimants allege to have fled the family home that they shared with Mr. XXXX in XXXX 2014 and stayed in an apartment owned by the principal claimant's mother until they were able to travel to the United States (US) in XXXX 2015, using US visitor's visas they obtained a few weeks prior to their departure. The claimants did not seek protection in the US and shortly after their arrival sought protection in Canada at the port of entry (POE) as family exceptions to the Safe Third Country Agreement.\nVULNERABLE PERSON APPLICATION\n[6] An application5 was filed to have the principal claimant designated a vulnerable person, with the requested accommodations being a female panel and interpreter and reverse order of questioning. This application was refused6 due to lack of supporting documentation however two of the accommodations were granted: a female panel and interpreter. A second application was made accompanied by a psychotherapist's report7, however the application was refused again8 as the evidence was not found to establish the need for a vulnerable person designation. At the outset of the first sitting, in a prehearing conference, the panel canvassed whether there was any new evidence related to the claimant's psychological state to consider in relation to the vulnerable person applications that were filed. There was nothing new in this regard, however in discussing whether reverse order of questioning would assist the principal claimant in providing her testimony, the panel agreed to this additional accommodation.\n[7] The hearing proceeded with a female panel and female interpreter and with the claimants' counsel leading questioning.\n[8] Given the issues presented in the allegations, the panel considered the Chairperson's Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender Related Persecution (the Guidelines)9 and as such, made efforts to create a relaxed environment for the principal claimant and to question her in a sensitive manner about her experiences. The panel also considered the Guidelines in its assessment of the principal claimant's credibility.\nDETERMINATION\n[9] The panel finds that the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. The panel's reasons are as follows.\nANALYSIS\n[10] The determinative issue in the assessment of these claims is credibility.\nIdentity\n[11] The identity of the principal and minor claimants and their citizenship as nationals of Jordan have been established by the testimony and supporting documentation provided, including copies of their Jordanian passports10.\n[12] The claimants' family relationship as mother and daughter set out by the principal claimant's name being listed as mother in the minor claimant's previously mentioned passport as well as in her birth certificate and baptism certificate11.\n[13] The principal claimant has also established her identity as a national of Iraq by her testimony and supporting documentation, including the copy of her Iraqi passport.12 The panel notes that as the principal claimant is an Iraqi citizen, the minor claimant has also acquired Iraqi citizenship, pursuant to Article 3 of the Iraqi Nationality Law.13\nCredibility\n[14] In assessing credibility, the panel is mindful of the principal claimant's education, and background. The panel notes that she is a 30-year-old married mother of one. She is university educated, with a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX14 and more than two years of work experience outside of the home as an XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.15\n[15] The panel considered as well the report from the registered psychotherapist XXXX XXXX16 filed in support of the claim. The panel notes that the report, dated XXXX 1, 2015, is based on the principal claimant's self-reporting during a one-time interview of unspecified length (although it was noted that such assessments typically extend 60-90 minutes). The interview was conducted with the assistance of an Arabic interpreter. Based on this interview, Ms. XXXX notes that the principal claimant exhibits symptoms consistent with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[16] While the panel accepts the psychotherapist's clinical impression that the principal claimant exhibits symptoms consistent with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, given that the report is based on information provided by the principal claimant, the panel finds the report to be of little probative value in corroborating the principal claimant's allegations.\n[17] The panel notes that Ms. XXXX did not appear to testify in support of the claimants or to be cross-examined on her report. The panel also notes that in this report, under the heading Clinical Impression, Ms. XXXX states, \"I believe that returning to Jordan or Iraq, where Ms. XXXX and XXXX will likely face discrimination, danger, and significant trauma, will be harmful to them both\". The panel finds that this statement crosses the line separating expert opinion and advocacy.\n[18] In the case of Czesak v. M.C.I., Justice Annis provided some caution to decision-makers when he discussed psychological reports submitted into evidence before administrative tribunals:\nOur legal system has a long experience in dealing with forensic experts testifying on matters relating to technical evidence for the purpose of assisting courts in their determinations. From that experience, the courts have developed what I would describe as a guarded and cautionary view on conclusions of forensic experts which have not undergone a rigorous validation process under court procedures.\nThis is not to say that every expert report prepared for litigation should be dismissed as having no, or little, weight. But what the court's experience with\nforensic experts does suggest in relation to these reports being proffered before administrative tribunals where there exists no defined procedure to allow for their validation, is that caution should be exercised in accepting them at face value, particularly when they propose to settle important issues to be decided by the tribunal. In my view therefore, unless there is some means to corroborate either the neutrality or lack of self-interest of the expert in relation to the litigation process, they generally should be accorded little weight.17\n[19] In considering the report of Ms. XXXX, the panel also notes that the report was completed approximately one and a half years prior to the hearing of the claim, with nothing more recent provided speaking to either claimants' current psychological functioning or mental health regarding any treatment received or the current diagnosis\/prognosis.\n[20] Taking into account all of the above, the panel gives Ms. XXXX report little weight.\n[21] While a hospital admission document18 for the principal claimant from XXXX 2016 was subsequently provided which makes reference to XXXX and XXXX, it is unclear from the report whether this is in any way related to the allegations in the claim, and the principal claimant indicated that this was related to a situation that she was experiencing in Canada. The panel notes that the hospital document is also somewhat dated, almost a year old, and so also does little to speak to the current condition of the claimants.\n[22] The panel also took into consideration some of the difficulties that claimants can face in the hearing room, including cultural factors, the milieu of the hearing room, and the stress inherent in responding to oral questions through an interpreter.\n[23] The panel had a number of concerns with the testimony of the principal claimant, including material omissions and inconsistencies, some of which are noted below. The panel did not find these credibility concerns to be reasonably explained.\nWhen the claimants left the family home\n[24] The principal claimant alleges that she and the minor claimant left the family home in XXXX 2014, staying from that time on at an apartment owned by her mother in XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimants allegedly lived at her mother's apartment from XXXX 2014 until leaving Jordan in XXXX 2015. The principal claimant provided an address history19 in the forms she completed at the POE on arrival in Canada. The panel notes that this form was completed on XXXX XXXX, 2015, only three days after the principal claimant left Jordan. As such, the panel finds it reasonable to expect the principal claimant to have accurately listed her history of addresses in Jordan.\n[25] While the claimant lists the XXXX XXXX address as where she most recently lived in Jordan, the timeframe given for this address is from XXXX 2012 (not XXXX 2014) until XXXX 2015. When asked about this discrepancy, the principal claimant's explanation was that she could not recall the date and so just wrote anything. As the panel noted during the hearing, while this might explain being a little bit off the timeframe for when she moved to XXXX XXXX, it does not explain being more than two years off. Moving to XXXX XXXX in XXXX 2012, as the principal claimant indicated in her forms from the port of entry, would mean that the claimants living outside of the family home before the significant events of 2013 and 2014, which allegedly occurred in the family home.\n[26] The panel notes that another version of the IMM5669 form20 was put into evidence and it was stated that this form was completed by the principal claimant and her mother prior to making her claim but she was unable to refer to that to document when completing the forms at the POE. The panel notes that the portion of the form provided is undated and so it is unclear whether it was completed before or after the POE. Even accepting that it was completed prior to the form completed at the POE, the panel finds it reasonable to expect the principal claimant to provide details of her recent residency without looking at the information her mother previously assisted her in completing.\n[27] The panel does not find this to reasonably explain the discrepancy for the timeframe for when she was living at her most recent address in Jordan. The panel finds this to be a relevant discrepancy because it is tied to the situation that allegedly led the claimants to flee. As such, the panel draws a negative inference regarding the principal claimant's credibility and the credibility of her allegations from this inconsistency.\n[28] The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimants have failed to establish that they fled the family home in XXXX 2014. The panel finds that they likely lived outside of the family home since XXXX 2012, as indicated in the IMM5669 form completed at the POE. The panel finds that this raises questions as to the veracity of their allegations, as they were not living in the family home in 2013 and 2014, the panel finds that the events that are said to have occurred in the home at that time likely did not occur as alleged.\nSupporting evidence inconsistent with the principal claimant's testimony\n[29] The principal claimant provided a letter21 from a friend in Jordan, signed XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The letter was accompanied by a scanned page of a Jordanian passport in the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.22 The panel noted that the principal claimant's BOC narrative makes reference to a friend named XXXX, and the principal claimant confirmed that they were one in the same person. The panel asked why the letter written by XXXX is signed XXXX and she explained that [transliteration issue] and that it is the same name. While the panel accepts that XXXX and XXXX are transliterations of the same Arabic name into English, as the letter XXXX and XXXX could reasonably be used to capture the same Arabic letter, it is less obviously so with the name XXXX, which leaves out the XXXX XXXX XXXX sound completely. The panel notes that the claimant referred to her as XXXX, not XXXX and the passport provided uses XXXX. The writer would presumably be familiar with how her name is written in English in her passport and so the panel finds it reasonable to expect her to use XXXX when signing her letter. The panel finds this difference in name raises questions as to the provenance of the letter and whether it was indeed written by the individual in the passport.\n[30] The panel notes as well that the letter is not a sworn statement and that the original of the letter was not before it, only a copy of a scanned image, and that the writer is not before it for questioning.\n[31] Of most concern to the panel was the inconsistency between the information in the letter and that provided by the principal claimant about the situation between her and her husband.\n[32] The principal claimant stated that her friend only visited her mother, the principal claimant's neighbour, from time to time. In contrast, her friend stated that she lived with her mother for six months. When this discrepancy was pointed out to the principal claimant, she stated that her friend did stay for six months when she was pregnant. No explanation was offered as to why the claimant only mentioned her visiting from time to time initially.\n[33] The principal claimant stated that she had only spoken to her friend two times (in XXXX 2014 and XXXX 2014) about her problems and that on the second occasion her friend advised her to go to the Family Protection Centre for help. The panel noted that the friend's letter indicated that she told the principal claimant many times to go to the Family Protection Centre and was asked to explain this difference. The principal claimant stated that her friend only told her this once.\n[34] The panel was asked whether, outside of the times she talked to the principal claimant, her friend did anything else to try to assist her. The principal claimant indicated that other than this, her friend had also spoken to the principal claimant's mother when she came back to Jordan. The panel noted that the friend's letter indicated that her friend also approached Mr. XXXX to try to talk to him about the matter. The principal claimant then stated that this had also occurred. When asked why this was not mentioned, the principal claimant stated that she forgot. The panel finds this to be a significant detail and does not find forgetting to be a sufficient explanation for its omission.\n[35] The panel also noted that the friend's letter mentioned Mr. XXXX going crazy in front of the principal claimant's parents and the principal claimant indicated that she did not remember the incident. The panel noted that this seemed a significant incident in the letter, and the principal claimant stated that he had lost his temper two or three times in front of her parents. The panel asked whether these were included in the narrative and the principal claimant noted that they were not, explaining that if she put everything in she would have needed a 200 page book. The panel does not find this to sufficiently explain the omission of these details from her narrative.\n[36] The panel finds, given all of the above concerns, that it can assign this letter no weight.\n[37] With regard to the absence of the above noted details from the principal claimants own BOC narrative and amendments,23 the panel does not find the claimant reasonably explained the absence of these significant details from her BOC and finds them to be embellishments. The panel draws a negative inference from the principal claimant's evolving testimony on this issue.\nNo harm from Mr. XXXX XXXX2014XXXX XXXX 2015\n[38] The panel notes that despite making threats against the principal claimant and knowing where she was living during this time, Mr. XXXX did not attempt to confront or harm the claimants in the months that they were living in the principal claimant's mother's apartment. The panel does not find this to be consistent with the threats against the claimants allegedly emanating from Mr. XXXX. The panel finds this raises questions as to the veracity of the alleged threats.\nOmission of divorce as trigger to recent rage in husband\n[39] The principal claimant stated at the hearing that while her husband abused her all the time, he was made angrier when he learned about the divorce that she was seeking. When asked for more details about this, the principal claimant stated that these threats were made recently, in the past one or two months. The panel asked why this was not in her BOC addendum and the principal claimant stated that it was because she was not asked. The panel does not find this sufficiently explains the omission of this detail from her BOC. The panel finds this to be a serious allegation and relevant and significant detail regarding the nature and recentness of the threats he was making to her.\n[40] The panel finds this to be an embellishment and draws a negative inference from this as to the principal claimant's credibility.\nDiscrepancy in timeline for new threats\n[41] The principal claimant stated in the recent addendum to her narrative24 that her husband had been sending threats by WhatsApp to her mother between XXXX 2015 and XXXX 2016.\n[42] In her testimony at the hearing, the principal claimant stated that the threats received by WhatsApp occurred approximately two months earlier (approximately XXXX 2016). The panel noted the difference in the timeline and asked her to explain this discrepancy. The principal claimant stated that it was maybe because her mother had only told her about it recently but that it had occurred earlier. The panel does not find this to be a reasonable explanation as even if this were true, the principal claimant provided the timeline of XXXX 2015-XXXX 2016 in her own signed narrative addendum and so was reasonably aware of it and as such, it is reasonable to expect her to provide this timeframe in her oral testimony. The panel draws a negative inference from this inconsistency.\nAbsence of recent WhatsApp threats from XXXX\n[43] The principal claimant and her mother in her statement indicated that there were troubles accessing the threats from XXXX since the mother changed her phone. The panel finds this almost too coincidental\/convenient an excuse for the absence of this significant supporting documentation that was in their possession in Canada. Nothing to indicate change of phone and timing or from WhatsApp, Bell or tech-savvy friend who was helping to try to retrieve messages. Also, given the significance of these and the fact that principal claimant and mother presumably aware of the importance of supporting documentation (given that volumes of documents provided and mother herself provided two statements, etc.) it is reasonable to expect that these would have been printed off when they were received rather than subsequently lost. The panel does not accept the explanation to have been credibly established and does not find the absence of the threats to be reasonably explained. As such, the panel draws a negative inference.\nWhatsApp threats not reported to Canadian authorities\n[44] It was alleged that in his WhatsApp threats Mr. XXXX indicated that the principal claimant would regret her decisions as he was coming to Canada and give her a lesson and she 'knew what he would do'.25 The panel asked whether these threats had been reported to Canadian police and the principal claimant stated that they had not. The panel asked why this was not reported, given his history of violence and that he indicated that he was coming to Canada to further harm the claimants. The principal claimant suggested that he always said things like this and she did not know whether he would really do it or not. The principal claimant appears to have not taken the threat seriously as would reasonably be expected of someone who had faced the serious harm alleged at his hands. The panel finds this raises questions about the veracity of the allegations of his past violence and about the WhatsApp threats.\n[45] While the panel notes that the principal claimant's mother provided an affidavit26 providing details around the receipt of the WhatsApp threats, the panel has given this little weight. The panel notes that the mother was initially going to be called as a witness but in the end was not called by counsel after the principal claimant acknowledge speaking to her mother about her testimony between instructions despite instructions not to do so.\n[46] Given the above concerns regarding the absence of documentation around the threats, the failure to report the matter to Canadian authorities, and the inconsistent timeline for when the WhatsApp threats were received, the panel finds that these threats have not been established, on a balance of probabilities, and that they were likely an embellishment to buttress the claims.\nMedical documents\n[47] The principal claimant stated in her BOC narrative27 that her husband had XXXX XXXX XXXX in one of the attacks against her. She has provided some medical documents28 and photographs29 to support this allegation. The panel notes that while the documents confirm surgery, the medical evidence provided does not confirm the allegations, as there is no mention of the cause of the need for surgery.\n[48] The principal claimant also provided a report30 from a Canadian doctor, Dr. XXXX XXXX, which confirms blockage of XXXX XXXX XXXX, removal of the lower XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and an XXXX XXXX XXXX. Dr. XXXX notes having received the above noted supporting medical documents from Jordan, but notes that without operative reports from Jordan, he cannot be more specific than confirming that she had XXXX XXXX XXXX with a subsequent attempted repair of the fracture and a XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[49] Based on the evidence, the panel accepts that the claimant had these surgeries in 2015, but finds it has insufficient evidence before it to establish that this was related to a violent attack from Mr. XXXX.\n[50] Given the finding that the claimants were not living with Mr. XXXX at the time this was alleged to have occurred, the panel finds the XXXX surgery was likely not related to the principal claimant's allegations.\nFamily court documents in Canada\n[51] The claimant has provided two documents from a Canadian family lawyer,31 indicating that she has started to prepare to file for divorce in Canada and is seeking custody of the minor claimant due to allegations of abuse in Jordan. The panel accepts that the principal claimant is starting divorce proceedings.\n[52] The panel notes that it has found that the claimants left the family home in XXXX 2012 and accepts that the relationship with her husband has ended. The panel notes that it did not find credible the allegations of harm in 2013-2014 and notes that Mr. XXXX is not alleged to have pursued the claimants when living outside the family home in Jordan. The panel also notes that the continued WhatsApp threats were found to be embellishments. The panel notes that Mr. XXXX signed an authorization32 for the claimants to travel and did not prevent the child from leaving with the mom to North America. The panel finds on the evidence before it that their split appears to be amicable.\nStatements from the principal claimant's mother\n[53] As noted, the principal claimant's mother was potentially a witness, however, despite instructions not to talk about testimony before hearing from the witness, the principal claimant indicated during her testimony at the second siting that she had in fact spoken with her mother about her testimony at the first sitting. The panel noted that this would affect the weight to be given the mother's testimony and counsel did not elect to call her as witness.\n[54] As to the written statements from the mother,33 the panel notes that much of the information contained in the statements is information that was relayed to her by the principal claimant and not based on her first-hand knowledge.\n[55] While she speaks of some information in the first-hand, the panel notes that it had concerns with principal claimant's testimony and evidence in these areas and as noted, the potential witness testimony was compromised by speaking about the principal claimant's testimony before giving her own witness testimony.\n[56] The panel notes that while the principal claimant's mother is said to have been in Jordan with the claimants throughout parts of 2014 and 2015, evidence of this travel was not provided to establish this. Also, as previously noted, while the mother is said to have received WhatsApp threats, evidence of receipt of these threats or to confirm the explanation for their absence, was not provided.\n[57] As such, the panel gives these statements little weight.\nAbsence of further mental health evidence\n[58] In looking at the previously mentioned psychotherapist report,34it suggests that both claimants require counselling to work through the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX they feel. When asked at the hearing about any follow up from the one time interview she had with Ms. XXXX or with any other professionals, the principal claimant indicated that there was no further meetings with Ms. XXXX, but she mentioned subsequently seeing a psychiatrist.\n[59] While the principal claimant stated that she had visited a psychiatrist after meeting with Ms. XXXX, she was unable to provide details to clarify when this was or how long she continued with this. She also provided nothing to confirm these visits, and was unable to reasonably explain her failure to obtain documentation from this doctor.\n[60] When the panel asked for further details on the principal claimant's involvement with this doctor, she was unable to provide a clear indication of when or for how long she was attending.\n[61] The principal claimant was asked about a report or letter from this doctor and she stated that it did not occur to her. The panel does not find this to reasonably explain the lack of supporting document from this doctor. These visits were more recent, and more in-depth as they allegedly took place over some time. The panel draws a negative inference from the absence of more recent documentation related to the principal claimant's psychological functioning.\n[62] Going back to Ms. XXXX report, the panel notes that it makes reference to the effects the family home situation has had on the minor claimant, but indicates that this information was provided by the principal claimant. At the hearing the principal claimant stated that Ms. XXXX also spoke with the minor claimant. The panel finds it reasonable to expect the psychotherapist to have mentioned speaking to the minor claimant if she in fact had spoken to her during the assessment. The principal claimant was unable to reasonably explain this discrepancy.\n[63] The panel also asked the principal claimant about follow up treatment for the minor claimant given the reported deleterious effect the alleged previous experiences have had on her. The principal claimant stated that she did not take the minor claimant for any other care or treatment because her situation was not stable and she was planning to take her when things settled down. The panel asked if the principal claimant had since taken her daughter for any treatment, she answered in the negative. The panel finds it reasonable for the principal claimant to have sought follow up care for her daughter, the minor claimant, at some point during the more than 18 months they were in Canada, if she were in fact experiencing the difficulties alleged. The panel finds that the lack of such follow up inconsistent with the actions reasonably expected of a mother whose child was dealing with the issues alleged for the minor claimant, especially if the principal claimant was seeking treatment for herself as alleged. The panel draws a negative inference from this and finds it consistent with the alleged psychological\/emotional situation of the minor claimant being an embellishment of the principal claimant to buttress the allegations of domestic violence in the family home in Jordan.\nGeneral credibility finding\n[64] Given all of the above concerns, the panel finds the principal claimant to have been generally not credible. The panel finds that it has insufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to establish the allegations in these claims.\n[65] The panel finds that the claimants have not provided sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to establish their past experiences on a balance of probabilities. As such, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimants have not established a forward looking risk from the alleged agent of harm (the principal claimant's husband and father of the minor claimant) to establish their claims under section 96 of 97(1) of the IRPA.\n[66] It appears that the decision for the claimants to claim in Canada was part of the family's plan for reunification, as the siblings and parents of the principal claimant were all resettled to Canada in 2013 following which the principal claimant had been making efforts to obtain visas for Canada and the US until she and the minor claimant were finally able to travel in 2015.\nCONCLUSION\n[67] As the panel did not find the claimants' allegations to be true on a balance of probabilities, the panel finds that there is no serious possibility that the claimants would be persecuted, or that they would be subjected, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture in Jordan.\n[68] The panel therefore rejects their claims.\n[69] The panel notes it is not required to consider the fear of persecution or availability of protection in the second country of citizenship, once it has been determined that the claimants do not have a well-founded fear of persecution in the first.35\n[70] As the claimants have not established their claims against Jordan, the panel has not considered their claims against Iraq.\n(signed)\nJ.

The allegations of the claimant are contained in his Personal Information Form (\"PIF\"), 2 but I will provide a brief summary here.\n[2] The claimant fears returning to Turkey as he fears arbitrary detention and torture, physical assault and other serious threats to his life and safety on the basis of his profile and his previous activities. The claimant was born in XXXX village, where the population was entirely Kurdish and Alevi. The claimant learned to speak Kurmanji at home, but all of the education he received was in Turkish, and he and the other students were forced to learn about Sunni Islam in school. As a result, the claimant did not continue schooling past primary school.\n[3] The claimant's PIF contains numerous incidents of persecution that he allegedly experienced while in Turkey, including abuses by extremist Turkish nationalists, military, special commandos, police and security forces. The claimant was able to obtain work abroad and spent many of his working years away from Turkey. The claimant alleged that he was detained by Turkish authorities on four different occasions during which time he was accused of being involved with the Kurdistan Workers Party (\"PKK\") and being opposed to the government in Turkey. After a number of detentions, the claimant's house was raided in mid-XXXX 2011. His house was ransacked and he was mistreated in front of his wife and children. It was at this point the claimant realized he had to leave Turkey. He obtained the assistance of an agent in order to procure a United States (US) visa. He left Turkey on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2012 and flew to Seattle. The claimant illegally crossed the border into Canada near Vancouver, then traveled to Toronto where he made a refugee claim. He has a cousin here in Toronto who agreed to assist him with settling in and filing a refugee claim, which was filed in early 2012. After making his claim, the claimant's wife advised him that the police had come to their home and asked about him and his whereabouts. He was also accused of using false documents to leave Turkey.\n[4] The claimant had a hearing before the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) in 2013, and a negative decision in his claim was provided on December 9, 2013. The member rejected the claimant's claim, finding him not to be credible due to his delay in claiming and his lack of subjective fear. The case was appealed to the federal court, who returned the claim to the RPD for determination by different member. It is thus that this case is before me for determination.\n[5] I was concerned about the claimant's past work and travel to particularly insecure regions of the world, including Afghanistan, Libya in 2011, and Pakistan (XXXX region). I invited the Minister to participate in the hearing but the Minister opted not to intervene.\nISSUES\n[6] There are three issues with this claim:\na. Has the claimant established his identity?\nb. Was the claimant credible?\nc. Does the claimant have a well-founded fear of persecution in Turkey due to his profile, or is he a person in need of protection?\nDetermination\n[7] I find the claimant not to be credible with respect to material elements of his claim, including his actual presence in Turkey during the relevant time frames. I also find that his residual profile of being an Alevi Kurd is not sufficient to found his claim for asylum.\nHas the claimant established his identity?\n[8] The claimant filed a number of identity documents when he made his claim, but the most germane are his Turkish passport and his national Turkish ID card.3 I was concerned about the provenance of these documents, as they were issued on the same day and they have the same photo of the claimant appended to them. It was for these reasons, and the claimant's testimony about these identity documents, that led me to send both documents for authentication.\n[9] The identity card was inspected by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) anti-counterfeiting Bureau, and they produced a report which indicates that there are no alterations detected on the card, but because there was no genuine specimen available for comparison, the authenticity of this document was inconclusive.4 As for the passport, it was produced to the panel for inspection. The passport bears the hallmarks of a genuine document, including the appropriate holographs and security features. The claimant used this passport to travel out of Turkey, and although I have concerns about the fact it was issued on the same day as the identity card and the photo is the same, my concerns are not sufficient to overcome the fact that a passport is prima facie evidence of identity, and this passport appears to be genuine. Therefore, on a balance of probabilities, I accept the claimant is a national of Turkey named XXXX XXXX, as he alleges.\n[10] Furthermore, I have evidence to corroborate the fact that the claimant is Kurdish5 and Alevi6 and I therefore accept this element of his profile on a balance of probabilities as well.\nWas the Claimant credible?\n[11] It is a trite point of refugee law that when a claimant asserts under oath that their testimony is true, I must accept it to be so unless I have a valid reason to doubt it. However, this presumption is rebuttable. In this case, I questioned the claimant extensively about his allegations. The claimant was not credible. His evidence was rife with contradictions, omissions and embellishments, primarily regarding his experiences in Turkey and the persecution he fears in Turkey. He also divulged a number of concerning new allegations which do not appear anywhere in his narrative. I am also greatly concerned by the lack of persuasive evidence placing the claimant in Turkey during the relevant time periods. My concerns are not picayune or middling-they go to the very heart of the claim. I have not one or two concerns with the claimant's evidence-I have many, but for the sake of brevity here will focus only on the most glaring.\n[12] In reaching a decision in this matter I have considered all of the evidence in the file before me, including the transcripts of the previous hearing, the extensive documentary evidence submitted by the claimant, the medical reports, in this case consisting of two reports corroborating the claimant's injuries and another two reports attesting to his psychological state. Even if a particular item is not referred to in this decision, I have considered it in reaching my decision\nThe claimant's marital and family status\n[13] The claimant alleges that he is married and that he is the father of XXXX sons. There was little evidence filed to establish the claimant's marital status or the fact that he is the father of XXXX sons. This information is clearly relevant, as the claimant alleges a fear of persecution on a forward-looking basis due to the fact that his family who remain in Turkey have been consistently harassed and bothered since the claimant's departure.\n[14] I asked the claimant about his family. He did not know the date of birth of his wife, or that of his sons. He said he would be able to know if he looked at his documents, but I told him that was not an option during the hearing. I asked him how his oldest son, XXXX, was, and he replied that he was 24 years old. The claimant's PIF indicates that XXXX is in fact 24 years old, born on XXXX XXXX, 1992. He then was asked for the date of XXXX birth, and he stated \"as far as I am concerned XXXX XXXX, 1982.\" This date is obviously incorrect, and is off by 10 years. I then asked how old his youngest child was, and the claimant replied he is 10 years old. I put to him that the PIF indicates that XXXX XXXX was born in 2004, which would make him 12 years old at the date of the hearing. The claimant indicated that he guessed and that he does not pay attention to dates. I then asked him to tell me the names and ages of his children in order. He knew that his oldest son XXXX is 24, but thought that his other son XXXX was 23. XXXX is in fact 22. The claimant knew the ages of only XXXX and XXXX. I asked the claimant where his marriage certificate was, and he indicated he did not have it. He also did not produce the family register, which would establish his family connections back in Turkey and corroborate the existence of his children and wife. The claimant has had over four years to gather this evidence. I have taken into account the claimant's limited education, the fact he has been away from his family for a not insignificant amount of time and the psychological reports when assessing this evidence. I balance it against the evidence before me which establishes the claimant's extensive work history outside of Turkey. This is a man who is clearly extremely resourceful and intelligent enough to obtain consistent remunerative work in numerous countries throughout the world. He testified that the reason he kept returning to Turkey was for his family. Having taken the foregoing into account and balancing the evidence, I find that the claimant should have known the ages and birthdates of his children and wife. Although this is not a hugely significant credibility concern, it is one that makes me wonder what the claimant is hiding from the panel. I find the claimant's evidence regarding his family to have a minor negative impact on his credibility.\nAllegation made against the claimant by a store owner\n[15] The claimant testified about an incident that allegedly occurred in XXXX 2007. The PIF indicates that this was the date of the claimant's first detention, and on this date he had returned for visit with his family in Turkey from Morocco. He received news that the Alevi dede, or spiritual leader, had passed away in the village. The claimant and a number of his friends went to the leader's village to offer condolences. En route to XXXX, the claimant and his friends were stopped by the gendarme. After checking his ID and obtaining information from their sources, the claimant was detained for three days on the accusation of going to the funeral of a terrorist. The claimant alleges he was beaten badly with truncheons, punched and kicked on this occasion. After three days he was released without charges.\n[16] In his testimony, the claimant testified that the reason he was detained on this occasion was because of a complaint made by a XXXX XXXX store owner. This is a totally different reason for the detention than that indicated in the PIF, and one which is not included in the PIF, although he did mention this at his first RPD hearing. I asked the claimant why the fact that this detention was on the basis of a complaint was not included in the narrative. He replied that it was a long story and he did not want to put all the details into his narrative. However, the claimant indicated that he had provided a letter from one of his fellow detainees,7 and this letter indicates that this detention was on the basis of the complaint. I have carefully reviewed the letter, and I note that although it has an identity document appended to it, it is not in the form of an affidavit, nor has the letter writer been put forward as a witness for the claimant. The omission of the fact the authorities intercepted the claimant is significant because it suggests that he was targeted by authorities rather than apprehended at a random stop. This complaint also reappears throughout the testimony of the claimant, as I note below, so it should have been captured in the narrative. The claimant has been represented by respected counsel for both of his hearings, and I would expect this significant element to his claim to have appeared in his narrative, irrespective of whether corroborating evidence appears later. I find that its omission has a negative impact on the credibility of the claimant.\nClaimant recounts most memorable incident of detention\n[17] I took into account the claimant's limited education and psychological issues when questioning him and led with very open questions. For instance, when questioning him about his detentions, I said \"is there one that was particularly memorable for you? Tell me about that one.\" The claimant then stated \"it was the very last one when the police raided my house.\" The PIF indicates that the last detention took place on XXXX XXXX, 2011, when the house was raided and authorities found a book with photos of Jesus and the Virgin Mary and the claimant was accused of making propaganda for Christians.8 The claimant said this event took place on XXXX XXXX, 2010 and confirmed this date twice. When I pointed this inconsistency out to him-fully one year's difference, the claimant stated it was his mistake and it took place in 2011. I reject the claimant's explanation for this significant inconsistency. It is a year's difference, and the claimant testified that this incident was most memorable for him as it was his last detention before he left Turkey. I would therefore expect this incident to be clear in his mind. I find this inconsistency to have a negative impact on the credibility of the claimant.\n[18] In addition, the claimant was inconsistent about the details of this incident. When asked to tell me the details about the incident in XXXX of 2011, he said his house was raided and he was handcuffed while his children begged for him to be released. He was detained for four days and abused badly while in detention. The claimant stated that the reason for this detention was \"again due to the same reason the complaint that I participated in funeral for member of PKK and protests.\" I asked if there had been another complaint but he stated it was based upon the same complaint from 2007, and he then stated \"PKK started its activities in XXXX XXXX, 1984, every XXXX of the year they raid people's houses who they suspect may have relationship with PKK.\" I asked him if there was any other reason he was detained in XXXX of 2011, and he said \"no other reason.\" I then put to him that his narrative indicates that he was detained because the police searched the house and found pictures of Jesus and the Virgin Mary. He then replied \"yes I got a book regards the prophet Jesus. When they saw that they made more pressure on me and said you are doing propaganda for Christianity.\" I asked the claimant to tell me why his account was different than his narrative with respect to this important incident and he said \"I am telling you the narrative.\" I asked what he meant and he said \"it has been a long time and sometimes it is impossible to remember anything.\" The narrative does indicate that when he was detained, he was accused of being a terrorist and a separatist, but it gives a different reason for the claimant actually being detained. I strongly reject the claimant's explanation for this significant contradiction. Being detained and persecuted for having Christian books is an entirely different reason than due to a complaint that one is involved with the PKK. This totally different account of what the claimant described when asked to tell me about the most memorable incident is troubling and has a negative impact on his credibility.\n[19] Furthermore, I asked the claimant if he was accused of anything else during this detention. He stated that he did not remember. I put to him that his narrative indicates he was accused of throwing a Molotov cocktail. He initially stated 'even if I see Molotov cocktail I would not know what that is,' and then said they had accused him on this occasion. When I asked why he did not mention this accusation earlier, he stated \"I have been here for five years and I have a lot of problems and situation and condition in Turkey is getting worse and every day I am crying and even my eyes are affected and my sight is not good anymore.\" I find the claimant's explanation for the omission of the accusation about the Molotov cocktail from his testimony to not be reasonable. I specifically asked him if was accused of anything else and he said he did not remember but then suddenly remembered when I told him it was in the narrative. This is a strong indicator of a fabricated story or incident. I know the incident allegedly occurred over five years ago and I am aware of the psychological evidence regarding the claimant (discussed below). I made it as easy as possible for the claimant to recount this incident as described in his narrative, even giving him the gentle nudge by asking him \"were you accused of anything else?\" However, the claimant's testimony about this pivotal incident, chosen by the claimant as the most memorable, is inconsistent with his narrative regarding material elements. I find this to undermine his credibility on a material point. I further find that this incident did not occur as described, if at all. This casts a pall over the claimant's evidence regarding all his detentions.\nThe agent for the claimant is executed\n[20] There was a startling revelation during the hearing which I find to be very significant. The claimant alleged he had to use the services of three agents to flee from Turkey, and that it cost him almost $37,000 USD in order to obtain the false US visa on which he travelled on to the US. The names of two of these agents are XXXX and XXXX, and he did not know the name of the third agent. However, XXXX was arrested and killed by Turkish authorities after the claimant arrived here in Canada, \"almost five years ago\". The claimant learned of this after he had made his claim when his relative, XXXX XXXX, who was going to use the services of these agents, was unable to come to Canada due to the execution of XXXX. I asked the claimant if the execution of XXXX affected his risk in Turkey and he replied:\n\"Yes. Otherwise I would not wait here for five years. Because my mom died and my wife was injured.\"\nWhen questioned further on this and asked if this issue had not happened with XXXX, would he have been able to go back to Turkey, the claimant stated\n\"I was afraid since this guy was killed I believe I may also be killed I was afraid so that is why I did not want to go. Otherwise, who would want to be apart from their children?\"I take from this that the detentions the claimant allegedly experienced alone were not sufficient to keep him from returning to Turkey, but this situation with XXXX was.\n[21] I asked the claimant why he was afraid due to XXXX execution, and he stated that XXXX was asked how many people had been sent abroad and they took a list of people. The claimant testified that he believes his name is on XXXX list and this list is now in the hands of authorities and this is the reason why he cannot return to Turkey. There is no mention of the execution of XXXX and the serious implication this has for the claimant's claim, even though his claim has been extant since 2012, he has been through two RPD and one court hearing, and numerous PIF amendments have been filed. I find this omission to be very serious. I asked the claimant why this does not appear in his narrative and he stated \"in my narrative I answered questions that I was asked.\" While this incident may have occurred after the claim was made, I find it to be significant enough to merit a PIF amendment as it goes to the claimant's forward looking risk in Turkey. The claimant has been represented by able counsel during the entirety of his claim. I find this very significant omission to have a negative impact on the claimant's credibility. I further find that this testimony, in particular that he would have returned to Turkey but for the situation with XXXX, to strongly suggest the claimant did not have problems with the authorities in Turkey, he is not wanted and he has fabricated his entire asylum claim. I further find that the story about XXXX is likely an embellishment. This is devastating for his credibility.\nThe claimant's work history abroad\n[22] The claimant has an overseas work history which, in my experience, is unusual for a Kurdish claimant from Turkey. He has worked all over the world and in some rather compromised places from a security perspective. Counsel filed a PIF amendment on November 17, 2016 outlining all the claimant's work experience since he began working in 1982. I asked the claimant to tell me about the places he worked. He stated he has worked in Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Morocco and Libya. I asked if he worked anywhere else. He replied that he did not remember and was not sure. I put to him that the information he filed in his initial PIF indicates he worked in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Oman as well. I asked him why he did not mention these places when asked. He replied that he has been going through a serious depression and does not remember a lot of things and that he has a doctor's report about it.\n[23] There is extensive corroborating evidence regarding the claimant's work history abroad9 and it does go back many years so I only make a minor negative credibility finding against the claimant for his not telling me the names of all the countries he has worked in. What I do find puzzling is that the claimant's initial PIF has him going to certain countries that the later PIF amendment10 does not contain, including Tajikistan, and the amendment has him in Kyrgyzstan when the PIF makes no mention of it. Counsel's amendment was done to jive with the documents filed to corroborate the claimant's employment, and I find this ex post facto revision to the PIF to ensure consistency with the documents to be troubling.\n[24] I was concerned about the claimant's travel, as he was in Afghanistan when it was very restive, Libya (and Benghazi for that matter) in 2011, around the time the situation became difficult in that country, along with Pakistan, in the XXXX region. I invited the Minister for this reason, but they opted not to intervene. I am therefore left with the claimant's objective evidence of his employment which he says is genuine.\n[25] The claimant has not filed his passport to corroborate his travel to these countries so I am left with a not credible claimant and some documents to corroborate where he was during certain time periods of his life. I therefore accept the claimant was in those places he alleges which were corroborated by his documents. What was conspicuously absent in this case was any evidence placing the claimant in Turkey during the times he alleges. I will discuss this further below, after my discussion of the claimant's employment in Turkey?\nThe claimant's work history in Turkey\n[26] The claimant's testimony regarding his employment in Turkey was inconsistent with his documents. He was asked if he ever worked in Turkey and he replied \"I don't remember...maybe for a very short period of time.\" He could not remember when it was, and he stated that most companies would not take him and he, along with many others, left the country to look for work. The claimant testified he was good at his work as a XXXX but that in Turkey, the nationalists did not want the Kurds to work for them.\n[27] He then testified that he worked for a Turkish company in 2004 for \"less than a year\". There is a letter to corroborate this employment11, which is curious, given the claimant's earlier testimony that he was only employed in Turkey for a short period of time. When I asked the claimant about why this employment ended, he said \"the job was done\" When I pressed him and asked why it was so hard for him to obtain work in Turkey, he stated \"they wanted to fire me but the project manager would not permit it.\"\n[28] The claimant then made another rather shocking allegation. He said there was an allegation in the GBT system (Turkish government computer system to monitor nationals) of the claimant having a relationship with the PKK but the project manager would not terminate him because he was experienced and working in the mountain area. This portion of the testimony bears inclusion verbatim because it shows how the claimant danced around the issue of his involvement or perceived involvement with the PKK. Recall that the claimant testified that the complaint by the XXXX XXXX store owner happened in 2007, while this employment and the GBT notice allegedly occurred in 2004:\nPanel: You said GBT system alleges you had a relationship with the PKK?\nClaimant: Yes.\nPanel: Why would that be there?\nClaimant: Because they sent plainclothes police to companies...they check who works for the company if anyone has any record. Then they report about people who are working for the company. So our names were given. But the company did not fire us.\nPanel: Do you have a record in Turkey that you are involved with the PKK?\nClaimant: No. I don't have any relationship because I was working all the time.\nPanel: Why would the GBT system say that you do?\nClaimant: Because there was a complaint against me.\nPanel: There was a complaint that you were involved with PKK?\nClaimant: Yes.\nPanel: You told me about that already?\nClaimant: Yes\nPanel: But that happened in 2007.\nClaimant: But always they take that into consideration.\nPanel: We were just talking about your work in 2004 and that they wanted to fire you because of involvement with the PKK?\nClaimant: Yes, because I am Alevi and Kurdish.\nPanel: You just said it was because of a complaint that was made that you were with the PKK...But the complaint did not come until 2007.\nClaimant: The complaints are always taken into consideration.\nPanel: Had there been previous complaints?\nClaimant: Before what?\nPanel: Before 2007.\n.\nClaimant: Because I am Kurdish and Alevi.\nPanel: Do all Kurds and Alevis have a record in the GBT that they are involved with the PKK?\nClaimant: They make accusations against most of them.\nPanel: This has happened to other people?\nClaimant: Yes.\nPanel: Why is none of this in your narrative?\nClaimant: Because those are work regulated stuff so I did not include it in my narrative and also it is difficult to explain.\nPanel: Help me understand why you did not work in Turkey after 2004?\nClaimant: I chose to not work in Turkey anymore after I had that experience.\nThe claimant suddenly became very evasive and shifted his story from \"they think I am PKK\" to \"because I am Kurdish and Alevi\", a rather different and much less troubling allegation He also alleged that he had this work problem because of the complaint, yet he previously testified that the complaint happened in 2007, well after this alleged incident with his work in Turkey.\n[29] I am stymied by the claimant's evidence. His evidence is shifting and inconsistent; he has included another rather incendiary allegation about his being flagged by authorities in the Turkish government system in 2004 as being involved with the PKK but there is no mention of this anywhere in his narrative. The omission of this allegation is troubling because this would help to provide context for the claimant's story and establish a strong forward looking risk. I am troubled by this testimony and the claimant's responses to my questions. I am concerned that when asked if he has a record in Turkey that he is involved with the PKK, he replied, extremely evasively, \"no, I don't have any relationship because I was working all the time,\" as though working would preclude someone from being involved with the PKK. It is even more troubling because by the claimant's own testimony, he only worked for short periods while he was in Turkey. I do not know what the claimant's actual story is but I find on a balance of probabilities he is not being truthful with the panel regarding his past activities, where he has been or what he has done. I find him to be lacking in credibility and to be untruthful.\nWhere has the claimant been?\n[30] There is a disconcerting lack of evidence placing the claimant in Turkey in the recent past, and I will itemize it for clarity.\na. a Turkish ID card12 and passport13, issued on the same day, XXXX XXXX, 2011, shortly before the claimant's departure from Turkey in XXXX 2012;14\nb. the aforementioned letter ostensibly corroborating the claimant's employment in Turkey in 2004;\nc. letter, ostensibly from hospital in XXXX, written on XXXX XXXX 2012, attesting to the claimant's head being injured on XXXX XXXX, 1998;15\nd. the claimant's Turkish drivers' license, issued in 1994;\ne. claimant's work contract in Turkey terminating in XXXX 1991;16\nf. \"Authorization certificate for using XXXX XXXX, issued XXXX XXXX, 1989;17\ng. Primary school diploma for grade five, issued XXXX XXXX XXXX 198018\nThe claimant was not credible regarding his story of persecution in Turkey, and I find he did not suffer any persecution as alleged if at all. Furthermore, there is a significant gap in his Turkish documents which amounts to almost 10 years, between 1994 and 2004. I do not know where the claimant was during that time period or what he was doing, but on a balance of probabilities, I do not accept that he was in Turkey as he alleged.\nWitness-cousin of the claimant\n[31] Additionally, the claimant put forward a witness to help establish his identity, one XXXX XXXX, a cousin of the claimant.19 I questioned Mr. XXXX regarding his knowledge of the claimant. Mr. XXXX testified under oath that he last saw the claimant in Turkey in 1988. Mr. XXXX testimony may have been of assistance to help establish the claimant's identity, but he was not able to place the claimant in Turkey after 1988.\n[32] In addition, Mr. XXXX testified that he came to Canada as a refugee claimant in 2001 and was granted asylum on the basis of problems he had in Turkey due to his political activities and his being Kurdish and Alevi. Mr. XXXX is now a Canadian citizen and the XXXX of the XXXX XXXX XXXX. Mr. XXXX testified that he himself had last been in Turkey last year and then again this year, from XXXX to XXXX. He stated that his XXXX children, aged XXXX were already in Turkey on vacation so he went to bring them back. I find this to suggest that the general risk to Alevi Kurds may not be as extreme as the claimant may have me believe, especially if the XXXX XXXX of the XXXX XXXX can go to Turkey in the summer for vacation with his young children and not be bothered by authorities.\nAffidavit from claimant's nephew\n[33] Additionally, the claimant's nephew, XXXX XXXX, provided a sworn affidavit in support of the claimant's refugee claim here in Canada.20 I asked the claimant about this nephew. The claimant said he did not know the last time he saw the claimant Turkey but it was 'when he was young' and he 'could not guess' when that was. I asked the claimant if XXXX was involved in any of the incidents which had been discussed in the hearing or if he witnessed any of the things referred to in the claimant's narrative. The claimant stated \"no, he did no see those incidents because much before that he left\" and that \"we did not have any connections\". XXXX affidavit states:\n\"As a child, I witnessed raids by the gendarmes on our village, including on our house and Uncle XXXX house.\nI make this affidavit to provide evidence for the refugee hearing of my uncle XXXX XXXX and for no other or improper reason.21\"\nI asked the claimant why XXXX affidavit states that he personally witnessed raids on the claimant's house. The claimant stated that he heard it from relatives, but he did not witness it. I again asked why XXXX lied in the affidavit for the claimant, and he said \"I don't remember.\" I make two findings about this evidence: one, that XXXX affidavit contains a false statement which was submitted by the claimant's previous counsel as truthful. Two, that the submission of a fraudulent or false affidavit diminishes the weight I can assign to any questionable documents filed by the claimant. If a sworn statement cannot be trusted, I can assign little weight to the documents filed by the family members of the claimant or any other personal corroborative documents he has filed in support of his claim. I will discuss the documents filed in support of the claim below.\n[34] I note as well that the claimant testified that XXXX had been in Germany for a number of years then claimed asylum here in Canada in 2005. His Canadian Permanent Residence Card was issued XXXX XXXX, 201122 but the claimant testified that XXXX returned to Turkey in 2011 and obtained a Turkish passport. I asked why he would do this and he said XXXX had not seen his parents in 15 years and was engaged and his fianc\u00e9 wanted him to take her to Turkey, so he took a risk and went. This apparently caused XXXX some difficulties with Canadian immigration authorities and his Member of Parliament had to get involved in order to assist XXXX. I am unaware of the reasons XXXX claimed asylum in Canada but his affidavit indicates that his family is Kurdish and Alevi and that his family had to move out of the village where the claimant lived to escape from the gendarme raids on their home. These issues notwithstanding, XXXX returned to Turkey. I again find this to suggest that the situation for Kurdish Alevis must not be as perilous as the claimant would have me believe.\nDocuments filed in support of the claim\n[35] The claimant has filed an affidavit from his relative XXXX XXXX, whose content he appeared to unaware of and whose content he contradicted. I therefore find that the claimant submitted a false or fraudulent affidavit to the panel. It is for this reason that I give the letters, ostensibly from the claimant's wife,23 both unsworn and unaccompanied by an identity document, no weight. The letter from XXXX XXXX,24 is not sworn, nor was XXXX put forward as a witness. I give this document little weight in corroborating the allegations of the claimant. The claimant filed some photographs at the sitting on November 17, 2016 of some unidentified individuals, ostensibly in XXXX, whom he claims to be his wife and sons.25 I have no idea who the people are in these photos or when or where they were taken. I give them no weight in corroborating the allegations of the claimant. The same holds true for the photos submitted of the claimant ostensibly of his village in Turkey.26 I give them no weight.\nMedical evidence filed in this claim\nLetter from Dr XXXX XXXX\n[36] The claimant has filed four items of medical evidence which I will consider. First, he filed a letter, ostensibly from a doctor in Turkey, written in 2012, well after the claimant had been here in Canada27. This document indicates that the claimant was brought to the XXXX State hospital on XXXX XXXX, 1998, early in the morning, as he had been hit on the head and injured. Five stitches were administered. This is not the actual record of the claimant's hospital admission; it is merely a letter from a doctor ostensibly indicating the doctor's recollection of treating the claimant fully 14 years after the alleged incident. It is not on hospital letterhead, nor does it indicate that the claimant was injured as a result of being assaulted by a gun butt by special commandoes. Additionally, some testimony regarding this document was elicited at the claimant's first refugee hearing.\nCOUNSEL: Right. So how did you get this letter from the doctor last year?\nCLAIMANT: Because I went to the same hospital. That doctor knew me.\nCOUNSEL: So how did you contact the doctor to get the letter last year when you're in Canada?\nCLAIMANT: I told my brother, older brother XXXX XXXX about the situation. I told my brother that I need the report. I told him to go to the same doctor and ask him for the report.28\nThis testimony about the claimant's relationship with the doctor causes me to wonder about the impartiality of the doctor and the provenance of the letter. I note as well that the claimant did not obtain this document, but his brother did and we have little information regarding how it was obtained. These issues, combined with the aforementioned concerns I have with the document leads me to give it little weight.\nLetter from Dr. XXXX\n[37] The claimant also submitted a report from Dr. XXXX XXXX, a doctor here in Canada, to corroborate his allegation of having been assaulted by a XXXX in 1998.29 This is regarding the same incident referred to in the letter from Dr. XXXX, but Dr. XXXX report goes further. He states that the claimant told him\n\"that in 1998 his village was raided by commando soldiers and he was severely beaten. A rifle butt was smashed into his face. He required hospitalization and suturing of a large laceration.\"\nDr. XXXX then concluded that the claimant's scar was consistent with the claimant's history of beating and laceration. The claimant was questioned about this document at his first hearing, and his evidence was inconsistent. The PIF indicates that the claimant was injured in XXXX of 1998 when XXXX raided his home. However, the letter from Dr. XXXX indicates that this incident occurred when village was raided, an incident which the PIF places as occurring in 1993. The previous member questioned the claimant about this issue:\nCLAIMANT: I told the doctor that the raid was took place to my - that they raided my home. I told that to the doctor.\nPRESIDING MEMBER: So do you have an explanation why he's indicating that you told him that in 1998 your village was raided by XXXX soldiers as opposed to your home being raided?\nCLAIMANT: That time I told the doctor that the raid was took place to my home, on my home. The raid was took place on my home.\nPRESIDING MEMBER: Okay. So you don't know why he would have typed up this letter for you indicating that you had told him that it was a village raid?\nCLAIMANT: No, I have no any idea why it's like that. 30\nDr. XXXX accepted the claimant's account of what occurred in Turkey to be credible. I have not found the claimant to be so, on a balance of probabilities. The claimant's account of how he obtained this injury is not consistent with his PIF. I am unable to conclude that the injuries seen by Dr. XXXX are casually connected to the incidents alleged by the claimant. I therefore give this document little weight in corroborating the allegations of the claimant.\nPsychological report by Dr. XXXX\n[38] The claimant provided a report from Dr. XXXX XXXX XXXX, dated February 24, 2016.31 Dr. XXXX diagnosed the claimant as suffering from \"major depressive disorder of moderate severity and post-traumatic stress disorder.\"32\n[39] I note that while Dr. XXXX interviewed the claimant, the doctor's report does not establish satisfactorily or persuasively that the claimant's experiences are a result of what he is alleging in respect of his refugee claim. I note that that Dr. XXXX opinions are based solely on evidence provided to him by the claimant. Given that the claimant lacks credibility on the central elements of his claim, I am unable to conclude that there is a causal relationship between the doctor's findings and the facts found in the claimant's request for refugee protection.\n[40] In addition, I note as well the case of Czesak33 where Justice Annis discusses the utility of expert evidence obtained for the purpose of litigation and particularly, that obtained for use in proceedings before administrative tribunals. The court said the following:\nThis is not to say that every expert report prepared for litigation should be dismissed as having no, or little, weight. But what the court's experience with forensic experts does suggest in relation to these reports being proffered before administrative tribunals where there exists no defined procedure to allow for their validation, is that caution should be exercised in accepting them at face value, particularly when they propose to settle important issues to be decided by the tribunal. In my view therefore, unless there is some means to corroborate either the neutrality or lack of self-interest of the expert in relation to the litigation process, they generally should be accorded little weight.\nI accept and adopt the court's reasoning in Czesak.\n[41] Further, as stated in Danailov,34 with respect to the assessment of a physician's evidence and the question of the assessment of credibility, \"that opinion evidence is only as valid as the truth of the facts on which they are based.\"\n[42] I am mindful that making a claim for refugee protection and its process can be stressful for any claimant. I am cognizant of the many difficulties faced by a claimant in establishing a claim, including cultural factors, the milieu of the hearing room, and the stress inherent in responding to oral questions through an interpreter. I have taken these considerations into account in arriving at negative credibility findings. However, a report from a doctor claiming that the claimant is suffering from psychological conditions cannot remedy the significant flaws in the evidence of the claimant. I note as well that Dr. XXXX report indicates that the claimant is not currently employed (as of January 2016). This was contradicted by the claimant, who testified that with the exception of a short period of time when he arrived in Canada, he has always been employed here. It was rather a source of pride for the claimant and he clearly enjoys his work. The claimant said he did not tell Dr. XXXX he was unemployed and I therefore also find that Dr. XXXX embellished his report to make the claimant appear more psychologically incapacitated than he actually is.\n[43] I have found the claimant's allegations to lack credibility. As stated in Rokni,35 a psychiatric report submitted as evidence \"cannot possibly serve as a cure-all for any and all deficiencies in a claimant's testimony\". As a result, I give the report minimal weight in terms of establishing the claimant's allegations or explaining the concerns with his credibility.\nLetter from Dr. XXXX\n[44] The claimant submitted a letter from one Dr. XXXX XXXX, dated November 3, 2016.36 Dr. XXXX diagnosed the claimant as having anxiety and depression, and he is treating him with psychotherapy and anti-depressant medication, and the claimant showed some improvement in symptoms. The doctor further stated:\n\"I strongly believe that if he can unite with his family, his symptoms will be resolved and he will be more productive person [sic].\nI would highly appreciate if any help can be given to this gentleman to bring his family to live with him here in Canada.\"37\nDr. XXXX does not attribute the claimant's anxiety and depression to his experiences in Turkey, but it appears that he believes the problem is caused by the claimant's separation from his family. The claimant corroborated the treatment being provided by Dr. XXXX, and I accept that the claimant is receiving this treatment from Dr. XXXX as alleged. I find Dr. XXXX report to be candid and I accept it as evidence of the claimant's psychological distress as a result of being apart from his family. However, it does not corroborate the claimant's allegations about what happened back in Turkey, it does not overcome my previous credibility concerns, nor does it bolster the claimant's credibility regarding the allegations in his refugee claim, and I give it little weight.\nIndicators of a lack of subjective fear\n[45] Many of the claimant's actions strongly undermine his allegations of fear in Turkey. Notwithstanding the alleged persecution experienced by his family members going back many years, and persecution he himself experienced, the claimant made repeated trips out of Turkey and consistently re-availed. He stated that his family was in Turkey and he needed to be with them. I find this explanation to be dubious and inconsistent with a well-founded fear. I find that the claimant's actions undermine his allegations of persecution in Turkey.\nConclusion on credibility\n[46] The claimant was not a credible or reliable witness in these proceedings. His evidence was rife with new allegations which had been omitted from his narrative, contradictions, evasions and embellishments. I do not accept that his allegations of persecution in Turkey occurred as described if at all. I have little strong evidence placing the claimant in Turkey during the times when he was allegedly having such difficulty there, and I am particularly troubled by the ten year gap in information I referred to earlier. The claimant is not credible on a balance of probabilities. His story is likely something rather different than the one he would have me believe and he was not truthful regarding what he fears back home. I do, however accept that he is Kurdish and Alevi and I will consider his claim on the basis of this residual profile.\nDoes the claimant have a well-founded fear of persecution in Turkey or is he a person in need of protection?\n[47] The claimant's account of persecution in Turkey was not credible. I have considered his risk as an Alevi Kurd from the restive areas of Turkey in considering his forward looking risk but I am unable to conclude that this profile would be sufficient for a grant of asylum.\n[48] The United Kingdom Home Office has a number of very helpful documents regarding the current situation for Kurds and Alevis in Turkey. Kurds represent 17% of Turkish society and are the largest ethnic group in that country.38 In the past, Kurds have experienced discrimination in the areas of language and education, but the Turkish government has taken steps to address the concerns of the Kurdish minority.39 Although there have been instances where demonstrations involving Kurds have been disrupted in a heavy-handed way by the authorities, this approach is not limited to protests or demonstrations involving Kurds. Ultimately, the UK Home Office concludes:\nEven when taken cumulatively the discrimination faced by Kurds does not in general amount to them being subject to action on the part either of the populace or the authorities which would amount to persecution within the terms of the Refugee Convention or otherwise inhuman or degrading treatment40.\nThe situation in Turkey has certainly become more fraught since the coup in July of 2016, and I have considered counsel's recent and extensive documentary evidence41 when considering the risk to Alevi Kurds in Turkey at the current time. However, even taking into account this extensive documentary evidence, I cannot find that all Alevi Kurds are currently at risk in Turkey.\n[49] As for the situation of Alevis, they too have experienced some minor discrimination, described in another Home Office report as follows:\nThe government considers Alevism a heterodox Muslim sect and Alevi places of worship are not officially recognised ...This means that they do not receive financial support from the state and Alevis also experience difficulties in establishing new places of worship. This does not, however, prevent Alevis in practice from worshipping in buildings which do not have legal place of worship status...\nAlevis also face unequal treatment in education...and Alevis, along with a few other minority religious groups, are unable to state their religious identity on national identity cards because their groups are not listed as options.\nThere are also a small number of reports of ill-treatment by the authorities, primarily as a result of the police using excessive force in responding to demonstrations involving Alevis and the Alevi community's perception that they are subject to discriminatory language, including by members of the government.42\nI am unable to conclude that the discrimination faced by Alevi Kurds, even when considered cumulatively, rises to the level of persecution. The Home Office concluded thus:\nEven when taken cumulatively, the treatment faced by Alevis does not in general amount to them being subject to action on the part of either non-state actors or the authorities which would amount to persecution or serious harm. 43\nThe documentary evidence both in the NDP and submitted by counsel establishes that some Kurdish Alevis may experience problems but I cannot find that all do. There is case law to back me up on this point, and although it is with respect to the situation of Roma in Europe, I find it to be analogous as it deals with the residual profile of a refugee claimant based on ethnicity.\n[50] I quote with approval from Madam Justice Strickland of the Federal Court in Dudu.44 This is a case about Roma from Hungary, and it is squarely on point due to its discussion of discrimination amounting to persecution:\nHere, however, all of the documentary evidence cited by the Applicants is essentially consistent with the Board's conclusion in that it shows that serious discrimination may rise to the level of persecution in Hungary. However, it does not establish that the discrimination faced by Roma in Hungary rises to the level of persecution for all and every Roma (emphasis added).\nSimilarly, in Birkas45 Justice Zinn of the Federal Court ruled that a claim based only on a single profile can only succeed if a claimant establishes that all persons with their profile (all Kurdish Alevis from Turkey in the present case) have a well-founded fear of persecution under section 96 of the Act or establish a risk or danger under section 97. As a result, in this particular case, I find that the claimant's risk profile as an Alevi Kurd is insufficient to ground a claim for refugee protection.\nCONCLUSION\n[51] The claimant was not credible regarding material elements of his claim, as noted above. I find that the profile of the claimant is not indicative of more than a mere possibility for forward looking risk.\n[52] Having considered all of the evidence, I find that the claimant has not satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility or reasonable chance of persecution on a Convention ground, or that, on a balance of probabilities, he would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life, or face a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, if he were to return to Turkey.\n[53] The claim is therefore rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Catherine Gaudet\"\nCatherine Gaudet\nJanuary 18, 2017\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27 as amended\n2 Exhibit 2\n3 Exhibit # 18\n4 Exhibit # 24\n5 Exhibit 9 at page 14; Exhibit # 17\n6 Exhibit # 9\n7 Exhibit # 9 at page 210\n8 Exhibit #2 at paragraph 14\n9 Exhibit #19\n10 Exhibit #22\n11 Exhibit #19 at page 20\n12 Exhibit #18\n13 Exhibit #12, page 99\n14 Exhibit #19 at page 20\n15 Exhibit #9, at pages 1-2\n16 Exhibit #19 at page 4\n17 Exhibit #19 at p 10\n18 Exhibit #19 at page 25\n19 Exhibit #23 at page 1\n20 Exhibit #10, pp 221-222\n21 Ibid, at page 222\n22 Exhibit #12, page 4\n23 Exhibit # 9, pages 3-5, and item 16\n24 Exhibit # 9, pages 6-10\n25 Exhibit # 23\n26 Exhibit # 10, pages 230-239\n27 Exhibit # 9 pages 1 and 2\n28 Exhibit # 9 pgs 264-265\n29 Exhibit # 8\n30 Exhibit # 1 pages 253-254\n31 Exhibit # 16\n32 ibid\n33 Czesak v.

The Principal Claimant was appointed as the Designated Representative for the Minor Claimants. The Principal Claimant and Male Claimant testified on behalf of the entire family.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimants' allegations are set out in the narrative attached to the Principal Claimant's Basis of Claim (\"BOC\") form2, amended on November 7, 20163 and December 19, 2016.4 The claimants allege that they are citizens of Nigeria residing in the municipality of XXXX located in Delta state. The Principal Claimant alleges that she is a XXXX by occupation. The Principal Claimant alleges that in XXXX 2016 she was XXXX XXXX at a party when she overheard a conversation by some party attendants who were planning to blow up oil pipelines. The claimants allege that these individuals belonged to the Niger Delta Avengers, a militant group in their state. The Principal Claimant alleges that upon overhearing their plans she decided to speak out to the group members about the damage their actions would do to Nigeria. The Principal Claimant felt the need to do this because the group was primarily composed of youth, being 18 or 19 year old men. She alleges that at the conclusion of the party she was warned to never speak of what she heard to anyone and was given extra money.\n[4] The claimants allege that the proposed attacks overheard by the Principal Claimant actually took place. They allege that after the police arrested some of the perpetrators, some Avengers became suspicious that the Principal Claimant reported their overheard conversation. The claimants allege that they then approached the police for protection and reported what they heard at the party and the recent threats against them. They allege Nigerian police have been corrupted by the Avengers and may have actually assisted the Avengers to locate the family's whereabouts in southern Nigeria. The claimants allege that the Avengers are continuing to look for them in order to exact revenge.\nANALYSIS\n[5] The determinative issues were the credibility of the claimants' account.\nIdentity\n[6] When the claimants made their inland claim, they did not have their Nigerian passports (which they explained were taken by their agent without their consent). Instead they presented photocopies of the first page of each of their biographical data page.\n[7] The claimants filed considerable disclosure of personal documents to support their case. None of the packages included photocopies of the remaining pages of their passports.\n[8] In the hearing room, the claimants provided their original Nigerian passports in response to one of my questions.5 The photographs in the passports match the claimants' visual representation in the hearing room. I had no concerns that the originals presented to me were anything other than their authentic Nigerian passports. I find that they attest to the claimants' identities.\n[9] However, this does not end the matter. Significantly, the original passports indicate that the claimants obtained the U.S. visas in XXXX 2016, which was before the Principal Claimant encountered the Avengers and before the claimants' retained an agent to obtain U.S. visas for them as they indicate in the first version of their BOC. The Board and immigration authorities were not privy to this information until these original passports were disclosed in the hearing room in response to one of my questions. I would note when I asked about their passports, the claimants produced a shipping bag from which they proceeded to remove various pieces of clothing, documents and the original passports. The claimants were called upon to explain their conduct.\n[10] The Principal Claimant and Male Claimant testified that the reason they did not have their original Nigerian passports when they were interviewed by the referring Immigration Officer is because their agent took their passports from them and would not give them back because he said they owed him money. The Federal Court has held that the Board is reasonable in not accepting these sort of explanations which generally revolve around smugglers stealing their clients' passports in the absence of further reasonable explanations.6\n[11] In this case, the explanation that the agent took the claimants' passports is also unreasonable because the claimants took no steps to report the unauthorized taking of their passport to the Nigerian Consulate or Canadian police. I specifically reject the claimants' explanation that they did not know how to report such a matter to Canadian police since they had already retained an experienced counsel by the time they submitted their claims.\n[12] If their passports were actually taken as alleged, I would have expected them to contact police and report what is in essence an act of theft, either in Canada or the U.S.\n[13] When I asked the claimants how they re-obtained their passports, they testified that the passports were sent to them by Ms. XXXX from Nigeria after their debt to the agent was paid. An original UPS shipping label which accompanied the passports indicates that the package was sent on October 24, 2016. The claimants testified they received the package about a week later, in either late October or early November 2016. When I queried why all of the claimants' December 2016 disclosure omitted the complete passports, the claimants explained that they did not notice the passports in the package until recently because they were wrapped and hidden by the Principal Claimant's catering uniforms. I reject this explanation as not credible. I do not believe that the claimants did not have the opportunity until their hearing was actually taking place to empty the contents of their shipping bag and separate the various pieces of clothing from the various documents and passports. There are otherwise indications that the claimants in fact reviewed these passports and acted on the information within them. On November 7, 2016, the claimants amended their BOC to remove the reference to their agent obtaining U.S. visas for them.7 This was around the same time as the purported arrival of the original passports according to the claimants.\n[14] The November 7, 2016 BOC amendment was significant because the original passports indicate that the Principal Claimant's and Minor Claimants' U.S. visas were issued in XXXX 2016, before the agent was retained by the family to allegedly obtain the U.S. visas as indicated by the original BOC.8 The Male Claimant was issued his visa on XXXX XXXX, 2016, which is also before the alleged retention of the agent. Of course, the Board had no access to this significant visa information until the actual hearing took place and only in response to my direct question.\n[15] I find that the conduct of the Principal Claimant and Male Claimant indicates that they intentionally withheld their original passports from examination by Canada's immigration authorities and the Board until the last possible minute, which in this case resulted in the original passports being produced in the hearing room. This is not acceptable. I draw an adverse inference as to the Claimants' general credibility due to their failure to reasonably explain their failure to produce their original passports in a timely fashion before the hearing in accordance with the Rules.\nBOC amendment concerning U.S. Visa not credible\n[16] As stated earlier, the claimants amended their BOC on November 7, 2016 to remove the reference to their agent obtaining U.S. visas on their behalf. They testified that they applied for U.S. visas before the trouble with the Avengers started because they wanted to go on holidays.\n[17] I asked the claimants why they erroneously wrote in their BOC that the agent obtain U.S. visas for them in the first place. They explained that the error was discovered on the date of the interview with Citizenship and Immigration Canada, on November 1, 2016 when they were told to go to their counsel. They otherwise blamed the oversight on stress. I reject these explanations as unreasonable. The date of the interview was a month after the original BOC was signed. The original BOC indicates that they had counsel and an interpreter to assist them with the drafting of the original BOC that contained the error. I also do not accept \"stress\" as a valid reason. While the Principal Claimant had a medical report that may explain some deficiencies in her testimony and memory, the Male Claimant is medically \"fine\" according to his testimony (no expert report was filed on his behalf). The two adult claimants drafted the original BOC together. I would have expected the Male Claimant to catch the statement about the agents obtaining visas at the outset because it is clearly not true and is replicated in more than one area of the BOC. At is turns out, the amendment was only signed in or around the purported arrival date of the original passports which contradicted the claimants, which were at any rate not disclosed to the Board in the hearing room. I draw an adverse inference as to the general credibility of the claimants from the lack of reasonable explanations for how this mistake in the BOC came to be and how the amendment came about.\nEvidence concerning principal claimant's sister or cousin is fraudulent\n[18] On December 19, 2016 the claimants amended the BOC again by changing only one area in the narrative that described the relationship between the Principal Claimant and a person who was visited by the Avengers because she harboured the claimants, from \"sister\" to \"cousin\" (I note that the old moniker appears in another area of the amended BOC).9 When I asked the claimants to explain the reason for this change, they explained that the individual, XXXX XXXX XXXX, is more like a cousin to the Principal Claimant, the way it would be understood in Canada, rather than an actual sister (as in descendant from the same parents). They noticed this deficiency in the BOC fairly late in the process. I reject this explanation as unreasonable. If the claimants had honestly believed that Ms. XXXX is the principal claimant's sister, they would have listed her as a sister on page 7 of the BOC. If they were unclear, they should have provided more detail and explanation in the BOC narrative. They did neither. The claimants had an opportunity to amend their BOC in November 2016 when they changed the role of the agent concerning their U.S. visas. They were represented by experienced counsel throughout. I find it unreasonable that the Male Claimant (assisting the Principal Claimant), after being in Canada and instructing counsel for several weeks, would not have sought to correct this discrepancy.\n[19] The affidavit purportedly sworn by Ms. XXXX on December 28, 2016 states that she is the \"Older Sister\" of the principal claimant.10 The claimants explained the discrepancy by again pointing to cultural differences. I reject this explanation as unreasonable. The Principal Claimant has a few sisters listed in her BOC, all younger. I find that by Ms. XXXX use of the descriptor \"Older\" in front of \"Sister\", she clearly sought to identify herself as an older sibling of the Principal Claimant. This descriptor is inconsistent with the Principal Claimant's changes to the BOC. The claimants had not adduced documentary evidence concerning cultural naming practices in Nigeria for siblings or cousins. In the absence of such evidence and a reasonable explanation for the inconsistencies above, I find that a negative inference with respect to the claimants' general credibility is reasonable and appropriate.\n[20] Ms. XXXX is a central character in the alleged events. She provided sanctuary to the claimants. The avengers came to Ms. XXXX house to look for the claimants. She later warned the claimants about the Avengers' visit. I do not find it credible that such a significant discrepancy in the description of the relationship between the Principal Claimant and Ms. XXXX would arise in the following ways in light of this person's importance to the claimants:\na) between the original BOC11 and the November 7, 201612 and the December 19, 2016 amended BOCs13;\nb) within the latest amended version of the BOC which removed only one reference to \"sister\" but which did not remove another reference to \"sister\" at page 4;\nc) between the various BOCs14, which do not include the descriptor \"Older\" and the affidavit of Ms. XXXX;15 and,\nd) internally within the Principal Claimant's testimony when she spoke about contacting Ms. XXXX, identified in her oral testimony as her \"sister\" (after she explained to me why cousin was correct descriptor).\n[21] There were also discrepancies between the address of Ms. XXXX declared in her affidavit16 which states \"XXXX XXXX XXXX.\", the amended Schedule A form which states \"XXXX XXXX XXXX\"17 and the address on the shipping label of the original documents purportedly sent by Ms. XXXX to the claimants which states \"XXXX XXXX XXXX.\"18 The claimants explained that numbers XXXX and XXXX XXXX are twin buildings; Ms. XXXX lives in a flat and the correct address is XXXX XXXX. With respect to the different address on the label, the Principal Claimant confirmed that this is the address of her restaurant\/catering business but she does not know why Ms. XXXX shipped the package from that location. I do not accept this explanation as reasonable, that the claimants (especially the Male Claimant who does not have a medical condition) would not know which building number the Principal Claimant's sister or cousin lived in, especially since they allegedly stayed there for a few days recently in late XXXX 2016. I do not find it reasonable for the claimants to have no idea why Ms. XXXX is using the Principal Claimant's restaurant address when she deposes in her affidavit that she lives elsewhere. This is a serious inconsistency that casts doubt on whether Ms. XXXX lives anywhere on XXXX XXXX. as alleged by the claimants and on the credibility of their account of fleeing from agents of persecution, as they alleged to have been in hiding at Ms. XXXX residence. I draw an adverse inference as to the general credibility of the claimants from these inconsistencies and their failure to provide reasonable explanations.\n[22] I find that the affidavit by Ms. XXXX is fraudulent based on the above inconsistencies and failure to adduce reasonable explanations. I draw an adverse inference as to the general credibility of the claimants from the submission of a fraudulent document that relates to a substantive portion of their claims. I find that the claimants have failed to adduce with credible evidence that Ms. XXXX exists and her familial relationship to the Principal Claimant. I find that the claimants have failed to adduce sufficient credible evidence to establish Ms. XXXX purported address and that the claimants stayed with her for a few days in or around XXXX XXXX, 2016 as alleged. I do not believe the allegations or testimony of the claimants that the Avengers asked Ms. XXXX about the claimants when they were staying with her and that consequently they fled to XXXX, Lagos.\nAffidavit of XXXX XXXX is fraudulent\n[23] The claimants submitted an affidavit from XXXX XXXX, a neighbour of the claimants, that speaks to some of the events that happened after the claimants fled.19 She states as follows:\n8. That since they had left their house the police has been to XXXX and XXXX house on three occasions to ask of their return. They have also questioned the village numbers(sic) about contacting her because they have threatened to deal with her.\n9. That XXXX called me in late XXXX 2016 to thank me for my assistance and she advised that they were in Canada.\n10. That after the police efused(sic) to help especially because we are no longer in Nigeria.\n[Emphasis added]\n[24] This affidavit indicates that the police have been looking for the Principal Claimant and threatened her. The claimants testified that they made two reports to the police; in the first report the police just listened and in the second report the police advised the claimants to flee. The claimants are not surprised that the police are after them. When I pointed out that the allegation of police as an agent of persecution is not in the BOC, the claimants explained that they only learned about this issue recently. I reject this explanation as unreasonable. The claimants were asked at the start of the hearing to confirm their BOC and the previous amendments. They were asked if there were other changes and they responded in the negative. The transformation of a specific police unit from a mere inadequate and corrupt agent of state protection, into a full-fledged agent of persecution is a major change to the BOC that should have been raised at the outset of the hearing. I draw an adverse inference as to the claimants' general credibility from this BOC omission. Furthermore, counsel has not referred me to any specific documentation that corroborates persecutory behaviour by Nigerian police on behalf of the Avengers against common citizens. I do not believe that paragraph 8 of Ms. XXXX affidavit is credible.\n[25] Furthermore, paragraph 10 of Ms. XXXX affidavit is absurd. First, it refers to \"we\" seeking police help which was refused, because \"we\" are no longer in Nigeria. This choice of words is dubious because Ms. XXXX, the author of the affidavit and presumably who she refers to as \"we\", is in Nigeria at the time of the swearing of her affidavit. Second, there is no allegation that the claimants sought police protection from the same police while outside of Nigeria. The claimants could not explain paragraph 10. I find the claimants' lack of an explanation to be unreasonable because the Principal Claimant purportedly spoke to Ms. XXXX in late XXXX 2016 from outside of Nigeria (according to para. 9 of the affidavit), before this affidavit was allegedly commissioned. I do not believe that if Ms. XXXX was a real witness to these events and she spoke to the Principal Claimant in late XXXX that she would have sworn to the truth of paragraph 10 which is at best confusing and at worst absurd. There is also an obvious spelling error in the word \"efused\" which further casts doubt that this is an authentic factual detailing. Based on those deficiencies and the absence of reasonable explanations, I find that Ms. XXXX affidavit is fraudulent. I do not know who Ms. XXXX is. I do not believe what is written in that affidavit. I draw an adverse inference as to the claimants' general credibility from the submission of a fraudulent document in support of a substantive part of their claim.\nClaimants not generally credible\n[26] Based on the above credibility findings I find the claimants to be generally not credible. I find that the adverse credibility findings which go to the core of their claim extend throughout their evidence. The claimants seriously damaged their credibility by submitting fraudulent documentation. I do not believe what the claimants say in support of their claim generally.\nAffidavit of XXXX XXXX not sufficient to ground claim\n[27] The claimants submitted an affidavit from XXXX XXXX that speaks to their troubles with the Avengers, his assistance to them including letting them stay in his house, and arranging an agent to take them to Canada.20 I find that this affidavit is insufficient by itself to ground the claim in light of the serious credibility issues that afflict the claimants' evidence. Much of Mr. XXXX evidence is a recitation of what the claimants told him. I have already found the claimants not credible. The fact that another person is reciting the same story back does not cure the lack of credibility. I also note that Mr. XXXX repeats the same mistake as Ms. XXXX and the claimants in their original BOC when he refers to the claimants being at \"XXXX(sic) Sisters house\". I already found that the claimants could not establish with credible evidence that Ms. XXXX exists, her relationship to the Principal Claimant and where she lives. I found that Ms. XXXX affidavit was fraudulent. The repetition of the erroneous characterization of Ms. XXXX as a \"Sister\" along with a spelling error as set out above casts serious doubt over the authenticity of Mr. XXXX affidavit. Consequently, I do not believe what Mr. XXXX says in support of the claimants. I assign no evidentiary weight to this document.\nPsychological report does not allay credibility problems\n[28] The Principal Claimant filed a psychological report from Dr. XXXX XXXX in support of her claim.21 Dr. XXXX diagnoses the Principal Claimant with major depressive disorder of moderate severity and posttraumatic stress disorder. Dr. XXXX recommends that the Principal Claimant be granted breaks and understanding for any lapses in memory or disorganization.\n[29] In the course of the hearing I endeavoured to provide the Principal Claimant with breaks as needed. I also allowed the claimants to testify as a panel, allowing the Male Claimant to testify on the Principal Claimant's behalf when she felt uncomfortable and later allowed the Principal Claimant to comment and add more evidence as required.\n[30] I find that this report does not explain the claimants' general lack of credibility, which was based primarily on the submission of fraudulent documentation and their deceitful conduct concerning their passports. While some understanding should be given to the Principal Claimant with respect to the BOC amendments, I find that her medical condition does not excuse the problematic nature of those amendments because she was at all times assisted by the medically \"fine\" Male Claimant in the drafting and amendments to the BOC as well as by counsel and an interpreter.\n[31] In regard to my analysis on the matter of an internal flight alternative for the claimants, I also find that the report is not helpful in addressing the reasonableness of the IFA as it does not deal with the question of the impact of the Principal Claimant, the Minor Claimants and the Male Claimant together relocating to other parts of Nigeria in the context of their unique personal circumstances.\nMANIFESTLY UNFOUNDED CLAIM\n[32] Section 107.1 of the IRPA reads:\nIf the Refugee Protection Division rejects a claim for refugee protection, it must state in its reasons for the decision that the claim is manifestly unfounded if it is of the opinion that the claim is clearly fraudulent.\n[33] The panel finds that the false representations made by the claimants relate to the central elements of their claim for protection. They substantively go to the actual story of persecution and the events that surround the persecution.\n[34] The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Position on Manifestly Unfounded Applications for Asylum has provided the following guidance on this topic:\nThe Office has stated that the notion of \"clearly fraudulent\" could reasonably cover situations where the applicant deliberately attempts to deceive the authorities determining refugee status. The mere fact of having made false statements to the authorities does not, however, necessarily exclude a well-founded fear of persecution and vitiate the need for asylum, thus making the claim \"clearly fraudulent.\" Only if the applicant makes what appear to be false allegations of a material or substantive nature relevant for the determination of his or her status could the claim be considered \"clearly fraudulent.\"22\n[Emphasis added]\n[35] In Warsame v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)23 Justice Roy stated the following about manifestly unfounded claims:\nParliament chose to require that the claim be \"clearly fraudulent\" for particular consequences to flow. That would entail that it is the claim itself that is assessed as being fraudulent, and not the fact that the applicant would have used, for instance, fraudulent documents to get out of the country of origin or to gain access to Canada. However, once making a claim for refugee protection, the applicant would have to operate with clean hands and statements in support of the claim have to be accurate or they could be held against the claimant. In other words, the claimant would be attempting to gain refugee protection through falsehoods that may make the claim fraudulent. It is the claim that must be fraudulent.24\n[Emphasis added]\n[36] For all of the reasons that I have discussed, I find on a balance of probabilities that the basis of each of the claims is not credible.\n[37] Moreover, I find that the claimants have not operated with clean hands. Their dishonesty, evidenced by the submission of fraudulent documents, happened after the claims for refugee protection were commenced and concerned the material or substantive nature of the claims. The failure to provide the original passports earlier, or at least to send copies before the hearing, indicates that they attempted to deceive the Board until the last possible minute.\n[38] Also, given the claimants' submission of fraudulent documents that are of a material or substantive nature and relevant to the determination of their claims, I also find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claims are clearly fraudulent. Therefore, I find that the claims are manifestly unfounded.\nCONCLUSION\n[39] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that there is not a serious possibility that the claimants would be persecuted in Nigeria, or that, on a balance of probabilities, they would be subject personally to a danger of torture or to a risk to life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Nigeria.\n[40] I find that the claims are manifestly unfounded. They are clearly fraudulent.\n[41] I conclude that the refugee claims of the Minor Claimants were tied to the Principal Claimant's claim. They were entirely based on the allegations advanced by the Principal Claimant and the Male Claimant. The claimants did not allege a separate basis for the Minor Claimants' fear of persecution. Accordingly, I dismiss their claims for the same reasons as the claims of the Principal Claimants and the Male Claimant, that is, due to the credibility concerns and manifest unfoundedness.\n[42] I conclude that the claimants are not Convention refugees. For the same reasons, the allegations do not give rise to successful claims under section 97(1) of the IRPA. I conclude that the claimants are not persons in need of protection. I therefore reject their claims. The claims are manifestly unfounded.\n(signed)\n\"YONATAN ROZENSZAJN\"\nYONATAN ROZENSZAJN\nJanuary 23, 2017\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n2 Exhibit 2, BOC.\n3 Exhibit 9, page 66.\n4 Exhibit 10, pages 3.\n5 Exhibit 14.\n6 Elazi v.

He claims he fears returning to Turkey due to his religion (Alevi), ethnicity (Kurdish) and his real or imputed \"anti-government\" political opinion. He fears harm at the hands of the Turkish state and society at large, and he is claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] In his Basis of Claim Form (BOC)1 and port of entry (POE) documents,2 the claimant alleges that:\n* He is an Alevi Kurd from XXXX, Turkey.\n* He studied at university from 2012 until XXXX 2014. He was the victim of attacks by Islamist jihadists and supporters of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP).\n* He did not work after university.\n* In XXXX 2013 he was arrested while protesting in support of XXXX XXXX. He was held for one day at the police station.\n* He has been a member of the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) since XXXX 2014. He was also a supporter of his local Alevi Association.\n* He was arrested during a demonstration in XXXX in support of Kurds in XXXX 2014. He was detained at security headquarters where his picture was taken and he was beaten twice. He was released after one day.\n* He was arrested on XXXX XXXX 2015 while celebrating XXXX. He was held for three days and beaten.\n* He was arrested in XXXX 2016 while participating in XXXX celebration. He was held for almost two days and subjected to severe torture.\n* Following his release he was followed by plainclothes police and also started to receive threatening telephone calls.\n* He obtained a passport in XXXX 2016.\n* He departed Turkey on XXXX XXXX 2016 and traveled to Mexico via Russia and Cuba. He entered the United States of America (USA) illegally and was apprehended there on XXXX XXXX 2016 and a made an asylum claim. He was released on bail on XXXX XXXX 2016 and came to Canada on or about XXXX XXXX 2016. He was allowed to enter into Canada because he has a maternal uncle in Canada.\n* He fears returning to Turkey because post-coup attempt the HDP have been targeted by the Turkish government and president. Hundreds of HDP members have been arrested. As a party member he will face risk and danger.\nDECISION\n[3] The panel finds that the claimant is not a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\nPersonal Identity\n[4] The panel is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has established his personal identity both as a citizen of Turkey and as an Alevi Kurd based on his testimony and on true copies of a genuine Turkish passport and identity card (at Exhibit 1), and a letter from the XXXX XXXX Community and Information Centre (at Exhibit 8) dated 2 February 2017 indicting that the claimant, to the best of their knowledge, is of a Kurdish descent.\nCredibility\n[5] The panel finds the claimant not credible on material aspects of his claim (i.e. that he is considered to be known Kurdish political activist by the Turkish authorities who has previously been arrested and tortured) due to numerous material inconsistencies, omissions and implausibilties in his evidence.\nMaterial inconsistencies\n[6] In his narrative the claimant mentioned being arrested and detained four times since 2013 and even been subjected to brutal torture. In Schedule A, however, when asked if he has ever been detained, incarcerated or put in jail he states \"no.\" When asked about this material inconsistency he said the Schedule A form was wrong.\n[7] The claimant was interviewed at the POE by an officer on XXXX XXXX 2016. The claimant requested and was provided with a Turkish interpreter. The interview notes are four and a half pages long and the claimant was asked numerous questions. One question he was asked was: \"Have you ever been arrested, charged or convicted of any crimes or offense or subject of any criminal proceedings in any country at any time?\" He responded \"No but I have been under observation by police, because I am a Kurd.\" When asked at the hearing about this materially inconsistent answer he said that the interpreter at the POE did not accurately interpret his answers.\n[8] On file is information from the USA Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) which shows that the claimant made an asylum claim in the USA and had a credible basis hearing. However, when the claimant was asked at the POE in Canada whether or not he had made an asylum claim in the USA he responded \"No. They questioned me but I did not apply for anything there.\" When he was further asked: \"Why did you not make an asylum claim in the United States?\" he responded: \"I have nobody there.\" When asked at the hearing about this material inconsistency in his evidence he said that the interpreter at the POE did not accurately interpret his answers.\n[9] The claimant was asked at the POE: \"Why are you asking for Canada's protection today?\" And he responded \"My uncle lives here and the living standards are good here.\" When he was further prodded by the officer with the question \"OK. But why do you need Canada's protection, what do you fear?\" he responded: \"I am a Turkish citizen but I am Kurdish and am afraid of living there.\" When the claimant asked about these material inconsistencies\/omissions (in other words why did he not state that he had been arrested and severely mistreated in Turkey) said he mentioned all of his detentions in Turkey at the POE interview but the interpreter was inaccurate. He elaborated that the interpreter had an accent and was not a local Turk and did not speak Turkish well (at Exhibit 7 is a letter from a distant relative of the claimant which states that he believes the interpreter at the POE may have been Armenian).\n[10] In his narrative the claimant says he has been a member of the HDP since XXXX 2014. In his Schedule A form however it indicates that he was a member of the HDP since XXXX 2007. When asked about this inconsistency at the hearing the claimant said the Schedule A form was wrong.\n[11] The panel finds that the claimant has not adequately addressed the material inconsistences between his allegations at the hearing and his statements in the POE interview and in his POE forms. While the panel recognizes that the story in the claimant's narrative is substantially similar to the story he put forward to USA authorities the panel nevertheless also notes numerous and material inconsistencies with his answers at the Canadian POE and his BOC. The panel accepts that interpretation problems do arise and that the purpose of the POE interview is not to establish a refugee protection claim. However, the panel notes that the claimant was asked and answered many questions during his POE interview. Certainly much information seems to have been accurately recorded like, for example, the information concerning the whereabouts and relations to his family members in Canada and the circumstances of his family in Turkey. All these questions appear to be asked and answered accurately. It seems not plausible then that the most significant information - concerning the claimant's arrests, torture and detention in Turkey - was failed to be noted by an incompetent interpreter at the POE and that the answers the claimant provided as to why he was seeking protection in Canada were so different. I note that according to the POE notes the claimant was asked if he had understood the interpreter and whether he understood all the questions that officer had asked. He replied in the affirmative to both questions. He signed a declaration that he read and swears and affirms that all statements are true and accurate.\n[12] The panel does not accept that poor interpretation can adequately explain the numerous inconsistencies that appear. The panel believes, on a balance of probabilities, that if the claimant had been arrested numerous times and subjected to torture at the hands of the Turkish police he would have thought to mention that to the officer at the Canadian border when prompted to speak about his fear in Turkey and it would have been recorded, even if only cursorily so. The panel finds that the claimant has simply attempted to alter his evidence at or just before the hearing stage to align with the story he gave in the US INS notes, which was likely provided to him by the smuggler (to whom his father paid 6K USD).\nFailure to claim in Mexico and the US\n[13] Generally speaking a claimant will advance a protection claim at the earliest available opportunity to do so in a country where it is safe to do so. Absence a reasonable explanation for not doing so, a negative inference may be drawn on the claimant's credibility for lack of genuine subjective fear.\n[14] The claimant arrived in Mexico on or about XXXX XXXX 2016 and stayed there for about a 10 to 12 days. He did not make an asylum claim in Mexico. He then arrived in the USA in or about XXXX 2016. He did make an asylum claim in the USA but did not fully prosecute his asylum claim in the USA. When asked why not the claimant stated that it was always his intention to come to Canada, where he has an uncle.\n[15] The panel does not accept the claimant's explanation as reasonable and finds that this behaviour (i.e. failing to make an asylum claim in Mexico and to fully prosecute his claim in the USA) is inconsistent with possessing a genuine fear of harm at the hands of the Turkish authorities. The panel notes that Mexico and the USA have established and well-developed asylum programs and procedures. The panel draws a negative inference on the claimant's credibility due to his failure to make a claim for asylum in Mexico or the USA.\n[16] The panel finds that the claimant has not adequately explained his failure to make a claim in Mexico or to pursue his asylum claim in the USA. While the panel acknowledges the claimant is a young man who indeed has an uncle residing in Edmonton, Alberta it simply does not make sense that he would not follow through on his asylum claim started in the USA if he truly feared persecution. The claimant cited the need for the assistance of his uncle in Canada but admits that he does not live with his uncle in Edmonton but rather is staying in Toronto. He said that he came to Toronto because his Canadian uncle advised him that it was \"better\" to go to Toronto to make a claim as that was what he had done. Initially the claimant stayed with a distant relative in Toronto for two months and now he stays at his own place (Exhibit 7). On the one hand the claimant alleges that he failed to make a claim in Mexico and to pursue his claim in the USA because he needed to rely on his Canadian uncle for assistance. On the other hand the claimant illegally entered Canada and never resided in Edmonton with his uncle but rather stays in Toronto alone. The panel finds that the claimant was merely forum shopping in his failure to make a claim in either Mexico or the USA and indeed in coming to Canada, and draws a negative inference on his credibility because of his failure to make a claim in either the USA or Mexico.\nExited Turkey on a genuine passport\n[17] The claimant departed Turkey using his own genuine passport. The Board's Responses to Information Requests (RIR) TUR43471.E and TUR105394 (items 14.2 and 14.3, at Exhibit 3) outline the stringent exit controls for international passengers at Turkey's airports and report on the security and law enforcement personnel present and the actions taken in cases where an individual is wanted by the Turkish authorities. The panel wondered how the claimant would have been able to leave Turkey without incident using his own passport if the Turkish police were truly aware of him for being a known Kurdish political activist. When this question was put to the claimant at the hearing he said that the agent his father had engaged the help of an agent who had bribed officials at the airport in Turkey. This assertion is not mentioned in the claimant's narrative nor in Schedule 12 which asks information about any person who facilitated one's journey to Canada and the panel notes that this is a material omission.\n[18] The panel finds this explanation for being able to exit Turkey without even being questioned at the airport inadequate. On the one hand the claimant alleges that he is a known Kurdish political activist and has been persecuted by the Turkish authorities because of his political profile, membership in the HDP and that the Turkish authorities are aware of his previous detentions and had even subjected him to torture; yet on the other hand he asserts that he could leave his country without even being questioned at the airport because an agent bribed airport officials. I find this assertion to not be implausible, given all of the circumstances in this case. While the panel is aware that bribery and trafficking does take place in Turkey I find that given the allegations alleges by this claimant about his profile and given the sensitive security environment exiting in Turkey today I do not find this plausible. I find that had the claimant truly been known by the authorities to be a Kurdish political activist that had he truly been subjected to multiple detentions and torture at the hands of the Turkish police he would not have, on a balance of probabilities, have been able to exit the country using a genuine passport without, at a minimum, being stopped at the airport for close questioning.\nLack of corroborating documents\n[19] In coming to this credibility determination the panel also considered the claimant-specific documents entered into evidence by the claimant (including those at Exhibits 5, 6, 7 and 9 and 11) to support his allegations.\n[20] At Exhibit 5 is a letter from the HDP indicating that he was been a member (since XXXX2014). The panel notes the letter from the HPD (which is not on any letterhead and which is a very brief two sentence letter), does not mention any tasks performed by the claimant on behalf of the party nor any problems he may have experienced due to his membership. The panel believes that if the claimant had suffered the treatment he alleges because of his membership in the HDP or if he would be reasonably likely to suffer future mistreatment in Turkey because of his membership, the HDP letter would mention this.\n[21] Also at Exhibit 5 is a note from a doctor in Turkey. The medical note provided by the claimant was undated, and again on paper without any letter head. The notes states that the claimant \"came to me for psychiatric help on 25 March 2016 because of torture which he suffered. He received therapy on a regular basis when he was not arrested. I am not allowed to provide further information other than the above due to the patients' confidentially rights. This document was arranged and given to his family upon the request of the family.\" Given the numerous unresolved inconsistencies in this case the panel was unable to given any weight to the brief note purporting to be from a medical doctor in Turkey. The panel notes that no information was tendered by any Canadian physician or by the Canadian Center for Victims of Torture, for example.\n[22] The panel was able to assign only little weight to the letters from family members and friends as they were not made available to be witnesses and questioned by the panel. The panel finds a paucity of corroborating documents that it would have expected to see in a claim such as this.\nConclusions on Credibility\n[23] The panel does not find the claimant credible on his material allegations. The panel accepts that the claimant is an Alevi Kurd who may have participated in events celebrating his Kurdish ethnicity\/ ancestry or protesting peacefully Kurdish causes (in Turkey and Canada). However the panel does not accept that the claimant is a Kurdish political activist known to the Turkish authorities who has been arrested, detained and subjected to torture by the police or that he is likely to attract severe harm at the hands of the Turkish authorities for any reason now.\n\"Residual claim\"\n[24] The panel also considered whether the claimant would meet the burden of proving a serious possibility of persecution, or of having a s.97 risk on a balance of probabilities, based solely on being an Alvei Kurd who supports the HDP and finds that he would not.\n[25] The country of origin information submitted by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) and by counsel reveals an increasingly repressive government when it comes to freedom of thought and association generally in Turkey, and also shows a history of discrimination against Alevis and Kurds. There is fairly extensive evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP) at Exhibit 3 indicating that Kurdish political activists and human rights defenders are unduly affected by authorities in Turkey. Moreover, the panel is aware that in the aftermath of the recent failed military coup that took place on 15 July 2016 Turkey has extended a temporary state of emergency and the wide reaching reactions on the part of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) government (which has included mass firings and mass detentions) has heightened the risk of harm certainly for members of Hizmet and arguably for anyone perceived to be antigovernment activist at this time (see Exhibit 10). The panel also acknowledges the recent arrest of the co-HDP leaders. However, I find that the claimant has not proven his political profile as a Kurdish political activist or human rights defender of any sort, nor has he shown on a balance of probabilities that he is a senior member of or supporter of any political party. He simply does not possess a political profile of one who would interest the Turkish authorities and singled out for severe treatment, even post-coup attempt.\n[26] The claimant alleges that he was a member of the HDP. At item 1.11 of Exhibit 3 is the United Kingdom (UK) Home Office's report on Country Information and Guidance Turkey: HDP (Peoples' Democratic Party) published in March 2016. It states:\nThe HDP was formed in 2013 as an alliance of Kurds, other national minorities, women's and green groups and others on the political left. The HDP has tried to appeal to all Turks, besides its traditional Kurdish base in the south and south east of Turkey, and fielded several minority ethnic candidates for the elections of June and November 2015 (see HDP: Background).\nPre-election violence\nThere were several hundred attacks targeting HDP election offices in the run-up to the elections of June and November 2015. On 18 May 2015, there were simultaneous bomb attacks on the party's bureaus in the cities of Adana and Mersin. It is unclear who was responsible for these attacks, but some commentators suggested that Turkish far-right nationalist groups may have been involved, while others claim that President Erdogan and other senior members of the Government may have provided partial incitement with public statements conflating the HDP with the PKK. A number of the attacks appeared to be in retaliation for PKK actions (see Motives for, and incitement to, harassment and Attacks on HDP offices and bureaus).\nOn 5 June 2015, there was a bomb attack on the HDP's final election rally in Diyarbakir and this was followed by a further bomb attack on 10 October 2015 at a peace rally in Ankara, which was attended by the HDP. One of the suicide bombers was identified as a Daesh-linked terrorist (see Attacks on HDP rallies and Suruc bombing).\nIn August 2015, the HDP estimated that more than 1,000 of its members had been detained since President Erdogan's crack-down following the Suruc bombing of July 2015, which was believed to have been carried out by a Turkish citizen who was an ethnic Kurd and reportedly had links to Daesh (see Suruc bombing).\nIt was further suggested that arrests and detentions of HDP members were linked with the collapse of the ceasefire between the Government and the PKK in July 2015 as Turkish security forces had been carrying out major operations in the southeast of the country. A number of mayors and politicians with links to the HDP were arrested; in at least some cases, this appeared to be in connection with declaring 'autonomy' in their regions or because they were accused of supporting the PKK. Local officials from the HDP were detained, apparently in connection with a crackdown on the PKK's youth wing (see Suruc bombing and Arrest, detention and investigation of HDP supporters).\nIn October 2015, the HDP claimed that a local court had banned the HDP's election manifesto due to its references to 'administrative self-rule.' Also in October 2015, a Criminal Judge of Peace ordered the confiscation of an HDP leaflet which referred to 'decentralised government' and was used as criminal evidence in an investigation under the Anti-Terrorism Law (see Autonomy for Kurds).\nPost-election violence\nA prosecutor opened an investigation into Selahattin Demirtas in December 2015 over his call for greater independence for Kurds, and President Erdogan stated that he supported criminal probes into HDP leaders over their comments about self-rule. Turkish police detained senior local officials from the HDP on 8 January 2016 in a raid on one of its Istanbul offices, just two days after President Erdogan said he backed legal action against its members. Party officials said no reason was given for the detentions (see Arrest, detention and investigation of HDP supporters).\nNine Kurdish politicians and HDP members were arrested in December 2015 in Izmir province, accused of supporting the PKK (see Alleged links between HDP and PKK).\nConclusion\nThose at particular risk of adverse attention by the authorities include senior members of the HDP and HDP members suspected of involvement with the PKK or suspected of supporting autonomy for Kurdish people.3\n[27] Again later it states:\nWhen ordinary members of the HDP have come to the adverse attention of the authorities, this has generally been whilst participating in demonstrations and rallies; an ordinary member would not otherwise generally attract the adverse attention of the authorities on account of their political beliefs. However, if the person is a senior member of the HDP or has otherwise come to the adverse attention of the authorities because of suspected involvement with the PKK or support for autonomy for Kurdish people, they may be at risk, but each case must be assessed according to its individual facts.\nInternal relocation to escape any risk from non-state actors (including rogue state actors) is in general likely to be available, but each case must be assessed according to its individual facts.4\n[28] The panel finds that the claimant is not a senior member of the HDP. Nor is he a Kurdish activist. The panel finds that the claimant is an Alevi Kurd who may participate in cultural activities and who may attend peaceful political demonstrations to support leftist causes but does not have the profile of an individual likely to attract the attention of the Turkish authorities for harsh treatment in the future.\n[29] In coming to this finding the panel also specifically considered the information in the RIR at item 12.2 of Exhibit 3 entitled: Turkey: Situation of Alevis, including political and religious rights; treatment of Alevis by society and authorities; state protection (June 2012-May 2015) which was published on 12 June 2015. This RIR underscores discrimination historically faced by Alevis and states, inter alia:\n1.2 Religious Rights\nSources indicate that the Alevi are not recognized as a distinct religious group. Freedom House similarly states that the Alevi \"lack protected status.\" Country Reports 2013 states that \"religious minorities, including Alevis ... are prohibited from fully exercising their linguistic, religious, and cultural rights and continued to face varying levels of pressure to assimilate.\" Sources indicate that mosques are being built in Alevi communities. Sources note that this is viewed by some as an attempt at assimilation or \"conversion.\"\nSources indicate that the Turkish government does not recognize Alevi cemevis [houses of worship] as official houses of worship. Sources report that Alevi cemevis do not receive state funding, unlike Sunni mosques, which do. Sources report that in December 2014, the European Court for Human Rights (ECHR) ruled against Turkey for failing to give the same status to Alevi houses of worship that mosques, churches and synagogues have. Today's Zaman, a daily English-language newspaper in Turkey reports that in particular, the ECHR ruled in favour of the Alevi community in relation to electricity costs paid by individual cemevis, finding that the costs should be covered by the government's Religious Affairs Directorate and that the state's failure to pay for these costs amounts to discrimination. Al Jazeera reports that the Directorate pays for the electricity costs of mosques, churches and synagogues. Today's Zaman reports that the ECHR was to hold another hearing in June to further examine whether the fact that cemevis are not legally recognized by the state constitutes discrimination under the European Convention on Human Rights. According to Hurriyet Daily News, a daily English-language newspaper in Turkey, the hearing was held on 3 June 2015 and the court is expected to have concluded its ruling within 6 to 12 months.\nUnlike Jewish and Christian students, Alevi students are unable to be exempted from compulsory [Sunni Islamic] religion classes. According to sources, the ECHR ruled in September 2014 that the state's compulsory religious education for students discriminated against Alevis ; and held that the state should allow pupils to be exempted from religious classes without parents having to disclose their religious beliefs. According to a briefing produced by the German Information Centre on Asylum and Migration (IZAM), which provides specialist information to the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) in Germany, as of 23 February 2015, the Turkish government had \"refused to implement\" the ECHR ruling.\n2. Treatment by Society\nIn correspondence with the Research Directorate, a professor at the Department of History, Anthropology & Philosophy at Georgia Regents University, who specializes in the political history of Turkey, explained that some \"who consider themselves to be devout Sunni Muslims feel that Alevis are non-believers or 'devil worshippers.'\" Other sources state that \"many\" Sunni Muslims regard some Alevi practices as \"heresy.\" According to Country Reports 2013, \"Alevis regularly faced societal discrimination.\" The Professor similarly stated that discrimination of Alevi \"both subtle and more overt, takes place throughout the country.\" In contrast, a 2014 article in the Turkey Analyst, a bi-weekly publication of the Central Asia-Caucasus Institute & Silk Road Studies Joint Center that focuses on news and analysis of domestic and foreign policy issues in Turkey states that the \"increasing frequency of anti-Alevi prejudice\" comes from \"members of the AKP leadership,\" that there has been no major increase in anti-Alevi sentiment \"amongst the Sunni population as a whole\" and that most Sunnis and Alevis co-exist with relatively few problems on a daily basis. ...\nSources report on incidents of violence against Alevis, including the following:\n* During the month of Ramadan in 2012, the home of an Alevi family was surrounded by local residents after the family tried to stop drum noise used to wake people for a predawn Ramadan meal. Sources report that the home was stoned and a stall next to the house was set on fire.\n* According to Hurriyet Daily News, in August 2012 \"[a]rsonists attempted to set fire to a cemevi ... in Istanbul's Kartal district.\" According to the same article, the day before the attempted arson, the houses of 25 Alevi families were \"marked\" by unknown individuals in the same neighbourhood.\n* In December 2013, the homes of 13 Alevi were marked with red paint, similar to that which occurred prior to the 1978 killings of Alevis. Minority Rights Group International (MRG) indicates that this took place in Adiyaman province.\n* According to an article in Today's Zaman, in October 2014, nine apartment buildings in an Alevi-majority area in Istanbul were marked with the message \"Death to Alevis and Kurds. ISIL.\"\n* In November 2014, Deniz Naki, a footballer playing for a Turkish club, was physically attacked and \"insulted\" for his Alevi and Kurdish origins. Hurriyet Daily News reports that he had experienced past abuse for being an Alevi. As a dual Turkish and German citizen, he left the club and returned to Germany.\n3. Treatment by Authorities\nAccording to sources, since the civil war in Syria, Alevi in Turkey have faced increased discrimination. In correspondence with the Research Directorate, a PhD candidate and sessional lecturer at the University of Sydney who has published multiple academic articles on the Alevi in Turkey stated that discrimination of Alevi has increased \"since the 1980s, but even more so throughout the AKP government rule.\" The EPC article describes the Sunni-dominated governorship in the country as signalling an \"institutionalized discrimination\" [against Alevis]. Country Reports 2013 notes that Alevis \"faced systemic discrimination from the state.\"\nSources note the following examples of the treatment of Alevis by state authorities:\n* According to the Turkey Analyst article, AKP officials reportedly blamed a May 2013 car bombing in Reyhani which killed 53 people on the Alevis, claiming that the attack was carried out by Turkish Alevis based in Syria, even though no evidence was produced to this effect.\n* Sources report that the request of a prison inmate to see an Alevi religious figure was rejected and an imam was sent instead.\n* According to Freedom House, in 2014, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and \"AKP officials\" criticized members of the Alevi religious minority; in particular, Erdogan \"made repeated disparaging remarks about Alevis.\" Al-Monitor, quoting a translated interview with the head of the Alevi- Bektashi Federation, Selahattin Ozel, similarly reports that Erdogan's rhetoric ... on the Alevis has been very divisive, very ostracizing.\"\n* According to Country Reports 2013, there was excessive use of force by police in responding to Gezi Park protests against the development of Istanbul's Gezi Park that escalated to involve larger issues like the \"oppression of individual liberties\" involving Alevi citizens. According to a 2014 article on the conflict between the Alevi and the AKP published in the Eurasian Journal of Anthropology, Alevi neighbourhoods were highly supportive of the Gezi Park protests and the majority of the people killed during the protests were Alevi, as a result of \"the harshness of the police violence in certain neighbourhoods populated largely by Alevis.\" ...\n* Without providing further details, Freedom House reports that in May 2014, \"violence between Sunni and Alevi groups in Istanbul claimed two lives.\" Similarly, the Turkey Analyst article reports that on 22 May 2014, members of the militant leftist group the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party\/Front (DHKP\/C), which \"almost exclusively\" recruits Alevis, \"clashed with police in the Alevi part of the mixed Sunni-Alevi neighbourhood of Okmeydani in central Istanbul,\" and two people were killed. Sources report that one of the victims was shot while waiting in a cemevi courtyard to attend a funeral. Human Rights Watch reports that the police had originally been targeting protestors after they threw a Molotov cocktail at a police vehicle.\n* According to Religion News Service, a non-profit online news source that aims to \"provide in-depth, non-sectarian coverage of religion,\" police responded to protests on 13 February 2015 by Alevis and other religious minorities regarding compulsory religion classes in primary schools with pepper spray, water cannons, and detaining and filing charges against protest leaders \"for insulting the Turkish president.\"\n[citations omitted]\n[30] As this RIR demonstrates, and the panel accepts, there is evidence of continued societal abuses of and discrimination against Alevis. Many Alevis, for example, have faced discrimination in the government's failure to include any of their doctrines or beliefs in the compulsory religious education courses provided in public schools. It required a decision of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to allow Alevi parents to request to exempt their children from such religious education. Materials on Alevis have been added to the religious course curriculum after the ECHR decision, but many Alevis consider them to be inadequate or, even, false. Alevis, like some other religious groups, are unable to state their religious affiliation on their National Identity Cards because their religion was not included among the possible options. While Alevis freely practice their beliefs in their places of gathering (\"cem\" houses or \"cemevis\") the sites have no legal status as places of worship and are referred to as \"cultural centers.\" Elements in the Alevi community complain about this and argue that Alevis receive no financial support from the government for their meeting places. Some Alevi organizations maintain that they face obstacles in trying to establish \"cem\" houses.\n[31] At item 1.19 is the UK Home Office's report published in February 2016 entitled Country Information and Guidance. Turkey: Alevis. It summarizes the risk of harm for Alevis in Turkey as:\nThe government considers Alevism a heterodox Muslim sect and Alevi places of worship are not officially recognised (see Position in law). This means that they do not receive financial support from the state and Alevis also experience difficulties in establishing new places of worship. This does not, however, prevent Alevis in practice from worshipping in buildings which do not have legal place of worship status (see Places of worship).\nAlevis also face unequal treatment in education (see Education) and Alevis, along with a few other minority religious groups, are unable to state their religious identity on national identity cards because their groups are not listed as options (see Religion on identity cards).\nThere are also a small number of reports of ill-treatment by the authorities, primarily as a result of the police using excessive force in responding to demonstrations involving Alevis and the Alevi community's perception that they are subject to discriminatory language, including by members of the government (see Treatment by authorities).\nTreatment by non-state actors\nAlthough there are isolated incidents of societal discrimination and violence towards Alevis, these are few and most Alevis co-exist with other communities with few problems on a daily basis (see societal discrimination).5\n[32] It also states in the Assessment of risk section that:\nEven when taken cumulatively, the treatment faced by Alevis does not in general amount to them being subject to action on the part of either non-state actors or the authorities which would amount to persecution or serious harm.6\n[33] The panel accepts that the claimant is an Alevi Kurd and having found the claimant's \"political activist\" identity not to be credible, the panel has considered the claim with respect to the claimant's religion. With respect to the claimant's religion as Alevi, the panel finds that although Alevis have experienced discrimination, it concludes and agrees with the views expressed in the Operational Guidance Note: Turkey of May 2013 that: \"A claimant of the Alevi faith is unlikely to encounter ill-treatment by the authorities amounting to persecution solely on the grounds of religious belief.\"7\n[34] In examining the evidence in this claim, the panel was not presented with sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence that the claimant, as an Alevi Kurd, had difficulty practicing his faith or would have difficulty practicing his faith should he be required to return to Turkey at present. Accordingly, the panel finds that the claimant is an Alevi who was a supporter of the BDP (now HDP) but not a party member and who may attend peaceful legal demonstrations and practice his faith has not established that he has a serious possibility of harm rising to the level of persecution if he were to return to Turkey at present.\n[35] Having considered the totality of the evidence, including the claimant's particular circumstances, there is no persuasive evidence before the panel that the claimant has a profile that would attract attention of the Turkish authorities and the panel finds that there is not a serious possibility of persecution or risk of harm as the claimant does not have the profile of an Alevi Kurd likely to experience such treatment in a systematic way.\nCONCLUSION\n[36] The panel finds that the claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution on the basis of his identity as an Alevi Kurd or being a peaceful supporter of leftist political causes. For the reasons noted above, the panel finds that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection and denies his claim.\n(signed)\n\"L. Figg\"\nL.

The claimant fears that she will be persecuted because she is a member of the Southern Cameroons National Council (SCNC) an organization that advocates the separation of anglophone Cameroon from the majority francophone Cameroon.\n[2] The claimant stated that she attended rallies of the SCNC and that she distributed flyers on behalf of the party. The claimant says that she was arrested twice due to her political activities and opinions. She was detained in XXXX, 2015 for three days, and again in XXXX, 2016 for three weeks.\n[3] If she were to return to Cameroon, the claimant says that she will be arrested, detained and tortured. She says that there is no state protection for her in Cameroon, and that there is no safe place for her anywhere in Cameroon.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[4] The claimant provided a certified copy of the first page of her passport.1 The panel is satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is a citizen of Cameroon.\nPolitical opinion\n[5] Political opinion was the key to the determination of this claim. If the claimant is truly an activist in favour of the independence of Southern Cameroon, as she alleges, then she may face a difficulties if she were to return to Cameroon. If she is not credible as to her political opinion, however, then she does not risk more than a mere possibility of persecution upon a return to her country. The claimant relied on certain documentary evidence, as well as her testimony, to persuade the panel that she a supporter of the SCNC, and that the authorities in Cameroon are pursuing her.\nCredibility\n[6] The panel finds that the claimant has serious issues of credibility. Although the panel ultimately concludes that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant is a citizen of Cameroon, her inability to be candid and forthright in answering the panel's questions undermines her credibility. She does not present herself as a credible witness.\n[7] The claimant provided two different birth certificates.2 When asked for an explanation as to why there were two birth certificates, the claimant was unable to provide an answer. The panel was unable to conclude that either of the birth certificates was genuine.\n[8] The claimant was asked if she had evidence of having been XXXX XXXX of the University of XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimant stated at the first sitting that she did not have that evidence, but that it would be indicated in her university student card. The university student card3 was received by the Board on May 8, and was considered at the second sitting. Nothing in the card confirms that the claimant was XXXX XXXX of the XXXX XXXX at her university.\n[9] The claimant had declared in her BOC (Basis of Claim) narrative that she was released on bail4 on conditions. The claimant was asked if she could provide any court documents to corroborate her statement. She provided a Recognizance of Surety.5 As will be seen in the analysis of the documentary evidence, that document is highly suspect.\nDiscrepancies between the visa application and the claimant's evidence\n[10] The claimant admitted signing a false visa application in October 2016 when she declared that she was not married, whereas her testimony was that she had been married to her husband since 2005. When asked for an explanation, the claimant took a long pause without answering, before finally stating that she lied because her life was at stake. There was no explanation provided by the claimant as to how making a false declaration about not being married could save her life better than if she had stated the truth.\n[11] In the family information form which formed part of the claimant's visa application, she listed two brothers and two sisters. When signing and certifying her BOC, however, the claimant only indicated one sister and two brothers. The claimant was asked to explain the discrepancy, but she could provide no satisfactory answer, even though she had signed and certified both documents as being true and complete.\n[12] At line 32 of her BOC narrative, the claimant stated that she was XXXX XXXX of the XXXX XXXX when she was at university. The claimant was asked if she had evidence of being XXXX to the position of XXXX. The claimant stated at the first sitting that she was awaiting the arrival of her student card to prove that she was the XXXX. When the card was submitted to the Board on May 8, 2017, there was no evidence as suggested by the claimant that the claimant had been XXXX XXXX of the XXXX XXXX. The claimant's inability to provide documentation that she indicates in her testimony may exist detracts from her ability to act as a credible witness.\n[13] The panel concludes that the claimant has not told the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, as she had undertaken to do at the beginning of the hearing. This claim fails due to the lack of credibility of the claimant. This claimant is not, on a balance of probabilities, an active member of the Southern Cameroons National Council.\nDocumentary Evidence\n[14] The presumption that foreign identity documents are valid6 falls away when there is a valid reason for doubting their authenticity.7 Stated differently, where the RPD (Refugee Protection Division) is satisfied that one or more of an applicant's identity documents have been fraudulently obtained or are otherwise inauthentic, the presumption that the applicant's remaining identity documents are valid can no longer be maintained. This is because the foundation for that presumption has been eroded.\n[15] Including the two birth certificates, of which at least one was a fabrication, the claimant presented at least nine documents of dubious authenticity. The claimant provided two ostensibly official Arrest Warrants8 laden with spelling errors in the supposed French portion of the letterhead. The work \"attendu\" is mis-spelled as \"attend\", the French word \"mandat\" is mis-spelled as \"mandate\" and the word \"d\u00e9cern\u00e9\" is mis-spelled as \"d\u00e9cerne\". The expression \"\u00e0 tout officier\" was mistakenly rendered as \"\u00e0tout officer\". This document is so full of errors as to render it beyond belief as an authentic document. The claimant was asked to explain why these errors appeared, but she had no explanation. It is, on a balance of probabilities, a fraudulent recreation of an official document.\n[16] The claimant also provided to the tribunal a Recognizance of Surety9 with numerous spelling errors. The word \"delegation\" is mis-spelled (in the French version) as \"deligation\". The expression \"toutes autre requisition\" pluralizes the first word without doing so to the second and third words. The charges stated in the Surety relate to \"Contempt, secession and inciting rebellion\" which are the same words found in the Arrest Warrant. Strangely, the articles of the Penal Code which the claimant is alleged to have contravened in the Surety are completely different than the Articles cited in the Arrest Warrants. On a balance of probabilities, this document is fraudulent.\n[17] At pages 22 and 23 of exhibit 5, the Release Orders give the English spelling of \"virtue\" to the French version, which should be \"vertu\". The claimant was once again unable to explain why the error existed in a document supposedly issued by a bilingual administration in an officially bilingual country.\n[18] The claimant provided a medical report.10 The Cameroonian doctor who allegedly wrote the report noted injuries to the \"souls\" of the feet and \"virginal\" discharge. It is highly unlikely that a trained doctor who is fluent in English would not know the difference between \"souls\" and \"soles\", or between a \"vaginal\" discharge and a \"virginal\" one. The letter head mis-translates the English word \"Delegation\" as \"Delagation\" in French. The claimant was unable to allay the concerns of the panel concerning the genuineness of the medical report. On a balance of probabilities, the medical report is fraudulent.\n[19] The claimant submitted an Undertaking.11 The document mis-spells the word Delegation as \"Deligation\". The word \"hereby\" is rendered as \"Here by\". On a balance of probabilities, the Undertaking is a forgery.\n[20] The presentation of false evidence in support of a claim for refugee status is a very serious matter. It undermines the integrity of a claimant's overall evidence in support of his or her refugee claim. Submitting a false or irregular document has an impact on the weight assigned to other documents provided by the claimant, especially when they are interrelated.12 The tendering of a false document diminishes the overall credibility of the claimant.13\n[21] From the claimant's attempt to mislead the Canadian authorities and given her failure to give a reasonable and truthful explanation for so doing, the panel draws an adverse inference as to the credibility of the claimant as a credible or trustworthy witness.14\n[22] The claimant has produced a letter from the chairman of the SCNC.15 Due to the numerous deficiencies in her credibility, and due to the claimant's proffering of false and misleading documents, the panel attributes little weight to the letter.\n[23] The claimant also provided a letter16 from her lawyer in Cameroon. Although the letter purports to be an affidavit, it is not sworn before a Commissioner of Oaths or equivalent officer of the court. The letter is not in the first person and therefore does not affirm knowledge in the mind of the deponent. The letter appears to be a hearsay statement of what the claimant's husband allegedly endured. The letter is vague, with such statements as \"police sources revealed to us\" without revealing who the \"us\" in that statement consists of.\n[24] At page 27 of exhibit 5, the claimant advanced an affidavit purportedly deposed to by her husband. The husband refers to the claimant in paragraphs 4, 5, 6, and 9 and \"his wife\" instead of as \"my wife\". The claimant's husband signed it but the deposition is irregular. There is no explanation as to why the declaration is not in the first person or in the husband's own words. The weight of this document is substantially reduced by these irregularities.\n[25] Based on all the evidence, and given the claimant's apparent willingness, propensity and motive to provide fraudulent documentation in her visa application and in her refugee hearing, the panel finds and determines that it is appropriate to give little or no weight to any of the documents the claimant has provided or has been given from Cameroon, except the certified true copy of her passport, which the panel accepts as being a genuine document.\nMANIFESTLY UNFOUNDED\n[26] Section 107.1 of the IRPA prescribes that if the Refugee Protection Division rejects a claim for refugee protection, it must state in its reasons for the decision that the claim is manifestly unfounded if it is of the opinion that the claim is clearly fraudulent. In this case the claimant provided a clearly fraudulent document, namely her Cameroon national identity card in support of her claim. The document was provided in support of the claimant's identity as a citizen of Cameroon. Given that the claimant travelled on a genuine Ethiopian passport to Canada, and given her inability to establish her Cameroon identity other than through a fake identity card, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is more likely a citizen of Ethiopia than she is a citizen of Cameroon.\n[27] Based on all the above, it is clear the claimant fabricated a claim for protection in Canada and the claim is clearly fraudulent.\nCONCLUSION\n[28] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel determines that the claimant has not established that there is a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground or that, on a balance of probabilities, she would personally be subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if she were to return to Cameroon.\n[29] The panel therefore concludes that the claimant is not a Convention refugee, and she is not a person in need of protection, and the Division rejects her claim. The panel finds that this claim is manifestly unfounded.\n\"R. K. Riley\"\nR. K.

She is claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant was born in XXXX, India to Tibetan parents. The claimant's parents and family members were forced to flee Tibet after their participation in the 1959 Tibetan Uprising. They fled to India where they settled in XXXX, where the claimant was born. The claimant alleges that she has no right to citizenship in India and cannot return to India. The claimant alleges that she has a well-founded fear of returning to China in that she fears she could be deported to China by the Indian authorities.\n[3] The claimant fears that she will face serious harm at the hands of the government because of her Tibetan race and nationality. She also fears a serious risk of harm because of her political and religious beliefs in that she follows the teachings of His Holiness the Dalai Lama. She cannot freely practice her faith in China and would be persecuted based on her religious beliefs.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] The panel finds that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection for the reasons that follow.\nANALYSIS\n[5] The determinative issues in this claim are the claimant's identity, nationality and country of reference.\nIdentity\n[6] The panel accepts the claimant's ethnicity as a Tibetan by way of her documents she presented and through her testimony. The claimant has a contribution booklet commonly known as the Green Book. In addition she has presented a letter from The Office of Tibet, affirming her ethnicity as a Tibetan. The panel also notes that the claimant's brother who is now a Canadian citizen made a claim for refugee protection in 2009. A copy of his Personal Information Form2 (PIF) submitted to the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) in 2009 listed the claimant as his sister and identified her as Tibetan. Notwithstanding her Tibetan ethnicity, the panel notes that the claimant was born in India and has a claim to Indian citizenship. The claimant contests this view alleging that she will not be considered an Indian citizen because her birth was not registered.\nWhat is the claimant's nationality?\n[7] A claimant cannot be given refugee protection when the claimant has citizenship that is available to him in another safe country and it is within his power to acquire said citizenship.3 There has been some division in the applicable jurisprudence as to whether Tibetans born in India between January 26, 1950 and July 1, 1987 have a right to citizenship in India.4 Counsel has provided a number of documents regarding this issue.\n[8] At the conclusion of the hearing counsel requested time to submit written representations to be submitted by March 27, 2017. On April 5, 2017, the Board disclosed a package to the counsel that referred to a recent Delhi High Court decision wherein the High Court ordered that passports be issued to Tibetan residents living in India who had been born in India between January 26, 1950 and July 1, 1987. Counsel was given an opportunity to reply. In response to the disclosure, counsel provided additional post-hearing submissions and documents. The panel has carefully read and considered the documents and submissions.\n[9] Section 3(1) of the Indian Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003 states as follows:\nExcept as provided in sub-section (2), every person born in India,\n(a) on or after the 26th day of January, 1950, but before the 1st day of July, 1987;\n(b) on or after the 1st day of July, 1987, but before the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003 and either of whose parents is a citizen of India at the time of his birth;\n(c) on or after the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003, where\n(i) both of his parents are citizens of India; or\n(ii) one of whose parents is a citizen of India and the other is not an illegal migrant at the time of his birth, shall be a citizen of India by birth.5 [emphasis added]\n[10] The claimant was born in XXXX, India on XXXX XXXX, 1985. It would appear on the basis of the Indian statute that the claimant is a citizen of India. However, the Indian authorities have long been reluctant in recognizing Tibetans born during the stated period despite meeting the legal requirements.6 It has been reported that Tibetans who did apply for passports have been denied and were forced to seek intervention through the Indian court system. In 2010, 2013, and 2014, India's High Courts in Delhi and Karntaka ordered that the authorities issue passports to the petitioners. Both courts found that the respective petitioners were entitled to claim the status of an Indian citizen by virtue of their birth under the Citizenship Act.7\n[11] More recently, on September 16, 2016, the Delhi High Court ordered the Ministry of External Affairs to recognize Tibetans as Indian citizens if they meet the requirements under the Citizenship Act. It held that the petitioners who argued their case before the Delhi High Court were Indian citizens and were entitled to all benefits and privileges that were available to Indian citizens. While there has been some resistance in the past, it is clear that the High Courts in Delhi have ruled consistently that Tibetans born in the relevant time period are entitled to Indian passports.8\n[12] Counsel provided an announcement from the Ministry of External Affairs outlining new passport rules. However, this document appears to refer to applicants born on or after January 26, 1989. The claimant was born on XXXX XXXX, 1985. This document does not appear to be relevant or applicable to the claimant.\nThe claimant's attempts to obtain citizenship\n[13] The claimant provided the following documents to prove her attempts to obtain citizenship:\nA letter from XXXX XXXX, a cousin brother of the claimant. He indicated that the claimant applied for an Indian passport but it was not issued to her because of a lack of documentation.9\n[14] Mr. XXXX indicates that she was unable to get a passport due to lack of documentation. However, he provides minimal details regarding what efforts the claimant made to get the required documentation. It is not unreasonable for a government authority to refuse to issue a passport if an applicant has no documents. The panel gives minimal weight to this letter.\nA letter from a lawyer in XXXX, India indicating that the claimant cannot become a citizen of India because her birth was not registered10 and a document from the Government of XXXX indicating that the claimant's birth was not registered. This document dated XXXX XXXX, 201711\n[15] The panel notes that recent documentation provided by counsel does not indicate that a birth must be registered in order to be considered a citizen of India. In fact, in the announcement of new passport rules (a document provided by counsel), there are a number of documents an applicant can use as proof of the date of birth of the applicant. (The panel does stipulate that this announcement refers to applicants born on or after January 26, 1989.) The panel notes that this document does not indicate that an applicant's birth must be registered. Having reviewed the document, the important factor in determining eligibility for a passport is the date of birth.\nAffidavit from XXXX XXXX\n[16] Counsel provided an affidavit from XXXX XXXX,12 a friend of the claimant who accompanied her to the Indian High Commission in Toronto on April 28, 2017. Ms. XXXX states that the claimant tried to apply for a passport; however, she alleged that the employees at the High Commission were unaware of the Memorandum directing passports were to be issued to Tibetans born in India in the relevant period.\n[17] The panel finds this affidavit to be of minimal probative value. The lack of knowledge of employees of the Consulate does not have any bearing on whether the claimant is a citizen. While it is unfortunate and frustrating, that they were unaware or even feigning ignorance it is not an indication that the Consulate has refused the application of the claimant. Moreover, the affidavit is silent on whether the claimant had all the requisite documentation that was required to submit an application. The panel finds this document to be of minimal probative value.\nAffidavits from individuals in India\n[18] The panel notes that counsel has provided three affidavits from individuals in India.13 These individuals state they attempted, unsuccessfully to apply for a passport in India given the recent ruling. The individuals indicated they each went with the required documents in hand but were told that must first prove their birth in India or their citizenship.\n[19] The panel notes that these affidavits were provided post-hearing and included in the counsel's written submissions. They are poor copies and two of them are barely legible. Furthermore, the panel notes that none of the affidavits are accompanied any documents to establish their respective identities. Counsel has not requested a continuation of the hearing to present these affiants as witnesses to test the veracity of their claims and their identity. The panel assigns no weight to these documents.\n[20] The panel notes that included in the claimant's disclosure is a copy of her Registration Certificate. The panel notes that this document was issued after the conclusion of the hearing but was included in post-hearing documents with counsel's written submissions.14 It is not clear how the claimant was able to provide this copy given she testified that she had to surrender the original document upon leaving India and she testified she did not have a copy.\n[21] Nonetheless, the claimant has now provided a copy of her Registration Certificate. This document shows that the claimant was born in India on XXXX XXXX, 1985 in India. The panel further notes that in 2012, the claimant traveled to Japan using an Identity Certificate (commonly known as an IC). This document allows a Tibetan to travel and is an international travel document.15 Furthermore, the claimant has provided a number of educational certificates including a transcript from the Central Board of Secondary Education. This document is a marks statement of the All India Senior School Certificate Examination in 2005.16\n[22] The panel finds that the claimant has not established on a balance of probabilities that her birth must be registered in order to be eligible to apply for a passport. Moreover, the panel finds that the claimant has not established that because her birth was not registered she would be denied Indian citizenship. The panel notes that there are over a billion people living in India and that the likelihood of everyone in the country is registered is minimal; this does not mean they are not Indian citizens. Moreover, the panel finds that there is ample evidence in the claimant's possession that would establish on a balance of probabilities that she was born in India on XXXX XXXX, 1985; this is between the periods in question - January 26, 1950 and July 1, 1987. If the claimant must assert her rights to citizenship, the panel notes that this is not an uneducated or unsophisticated person. Should the claimant require assistance in applying for an Indian passport, the panel finds that the claimant has the wherewithal to do so.\nCanadian Jurisprudence\n[23] The panel has considered the jurisprudence applicable to the issue of recognizing Indian citizenship. The facts in each of the cases have guided the determination of the Federal Court. In some decisions, the Federal Court has found that the acquisition of citizenship in India is neither automatic nor fully within the control of the applicant.17 In Dolma, Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer stated the following:\nIn my view, an obligation on refugee claimants to show that they applied for and were refused citizenship in a particular country would constitute a narrowing of the refugee definition in the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and section 96 of the IRPA. The proper question is whether, on the evidence before the Board, there is sufficient doubt as to the law, practice, jurisprudence and politics of the potential country of nationality such that the acquisition of citizenship in that country cannot be considered automatic or fully within the control of the applicant, not whether they have tried and been refused.18 [emphasis added]\n[24] However, other recent Federal Court decisions have taken a different view of the issue. In Tashi v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), Madam Justice Mactavish recognized the evolving developments respecting the issue of citizenship for ethnic Tibetans born in India between 1950 and 1987; she found it reasonable for the Refugee Protection Division to conclude that such individuals do have a right to citizenship in India.19 In Dolker v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), Mr. Justice Hughes stated in obiter as follows:\nWith all due respect to Justice Russell, there is nothing in Williams that says an Applicant need not even apply for citizenship. Williams, at paragraph 22, speaks to whether it is within the control of a person to acquire citizenship. Nothing in that case encourages an Applicant not to make reasonable efforts to secure such citizenship.\nWilful neglect or even neglect to apply for citizenship where a person has a right to apply should not serve as an invitation to try your luck in Canada. There would be good grounds for a certified question if the issue was not obiter. As this discussion is obiter, as I have found that the finding that the Applicant had Indian citizenship was reasonable, I will not certify a question.20 [emphasis original]\n[25] In a more recent decision in, Tretsetsang v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), Mr. Justice Mosley expressly declined to follow the decision in Wanchuk, wherein it was found that the acquisition of Indian citizenship for ethnic Tibetans born during the relevant timeframe was outside of their control because of resistance by the Indian government. Mr. Justice Mosley stated in Tretsetsang as follows:\nI cannot agree with the applicant. Section 96 of the IRPA plainly refers to \"countries of nationality,\" not to countries of nationality where an individual can assert all of his nationality rights without impediment. The Indian legislation is unequivocal that the applicant is a citizen by birth. Two state high courts in India have endorsed that view. The applicant cannot allege that he is not an Indian citizen because some officials might discriminate against him and deny that he is a citizen - no matter how persuasive the evidence of discrimination may be.\nIf the applicant requests citizenship documents in India, such as a passport, and is denied, he can bring a court challenge similar to the ones described in the documentary evidence. In Williams, at para 27, the Court of Appeal held that an applicant must make attempts to acquire citizenship in any safe country where it is available to him. The same would seem to apply to the enforcement of rights to which the applicant is entitled by law, as a citizen, notwithstanding efforts at obstruction by officials. [...]\nThis is where I must, with respect, decline to follow Wanchuk. At para 10 of that decision, Justice O'Reilly expressed the view that obtaining Indian citizenship was a \"mere possibility\" for a similarly situated applicant, since it might require litigation. That does not, in my view, amount to the level of the \"intolerable burden\" that Justice Russell found to apply in Hua Ma in light of the one child policy and other considerations in China. Nor is it consistent with the teachings of Williams. Applicants are expected to take reasonable steps to acquire or enforce any citizenship rights which are available to them. A right which is enshrined in legislation and has been enforced by the courts amounts to more than a \"mere possibility.\" There is nothing unreasonable about expecting the applicant to take legal action if his state of nationality attempts to deny his rights.21 [emphasis added]\n[26] The decision in Tretsetsang stated that where an impediment is alleged to exist, a claimant must show on a balance of probabilities the following:\nThe existence of a significant impediment that may reasonably be considered capable of preventing the claimant from exercising his or her citizenship rights of state protection in that country of nationality; and\nThat the claimant has made reasonable efforts to overcome such impediment and that such efforts were unsuccessful such that the claimant was unable to obtain the protection of that state.22\n[27] The panel agrees and is guided by this approach set out in Tretsetsang. It is incumbent upon an individual to make reasonable attempts to avail oneself of citizenship that is available to him or her. Obstacles and inconvenience, in itself, is insufficient to overcome this obligation.23\n[28] In the case of the claimant, she has provided a letter from her cousin brother indicating that she attempted to apply for a passport but did not have the proper documents.24 The claimant has not indicated that she is unable to obtain the documents despite having been issued a Registration Certificate and an Identity Certificate in the past. As stated earlier, an IC is akin to travel document and the RC indicates the claimant's place and date of birth. Furthermore, she has a number of documents in her possession that establish her education and her residence in India. While she was met with some resistance at the Indian Consulate in Toronto, she was not denied a passport, she was advised that they had no knowledge of the memorandum and that she should apply for the passport in India. This, in the view of the panel is a minor obstacle and an inconvenience; it is insufficient to suggest that her citizenship has been denied. The panel finds that the efforts made thus far by the claimant are superficial.\n[29] Moreover, while the claimant alleged that she does not have identity documents such as the Aadhar or Pan Card, the panel has been provided with insufficient evidence to establish on a balance of probabilities that she could not successfully apply for these documents. The panel notes that the claimant is educated, has previous travel and resided in Japan for a period of time. She is not unsophisticated or simple. The panel concludes that the claimant is resourceful and has the wherewithal to seek documents that would allow her to apply for a passport.\n[30] The panel finds that the country of reference is India in that she is a citizen of India. She did not adduce any risk of harm upon returning to India; only that she fears if she returns to India, she would be deported to China. The panel finds that the claimant rights to Indian citizenship is recognized by the state of India and that it is within her control to access such rights.\n[31] The panel concludes that the claimant is not a Convention refugee as she does not face a serious possibility of persecution in India nor that she is a person in need of protection as per ss. 97(1) of IRPA.\n[32] The panel rejects this claim.\n(signed)\n\"N.

XXXX XXXX is also a citizen of the United States (USA). XXXX XXXX XXXX was the designated representative for her daughter, the minor aged claimant.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe principal claimant (PC) alleges the following\n[2] PC has travelled extensively on vacation and owned and operated a successful business in Delta State requiring several business trips to the USA.\n[3] PC fears returning to Nigeria because she and her two daughters will face female genital mutilation (FMG) upon their return. Her husband's family, particularly her father-in-law and brother-in-law insist this ritual be performed.\n[4] The eldest daughter was born in Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017 and remained in Canada with PC until she was one month old.\n[5] PC's in-laws learned of the birth of the daughter and informed PC and her husband that it is the custom of the family that females should be circumcised when they are three weeks old or when they begin menstruation. PC and her husband are against female genital mutilation (FGM).\n[6] When PC learned she was pregnant with her second child, her husband suggested she travel to another country for the birth so that she would not have to fear any of the customary rituals. The claimant travelled to the USA and gave birth to her second daughter, the minor aged claimant, on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2012. When she was one month old, PC and the minor aged claimant returned to their home in Nigeria, knowing the family would wait until she reached puberty to perform the circumcision.\n[7] In 2013, the minor aged claimant became ill, the medical treatment she was receiving in Nigeria was not effective. PC was travelling to the USA in XXXX 2013, on a business trip. She decided to take her two daughters with her. PC sought medical attention for the minor aged claimant while in the USA. They left the USA on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014 to return to their home in Nigeria. Because the child had been ill for such a long time, PC's in- laws decided PC, the minor aged claimant and her oldest daughter should be circumcised. PC's husband agreed the ritual had to be performed. PC returned to the USA with both daughters for a further medical appointment for the minor aged claimant on XXXX XXXX, 2014. On their arrival, the border control officer questioned PC and informed her that she did not have the proper visa to enter the USA. They threatened to return her to Nigeria. The officer advised PC that the only way she could enter the USA was to file an asylum claim. The claim was rejected.\n[8] PC was issued a work permit in the USA on XXXX XXXX, 2014 and was to have her appeal heard before an immigration judge on XXXX XXXX, 2015. The appeal was lost. The claimant found a lawyer to reopen the claim after she told the judge that they faced circumcision if they returned to Nigeria. This reopening was also denied.\n[9] PC had no work permit and her parole status expired on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2016. PC decided to come to Canada since her eldest daughter is a Canadian citizen. They arrived at XXXX XXXX XXXX and then travelled into Canada and made a claim for refugee protection January 13, 2017.\n[10] Before making its decision for PC, the panel took into consideration the psychological report1 and the Chairperson's guideline number 4 relating to Women refugee claimants.2\nMINOR AGED CLAIMANT\n[11] Before making its decision for the minor aged claimant, a citizen of the USA and Nigeria, the panel took into consideration the Chairperson's guideline for Children refugee claimants.\nIdentity\n[12] The minor aged claimant is a citizen of the United States of America as noted by a certified copy of her passport.3\nClaim against the United States of America\n[13] Counsel submitted that this minor aged claimant seeks protection because the border officials in the USA held the family for 3 days before allowing PC to take her youngest daughter, the US citizen and minor aged claimant to her pre-scheduled medical appointment.\n[14] Counsel further submitted that this young claimant requires medical attention that she cannot receive in Nigeria. She further noted that she needs to be in the care of her mother, the PC. The panel acknowledges counsel's submissions and all the evidence4 before it, however, the USA is a democratic country with security forces to protect the country and its citizens.\nDetermination of the minor aged claimant\n[15] The panel finds there was insufficient evidence before it that would enable the panel to determine that the minor claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution in the USA. The panel has heard no evidence the minor claimant would be persecuted for any Convention ground or that, on a balance of probabilities, she would be subjected to a risk to her life, or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or to a danger of torture upon return to the USA. Thus, she is not a Convention refugee or person in need of protection pursuant to ss 96 and 97(1) of Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). Her claim is rejected.\nDetermination of PC\n[16] The panel finds that the claimant is not a Convention refugee as she does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Nigeria. The panel also finds that the claimant is not a person in need of protection in that her removal to Nigeria would not subject her personally to a risk to her life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, and in that there are no substantial grounds to believe that her removal to Nigeria will subject her personally to a danger of torture. The panel's reasons are as follows.\nNexus\n[17] The claimant fears being forced to undergo FMG by her husband's family. Therefore, the claimant is a member of a particular social group and the claim will be assessed according to ss 96 and 97 of IRPA.\nIdentity\n[18] The claimant's identity as a national of Nigeria has been established by her testimony and the supporting documentation filed, namely the certified copy of her passport held by CIC.5\nANALYSIS\nThe determinative issue is internal flight alternative (IFA)\n[19] The PC testified that after her first daughter was born in Canada, her father-in-law informed her that his family believed in the customary rituals and insisted that females must be circumcised before 3 weeks old or when they begin their menstrual cycle. PC's second daughter, the minor aged claimant, was born in the USA deliberately so that she would not undergo FMG when she was first born. PC worked for an XXXX and travelled frequently. After she moved to another state to be with her husband she started a successful business that required extensive travel.\n[20] The father-in-law and brother-in-law insist that PC and her two daughters must be circumcised to avoid any calamities to the family and to the land.\nInternal flight Alternative\n[21] If the PC returned to Nigeria, she fears that she will be forced to undergo FGM. Therefore, the panel considered whether a viable IFA in Port Harcourt exists for the claimant as this issue was raised during the hearing.\n[22] The panel is guided by the Federal Court cases. If there is a safe haven for claimants in their own country, where they would be free from persecution, they are expected to avail themselves of it before they seek safety in Canada, unless they can show it is objectively unreasonable to do so.6 There is a two-pronged test in considering if an IFA is viable.7\n(1) \"...the Board must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds and IFA exists.\"\n(2) Moreover, conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for her to seek refuge there.\n[23] The claimant bears the burden of proof to show that there is a reasonable chance that persecution will occur in the entire country and specifically in the potential IFA named.8\n[24] PC was asked if she could live safely in Port Harcourt. Port Harcourt is the capital and largest city of Rivers State. It has a population of over 1,800,000. The claimant testified that she could not live there because she would be found. Her father-in-law and brother-in-law, XXXX XXXX, have connections with judges, police, and those in political positions. They pay homage to her father-in-law because he has been made XXXX, and is the XXXX XXXX in his community.9 The panel accepts that her father-in-law could have influence in his own community, however, it has insufficient trustworthy evidence before it to indicate her father-in-law and brother-in-law have influence throughout all of Nigeria because of their positions.\n[25] In May 2015, the President of Nigeria gave assent to a bill, \"The Violence Against Persons (Prohibition) Act (VAPP), which includes, a ban on female genital mutilation.10 Those guilty of such an act can be fined and\/or face imprisonment. The report notes that some states have enacted a ban previous to the national ban. Port Harcourt is located in Rivers State, a state that had banned FGM before the national ban. The Constitution of Nigeria makes provisions for protection of people who do not wish to undergo rituals.11 They can report to the police if they do not want to undergo a ritual practice or submit a complaint to have the ritual stopped. However, the same article states that police are reluctant to provide protection to someone who is refusing to undergo a ritual. The panel acknowledges that some of the authorities are unwilling to interfere with cultural practices as noted in the evidence, however, the Nigerian police have \"started corroborating with other governmental agencies, state governments and women's advocacy groups to improve its response and attitude to harmful ritual practices...\" Therefore, the panel finds that the government of Nigeria is slowly addressing the problem of rituals including FGM through legislation and changing cultural attitudes. The claimant is an independent, educated woman who has travelled extensively and lived with and supported her young daughters in the United States for two years. The panel finds that on a balance of probabilities, the claimant would have the knowledge to seek protection to avoid this happening to her. Furthermore, if she did not receive assistance from the authorities, she would report the corrupt officers to the complaint Response Unit.12\n[26] Furthermore, the panel is not persuaded to believe anyone will look for the claimant in Port Harcourt. The panel finds the claimant has not provided clear and convincing evidence that the authorities would be looking for her nor has it received clear and convincing evidence that the Chief and his family have the ability to find her anywhere in the country of Nigeria. The panel finds that based on the evidence it has before it, the claimant could live safely in Port Harcourt.\n[27] The panel must be satisfied that it is reasonable for the claimant to live in Port Harcourt. Port Harcourt is a large city with over one million eight hundred thousand people living there. The claimant has a Bachelor's degree in XXXX.13 She worked for an XXXX XXXX and owned and operated a successful business. She was the primary financial supporter for her family. Counsel submitted that it would be difficult to find a government position because she is not a native of that state.14 The panel finds that although it might be difficult, she would be able to seek other employment or use her experience and start a new business of her own. There are churches to worship in, schools, medical facilities and all of the advantages a large city has to offer. It is easily accessible by land, air and ship. The claimant came to Canada with only one aunt living here. It is reasonable, therefore, for the claimant to be able to locate to a city in her own native country where her family would be able to visit her and the customs would be familiar. The claimant had the resourcefulness to travel to the United States and while there attend classes to enhance her education to enable her to work to support her family. The panel finds that on a balance of probabilities, she could do the same in Port Harcourt. Therefore, the panel finds it would not be unreasonable in all circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for her to seek refuge in Port Harcourt.\n[28] The panel carefully reviewed counsel's submissions, the psychologist's report15 and all the evidence before it. The panel finds it received insufficient reliable and trustworthy evidence to indicate that would it not be safe or unreasonable, in all the circumstances, for the claimant to seek refuge in Port Harcourt.\n[29] Since an internal flight alternative in Port Harcourt is available to the claimant, the panel finds that there is not a serious possibility that the claimant will be persecuted for a Convention ground or on a balance of probabilities, would be subjected personally to a risk to life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or to a danger of being tortured if she returns to Port Harcourt, Nigeria.\nCONCLUSION\n[30] For the foregoing reasons, the panel concludes that the claimant is not a Convention refugee or person in need of protection pursuant to ss. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[31] The Refugee Protection Division rejects her claim.\n(signed)\n\"Marlene D.M.

He was a businessman, but never became involved with politics or the drug business, although invited.\n[5] He was shot at and wounded in 2008 by unknown assailants. He told the family not to come to XXXX, as it was too dangerous. His son received death threats and left Guatemala for Canada and successfully claimed protection here.\n[6] The claimant's grandfather was killed by unknown persons in 2010. The claimant's mother was warned not to attend her father's funeral or ever return to XXXX, or she would be buried with him. The murder remains unresolved. The calls kept coming and were of a threatening nature.\n[7] In XXXX 2011, while driving, the claimant, her mother, a sister and her two children were robbed at gunpoint at a traffic light. One of the thieves allegedly told the claimant's mother that they had been watching her. The claimant and other family members reported the incident to the authorities, but they warned them not to pursue this line of enquiry. The claimant's putative uncle, XXXX XXXX, who had, allegedly, been making enquiries into the death of the claimant's grandfather, was also shot and killed in XXXX, in XXXX 2011.4\n[8] The claimant's mother left Guatemala in XXXX 2011 and is now a permanent resident of Canada. The claimant remained behind to be with her two sisters in Guatemala City. She lived with her Spanish boyfriend. During XXXX and XXXX of that year, unknown persons threatened the claimant with rape and death, but indicated that they were somehow connected to the death of her grandfather. Out of fear for her safety, the claimant fled Guatemala for Spain in XXXX 2011.\n[9] The claimant lived in Spain for over a year and returned to Guatemala in XXXX 2012, and stayed at her sisters' homes. Threats continued throughout her time in Guatemala until she left for North America in XXXX 2017. The claimant entered the United States of America (US) on a valid visitor's visa on XXXX XXXX and entered Canada at Niagara, and claimed protection at the port of entry, as an exception to the safe third country protocol, as she has her mother and brother here.\n[10] Claimant's counsel disclosed copies of the claimant's mother's narrative5 and notice of decision6 accepting the mother's claim. He submitted that I ought to find the claimant a protected person for reasons of judicial comity, in any event.\nDECISION\n[11] I have determined that the claimant is not a Convention refugee and is not a person in need of protection. I also determine that should the claimant return to her home country, she would not be subjected personally to a risk to life or to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. Further, on substantial grounds, there is no danger of torture.\n[12] Since this claim may involve gender-related violence, I considered the Chairperson's Guidelines on gender-related persecution.7 The Chairperson's Guideline helps to assess the key evidentiary elements in determining to what extent women making a gender-related claim of fear of persecution successfully can rely on any Convention ground and under what circumstances gender violence constitutes persecution. The Chairperson's Guidelines also highlights that women refugee claimants may face special problems in demonstrating that their claims are credible and trustworthy. Factors that may affect their ability to provide evidence include difficulty in providing testimony on sensitive matters, cross-cultural misunderstandings, as well as social, religious and economic differences. The Chairperson's Guideline was used to help assess the circumstances of this claim and to understand and apply the added sensitivities necessary to properly assess whether any credibility issues are the result of such difficulties or an attempt to fabricate evidence.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[13] On a balance of probabilities, I find8 that the claimant established she is a national of Guatemala based on a copy of her passport found in Exhibit 1.\nNexus\n[14] For this claim to succeed under section 96 of the Act, the definition of Convention refugee requires that the persecution alleged be linked to a Convention ground. The Supreme Court of Canada noted in Ward that:\n... the international community did not intend to offer a haven for all suffering individuals. The need for \"persecution\" in order to warrant international protection, for example, results in the exclusion of such pleas as those of economic migrants, i.e. individuals in search of better living conditions, and those of victims of natural disasters, even when the home state is unable to provide assistance.9\n[15] Claimant's counsel submitted that the claimant has a nexus to the Refugee Convention for two reasons. Firstly, she is a member of a particular social group, that is, a member of the family of her grandfather and her mother, both of whom were victims of criminals in Guatemala, and secondly, as a woman in Guatemala.10\n[16] It is not clear from her BoC narrative who the claimant fears, specifically, or what she fears. On questioning, the claimant testified that she fears the men who killed her grandfather in 2010. She testified that the police \"cannot tell, but we think it is Los Zetas,\" as they contacted her grandfather and asked him to work for them, and run for politics, but he refused to work for them. This is clearly speculation on the part of the claimant. I find that the claimant has not established who she fears, other than she states she fears persons who threatened her and her family. Even if the claimant's speculation is correct, that the persons who threatened her and other members of her family belong to Los Zetos, they are a well-documented criminal organization, which does not have any apparent political agenda.11 The claimant did not provide any evidence as to why she was threatened, if she was, but threats are, by their nature, criminal in nature. The claimant did not allege that she was threatened because of her race, religion, political opinion, nationality or even gender, as she alleged all members of her family were threatened - men and women.\n[17] The claimant's fear in this case, I find, is not linked to race, religion, nationality, or political opinion. The claimant's alleged fear of unknown persons who threatened her, and may have killed members of her family and others, is not related to a Convention refugee reason or ground, but criminality. The Federal Court has held that victims of crime, corruption or vendettas generally fail to establish a link between their fear of persecution and one of the Convention grounds in the definition of Convention refugee.12\n[18] I find that the claimant is not a member of a particular social group for the purposes of a claim under section 96 of the Act, as a member of her maternal grandfather's family alone. Although members of families which are subject to persecution may ground their claim in section 96, the members of the associated family must be victims of persecution for a Convention ground. Here, the claimant is a member of a family who all, allegedly, are at risk of serious harm at the hands of unknown criminals for unspecified reasons, somehow linked to the claimant's grandfather.\n[19] The claimant also claims she is a Convention refugee as a member of a particular social group, that is to say, Guatemalan women who fear gender violence. As I noted above, the putative agents of persecution, if they are interested in the claimant, as alleged, are interested in harming her not because she is a woman, but because she belongs to the family of her maternal grandfather.\n[20] The claimant alleged that one phone call - the one that made her decamp for Spain with her Spanish common law partner - the caller threatened rape, which is a form of gender violence, I find, as it is primarily women who are victims of sexual violence. Nevertheless, I find that the claimant's alleged victimization, even if rape was threatened as alleged, is not persecutory, as it entails victimization by the claimant on account of the widespread and generalized criminality in Guatemala, and not discriminatory targeting of women in particular. The putative agents of harm threatened the whole of the family, according to the claimant, and not just the claimant as a woman, notwithstanding that one of the threats included sexual assault. The harm feared was criminal in nature and had no nexus to the Convention refugee definition.13\n[21] For these reasons, I determine that the claimant is not a Convention refugee, under section 96. In the alternative, if the claimant has a nexus to the Refugee Convention, I would find that she has not shown the requisite subjective fear, and I would dismiss her claim on that basis.14\n[22] The balance of these reasons is an analysis of the claim under section 97.\nCredibility, Subjective Fear and the Claim under Section 97\n[23] The Federal Court, in Maldonado15, held that, \"When an applicant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there be reason to doubt their truthfulness.\"\n[24] I have found reasons to doubt the truthfulness of the claimant's allegations that she faces risk to life and other serious harm at the hands of criminals who threatened not only this claimant, but her whole family. These doubts arise from the nature or the limitation of the threats, the fact that nothing serious happened to the claimant since XXXX 2011,16 the fact the claimant remained in her home most of the time over the last seven years, the claimant's staying in Guatemala for many years, the fact that the claimant left for Spain (allegedly out of fear) yet failed to claim protection in Europe, the fact that the claimant returned to Guatemala and lived in the same area (if not the same house) for another five years, and the fact that two of the claimant's sisters and their families continue to live in their same houses in Guatemala City without anything happening to them.\n[25] The threats that the claimant alleges she and her family members received were in the nature of \"or else\" threats. If the claimant is to be believed that threats were made to her mother, originally, and to others in the family, it is along the lines of this: \"do not come to XXXX again\", \"do not attend the funeral of your [grand]father\", and especially, \"do not take interest in, and do not investigate the death of your [grand]father\", always with an \"or else\" you will suffer the consequences, impliedly death or other serious harm. I find that the claimant did not suggest or provided evidence that she ever went back to XXXX or investigated the murder of her grandfather. For this reason, it is not likely that the perpetrators of her grandfather's murder in XXXX would be interested in the claimant or her family in Guatemala City. I understand that one cannot put oneself into the mind of a criminal, but I am of the opinion that, along with the other credibility issues, the nature of the threats ought to be taken into account, which I have done.\n[26] I also note that, if we are to believe that the claimant was threatened by a person or persons connected to the death of her grandfather, those persons never, in seven years, actually harmed the claimant, although she lived in the same house or with family members throughout those seven years after the death of her grandfather in 2010, except for the one year she lived in Spain, and except for the alleged robbery with her mother and others in 2011. We have nothing to corroborate that the robbery at a traffic light in Guatemala City occurred, other than the evidence of the claimant and her mother in her own claim, which was accepted.\n[27] I recognize that corroborating evidence is not always required, and objective evidence corroborating whether the robbery occurred or not would not likely be available. With all of the evidence of criminality in Guatemala, and even in the capital, Guatemala City, it is plausible that the claimant and her family members did experience an armed robbery at a traffic light there. However, with all my other credibility concerns, I find that the claimant embellished her story by connecting this, what I find to be, random criminal act, to the killing of her grandfather. Even the alleged words of the robber, to the effect that he or they had been watching her mother, does not necessarily connect these robbers to anything that occurred in XXXX. The conclusion that the family came to is possible, but not probable. It is more probable that the robbers were watching the claimant's mother because of her money and assets, not because she was the daughter of the person someone killed in XXXX. In the alternative, if it were true that the robbers were connected to the claimant's grandfather's killing, the interpretation of their words (which I have already found to be more likely an embellishment than the truth) means that the robbers are telling the family, do not become involved in the killing, \"or else\". Since the claimant was not and had not ever become involved in or shown any interest in investigating her grandfather's death, I find the claimant was not likely facing any real risk of serious harm. In any event whether the alleged statement of the robbers was an embellishment or a warning, the most significant fact to remember is that nothing else befell the claimant in five more years while the claimant lived and worked in Guatemala.\n[28] I am aware of and acknowledge that the claimant's mother came to Canada and filed a successful refugee claim. The claimant disclosed her mother's narrative17 and the notice of decision18 in the mother's case. I note that initially the claim of this claimant and her mother arise from the same assertions, but I do not have the benefit of knowing the reasons the panel in her mother's claim accepted it, as no reasons were provided for the positive decision. The decision was reached in November, prior to the amendments of December 2012, which now require reasons for decision in every case, not just for decisions that reject a claim. Also, although not perhaps well known, a panel in one claim has no access to the file, physical or electronic, of another claimant, unless authorized by that other claimant. I note for the record here that, in her narrative, the claimant's mother writes her beliefs and opinions regarding the perpetrators of the murders of her father and half-brother and what they were doing that might have led to their killings. I find these to be speculative on the part of that refugee, and I am not able to know what part of the claim led to the other panel accepting the claim. There are many differences between the story of the claimant herein and that of her mother.\n[29] Claimant's counsel submitted that, not only should I recognize the fact that the claimant's mother and brother have been granted refugee protection in Canada, which I do, I should not \"turn a blind eye to those positive decisions\". Although counsel notes that I am not, \"strictly speaking, bound by those decisions\", I ought to grant this claimant refugee protection, for reasons of \"consistency in decision-making\". The cases that counsel cited in his submissions do not assist me in coming to the same conclusion in this claim as the panels did in the claims of her mother and brother. I do recognize that, in all three cases, the claimants' national and familial identity has been established, that the claimant's grandfather was murdered by unknown persons, and that Guatemala suffers from a high level of crime. However, the significant difference in this case from the cases of her mother and brother is that they made claims in Canada in 2011, when the alleged threats were fresh, and not in 2017, many years later. I find that the claims are not identical, mainly because the claimant's mother and brother came to Canada within a year of the death of the claimant's grandfather, right after the armed robbery, but also because nothing occurred to this claimant, or her two sisters who remain in Guatemala to this day, subsequent to the alleged robbery in XXXX 2011.\n[30] Furthermore, I do not know what the panels in the mother's and brother's claims, found with respect to state protection, but their findings on that issue, if any, are not relevant here, as that issue is not relevant in this claim, because my findings with respect to credibility and lack of subjective fear are determinative.\n[31] As noted by Justice Catherine Kane in Uygur at paragraph 28: \"...it is settled law that refugee claims are to be considered on their own merits. The fact that one applicant is granted refugee status based on a similar experience is not binding on the Board as the Board must assess each claim individually, and previous decisions, even regarding family members, may have been wrongly decided.\"19 In Coli,20 the Federal Court also cited the decision in Tenczin Losel,21\n\"Separate risk assessments under s. 96 and s. 97 are obviously required as a general rule because risk is personal to the claimant and includes both objective and subjective considerations which may differ between claimants.\"\n[32] Here, I am not coming to a different conclusion regarding national identity, but on assessing the risk set out in the claimant's narrative and in her testimony, I find there are considerable grounds from the evidence of either her mother or her brother to depart from the results found there.\n[33] As alluded to earlier in this decision, I have determined that the claimant is not a Convention refugee, under section 96, because there is no nexus, or, even if there is, she has failed to demonstrate the requisite subjective fear, as analyzed below. I have also determined that the claimant is not a person in need of protection as her claim of risk to life and other serious harm, personally, is not credible in light of her egregious delay, her failure to claim in Spain for over a year, and her return to the very home and city from which she says she fled, and remaining there for another five years without incident. Furthermore, I find that the situation of this claimant is more akin to that of her sisters, who remain in Guatemala, than to that of her brother or her mother who left Guatemala in 2011 and claimed protection in Canada that year.\n[34] The claimant testified that her sisters are not at risk because they are married, and use their husbands' respective surnames, instead of the matronymic, which might identify them with the XXXX family, and their late grandfather. I do not accept this submission. If it were that easy to elude the killers by changing one's name, there is no reason posited by the claimant as to why she would not change her own name. She can drop the XXXX part of her name and just use her father's surname. Or, she could take up a new name or even change it legally. Furthermore, if the claimants are watching the whole family, and if they are as pervasive as the claimant states that they are, there is no reason for the sisters and their families to remain in Guatemala, unless they do not believe they are exposed to any risk, either. As the sisters are still in Guatemala, and nothing has befallen them, except perhaps experiencing a robbery in 2011, I find that the claimant could also return and live without fear of personalized risk to life and other serious harm, as alleged. In other words, in the section 97 analysis, I find that the claimant may face risk to life and other serious harm in Guatemala but it is a risk shared by most other Guatemalans.\n[35] The other reason that I do not accept that the claimant has any subjective fear of harm is that she decamped for Spain, a country known to accept refugees, and did not claim protection, or even enquire into the process, while she resided there for over a year. Furthermore, the claimant, when she broke up with her Spanish partner, did not join her mother and brother in Canada, but instead returned to live for another five years in the same home or homes in the same city in Guatemala, without incident.\nSubjective Fear\n[36] The subjective fear relates to the existence of a fear of harm in the mind of the claimant. The objective basis requires there be a valid basis for the fear.22 Both subjective fear and an objective basis for it are crucial elements for a claim to succeed. In Kamana,23 Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer held that the panel's finding that the claimant had not credibly established the subjective element was reasonable and:\nThe lack of evidence going to the subjective element of the claim is a fatal flaw which in and of itself warrants dismissal of the claim, since both elements of the refugee definition-subjective and objective-must be met.\n[37] Failure to seek the protection of another country which is also a signatory to the Convention may be a significant factor to consider but is not in itself determinative. Voluntarily leaving a country where the claimant could safely live is another example of behaviour that can cast doubt on a claimant's subjective fear.24\nThe delay in making a claim to refugee status is not a decisive factor in itself. It is, however, a relevant element which the tribunal may take into account in assessing both the statements and the actions and deeds of a claimant.25\n[38] The 'delay' in this case is in failing to make a claim in the European Union, specifically Spain, and then leaving Spain, a signatory to the Refugee Convention26, to return to the putative country from which she is claiming protection for five more years.\n[39] It is not the delay in claiming by failing to claim in Spain and returning to Guatemala that is decisive in her claim, it is the claimant's explanation or lack thereof that is decisive.\n[40] One must remember that the claimant is an urban, internationally-travelled adult. The claimant went to Spain, as her male friend was Spanish, and not out of any fear of remaining in Guatemala, I find.\n[41] During that whole year, the claimant testified that she never once asked her hosts how she might be able to remain in Spain, or how she could extend her stay in Europe. She did not consult with the Spanish immigration services while she was still legally in Spain. She did not consult with immigration counsel while in Spain. For this reason alone, I find the claimant's allegation that she and her male friend left Guatemala for Spain from fear arising from threats not credible.\n[42] In Madoui,27 an Algerian claimant failed to claim during 19 months in Italy. He had been told by friends that he had little, if any, chance of obtaining refugee status in Italy. Despite statistics in evidence showing that similar claims were rarely accepted, the Board was not satisfied that the subjective component had been met and the Court saw no error in the Board's assessment.\n[43] In Mekideche,28 when the Board asked why the claimant did not claim refugee status during his two years in Italy, he testified that it was because he believed that Algerian refugees would be denied and returned to Algeria. This belief was based on news reports that other European countries were not receptive to Algerian refugees. Noting that he travelled throughout Europe with false documentation before arriving in Canada, the Board stated that this was a risk that a person who feared persecution would not take. The Court found no error in the Board's conclusion that these two issues showed an absence of a subjective fear of persecution.\n[44] In addition, the claimant obtained a US visa and travelled through the US when she came to Canada. In Leul29 at paragraphs 7 and 12, Mr. Justice Muldoon writes the following:\nOne might observe that he passed through Amsterdam and that The Netherlands is a convention refugee signatory, but apparently he did not think to claim refugee status there.\n...Just as I would not wish to send back to his country a person who stood in jeopardy of a reasonable chance of persecution, so I just do not wish to leave in Canada a person who isn't entitled to be here; a person who passed through a country which was a signatory to the convention and did not think to claim refugee status there.\n[45] The conclusion that I have arrived at is that the claimant lacks the requisite subjective fear, and her claim fails under section 96. On this same reasoning, the delays in leaving, the failure to claim in Spain without a persuasive explanation, and her return to Guatemala, means to me that the claimant is not credible with respect to her fear of returning to Guatemala for the reasons she alleged, and her claim fails under section 97(1), as well.\n[46] Furthermore, as stated by the Federal Court in Ahoua,30 at paragraph 16, \"... a negative finding regarding subjective fear may render the assessment of the objective aspect of the complaint superfluous and may in itself warrant the dismissal of the claim\". Also, in Ortiz,31 Mr. Justice O'Keefe held that a finding the claimant lacked subjective fear due to his failure to apply for asylum in the US is sufficient, alone, for the Division to reasonably deny the refugee claim:\n[30] However, the Board's finding that there was a lack of serious effort on the part of the applicant to apply for asylum is reasonable despite the applicant's submissions. As Mr. Justice Yvon Pinard held in Bobic v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2004 FC 1488 (CanLII) at paragraph 6, an applicant's reasons for not claiming refugee status in a foreign country must be valid in order to avoid an adverse inference. Serious efforts require more than having a friend inquire about the asylum process. As Mr. Justice Roger Hughes held in Stojmenovic v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 2010 FC 873 (CanLII) at paragraph 5, that \"a refugee claim should not be looked at simply as one of many choices as to how best to seek status in Canada.\" The applicant's submission that he did not apply for asylum because it would be granted more easily in Canada or because he would gain permanent residence faster in Canada are not valid reasons for negating the adverse inference that he lacked subjective fear by not applying for asylum in the United States. A finding that the applicant lacked subjective fear due to his failure to apply for asylum in the United States is sufficient, alone, for the Board to reasonably deny the refugee claim (see Goltsberg v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2010 FC 886 (CanLII) at paragraph 28; Gamassi c. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l'Immigration) (2000), 2000 CanLII 16473 (FC), 194 F.T.R. 178at paragraph 6).\n[31] Because of my finding on Issue 2, I need not deal with the remaining issues as an applicant needs to have a subjective fear in order to succeed in a refugee claim.\n[47] As Ortiz was decided since IRPA was enacted, I find the Federal Court's decision covers claims grounded in both sections 96 and 97, and I reject the claim for these reasons, as well.\n[48] I rely on the decision in Gomez32 for the proposition that corroboration does not make an incredible story credible. The claimant has provided the narrative of her mother, and some evidence that the robbery of 2011 was reported to the police, but I find this does not provide persuasive evidence that the claimant faces personalized risk as a result of being related to her late grandfather.\nWhere the Board makes a general finding that the claimant lacks credibility, that determination is sufficient to dispose of the claim unless there is independent and credible documentary evidence in the record capable of supporting a positive disposition of the claim. The claimant bears the onus of demonstrating there was such evidence.\n[49] In this case, the claimant, in my view has not met her onus in this regard.\n[50] I also note that the Gender Guidelines, in and of themselves, are not intended to serve as a cure for all deficiencies in the claim or evidence.33\n[51] In addition, I considered the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Shahamati34 wherein the Federal Court of Appeal stated \"Contrary to what has sometimes been said, the Board is entitled, in assessing credibility, to rely on criteria such as rationality and common sense.\" I find that it is possible that the claimant personally received threats to her life and other serious harm by unknown persons in Guatemala, but not probable, mainly because of the egregious delay and her reavailment to Guatemala without a satisfactory explanation.\n[52] The claimant has provided in her disclosure, and we also find in the National Documentation Package (NDP), a great deal of objective evidence regarding criminality in Guatemala, generally, as well as evidence regarding Los Zetos, particularly. Nevertheless, I find that if the applicant's testimony is not credible, \"it is reasonable to conclude that the documentary evidence cannot establish a well-founded claim by itself\".35\n\"The lack of credibility of the applicant and his wife was fatal to the claim. General documentary evidence, in the face of a version of events that is not believed, will not be sufficient to turn the tide.\"36\nCONCLUSION\n[53] Having considered all the evidence, and based on the above analysis, I determine the claimant is not a Convention refugee as the claimant has not established that there is a reasonable chance or serious possibility that she will face persecution for a Convention ground, and because she lacks the requisite subjective fear. I also determine that the claimant does not personally face risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture, believed on substantial grounds to exist, should she return to Guatemala.\n[54] Accordingly, I reject this claim pursuant to both sections 96 and 97(1) of the IRPA.\n(signed)\n\"James V.

On the same day, they made claims for refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \"Act\").1\n[2] The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) heard this matter over two days on June 19, 2013 and July 5, 2013, and denied their claims on October 10, 2013. On judicial review of that decision, the Federal Court allowed their appeal on February 27, 2017. This case was reheard by the RPD on August 4, 2017. This is the decision stemming from that hearing.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The principal claimant is a 37-year-old man from Bogota. He and his family were farmers whose farm was outside Bogota in XXXX XXXX XXXX department.\n[4] In 1994, the family farm was stormed by at least a dozen armed Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerillas who held the principal claimant, his siblings, parents and others captive. They threatened to abduct the principal claimant's brother unless they were paid 40 million pesos. His father agreed. Apparently, the guerillas had a file on the family, their businesses, homes in Bogota and children. The guerillas left and the principal claimant's father paid the money in two installments.\n[5] In 2000, the principal claimant and the associated claimant began living together in Bogota.\n[6] In 2001, the principal claimant's father received extortion demands from the FARC with which he did not comply. He sold the farm in XXXX.\n[7] In XXXX 2012, the principal claimant learned from a relative that the FARC was looking for the principal claimant's brother and on failing to find him, were searching for the principal claimant whom they had seen in XXXX. In 2011, his brother had failed to pay the FARC extortion and fled to Canada where his refugee claim was accepted. In XXXX 2012, the principal claimant filed a complaint with the Attorney General.\n[8] Later that month, the principal claimant received a call from the FARC demanding to know the whereabouts of his brother and 20 million pesos. The claimants remained at home for several days and followed up on the complaint to the Attorney General. The FARC called back to state that if the principal claimant's brother's whereabouts were not revealed and the money was not paid, one of the minor claimants would be abducted. The claimants moved to the associated claimant's mother's house. Meanwhile, their complaint to the authorities was transferred to the anti-abduction and extortion unit, with whom the claimants awaited for an interview that never came.\n[9] In XXXX 2012, the FARC called to say that the principal claimant was running out of time before he would be declared a military objective. Apparently, suspicious men had been to their apartment in their absence. The claimants submitted a complaint to the International Red Cross. Hearing nothing about their two complaints, the claimants left the country a few days later.\n[10] The claimants fear that if they return to Colombia, they will face persecution and other risks from the FARC for refusing to reveal the principal claimant's brother's whereabouts, failing to pay the extortion money and for reporting the matter to authorities.\nDETERMINATION\n[11] I find that the claimants are not Convention refugees as they do not have a well-founded fear of persecution related to a Convention ground in Colombia. I also find that the claimants are not persons in need of protection, in that their removal to Colombia would not likely subject them personally to a risk to life, or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. There are also no substantial grounds to believe that their removal to Colombia would subject them personally to a danger of torture.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[12] The claimants' identities as nationals of Colombia are established by their testimony and passports in evidence.2 I am satisfied of their identities by these documents.\nCredibility\n[13] The principal claimant gave evidence in an obliging and sincere manner. In relation to the central aspects of his allegations, there were no material discrepancies or inconsistencies between his testimony and the other evidence, including his testimony, that of his wife and brother at the previous hearing.\n[14] The claimants submitted documents to corroborate their allegations, including their complaints to the Attorney General, the Red Cross and a letter from the claimant's nephew confirming the threat from the FARC.3\n[15] Based on the presumption of truthfulness, the principal claimant's consistent testimony and the corroborative documents, I accept the claimants' allegations as credible.\nWell Founded Fear of Persecution & Risk of Harm\n[16] In this case, I do not find that the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution or a risk of harm within the meaning of section 97 of the Act, on a balance of probabilities. The claimants left Colombia more than five years ago and since that time, there is insufficient evidence of an enduring threat. Furthermore, Colombia has experienced changes that erode the risk to the claimants.\n[17] FARC last contacted the claimants in XXXX 2012. Although the principal claimant's family members were targeted by the FARC in 1994, 2001 and 2011, there is no evidence of any of them having contact with the FARC since 2012, when the claimants fled the country. The principal claimant's parents, other brother and six sisters have not been confronted by the FARC in the claimants' absence, despite the family's history with the FARC and the FARC's interest in locating both the principal claimant and his brother. There is no evidence that the FARC asked the family for the whereabouts of the claimants, retaliated against these relatives or targeted them in lieu of the claimants, as was the case for the principal claimant when one of his brothers fled to Canada. Thus, there is insufficient evidence that the threat against the claimants persists after five years. If the FARC was still interested in pursuing the principal claimant, it is reasonable to expect that the FARC would have shifted focus to his relatives as they did to the principal claimant when they could not locate his brother. Since this did not happen, it suggests that the FARC is no longer seeking the claimants.\n[18] The principal claimant testified that the claimants are still at risk from the FARC because the FARC has repeatedly targeted his family since 1994. However, in my view, the circumstances in Colombia are different, particularly since in the areas in which the claimants lived, there is insufficient evidence of the FARC's presence.\n[19] In November 2016, an historic peace accord between the government of Colombia and the FARC was ratified by congress, marking an official end to the five-decade armed conflict after more than four years of talks.4 President Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for this achievement. Amnesty International states that the de-escalation of hostilities between the security forces and the FARC led to a \"sharp reduction\" in combat-related violence affecting civilians.5\n[20] The United States (U.S.) Department of State (DOS) report also finds that there was a reduction in violence due to progress in the peace process between the government and the FARC, including the implementation of a bilateral ceasefire in August 2016.6 It indicates that the United Nations (UN) Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights annual report states that peace negotiations \"prevented many human rights violations.\" The DOS also maintains that the Conflict Analysis Research Center (CERAC) reported that levels of violence in the country fell to their lowest in 52 years in terms of the number of victims, combatants killed, injured and the number of violent acts. According to CERAC, offensive actions against the FARC fell 98 percent, combat between the armed forces and the FARC dropped by 91 percent, overall civilian casualties fell by 98 percent and overall combatant deaths dropped by 94 percent. The UN Commissioner and CERAC attribute these trends to confidence-building measures, such as the unilateral ceasefire by the FARC and the high level of compliance with the bilateral ceasefire. The DOS also states that before the peace agreement, the FARC announced in July 2016 an immediate suspension of the levying of extortion \"taxes\" on civilians engaged in legal economic activity. Most of this happened before the peace accord was struck at the end of the year.\n[21] Other evidence supports a reduction in crime. The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) reports that the homicide rate in 2016 was its lowest in 40 years.7 Human Rights Watch confirms that since the FARC announced a unilateral ceasefire in July 2015 before the peace deal was struck, abuses attributed to them have \"declined steeply.\"8 Insight Crime reports on the demobilization process and states that the FARC have officially withdrawn from their strongholds.9 The surrender of the FARC and reduction in crime demonstrate that the FARC is unlikely to approach the claimants in the future as the organization has formally surrendered.\n[22] The claimants maintain that there are dissident groups among the FARC who reject the peace accord, are not demobilizing and who many continue to target them. It is indeed the case that not all FARC fronts accepted the peace agreement and that they continue to operate.10 However, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that the claimants would be at risk given that Bogota is not a FARC stronghold with a dissident front. Although the principal claimant testified that the FARC member who called him in 2012 in Bogota did not identify which FARC front he was associated with, the evidence indicates that the FARC had seen him in XXXX before they called him. He testified that he and his brother supposed that the FARC members were from XXXX as this was where their farm was. This was also where the 1994 incident occurred. This town is just outside the federal district of Bogota in Cundinamarca.\n[23] I find that there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the front that operated in Bogota or Cundinamarca is not demobilizing or that there are dissident factions in the area. The peace process has been controversial and it will certainly be a struggle. However, a search of all reports in evidence fails to identify a dissident faction of the FARC operating in Bogota or Cundinamarca. Both International Crisis Group and Insight Crime report that the dissidents are Fronts 1, 7, 14, 16, 40, 43 and 62.11 Insight Crime presents a January 2017 map of the areas in which FARC dissident fronts are not demobilizing; neither Bogota nor Cundinamarca are affected by these factions. If the Bogota and Cundinamarca fronts were not demobilizing and had dissidents, it is reasonable to expect documentation of this. However, there is insufficient evidence of this before me.\n[24] I have carefully reviewed the claimants' evidence that describes the ongoing demobilization of the FARC over the last eight or nine months, including movement to concentration zones, weapon surrender, training, education and re-integration programs. A couple of these articles are dated before the peace accord was ratified, and a few are dated before the more recent Insight Crime and International Crisis reports in the National Documentation Package (NDP).12 As the demobilization process is in progress, analysis of recent documents is critical. For example, it was submitted for the claimants that 30 percent of the FARC may not demobilize.13 However, Insight Crime made this projection of defections in August 2016, before the peace agreement was ratified in November 2016. In January and February 2017, two articles indicate that only about 300 FARC guerillas, or five percent, are estimated not to be demobilizing as six fronts have rejected the peace deal.14 These figures are consistent with two May 2017 reports that 7,000 FARC guerillas have agreed to the peace process.15 The evidence is weighted towards demobilization of most FARC members and demonstrates the effectiveness of compliance with the peace agreement.\n[25] The principal claimant argues that crimes by the FARC continue to occur today. I agree. However, the claimants' numerous recent documents support the finding that it is committed by the particular fronts cited earlier that are not demobilizing. Persistent crimes carried out by the FARC are reported in specific departments of Colombia. The National Documentation Package and the claimants' up-to-date evidence indicate that of Colombia's 31 departments, the following have dissident fronts or continuing crime carried out by the FARC: Antioquia, Caqueta, Cauca, Choco, Guaviare, Guainia, Huila, Meta, Narino, Putumayo, Tolima and Vichada. These areas appear to be related to mining and cocoa regions where lucrative drug earnings have financed the FARC.16 In these cocoa-producing regions, the FARC's activities are still evident.17 The evidence does not support this occurring in Bogota where the claimants lived or in Cundinamarca. In May 2017, a UN official was taken captive by a dissident front in the Guaviare department.18 The May 2017 news report relating to people being extorted by the FARC is also about people in Guaviare.19 An abduction of two ranchers occurred in Caqueta.20 Nothing in these reports suggests that there are dissident groups in the Bogota capital district or the department of Cundinamarca. While a June 2017 article refers to a bombing that killed three people in a Bogota shopping centre, it is not known who is responsible, though it is noted that the National Liberation Army (ELN) is being monitored.21\n[26] It was also submitted that former FARC guerillas may evolve into organized crime groups, such as the Bandas Criminales (BACRIM) and los Urabenos, who would target the claimants. Concern about the potential for criminal successor groups is expressed throughout the evidence and is an important issue.22 It is reported that los Urabenos may be recruiting FARC members by offering generous salaries, though this is occurring in Antioquia, Bolivar, Cordoba and mining or cocoa-producing areas.23 These are among the departments referred to earlier. The claimants' evidence does not sufficiently demonstrate likely or ongoing criminal activity by former FARC members in Bogota or Cundinamarca. Their evidence demonstrates ongoing criminality by FARC and recruitment by exiting gangs in specific departments, with which the claimants are not associated. The claimants have not adduced adequate evidence of crimes occurring in Bogota by the FARC or its former members. I find inadequate evidence before me to illustrate that FARC members who targeted the claimants in Bogota likely failed to demobilize, or will not reintegrate after their rehabilitation period and will target the claimants again as organized criminals. It is overly speculative to find that possible new criminal groups will target the claimants in Bogota.\n[27] I acknowledge that the principal claimant's brother was accepted as a refugee in 2012 based on very similar allegations. However, this was long before the peace agreement was ratified and demobilization began. There is a new reality in Colombia today. The change in Colombia prompts me to consider whether a change in circumstances has occurred within the meaning of 108(4) of the Act. In this case, it was argued for the claimants that such a change in circumstances has not occurred; that to make such a finding, the changes would have to be meaningful, effective and durable. Whereas the changes have resulted in the claimants no longer having a well-founded fear of persecution or likely risk of harm, I find it premature to make a determination that the change can be defined by these terms. Certainly, the peace accord is a profoundly meaningful indicator of change. The subsequent surrender of most of the FARC - at least 7,000 members to-date - illustrates effectiveness to an extent. But, demobilization is not yet complete, and the effectiveness of reintegration and criminal successor group abatement is also not fully known. The fact that dissident factions of the FARC exist in parts of Colombia demonstrates some ineffectiveness. To examine this another way, if the claimants were to internally relocate to one of the departments I have cited where the FARC still operates, they could face problems from the FARC or its former members who continue to be active. This does not support a change in circumstances within the meaning of section 108(4). Durability of change can be established with more time; the peace agreement is less than a year old. On this basis, I am unable to find that a change in circumstances as contemplated in section 108(4) has occurred, notwithstanding my findings under sections 96 and 97 of the Act.\n[28] Based on the absence of evidence of an active threat against the claimants for over five years, the lack of evidence that relatives have been approached by the FARC, the peace accord and demobilization of the FARC in most of the country, the decrease in crimes committed by the FARC and the absence of evidence of ongoing criminality in Bogota by the FARC or its former members, I find that there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate a serious possibility of persecution or a risk of harm on a balance of probabilities.\nCONCLUSION\n[29] Having considered all of the evidence, I find that the claimants are neither Convention refugees as set out in section 96, nor persons in need of protection within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the Act. Their claims are denied.\n(signed)\n\"Preeti Adhopia\"\nPreeti Adhopia\nAugust 10, 2017\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibit 1.\n3 Exhibit 9.\n4 Exhibit 18, National Documentation Package (NDP), Colombia, May 31, 2017, Item 2.4.\n5 Exhibit 18, NDP, Item 2.4.\n6 Exhibit 18, NDP, Item 2.1.\n7 Exhibit 19, p. 154.\n8 Exhibit 18, NDP, Item 2.2.\n9 Exhibit 18, NDP, Item 4.5.\n10 Exhibit 18, NDP, Item 4.5.\n11 Exhibit 18, NDP, Items 4.1 and 4.15.\n12 Exhibit 18.\n13 Exhibit 19, p. 9.\n14 Exhibit 19, pp. 44-45 and 31-32.\n15 Exhibit 19, pp. 41 and 142.\n16 Exhibit 19, pp. 64, 81, 84, 90 and 94-95.\n17 Exhibit 19, pp. 89 and 93-95.\n18 Exhibit 19, pp. 40-41.\n19 Exhibit 19, p. 18.\n20 Exhibit 19, p. 141.\n21 Exhibit 19, pp. 150-152.\n22 Exhibit 19, pp. 45, 56, 84-88 and 112.\n23 Exhibit 19, pp. 87-89.\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n1\nRPD 29.1 (2014\/02\/18)\nRPD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SPR : VB5-03381\/03382\/03383\/03384\/03385\n",

I will herein provide a brief summary.\n[7] At the time of the hearing, Mrs. XXXX, the Principal Claimant, was 62 years of age. Her husband, Mr. XXXX, was 69 years of age. The claimants lived in XXXX, in northeastern Pakistan. They allege that they experienced ongoing abuse and discrimination from people in their village and they had both experienced episodic violence and discrimination much of their lives.\n[8] Both Claimants claim to be devout in their Ahmadi faith and they fear returning to Pakistan on basis of their religious beliefs and practices as people of the Ahmadi faith. They fear harm because of laws in Pakistan which prevent people of the Ahmadi faith from preaching or practicing their religion. They also fear violence at the hands of extremist groups in Pakistan and the lack of state protection.\n[9] Mr. XXXX spent his career in the Pakistan army. He testified that he engaged in one day of active combat in a conflict between Pakistan and India in 1971. He testified that he did not handle any weapons. He appears to have had a successful career in the military and he retired in 19XXXX.\n[10] On XXXX XXXX, 2014, the Claimants were issued United States visitor visas. On or about XXXX XXXX, 2014 the Claimants travelled from Pakistan to New York. They then made their refugee claims on or about December 19, 2014 at Fort Erie, Ontario.\n[11] The hearing of this matter was delayed until 2016 as the Canada Border Services Agency (\"CBSA\") had conducted its own investigation into Mr. XXXX claim.\nIdentity\n[12] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Claimants are nationals of Pakistan. They provided certified copies of their Pakistani passports with their Canadian visitor visas to establish their personal and national identities.\n[13] I find on a balance of probabilities that the Claimants are of the Ahmadi faith. They have provided Ahmadi badges and certificates, identity cards, receipts, a letter from an Ahmadi Caliph, a photograph with the Ahmadi caliph and an Ahmadi marriage certificate. I also note that their respective Pakistani passports list their faith as \"Ahmadiyya.\"\nANALYSIS\n[14] The determinative factors in this claim are subjective fear and credibility.\n[15] The Claimants testified that they have had a difficult life in Pakistan, wholly due to Pakistani attitudes and laws regarding his Ahmadi faith. They have provided a very detailed narrative depicting not only their personal struggles, but also those of their extended family and Ahmadi people generally.\nThe Claimants Lack Subjective Fear\n[16] Mr. XXXX built his career in the Pakistani military over several decades, between 19XXXX to 19XXXX. He testified that during his military service he would have to pray separately from his fellow officers and they would call him derogatory names.\n[17] Mr. XXXX treatment by fellow officers while in the military did not appear to have a significantly negative effect on his career as he devoted XXXX years of service to this profession. It appears that it was only after Mr. XXXX retired that he and Mrs. XXXX began exploring the idea of leaving Pakistan. They allege that they were harassed by local extremists subsequent to Mr. XXXX retirement.\n[18] The Claimants attended the annual Ahmadi convention, the XXXX XXXX, in the United Kingdom in 2006. Mr. XXXX testified that near the end of the conference he and two others approached a representative of the Jama'at to inquire about making refugee claims in the United Kingdom. They were all told by this representative that they were not allowed to make refugee claims in the United Kingdom while on visitor visas obtained for the purpose of attending the annual conference. On the basis of this advice, the Claimants returned to Pakistan. Mr. XXXX attended that same convention the following year and did not make a refugee claim at that time, either.\n[19] The Claimants failed to claim asylum in the United Kingdom in 2006, and then again, when Mr. XXXX attended the same convention in 2007. The Claimants explained to me that they held the belief that they were prevented from claiming in the United Kingdom. In my opinion, they were mistaken in this belief. If their lives were in sufficient jeopardy of the persecution they allege within their claims, then they ought to have made refugee claims in the United Kingdom or, alternately, in a neighbouring European Union country, such as France.\n[20] The Claimants did not claim refugee status in the United Kingdom or France, but rather reavailed to Pakistan where they remained for an additional eight years, during which time they allege that they suffered ongoing abuse from anti-Ahamdi extremists. I note as well that Mrs. XXXX travelled to India in 2009 and 2013 to attend conferences, each time returning to Pakistan after the conference.\n[21] The Claimants' behaviour, as a whole, suggests a lack of subjective fear. Mr. XXXX had a successful career in the military and the Claimants built a life in Pakistan. Later, upon making inquiries and being told that they could not make refugee claims in the United Kingdom, the Claimants appear to have simply abandoned the thought of seeking protection and returned to their lives in Pakistan. From this, I draw a negative inference with regard to their respective levels of subjective fear, as well as their credibility.\n[22] The Claimants then travelled to the United States in XXXX 2014 and made their refugee claims at the Canadian border shortly after arriving. Eight years elapsed between making the initial inquiries about claiming refugee status in the United Kingdom and the Claimants' travel to North America. Such a delay, after having investigated making a refugee claim eight years prior to actually leaving, suggests that life in Pakistan was tolerable, or at least not frightening enough to cause the Claimants to flee.\n[23] I note that subjective fear is an essential element in a successful claim for refugee protection. In Kamana (Kamana, Jimmy v. M.C.I. (F.C.T.D., IMM-5998-98, September 24, 1999), Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer held:\nThe lack of evidence going to the subjective element of the claim is a fatal flaw which in and of itself warrants dismissal of the claim, since both elements of the refugee definition - subjective and objective - must be met.\n[24] Based on the Claimants' actions, it appears that they do not have the subjective fear they allege. I draw a negative inference regarding the Claimants' purported subjective level of fear, and consequently, their credibility as well.\nRisk Profile as Persons of the Ahmadi Faith\n[25] I accept that the Claimants are of the Ahmadi faith. The National Documentation Package (NDP) notes that there are an estimated 2-4 million people of the Ahmadi faith in Pakistan.4 The total population of Pakistan is slightly less than 200 million people. The NDP,5 as well as counsel's documentation package,6 both detail that the Ahmadi people in Pakistan are socially ostracized and that the practice and proselytization of the Ahmadi faith is criminalized. There are numerous reports of people of the Ahmadi faith being subject to discrimination and violence.\n[26] The Claimants do not appear to have a particular risk profile over and above their basic Ahmadi faith, however. There is no evidence to suggest that they would be at greater risk than any of the other millions of Ahmadis currently living in Pakistan. Mr. XXXX was able to build a successful career, despite his Ahmadi faith. Both Claimants left Pakistan and then willingly reavailed rather than claiming protection in Europe. The Claimants' apparent lack of subjective fear and impugned credibility as a result are such that their risk profiles are insufficient to ground successful refugee claims in this particular case.\n[27] Given the totality of the evidence presented by the Claimants, I find that due to their lack of requisite subjective fear and impugned credibility as a result, their claims cannot be accepted under s. 96. On this same reasoning, their failure to claim refugee status in the United Kingdom or elsewhere in Europe in 2006 and 2007; their failure to leave Pakistan earlier, despite their narrative detailing the persecution they and their family allegedly endured causes me to infer that the Claimants are not credible with respect to their fear of returning to Pakistan for the reasons alleged, and in that respect, their impugned credibility causes their claims to fail under section 97(1).\nCONCLUSION\n[28] Having considered all the evidence, and based on the above analysis, I find that XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX are not Convention refugees as they have not established that there is a serious possibility that they will face persecution on a Convention ground or that, on a balance of probabilities, they will face a risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture should they return to Pakistan, due to their actions, which have shown a lack of subjective fear which have not been adequately explained.\n[29] I therefore reject these claims pursuant to both sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n(signed)\nE.

She claims that she is from the minority tribe of XXXX, and as such, she is treated with disdain by other tribes in Somalia. She also claims that as a woman living alone in Somalia, and as a senior woman, she is open to harassment by soldiers who sexually assault women.\nINTERVENTION BY THE MINISTER\n[3] The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration intervened in this case by filing submissions.3 The Minister argues that the claim should be disallowed. He claims that the claimant now says that her name is XXXX XXXX XXXX and that she entered Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2016. However, a search was conducted and revealed that there is no record of any individual with that name entering Canada between XXXX XXXX, 2016 to XXXX XXXX, 2016. Further, he argues that the claimant stated in her Schedule 12 that she entered Canada using a non-genuine Australian passport in the name of XXXX XXXX; however, the records show that no person with this name has entered Canada within the past 10 years. As a result, the Minister argues that the claimant has failed to prove her identity and thus the claim should be rejected.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] The panel determines that the claimant has not established that there is a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, or that, on a balance of probabilities, she would be personally be subjected to a danger of torture, or face a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment upon return to her country.\n[5] The panel's reasons for its determination are as follows.\nMain Issue and the Law\n[6] The main issue in this case is identity. The claimant is required to provide documents establishing her identity and other elements of the claim. This is a mandatory provision.4 If a claimant does not provide such documents, then they must explain why that is, and what steps they took to obtain the documents. The Refugee Protection Division is required under the IRPA to take into account, when assessing the credibility of the claimant, whether the claimant possesses acceptable documentation establishing his or her identity. If the claimant has not, the panel is required to consider whether the claimant has provided a reasonable explanation for the lack of documentation or what steps the claimant has taken to acquire such documentation.5\nANALYSIS\n[7] The claimant has not provided sufficient documentation to prove her identity as required under the IRPA and its accompanying Rules. In this case, there are three elements to identity. There is the personal identity of the claimant, which is her real name and date of birth. Then there is her identity as a citizen of Somalia, and then there is her identity as a member of the XXXX tribe, which is one of the elements of her claim.\nThe personal identity of the claimant\nEntering Canada under a false name unnecessarily\n[8] The claimant claimed that she left Somalia on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2016, after she had sold her house, and went to Kenya where she stayed until XXXX XXXX, 2016. During her time there, it is clear from the claimant's testimony that she did investigate the possibility of making a refugee claim there, but due to the poor conditions for refugees, she decided against it. She stayed with someone in Kenya, a Somali citizen, who provided her with accommodation. After her time in Kenya, she then came to Canada.\n[9] Her stay in Kenya provided a break in her \"flight\" from Somalia. She was there for some three months. She was not persecuted in Kenya, though she stated that conditions there were not good. It was there that she enlisted the help of a smuggler who assisted her to come to Canada.\n[10] She alleges that she arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2016.6 She stated that she came to Canada pretending to be the wife of one XXXX XXXX, the smuggler. She also stated that she travelled to Canada using a non-genuine Australian passport in the name of XXXX XXXX. During the hearing, she testified to these same facts which confirmed that she knew she was travelling on an Australian passport which was not genuine. She also confirmed in her sworn testimony that it was not a genuine passport. The claimant testified that Mr. XXXX helped her at the airport to clear customs. She has been staying with a friend in Toronto, XXXX XXXX, who provided her with accommodation. The smuggler dropped her off at a restaurant after they arrived in Canada, from there she was picked up and taken to XXXX XXXX home.\n[11] The panel therefore finds that at the time she entered Canada, she was not fleeing from her country of persecution. She had been staying in Kenya, and her trip to Canada was planned carefully. She testified to selling her home in Somalia with the help of a facilitator. She also testified to using the proceeds of the sale to fund her trip to Canada.\n[12] Because she was not fleeing from Somalia, there was no reason for her to enter Canada using a false identity. It was not a situation where she had to use a false name so as to avoid detection when fleeing a country of persecution.\n[13] There was no reason why the claimant could not use her \"real\" name when coming to Canada. As a result, the panel finds that there is no justification for her entering Canada under a name other than her own, and therefore, the panel draws a negative credibility inference.\nFiling of refugee claim under a name provided by the claimant in her forms\n[14] The claimant filed her claim under the name XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claim was filed inland. She had counsel from the date of XXXX XXXX 2016, and thus, at the time she filed her claim on October 14, 2016. Her BOC, Schedules A and 12 were signed on September 2, 2016. The claim was referred to the Board from CBSA on October 14, 2016. This name was provided by her, in her Schedule 12, and provided at the time she filed her claim. The name she alleges she entered Canada on was not a name she had to give during an oral interview under stress to a CBSA official, as would have been the case if she had made her claim at the port of entry. Rather, she entered Canada, without detection using a fraudulent passport, and filed her claim some 7 weeks after her arrival in Canada and after having taken legal advice. The claimant herself provided the name she used when she entered Canada. She was not assisted in filling out her forms by an employee of Citizenship and Immigration Canada or Canada Border Services Agency. Rather, she had assistance from someone of her choice, namely XXXX XXXX, from a non-governmental organization (NGO), who helped her type her forms for submission inland to the authorities in Etobicoke. Mr. XXXX in turn made a declaration on the forms that the claimant understood the nature and effect of the forms. Nothing was said in the forms about the spelling of the two names which she used in her claim. There is therefore no reason to doubt the accuracy of the names given by the claimant, whether the false name or the true name, even though the claimant alleged that she was illiterate.\nNo record of anyone entering Canada under the two names given by the claimant\n[15] The Minister filed evidence that there is no record of any individual with the name XXXX XXXX entering Canada within the past 10 years.7 Nor was there any record of any individual with the name XXXX XXXX XXXX entering Canada between XXXX XXXX, 2016 and XXXX XXXX XXXX 2016.\n[16] The Minister's evidence establishes that the claimant did not enter Canada under the name XXXX XXXX, as she alleges in her sworn evidence.\n[17] As a result, the panel finds that the claimant's story about entering Canada under the name XXXX XXXX is not true. As a result, the panel draws a negative credibility inference.\n[18] Nor did she enter Canada under her \"real name,\" being the name she used in these proceedings, XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[19] Since her story about entering Canada under the name XXXX XXXX has been found not to be true, and since she misrepresented her identity at a time when it was not necessary to do so, the panel also rejects her evidence that her \"real\" name is XXXX XXXX XXXX. She has lied about her identity, at a time when she was under no compulsion to resort to subterfuge to facilitate her escape from a country of alleged persecution. There is no reason why the panel should believe her now.\nNo supporting evidence of the claimant's alleged Identity\n[20] The claimant provided no evidence at all to support her allegation that her real name is XXXX XXXX XXXX. There were no witnesses, no photos, no letters and simply nothing at all other than her testimony to support her evidence as to her true personal identity.\n[21] Counsel for the claimant asked the claimant if she had a birth certificate, driver's license, death certificate, driver's license, school documents, documents to sell vegetables, or documents to do business. The claimant stated in evidence that she had none of these documents.\n[22] As to the neutral country conditions, it is clear that identity documents are difficult to come by in Somalia, and the following points are noted:\ni. It is difficult to obtain a Somali passport because the government has been at war for over 20 years;8\nii. There are no good record-keeping systems in place in Somalia;9\niii. There continues to be no recognized competent civil authority to issue civil documents. The Government of Somalia ceased to exist in December 1990, and in the course of a civil war, most records were destroyed;10\niv. The standard norm when applying for documents in Somalia is to apply in person, fill out forms and pay a fee;11\nv. Documentation can be obtained by a third party who knows you, someone who knows the department or by high level officials who know the government;12\nvi. It is feasible to obtain documentation from Somalia such as passports, medical, educational and employment records. However, these records can only be obtained in major cities for a fee;13\nvii. According to the website of Canada post, there is no air service, including letter post, parcels and Priority Worldwide, surface service - including letter post and parcels to Somalia;14\nviii. The Somali government is issuing passports and identity cards in Mogadishu and citizens from other regions of Somalia are eligible.15 Applicants must provide an ID card, birth certificate and criminal background check;16\nix. Passport fraud in Somalia is rampant and the Canadian government does not recognize Somali passports as there are no credible or verifiable registers.17 It does not regard them as reliable and they cannot be utilized to enter Canada;\nx. Somalia commenced issuing a national ID card in December 2013. Individuals must provide fingerprints, pictures ad undergo a criminal reference check in order to obtain an ID card. The card must be applied for in person and the application process is over 30 days.18\n[23] The panel finds that identity documents from Somalia, while not easy to obtain, may be obtained with some effort. The panel reminds itself that the claimant alleges that she is illiterate, with no family in Somalia. However, the panel notes the following:\ni. She was able to sell her land with the help of a facilitator who also acted as her witness in the sale of the land. The buyer also had a witness by which the transaction was finalised. The proceeds of sale were evidently sufficient to fund her trip to Canada;\nii. She was able to stay with contacts of hers in both Canada and in Kenya, when she was there. She also was able to obtain assistance from a smuggler who assisted her in entering Canada successfully;\niii. She claimed in her testimony, when asked if she had proof of her name, that \"she was scared and ran and that she did not have documents with her.\" This was not in fact true. She left Somalia in a planned manner. She called a contact of hers, found a buyer, and sold her property witnessed by two persons. It was a calculated departure, not a flight;\niv. She provided no documents about her trip to Canada, whether the passport, ticket or boarding pass, as a result the panel may draw a negative credibility inference as per Elazi, Iseikete Simon v. M.C.I. (F.C.T.D., no. IMM-1038-99), Nadon, February 17, 2000;\nv. The claimant was asked if the woman she is staying with in Canada was from Somalia, and she said she did not know, she did not ask. But when asked what language they communicate in, she said it was Somali and that the woman was Somali. The claimant could not explain the overt contradiction when asked, and thus the panel draws a negative credibility inference;\nvi. When asked if the Somali woman she is staying with now could be a witness as to her identity, she said she did not ask her. The panel finds that the claimant's failure to ask this important Somali contact to come and be a witness on her behalf works against her credibility. The panel does not accept her explanation that this woman is always ill and therefore cannot attend. The panel draws a negative inference for her failure to have a witness at the hearing;\nvii. She stayed with a Somali woman in Kenya who kept her for 3 months, yet she had no letter or information from this woman in Kenya to support her claim and to act as a potential witness;\nviii. When asked if she had any photos of family, friends or relations which may assist in proving her identity, she said that she did not bring anything with her. She said that when she sold her home, she just left. The panel finds the claimant was being evasive when asked about supporting documentation from Somalia. The panel does not accept her evidence that she just left everything behind given the manner in which she sold her home. When asked why she did not gather materials to help her show who she is in the 20 days between when she said she was approached by Al Shabaab and when she left Somalia, she said she was old and did not know what was required of her. The panel does not accept this explanation. The claimant was cunning and shrewd. She was able to obtain help to sell her home; stay with a Somali person in Kenya; investigate the possibility of making a refugee claim in Kenya; obtain a false passport and enter Canada posing as the wife of the smuggler; obtain legal advice and file a refugee claim. The panel finds she has not been forthright as to the circumstances under which she left Somalia.\n[24] The panel finds that the claimant could have accessed some identity documents in Somalia, based on the country conditions there. Although she may be illiterate, she is a clever woman with contacts who are able to speak English and have assisted her along the way. She did not ask those she knew to testify on her behalf because she claims \"she did not know what was expected of her,\" despite having expert legal advice. She was able to investigate the refugee system in Kenya and reject it in favor of Canada. This is forum shopping.\n[25] The panel finds that even if she was not able to access identity documents in Somalia, she has made no effort to provide evidence as to her true name. She provided no sworn testimony as to how she came to have the name XXXX XXXX XXXX. There was no evidence on how she came to know what her birth date is, or how she is known to others in Somalia over the 67 years she has lived in there.\nIdentity as a Member of the XXXX Tribe\n[26] In her BOC, she said she was from the XXXX tribe. In her testimony, she said she was from the XXXX XXXX XXXX tribe. She was asked about the inconsistency. She said that when she was asked her tribe, she gave the short-form. Yet in her letter from XXXX XXXX, it says \"XXXX\" as well. The panel rejects her story about being from the XXXX tribe due to her inconsistent testimony.\nIdentity as a Citizen of Somalia.\n[27] The panel has already found that the claimant has not proved her personal identity, or her membership in the XXXX tribe.\n[28] Due to the credibility issues in this case, the panel also finds that she has not satisfied this panel as to her nationality as a citizen of Somalia.\n[29] The claimant provided a letter from XXXX XXXX.19 This is a non-profit organisation which renders services to refugees from the horn of Africa. It assists persons from Africa to establish their citizenship as required in proceedings such as these. They conducted an oral interview with the claimant. They noted that the claimant does not read or write. Her assessment was done by means of an oral interview. She was questioned through the Somali mother tongue about history, heritage, geography, clan lineage, and Somali culture. They concluded that she was born in XXXX Somalia, and belongs to the XXXX clan.\n[30] Counsel for the claimant, Mr. C. Forbes also conducted an interview of the claimant in the hearing. He asked her about the XXXX tribe, her home city and its districts and tribes, government, past leaders of the country, cultural artifacts and other such questions.\n[31] The information about Somalia could have been learned for the purposes of this hearing. Further, two letters were provided by XXXX XXXX. The first letter (Exhibit 4) indicated that the claimant filled in an application and answered a questionare. The second letter noted that as she was an older person who could not read or write, she only had to undergo an oral assessment. The second letter does not explain why the first letter was issued in error. Thus, on the face of the letters, there is a contradiction about the process used to evaluate the claimant. Nor does the letter explain why the claimant should be regarded as from the XXXX tribe. As a result, the panel gives no weight to the letter.\n[32] Based on the above evidence, the panel finds that the claimant has not established her identity as a citizen of Somalia on a balance of probabilities standard.\n[33] In conclusion, the panel finds that the claimant has failed to prove her identity, and as a result, her claim must fail.\nCONCLUSION\n[34] The panel concludes that the claimant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection and as a result her claim is dismissed.\n[35] The panel also finds that there is no credible basis for the claim pursuant to Section 107(2) of the IRPA.20\n(signed)\n\"J.

XXXX is 12 years old, XXXX is 9 years old, XXXX is 6 years old and XXXX is 4 years old.\n[4] The principal claimant alleges that she was physically and verbally abused by her husband, XXXX XXXX (hereinafter referred to as \"XXXX\") because she has been unable to conceive a male child. She alleges that the minor children were also physically and verbally abused because they were girls.\n[5] The principal claimant alleges that she applied for a divorce and moved out of the house in 2013. She alleges that there were a number of court appearances over the three (3) years of litigation.\n[6] Since the separation, the principal claimant alleges that XXXX continues to threaten her and the children in order to intimidate her into withdrawing her matrimonial case against him. The principal claimant alleges that on XXXX XXXX, 2016, XXXX came to her house with his uncle and three (3) mean looking men. XXXX demanded that the principal claimant drop all of her financial demands in the divorce proceedings and told her that she had until the end of the year to leave Nigeria. She also alleges that he slapped her. The principal claimant alleges that XXXX told her that she better not go somewhere else in Nigeria because he would declare the children missing and the police would find them. So, the principal claimant alleges that she applied for American visas.\n[7] The claimants arrived in Canada having landed in the United States of America first.\n[8] The principal claimant alleges that she and the minor claimants cannot return to Nigeria because XXXX or his family will kill them.\nDETERMINATION\n[9] I find that the claimants are not Convention refugees as they do not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Nigeria. Further, I find that they are not persons in need of protection as their removal to Nigeria would not subject them personally to a risk to life, to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or to a danger of torture.\nISSUES\n[10] There are three (3) issues in this claim:\na. Have the claimants established their identities?\nb. Is the principal claimant excluded from making a claim in Canada?\nc. Are the claimants credible witnesses?\nANALYSIS\nHave the claimants established their identities?\n[11] The claimants' identities, as nationals of Nigeria, are established by the supporting documentation filed; namely, certified copies of their passports.4 I have also been provided with the Certificates of Birth for all of the minor claimants.5 I accept that the claimants are citizens of Nigeria.\nIs the principal claimant excluded from making a claim in Canada?\n[12] The principal claimant has not produced any evidence to confirm that the minor claimants' father has provided his consent for the minor claimants to travel with the principal claimant to Canada.\n[13] As a result, on January 24, 2016, the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) notified the Minister about a concern that the principal claimant may be excluded from making a claim in Canada due to the commission of a serious non-political crime; namely abduction. The Minister has not intervened.\n[14] Although the RPD has not been provided with evidence that the minor claimant's father has consented to the minor claimant's travel to Canada with the principal claimant, I do not have any evidence that the principal claimant has acted against the will of XXXX. The principal claimant's evidence is that she cannot obtain XXXX consent because he is the agent of persecution.6\n[15] Although Nigeria is not a signatory to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, I do not have any evidence that XXXX has brought an urgent application before the court to litigate the abduction issue and to have the court pronounce final orders on the residence of the minor claimants. Surely, if the principal claimant acted against the will of XXXX, after not seeing his children for three (3) months, XXXX would have taken steps to have the children returned to Nigeria.\n[16] I find that there is not enough evidence before me to conclude, on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant is excluded from making a claim in Canada because she abducted her children.\nAre the claimants credible witnesses?\n[17] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true, unless there is valid reason to doubt their truthfulness.7 However, when a claimant is found to lack credibility generally, this may conceivably extend to all relevant information emanating from her testimony.8 I find that, in this case, the claimants have not provided sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to support their fear of returning to Nigeria. I make this finding because the principal claimant was inconsistent with respect to the violence she faced, there were a number of omissions regarding the abuse, and the claimants provided non-genuine documents in support of their claim. All of these credibility issues combined results in a finding that the claimants are generally not credible such that I do not believe their allegations that they endured, and are at risk of enduring, domestic abuse and ultimately murder in Nigeria.\nInconsistency with respect to the Abuse endured during Pregnancy\n[18] According to the principle claimant's Narrative, XXXX beat her like crazy during her pregnancy with XXXX, their youngest child.9 The principal claimant testified that she \"got a slap\" from XXXX when he found out that XXXX was going to be a girl. A single slap is not the same as being beaten \"like crazy.\" I asked the claimant whether she was hurt any more times while she was pregnant with XXXX as perhaps another time she was beaten \"like crazy.\" The principal claimant testified that she was. I asked her to tell me what happened. The principal claimant testified that when XXXX was two (2) months old, XXXX beat her up. I repeated my question regarding physical violence while pregnant and asked the principal claimant to tell me about an incident that occurred while she was pregnant. The claimant told me about the same incident that occured when XXXX found out that XXXX was going to be a girl. This time she stated that XXXX \"pushed [her] away with a slap.\" I advised that principal claimant that she had already told me about that incident but that I wished to hear about another one. Again, the principal claimant told me about the incident when XXXX was two (2) months old. I pointed out to the claimant that she wrote in her Narrative that XXXX \"beat her like crazy\" during her pregnancy and that she had only told me about one incident were she was either slapped or pushed away; I asked her why her testimony was different from her Narrative. The principal claimant stated that there was no difference. I do not agree. When someone writes that they are beaten \"like crazy\" it leads the reader to believe that the person was brutally and severely attacked on a number of occasions. However, the claimant inconsistently with her Narrative testified that XXXX either slapped her once or pushed her away. I find that the principal claimant was inconsistent with respect to the severity, number of occurrences and method of her alleged domestic violence.\n[19] I acknowledge that, after we took a break, the claimant testified that XXXX used to beat her mercilessly that she would shout to the neighbours to save her. I note that I have not been provided with any evidence from these neighbours. In any event, this is not what the claimant testified to in the first instance. I find that, it is more likely than not, during the 20 minute break, the claimant was able to develop a story about being hurt by XXXX while she was pregnant that was more in line with her Narrative. I find that this undermines her credibility with respect to the violence she faced.\nNon-Genuine Medical Report\n[20] As stated above, the claimant alleges that XXXX beat her when XXXX was two (2) months old in XXXX of 2013. As a result of this incident the claimant sought medical attention. The claimant has provided a Medical Note which indicates that she attended at the doctor on XXXX XXXX, 2013.10 I asked the principal claimant why she waited one (1) month before she went to the doctor. The claimant explained that she did not have the money to go right away.\n[21] I pointed out that the Medical Note indicated that the principal claimant presented with bruising.11 I asked the principal claimant how it was possible that she had bruising a month later. The claimant explained that she still had bruising because she did not take care of her bruises the proper way. It is general knowledge that bruises last for a few days and then begin to fade on their own. They are normally gone within approximately two (2) weeks. If they take longer than that, it is usually due to an underlying serious medical condition. The Medical Note does not indicate an underlying serious medical condition and therefore, I am not persuaded that the principal claimant would have presented with bruising a month after she was harmed.\n[22] In addition to this anomaly, both principal claimant's first and last name are spelt wrong.12 I asked the principal claimant about this and she explained that, in Nigeria, people are careless about their responsibilities. Given that I am not persuaded that the principal claimant would have presented with bruising a month after she was harmed and that both her first and last name are spelt wrong, I find that this document has been fabricated. This false document undermines the claimant's credibility with respect to the violence she faced.\nOmission with respect to being forcibly removed from the Matrimonial Home and Posed Photographs\n[23] The claimants have provided a number of photographs. For example, the claimants provided photographs which she indicates depicts a time when XXXX and his family forced the claimants to leave the matrimonial home in the middle of the night.13 This incident was not contained in the Basis of Claim form. I asked the principal claim why she did not mention that she was kicked out of her home with her four (4) children. The principal claimant explained that if she had to write everything there would be so much irrelevancies. I am not persuaded that forcibly removing a mother and her four (4) young children from the matrimonial home is irrelevant. Being locked out of the house is abusive and, in this situation, the abuse would have been directed at both the principal claimant and the minor claimants. I find that, if this incident occurred, it would have been mentioned in the Basis of Claim.\n[24] I asked the claimant who took these photographs. The principal claimant stated vaguely that it was someone in the neighbourhood. She also testified that this photograph was taken at a photographic studio when the owner had left for the day. I asked the claimant why, if they were truly forcibly removed from their home, the neighbours would arrange for this photograph to be taken rather than help the family. The principal claimant explained that this was all the help that the neighbours were able to provide. I do not accept this explanation as reasonable. It is far more likely that, if the claimant and her young children were kicked out of their home in the middle of the night, the neighbours would take the family into their homes, help calm them down and provide them with a place to sleep and a warm meal. I am not persuaded that, in this dire situation, if genuine, the neighbours would arrange to go to photographic studio to have photographs taken. I find that these photographs have been fabricated. I find that both the principal claimant's omission of this incident from her Basis of Claim and the modelled photographs, undermine the principal claimant's credibility with respect to the abuse she faced.\nMisleading Photographs\n[25] The claimants also provided photographs of a door taken off the hinges.14 I asked the principal claimant about this incident. The principal claimant explained that she tried to have the least amount of contact with XXXX as possible. So, when XXXX was at home, she and the minor claimants would hide in her room. She testified that it was so bad that she would bring a container into the room and she and the children would use this container as a toilet. XXXX solution was to remove the door to her room. Since that time, she had to sleep with one eye open and decided that she must get together the money to leave the home. Again, this incident was not in the claimants' Narrative. I asked the principal claimant why she did not mention it. The principal claimant testified that it would be confusing if she mentioned everything. I do not accept this explanation as reasonable. The allegation that she and the children were so afraid that they locked themselves in a room when XXXX was home amounts to serious and ongoing isolation. If it occurred, the principal claimant would have mentioned it in her Narrative.\n[26] In any event, the electronic date on these photographs is XXXX XXXX, 2014. The claimant testified that she moved out of the home in XXXX of 2013. These photographs were taken almost a year after she moved out of the matrimonial home.\n[27] I find that these photographs are not what the principal claimant purports them to be. I find that the principal claimant sought to mislead the Board. I find that both the principal claimant's omission of this incident from her Basis of Claim and the misleading photographs undermine the principal claimant's credibility with respect to the abuse she faced.\nInconsistency with respect to the Date of Separation, Non-Genuine Court Order and a Lack of Documents\n[28] As stated above, the claimant testified that she moved out of the matrimonial home in XXXX of 2013. However, according to the principal claimant's Schedule A, she moved out of the matrimonial home in XXXX of 2013. When I asked the principal claimant about this five (5) month inconsistency she stated that she did not leave the home in XXXX. She did not provide an explanation for the inconsistency.\n[29] The claimants provided a Court Order from the High Court of Lagos State dated XXXX XXXX, 2015.15 In this Order, XXXX is supposed to exercise access at the principal claimant's home located at XXXX XXXX Street; however, according to the principal claimant's Schedule A, she lived at XXXX XXXX Street.16 When I asked the principal claimant about this inconsistency she explained that XXXX access was not to take place at her house. However, the Order actually states \"at her residence at XXXX XXXX Street;\"17 therefore, I do not accept her explanation. There is no indication in this Order that the access visit is to take place at the home a family member or a mutual friend.\n[30] Other than this Order, the claimants have not provided any other evidence of the divorce. The principal claimant and XXXX had been involved in matrimonial litigation for over three (3) years and, according to the principal claimant, had attended court many times. I find it strange that the claimant does not have plenty of documents to evidence this litigation. I asked the principal claimant about a number of documents, like the draft Separation Agreement that XXXX wanted her to sign, the letter regarding the dissolution of her marriage that she received from the court and documents regarding XXXX rejection of the children purportedly contained in his lawsuit. The principal claimant gave me many explanations for not having these documents; she said that she could not reach her lawyer. However, this does not make sense given that she has provided a letter from him18 as well as a number of different documents from the Nigerian Bar Association and XXXX XXXX XXXX.19 She also claimed that she had asked her lawyer to send her these documents but he had not done so. I do not accept this explanation either given the multitude of other documents the lawyer has sent. Lastly, she also stated that her lawyer did not provide some documents because they had not been filed in court. In any event, over three (3) years of matrimonial litigation would have generated a hefty amount of paperwork. I do not find it reasonable that the claimant does not have anything else, besides this one Order, to evidence her acrimonious divorce from XXXX.\n[31] Given both the anomaly with respect to the addresses, the lack of additional evidence regarding the divorce, and the non-genuine documents already provided, I am not persuaded that this Court Order is real. While I acknowledge that the claimants have produced documents to show that the principal claimant's Nigerian lawyer exists, that does not necessarily mean that this Court Order is genuine. Not all lawyers follow the rules of professional conduct. Given that this Court Order is not genuine, I also give little weight to the letter from the Nigerian Lawyer.20 As a result of the non-genuine Court Order and the inconsistency regarding her address, I am not persuaded that the claimant is even going through a divorce.\nXXXX Testimony\n[32] Lastly, although the claim does not turn on this point, I found XXXX testimony to be rehearsed and likely a regurgitation of what her mother, the principal claimant, had taught her to say. When I asked XXXX why she felt that her father treated her badly, XXXX testified that \"he abused us physically and verbally....\" XXXX is 12 years old. I find it hard to believe that a child would naturally use the phrasing \"he abused us physically and verbally.\" A child is far more likely to say something like \"he hit us\" or \"he called me stupid.\" The adult terminology used by XXXX are not likely her words. In any event, as I have stated, the claim does not turn on this point and I would have found the claimants to be generally not credible on the testimony of the principal claimant alone and the non-genuine documents provided.\nOther Documents\n[33] The claimants have provided a letter from their church indicating that the principal claimant had a misunderstanding with her husband.21 I do not find this letter to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants endured and are at risk of domestic violence to the extent that they are in need of protection in Canada. At most, it indicates that the principal claimant had an argument with her husband.\n[34] I acknowledge that the claimants have provided affidavits from the principal claimant's brother22 and their neighbor.23 While I have considered these two (2) documents, I find that these do not outweigh the credibility concerns and the non-genuine documents that I have been provided as well.\n[35] Lastly, the claimants also provided a psychotherapist report24 which contains facts as told to the psychotherapist by the principal claimant. As I have credibility concerns with respect to the claimant's allegations that her life, and that of her children, is at risk, I have not afforded the psychotherapist's report much weight. I have done this because, if the claimants were generally not credible with both their testimony and documents, telling the same, unpersuasive, account to the psychotherapist does not make the story genuine, on a balance or probabilities. The fact that the principal claimant was able to tell the same story twice does not outweigh the inconsistencies, omissions and non-genuine and lacking documents.\n[36] The claimant wrote in her Narrative that XXXX told her not to \"play smart with him by going somewhere else in Nigeria.\" According to the principal claimant, XXXX claimed he would simply \"declare the children missing in Nigeria and the police will fish [them] out.\" This does not make sense. According to the claimant, the reason for XXXX abuse after separation was to stop the principal claimant from pursuing the matrimonial matter in court. Therefore, there would be no difference between her moving somewhere else in Nigeria and leaving the country; either way, she could not pursue her claim. Or, if she could pursue her claim, she could do so at a distance from either country by having her lawyer do so on her behalf.\n[37] In addition, XXXX threat to call the police to declare the children missing with the goal of finding them in Nigeria is inconsistent with the allegation that he wants the family to disappear. If he wanted the family to disappear, he would not report them missing in order that they be found.\n[38] I find that the claimant disingenuously wrote this statement in her Narrative to address the concept of Internal Flight Alternative.\n[39] While I find this case turns on the issue of credibility, if it did not, the claimants likely also have an internal flight alternative. XXXX has no ties to the proposed internal flight alternative locations, there is no evidence of recent threats, XXXX has not even contacted the principal claimant's siblings and his connection with politicians are from at least XXXX years ago. In addition, the claimants speak English, are Christian and the proposed internal flight alternative locations are in predominately Christian areas. The principal claimant is well educated, she is a business woman and, in addition to this, has had a number of different careers during her life time evidencing an array of transferrable skills. She has lived on her own, as a single mother, for over three (3) years, she has the financial support of her siblings, she is independent having travelled by herself both to the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada and has indicated a willingness to relocate within Nigeria on recent job applications.\nCONCLUSION\n[40] Given the inconsistencies, omissions, non-genuine documents and lack of corroborating documents, I have found that the claimants are generally not credible with respect to the alleged domestic violence they faced and will face in the future.\n[41] Having considered all the evidence, I determine that there is not a serious possibility that the claimants will be persecuted in Nigeria, or that, on a balance or probabilities, they would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if returned to Nigeria. Accordingly, their claims for refugee protection are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"M. A. McColl\"\nM. A.

I also determine that the claimant is not a person in need of protection under section 97(1) of the IRPA.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The specifics of the claim are set out in the narrative to the claimant's Personal Information Form (PIF)2 and his oral testimony. The following outlines his allegations.3\n[4] The claimant was born in Bingol, in south-eastern Turkey, twenty-eight years ago, but has been a resident of the city of Istanbul in Turkey since shortly after his birth. He claims to be of Kurdish ethnicity.\n[5] The claimant has several years of post-secondary education in a university in Turkey.\n[6] He is not a member of any political party but he supported the DTP political party and the BDP, which was the successor to the DTP.\n[7] The claimant, although not a member, supported Kurdish political parties, by participating in demonstrations and rallies, distributing brochures and pamphlets, arranging tables and chairs, and serving tea to guests during party meetings, as a volunteer.\n[8] The claimant was arrested, detained and beaten up by the authorities four times between 2007 and 2010.\n[9] The claimant has evaded military service so far, and he claims that he is a conscientious objector.\n[10] Fearing for his life, the claimant left Turkey on XXXX XXXX, 2010, arrived in the United States of America (US) that day, travelled to the Canadian border on XXXX XXXX, 2010, and filed his refugee claim on the same date, as an exception to the Safe Third Country protocol.\nPRELIMINARY MATTERS\n[11] The claim first came on for a Refugee Protection Division (\"RPD\" or the \"Division\") hearing in 2012, over two sittings. On January 9, 2013, the Division determined the claimant was not a Convention refugee and not a person in need of protection.4 The claimant sought and was granted leave for judicial review. The judgment on review was decided by the Federal Court on February 20, 2014, allowing the application, setting aside the decision of the RPD, and remitting the claim to the RPD for determination by a different member of the Board.5\n[12] Claimant's counsel made three applications: one for the panel to accept an updated PIF narrative, secondly, for the panel to consider the decision of the Federal Court as tantamount to a direction to find the claimant a Convention refugee (obviating a need for a hearing); and thirdly, after making oral submissions on the second application, for the panel to recuse because of bias.\n[13] For the record, I note that the first two applications were not in conformity with rule 33 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules6, which requires a party to provide a document 10 days before the date fixed for the hearing, in this claim, September 19, 2017, but I received them on the morning of the hearing, and delayed the start of the hearing for about twenty minutes to review the materials. I note that the Division sent the claimant and his counsel of record a Notice to Appear on or about August 15, 2017. The counsel of record is the same counsel who appeared before the first panel in 2012, and before the Federal Court.\n[14] During a pre-hearing conference without the presence of the claimant, I admitted the claimant's updated narrative into evidence,7 notwithstanding that the narrative was late, but dismissed the other two applications for the reasons set out below.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity and Issues\n[15] On a balance of probabilities, I find8 that the claimant established his personal identity and that he is a national of Turkey, based on a copy of his passport, filed.9\n[16] I further find that the claimant established, on a balance of probabilities, that he is a member of the Kurdish minority of Turkey. This finding is based on an affidavit of Huseyn Sertkaya, who spoke to the claimant's Canadian brother and established that the claimant's brother speaks the Kurdish language of Turkey very well. I note that the claimant showed me a letter from the Toronto Kurdish community centre, but he did not ask for it to be admitted into evidence. Although I find the evidence to be weak and not entirely persuasive, I see no reason to find that the claimant did not establish that he is of Kurdish ethnicity.10\n[17] I also find that the claimant did not establish either his political identity or his identity as a conscientious objector, for the reasons that follow.\n[18] The issues I outlined and on which claimant's counsel provided further oral submissions at the conclusion of the hearing, were:\ni. Has the claimant established his claim with sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence?\nii. Is the claimant at risk of persecution or other harm because he is a Kurd?\niii. Is the claimant at risk of persecution or other harm because of his political profile and activities prior to coming to Canada?\niv. Has the claimant established that he has been detained and tortured four times prior to coming to Canada?\nv. Is the claimant a conscientious objector?\nvi. Is the claimant a draft evader? If so, is the claimant facing persecution or other serious harm for failing to appear for his basic training?\nvii. Is the claimant facing persecution for any reason, or has he experienced and would he face, instead, discrimination or harassment?\nviii. Instead of persecution, is the claimant facing prosecution for breaching a non-persecutory law of general application?\nix. Has the claimant established the subjective basis of his fear?\nCredibility\n[19] The claimant did not provide sufficient credible evidence to support the well-foundedness of his fear of persecution or risk of other serious harm.\n[20] The Federal Court, in Maldonado11, held that,\n\"When an applicant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there be reason to doubt their truthfulness.\"\n[21] However, as set out by Mr. Justice Harrington in the Federal Court case of Owoussou,\n\"It would be grossly unfair to allow safe haven as a refugee simply on that persons say so. Often the core of the claim cannot be verified, but other elements can, which is why the rules call upon the claimant to provide acceptable documentation.\"12\n[22] The claimant provided three documents that he alleges and counsel submits establishes his claim that he has the political profile he says he does, and that he faces charges of draft evasion, for failing to appear when allegedly called up.\n[23] I find that there are reasons to suspect that the documents provided by the claimant (the draft deferral letter,13 the list of conscripts,14 and the letter from the Peace and Democracy Party or BPD15 are either not genuine documents or, at least, do not indicate what the claimant alleges they indicate.\nIs the claimant facing persecution or other serious harm because he is Kurdish?\n[24] I find he is not, for the following reasons.\n[25] A review of the documentary evidence indicates that, although many Kurds are fully integrated into Turkish society, many other do face discrimination, which, I find, does not rise to a level of persecution, for this reason alone. Although the documentary evidence is somewhat mixed, according to the UK Home Office16:\n2.2.1 Kurds are estimated to be the largest ethnic minority group in Turkey representing 17% of the total population. A significant proportion of Kurdish people have integrated fully into Turkish society.\n2.2.2 Kurds have historically experienced discrimination in Turkey. The main way in which the Turkish state has discriminated against Kurds has been in use of language and education. Until recently, the use of minority languages was forbidden by law but these restrictions have now been eased so as to allow Kurdish and other minority languages to be used in education in private schools - though not yet in state schools - in broadcasting and in election campaigning. The Kurdish new year holiday of Newroz is generally freely and peacefully celebrated with rallies in cities nationwide.\n2.2.3 There have been a small number of reports of ill-treatment by the authorities which primarily concern the police using excessive force in responding to demonstrations involving Kurds, but such heavy-handedness is not confined to Kurds alone. Kurdish civil society organizations and political parties continued to experience problems exercising the freedoms of assembly and association.\n2.2.4 Hate rhetoric by some of the Turkish media has been reported, as have incidents of societal violence. The numbers of such incidents are however relatively small compared to the size of the Kurdish population in Turkey.\n2.2.5 Even when taken cumulatively the discrimination faced by Kurds does not in general amount to them being subject to action on the part either of the populace or the authorities which would amount to persecution within the terms of the Refugee Convention or otherwise inhuman or degrading treatment. Each case must be assessed on its own merits, taking full account of the particular circumstances and profile of the person and any past persecution.\nIs the claimant facing persecution or other serious harm because of his political opinion?\n[26] I find he is not, for the following reasons.\n[27] The claimant alleges that he was active in supporting two Kurdish political parties, the Democratic Society Party (Demokratik Toplum Partisi, or DTP), and its successor, the Peace and Democracy Party (BPD). The claimant alleges that he was actively involved in the parties' activities, although he never joined either of them or any other political party, from 2007 until he left Turkey in 2010. He further alleges that, because he is a Kurd, and because he took part in various protests and rallies, as well as other political activities with these parties, he came to the attention of the police or security forces in Istanbul - he alleges he was detained, beaten, tortured and threatened with even more serious harm, if he did not cease his activities.\n[28] I note that the claimant admitted that he does not have any charges, convictions, police or medical reports of any kind. I further note that the claimant, notwithstanding the interest of the police in him, including his allegation that a police torturer remembered him two years apart, the claimant was able to obtain a US study visa in XXXX 2010.17 To obtain a US visa, it is well-known that the American authorities would have checked for any criminality or other reason to be concerned about the claimant from the Turkish authorities. Furthermore, I note that the claimant exited Turkey from the international airport in Istanbul, where he would have undergone security clearance procedures, at least three times: firstly, to obtain his boarding pass, secondly, to enter the secured area of the airport from the public area, and thirdly, to board the aircraft. I find that if the Turkish authorities had any interest in the claimant, they would have flagged him at the airport on his exit from Turkey, but they did not, and the US visa office would not have granted the claimant a visa. I have drawn an adverse inference from the claimant's ability to leave Turkey without let or hindrance, and from his ability to obtain a US visa.18\n[29] The DTP began in 2005 and was banned in 2008. The Research Directorate found,\nAccording to the Political Handbook of the World 2015 (PHW), the BDP was formed in 2008 as a successor to the DTP, which was formed in 2005 as a successor to DEHAP, which was a successor to HADEP.19\n[30] Nowhere in his PIF narrative does the claimant allege he was active with the BDP, the successor to the DTP, and yet the only evidence the claimant has provided, other than his own testimony, is a letter allegedly from the BDP in Uskudar, his neighbourhood in Istanbul. As such, the letter does not corroborate the claimant's activities prior to 2008, but what it does indicate is that the claimant was \"involved in youth activities organized by our party from 2008 to 2010\", and that is all it says.20 It is not clear whether the letter is genuine or not, because of my other credibility concerns, above and below, but even if it is, it does not indicate any political profile such that the claimant would be of interest to the police or security apparatus of Turkey, should he return.\n[31] Claimant's counsel submitted that a panel must be careful not to draw adverse inferences from what a letter does not say, as opposed to what it does say. She was not able to cite the case upon which she based her legal proposition. I note that Mr. Justice Zinn, in Sitnikova,21 had this to say about what a letter says as opposed to what it does not say:\n[22] Second, the applicant submits that the officer erred by assessing evidence based on what it does not say, rather than on what it says. For example, the officer discounted letters describing the police harassment of the applicant's family because \"[n]one of the writers indicate that they sought to bring formal complaints against the harassing officers and if not, why not.\"\n[23] I agree. In Belek v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 205 (CanLII) at para 21, I held that:\n...documents that corroborate some aspects of an applicant's story cannot be discounted merely because they do not corroborate other aspects of his story: Mahmud v Canada (Minister of Citizenship & Immigration), 1999 CanLII 8019 (FC), 167 FTR 309 at paras 8-12 [Mahmud]. Here the RAD assigns little weight to a letter that corroborates some of the applicant's story simply because it fails to provide details that would further corroborate his story. The RAD fails to explain why it would be reasonable to expect these further details to have been provided, such that a negative inference can be drawn from their absence: See Taha v Canada (Minister of Citizenship & Immigration), 2004 FC 1675 (CanLII) at para 9. Absent such justification, the RAD's treatment of this document is unreasonable.\n[24] This reasoning applies in the present case. If the letter writers had mentioned that they had complained about police harassment and no action was taken, then this might have corroborated the applicant's claim that the police are, at best, indifferent to her persecution. However, the mere fact that the letter writers did not mention this is no reason to discount the evidence that they did provide. ...\n[26] If this was the only basis on which the letters were given little weight, then I would agree with the applicant. However, the officer did not discount the applicant's evidence solely because it came from individuals who support the applicant. The officer also cited credibility concerns about the applicant, as well as weaknesses in the letters themselves, including their lack of detail and the fact that they were not sworn statements. After considering all of these factors, the officer concluded that the letters had been engineered to support the applicant's claim. I cannot say that this assessment was unreasonable. [Emphasis added by me.]\n[32] The documentary evidence indicates that many BPD and Democratic People's Party (HDP) members are imprisoned and badly treated:\nIn 2011, Human Rights Watch reported that \"hundreds\" of BDP and former DTP members were in prison and being charged under terrorism laws for membership in the Union of Kurdistan Communities\/Turkey assembly (Koma Civak\u00ean Kurdistan\/T\u00fcrkiye Meclisi, KCK\/TM), an \"alleged front organization for the PKK,\" some of whom were in prolonged detention of up to two years (Human Rights Watch 18 Apr. 2011). Reporting on a the trial of 152 BPD\/DTP members in Diyarbakir, Human Rights Watch states that there was little evidence that the defendants engaged in terrorist acts, as defined by international law, or that they received logistical or financial support from an outlawed group (ibid.).22\n[33] If the claimant had been as active politically, as he alleged he was, I find that it would be more likely than not that the neighbourhood party chief would say so. The fact that he indicates that the claimant was involved only in youth activities organized by the party, but nothing about rallies, detentions or beatings, or organized events, as alleged in his testimony at the first hearing, is reason to find the claimant did not have such a profile that he alleged he had, or one that would be of any interest to the Turkish authorities.\n[34] Furthermore, if he was of interest to the authorities, I find that he would not have been allowed to exit Turkey in September 2010, as I already noted above.\n[35] For these reasons, I find that the claimant was not of any interest to the authorities when he left Turkey in XXXX 2010.\n[36] The claimant also alleged that he faces persecution and other serious harm, including the danger of torture, should he return to Turkey because he failed to report as a conscript, and the reason that the claimant did not report for military service was that he was already in Canada and, as a conscientious objector, he would not have reported for his military service, in any event.\nDid the claimant evade the draft?\n[37] I find23 he did not, for the following reasons: I find, on balance, that the military service deferral letter is not genuine, the list of conscripts is not genuine, and the claimant is not now wanted for the Turkish authorities, notwithstanding his allegation that he failed to appear for his basic training, when called up.\n[38] The claimant alleged that all Turkish males between the ages of 19 and 40 are duty-bound to provide military service to the state, that the authorities deferred his call-up for several years because he was a student (until February 2012), that he was called for military service to commence in February 2012, and that he did not enter military service when called to do so. The documentary evidence indicates that university students are required to perform six months of service as an ordinary recruit, or twelve months, as an officer.24\n[39] In addition to his PIF narrative and his testimony at the two hearings, the claimant provided a letter allegedly from the Military Draft Command of Uskudar, Istanbul, Turkey, and dated 2 November 2009.25 I asked the claimant if the letter was genuine and he stated that it was. I noted that the letter had not been disclosed to either the first tribunal or to the Federal Court, but only provided when I asked the claimant if he had the letter. He produced the letter found in Exhibit 8 at the hearing, along with an English translation, without any explanation as to why he had not put the letter into evidence before, when he had gone to the trouble of translating it. I found many problems with the letter, which I pointed out to the claimant, during the hearing.\n[40] Claimant's counsel allowed me to keep the original document, and invited me to send it out for forensic testing. I have declined to do so but attached it to Exhibit 8, as I am not aware that our sources for such testing would have a sample draft letter with which to compare this letter.\n[41] Firstly with respect to the so-called deferral letter, I noted that, although allegedly an official letter from the Military Draft Command of the Ministry of National Defence for the Republic of Turkey, the letter was not written on letterhead, that could be identified as being official, in any way: there is no logo, symbol, or great seal at the top of the letter, which one tends to see in official government documents. That is, the English translation indicates the top of the letter is: \"Republic of Turkey, Ministry of National Defense, Military Draft Command, Uskudar\", yet there is no great seal for the Republic, or a National Defense seal, or even a Military Draft Command seal, or an official seal of any sort, in the letterhead. I find this highly suspect, but that is not all.\n[42] The letter in question is not a form letter, which one might expect from such an agency. For example, there would be more likely than not, pre-printed areas followed by the specific requirements of the sender. At the top of the letter, across from the date, are two lines, rendered into English as \"Military Draft Branch\" and \"Subject\", each followed by a colon (in the Turkish version) and then the putative branch and the subject matter, here rendered as \"Military Service Status\". Again, below the body of the letter, are the following areas, followed by colons: \"Identity Information\" followed by several sub-headings, \"Military Service Information\" followed by several sub-headings, and other sub-headings, all of which would likely be pro-forma areas for inclusion in all records of military service status. Yet, none of this pro-forma material, as set out above, and obvious from the English version, at least, have been pre-printed, as the whole letter including what one might call the \"letterhead\" is in the same typeface and font.\n[43] The claimant, when I asked why there was no official seal or logo in the letterhead, pointed to what may be an ink-stamped seal, used by the person who signed the letter. I have problems with this part of the letter, too. Although it is difficult to tell if the seal was imprinted on the letter as part of an ink-jet printing process created by a computer application at the time that the letter was created, as opposed to a seal imprinted by an inked hand-stamp after the letter was printed, the seal is illegible to the point one cannot be sure what the seal is supposed to represent, and the seal, which one would expect to find over a signature to give some assurance of authenticity, is found in the centre of the document, to the left of and below the signature.\n[44] Finally, although the putative draft deferral letter is under the letterhead of the \"Military Draft Command\", I could not find in the documentary evidence any reference to this branch of the Ministry of National Defense, only reference to a \"Department of Recruitment\".\n\"One cannot be satisfied that the evidence is credible or trustworthy, unless satisfied that it is probably so, not just possibly so.\"26\n[45] What I had thought was another questionable aspect of the \"original\" document was the reference to the nation, rendered in English as \"Republic of Turkey\". That is not what appears in the Turkish version: there, instead of \"T\u00fcrkiye Cumhuriyeti\", we see only the initials, \"T.C.\", the abbreviation of the Turkish equivalent of \"Republic of Turkey\". However, in reviewing other documents in this and other Turkish claims, I have found that quite often such documents are headed, \"T.C.\" only.\n[46] Notwithstanding my discovery of the use of the T.C. on official documents, nevertheless, for all the other reasons I have provided, I find that the claimant has not established that his obligation for military service was deferred to 21 February 2012, as alleged, as the letter he provided to corroborate this aspect of his claim is, on balance, not genuine.\n[47] Another document that the claimant provided to support his allegation that he evaded the military draft is a document translated into English as \"List of Conscripts to be dispatched in February 2012\".27 The Turkish version is what appears to be a computer-generated printout of one page of a lengthier document. It is not an original, but a copy of something else that was not provided. I asked the claimant how he obtained the document. He said he did not remember, exactly, but that he surmised that his father sent it to him. He further stated that the document had been sent to the \"headman\" for Uskudar, his neighbourhood in Istanbul, who then provided a copy for the claimant's father. This makes little sense. Clearly, the draft board has the claimant's last known address, as Turkish residents are required to register where they reside with the village, town or neighbourhood headman. Secondly, the list is in no sensible order, neither alphabetical by surname, nor numerically by ID number, nor even by area to which conscripts are to report. The documentary evidence indicates that such notices of call-up are sent to the recruit's home address.28\n[48] However the main reason I find it unlikely the claimant was called up for military service in 2012, as alleged, is that the claimant admitted that there is no warrant for his arrest or any summons from the military or any other Turkish authority that he is aware of, which one would expect, if the claimant had, as alleged, evaded the draft. The RIR referred to above, indicates the following, after a person is found to have evaded the draft:\nMale Turkish citizens are called to report to the military draft branches between July 1st and October 31st of the year of their twentieth birthday. At this time, the process of \"final military draft inspection\" is initiated for draftees to register themselves for military service. Those draftees who are not ready for military service have to submit their documents showing the reasons (being a student, being unable to perform military service due to health reasons, being in prison, etc.). If these persons fail to report to their military branches, they become yoklama ka\u00e7agi (pre-registration draft evaders) as of November 1st of that year.\nDraftees who complete their final military draft registrations join the military during the year that they become 21 years old. Those who do not attend to the call of the military branches or those who fail to join the related military training center or unit after completing their registrations become bakaya (post-registration draft evaders).\nOnce the government is aware of those who have become yoklama ka\u00e7agi or bakaya, their name and address is forwarded to the security authorities (the police or gendarme) by the administrative authorities (the governorships) and consequently, security authorities are authorized to begin to search for these persons. Simultaneously, the military branches of the persons in question send an official letter to their address, stating that they have become draft evaders and that they have to apply to their military branch to complete the relevant procedures. [Emphasis added by me.]\n[49] The fact that the claimant or his parents never received an official letter at their address, as found in the RIR excerpt quoted above, means, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is not wanted for evading the draft. Also, the deferral letter sent in 2009, indicates that the claimant was deferred until February 2012, but the RIR indicates that the draft process is to take place between July 1 and October 31 in the year of the call-up.29\n[50] Furthermore, the authorities in Turkey would know the claimant left the country in 2010, because the authorities record all entries into and exits from Turkey.30\n[51] Claimant's counsel submitted that the claimant was not eligible for an exemption from the draft, only a deferral, and I agree that that is the best way to view the documentary evidence.31\n[52] However, I find that the claimant has not established with credible or trustworthy evidence that he has evaded military service. What does this finding mean? Either my findings are not correct, or, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant actually completed his military service prior to leaving Turkey. As a university student, the claimant might have been able to serve for as little as six months.32 I am not making the finding that the claimant actually completed his military service, but I do find that the claimant has not established that he is wanted by the authorities for evading military service.\n[53] In addition, and in the alternative, I find that the claimant is not a conscientious objector, and if he were to return to Turkey would be exposed to, at worst, prosecution for an offence of general application, or that if he did return to Turkey, and found to have evaded the draft, he does not face harsh or severe punishment.\nIs the punishment for draft evasion disproportionately harsh or severe?\n[54] The claimant gave evidence that he was conscripted to do the required military service in his home country. He objects to doing military service because he has \"a visceral hatred\"33 for the Turkish military, for what they did to him and his family and that he fears the penal sanctions and repercussions of being a military evader.\n[55] According to the United Kingdom Home Office, the punishment for draft evasion is not disproportionately harsh or severe.34\n2.5.1 In Sepet & Another v. SSHD [2003] UKHL 15, the House of Lords found that Turkish law provides no non-combatant alternative to military service. Draft evaders are liable to a prison sentence of between 6 months and 3 years. On completion of the sentence the offender is required to undertake his military service (paragraph 5).\n2.5.2 There remains no civilian alternative to military service (see Civilian Alternatives) and penalties for draft evasion - including, potentially, repeated penalties - remain in place (see Consequences of Draft Evasion).\n2.5.3 However, paragraph 5 of Sepet & Another v. SSHD [2003] UKHL 15 goes on to conclude that 'It is an agreed fact that those who refuse to perform military service in Turkey (including Kurds) are not subject to disproportionate or excessive punishment, in law or in fact, as a result of their refusal. Draft evaders are liable to prosecution and punishment irrespective of the reasons prompting their refusal'.\n2.5.4 Therefore it is unlikely that in the majority of cases the consequence of a person's general unwillingness to serve in the armed forces or objection to enter a 'combat zone' will be such that they can make out claim for protection.\n[56] I find that the claimant, even as a Kurd, would not face harsh or severe punishment amounting to persecution, torture, or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nIs the Claimant a Conscientious Objector?\n[57] I find he is not, for the following reasons.\n[58] In a country where military service is compulsory like Turkey, and there is no alternative to military service available, prosecutions and incarcerations of a conscientious objector for refusing to do military service (even when prosecutions and imprisonments are repeated) do not constitute persecution based on a Convention refugee ground.35 Compulsory military service, in and of itself, does not constitute persecution.36\n[59] I find the law with respect to military service in Turkey to be a law of general application, as it applies to all males between the ages of 19 and 40.\n[60] In the usual sense, conscientious objection is applied to a person who is a pacifist or against war and all militarism. The objection to military service must be based on principled reason of conscience,37 that is, genuine convictions grounded in religious beliefs, philosophical tenets or ethical considerations.38\n[61] The onus is on the claimant, not only to establish that he has, subjectively, genuine moral or political convictions, but also to adduce objective evidence of his being a conscientious objector.39\n[62] In his PIF narrative, the claimant set out the following:\n\"... I would serve in a war of self-defense to defend the territorial integrity of a democratic country like Canada.\"40\n[63] There is nothing in the claimant's PIF narrative, especially within the paragraph provided for his reasons for refusing to serve, which provide any indication that the claimant has religious, philosophical or ethical beliefs against serving in any war, but only show the claimant's aversion to serving in the Turkish military, because he has \"a deep hatred of them\".41\n[64] I find that the claimant does not have the deep-seated scruple and sincerely-held opinion of a conscientious objector, and he has not provided persuasive objective evidence of his being one, other than his allegation that he hates the Turkish military. I find that the claimant, on a balance of probabilities, has not established that he is a conscientious objector, as alleged.\n[65] At his first hearing (of two sittings) in 2012 and at the recent hearing before me, when asked about his PIF narrative statement, the claimant attempted to amend his reasons for not wanting to serve by adding that he has religious reasons for not serving. Although not pressed on the issue at the first hearing, I asked the claimant, \"What religious beliefs?\" The claimant replied that the Quran states that to kill one person is to kill a whole society. I asked the claimant where that passage is found but he admitted he did not know. The claimant also admitted that he prays at home and only goes to the mosque once or twice a month. There is nothing before me in the evidence, other than the claimant's recent say-so, that he is a religious person with deep seated religious beliefs against war and militarism in all its facets. In fact, I pointed out to the claimant that the Prophet and his armies swept across the Middle East and North Africa, but the claimant rationalized that that was okay because it is mere history. He did not suggest that the historical record of the spread of Islam by military means was unacceptable to him for religious, philosophical or ethical reasons.\n[66] The claimant changed his story, significantly, from his PIF narrative to his testimony. I note that the credibility of an account overall cannot be re-established by testimony that completely contradicts the written evidence, when the said written evidence, in itself, stems from the very words of the person in question. \"Changing one's story after contradictions have been raised undermines the very crux of a claim when the story no longer holds water.\"42\n[67] From the evidence before me, I find that the claimant has not established that he is a conscientious objector.\nMedical and Psychiatric Reports\n[68] The claimant provided several reports regarding his mental health. As I have found the claimant not to be credible, I find these reports do not advance his claim for the following reasons.\n[69] The first report, dated January 26, 2011, by psychiatrist XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, M.D., indicated a diagnosis for the claimant of post-traumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder. The psychiatrist noted no past history of significance, and no family history of psychiatric disorder. The claimant attended with an interpreter and the psychiatric interview was conducted through an unnamed interpreter. He set out the claimant's history, as found in the BoC narrative. The doctor did not prescribe or suggest any follow up course of treatment.43\n[70] The second report, dated August 22, 2012, by XXXX XXXX, M.D., is a report from a physician who has been in general practice for over 35 years, and who has examined more than 3,500 patients for evidence of torture.44 The examination by Dr. XXXX was with the assistance of an interpreter, named as XXXX XXXX.45 I did not find this report of \"torture\" particularly helpful. The doctor repeated the claimant's allegations of beatings and torture, but only says: \"In summary, he [the claimant] was detained on several occasions and subjected to multiple beatings. He does not have any permanent marks or scars from these episodes.\"46 The only scar that the doctor did find was on his left forehead, \"which he [the claimant] related to a childhood injury.\" I am not certain why this report was provided, but find it does not advance the claim. As a result, I can give this report no weight with respect to the allegation that the claimant was beaten and tortured in Turkey.\n[71] The third report provided to the Board, dated September 24, 2012, by XXXX XXXX, M.D., indicates that this report was prepared by the doctor at the request of claimant's counsel.47 She examined the claimant and had a copy of his narrative as well as the report of Dr. XXXX, referred to above. The doctor states that the claimant had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder by Dr. XXXX and, categorically, the claimant is a victim of torture ... for being a Kurd. Further, Dr. XXXX found that the claimant \"... now meets criteria for severe Major Depressive Episode in addition to suffering from PTSD\", which put him at increased risk of suicide. The doctor recommended that the claimant \"would benefit from undergoing therapy for the consequences of torture and PTSD,\" and other therapy.48 Although the doctor found the claimant's prognosis good, \"if he lives in a safe and secure environment, engages in treatment [emphasis mine], and is not exposed to further trauma or undue stress.\"49\n[72] The claimant's counsel provided a fourth report dated May 16, 2017, again by Dr. XXXX, as part of a mandamus application, which is now moot.50 The doctor indicated he relied on an assessment interview with the claimant on May 9, 2017, his previous report,51 and the report of Dr. XXXX XXXX XXXX.52 In his estimation, the claimant did not show suicidal ideation in 2017, contrasted with the finding of Dr. XXXX in 2012. He spoke with the claimant's brother, who told the doctor that the claimant was doing better since his marriage in XXXX 2017, and yet the doctor found that the claimant's mental state had deteriorated since his previous assessment in 2011.\n[73] Dr. XXXX diagnosed the claimant for Major Depressive Episode, moderate, and post-traumatic stress disorder, a change from when Dr. XXXX examined the claimant, as the diagnosis by her of Major Depressive Episode was \"severe\" at that time, but now \"moderate\", which has not been treated.53 He opined that this diagnosis will not abate until his immigration status is resolved. He then suggested that the claimant be referred to a therapist for treatment of both the post-traumatic stress disorder and his Major Depressive Episode.54\n[74] I have no reason or basis to dispute the doctors' credentials or diagnoses.\n[75] I note that the claimant admitted that, in the face of clear prescription and advice by two medical doctors with specialty in psychiatry, he did not go through with any therapy of any kind since recommended first in 2011, repeated in 2012 and again in May 2017. The only reason given is that the federal health plan does not cover such treatment. I am not sure if that is the case, especially if it is so critical to the claimant's mental health, but in any event, the claimant worked, he has a brother, a wife and in-laws in Canada, so he with their help could have paid the costs not covered by the provincial or federal health plans. I have drawn an adverse inference from the claimant's failure to take any treatment or therapy in Canada, with respect to the sincerity of the claimant's complaints to the various doctors.\n[76] I also note that the language used in the reports echoes language used in other psychological assessments made in other immigration and refugee cases by other professionals in this field. For example, in Mico v. Canada, the Federal Court made the following comment, and then cited an excerpt from a psychological assessment provided by another doctor:\nDr. XXXX interviewed the Applicant, at which time the Applicant experienced flashbacks and desperation and had concentration problems, which made it difficult for him to focus. Other stress-related symptoms identified included memory problems, which, along with concentration problems, are common among people exposed to traumatic stress. He elaborated:\n[The Applicant] confuses dates and details of past events; he forgets names, telephone numbers, addresses and appointments ... Difficulties are exacerbated under pressure, such as arises in the high-stakes context of a Refugee Hearing. Symptoms can take the form of difficulty understanding questions, requests for questions to be repeated or rephrased, inability to retrieve specific details of the past, or an apparent inability to formulate a coherent response. Should such problems become evident, it will be important to understand that they likely reflect the disorganizing effects of traumatic stress rather than an effort to evade or obfuscate.55\n[77] I note that many of these remarks are quite similar to the comments of Dr. XXXX in her reporting letter,56 and the reports of Dr. XXXX.57 In assessing these reports, I considered the comments of Justice Mosley in Molefe v. Canada, where he cautioned that \"Expert opinion reports should not be given exalted status in administrative proceedings simply because they are prepared by a licensed professional\",58 and went on to state that in that case, the psychological report authored by Dr. XXXX \"crosses the line separating expert opinion from advocacy\";59 the Court also remarked that his language in that case was \"very similar\" to that in other cases such as Mico v. Canada,60 cited above. Noting that Dr. XXXX and Dr. XXXX have adopted similar language in their reporting letters, I find that these reports, like those in the cases cited, also exhibit symptoms of having crossed the line into advocacy on behalf of the claimant. I have also considered the comments made by Justice Annis in Czesak v. Canada, when he stated that \"...decision-makers should be wary of reliance upon forensic expert evidence obtained for the purpose of litigation, unless it is subject to some form of validation\",61 also noting that administrative tribunals should use caution in taking them at face value, \"...particularly when they propose to settle important issues to be decided by the tribunal\".62 The Court concluded that \"unless there is some means to corroborate either the neutrality or lack of self-interest of the expert in relation to the litigation process, they generally should be accorded little weight.\"63\n[78] In this instance, I have no means to corroborate the neutrality of the reports' authors, and am concerned by the efforts made in the reports to urge their own assessments of the claimant's credibility upon the panel, or that only resolving his immigration matters will lead the claimant to better mental health.\n[79] Ultimately, while acknowledging that the claimant may suffer from the conditions enumerated in these reports but, as I found the claimant lacking in credibility, I do not find that the reports establish, on a balance of probabilities, that his medical conditions are a result of the circumstances or events alleged by the claimant in support of his claim. In this case, I find that the comments of the Court in Danailov v. Canada to be particularly apt, specifically that \"opinion evidence is only as valid as the truth of the facts on which it is based\".64 As I found that the claimant failed to establish the truth of those facts in this case because of my negative findings with respect to his credibility, I assign little weight to the opinions of Dr. XXXX, Dr. XXXX and Dr. XXXX, in assessing the claim.\nDecisions with respect to the preliminary applications\nApplication for the Panel to accept the claim without further viva voce evidence\n[80] The Federal Court,65 I find, did not \"direct a verdict\" on either issue, that is, with respect to the claimant's political activities, or with respect to whether the claimant is a conscientious objector. The Federal Court did determine that some findings of the first panel were unreasonable or even perverse, as submitted by counsel, but nothing in the Federal Court decision precludes this panel, at a de novo hearing, from making its own decision with respect to the evidence before it.\n[81] I also noted that the application was not made in accordance with the rules, as applications such as this one ought to be provided in writing, without delay and at least 10 days before the date fixed for the hearing.66\n[82] For this reason, I dismissed the claimant's application to accept the claim without oral testimony, and presided over a de novo hearing.\nApplication for the Panel to recuse for bias\n[83] The claimant, after I determined to proceed to hear the matter, asked me to recuse as I had shown that I was in some way biased.\n[84] Claimant's counsel indicated that I had stated that her submissions on deciding the claim without a hearing were \"unhelpful\" and because I had noted that the continuation of the claim instead of the claimant's wife sponsoring him for permanent resident status was an abuse of process. I dismissed the application on the basis that counsel had not met the test for bias.\n[85] The starting point relating to allegations of bias is whether the principles of natural justice have been adhered to. I note the following on this issue.\n[86] A hearing into a claim for refugee protection affects a person's rights to life, liberty and security of the person, which are protected by section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Thus it must be held in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. The tribunal which adjudicates upon those rights must act fairly, in good faith, without bias and in a judicial temper, and must give the claimant the opportunity to adequately state their case.67\n[87] The principles of natural justice are based on the common law (that is, they are based on case law rather than legislation). The common law principles of natural justice are recognized in section 162(2) of the IRPA:\n162. (2) Each Division shall deal with all proceedings before it informally and quickly as the circumstances and the considerations of fairness and natural justice permit.\n[88] The principles of natural justice require that the procedures of the Division be fair. In other words, the RPD must ensure that the procedures used before, during and after a hearing are fair in all the circumstances.\n[89] Natural justice is comprised of two main rules, namely:\nthe right to be heard which requires that the claimant must know the case being made against them and be given an opportunity to answer it;68 and the rule against bias, which provides that the claimant is entitled to have an independent and impartial decision-maker decide the case. The decision-maker must not have preconceived notions about how a case will be decided, must not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case, and must not be susceptible to improper influence. There is also a prohibition against bias at the institutional, as opposed to the personal level.\n[90] As a member of the Immigration and Refugee Board, I have been trained regarding the Chairperson's Guidelines, the Immigration Act and Regulations, Covenants and treaties, inclusive of the Rules of the Board and in particular the Rules pertaining to the Refugee Protection Division.\n[91] In this case, while admitting the claimant's addition to his PIF narrative,69 and after hearing the claimant's oral submissions regarding the Federal Court decision in this matter,70 I noted that the claimant had married in XXXX of this year, 2017, and I asked claimant's counsel if the claimant's new spouse was a citizen or permanent resident of Canada. Claimant's counsel said that the answer to the question was irrelevant to the matters before me and declined to answer my query, to which I stated that I found her to be \"unhelpful\". Clearly, the claimant (although he had filed an addition to his PIF narrative, which I admitted into evidence although it was not in keeping with a strict reading of the rule) had not updated the balance of his PIF, and in particular Question 4 with respect to his relatives. A claimant is obliged to complete a Personal Information Form and answer all the questions in it. Question 4 requires a claimant to provide the full name of each relative, including a spouse, her date of birth, her citizenship, and her place and country of residence.71\n[92] For this reason, I found claimant's counsel's refusal to answer my question as to the claimant's wife's citizenship \"unhelpful\", but I made no such finding with respect to her submissions, as alleged. Instead, I listened to her oral submissions, which were already before me in written form.\n[93] The second reason provided as to why I should recuse is that she alleged I had remarked that by continuing with his refugee claim, instead of applying for permanent resident status sponsored by his wife, would be an abuse of process. What the record will show is that I questioned the claimant's counsel as to whether the claimant's wife had started a sponsorship application, which she (claimant's counsel) declined to answer, stating that the claimant had a right to continue with his refugee claim and to be found a Convention refugee, as that would confer more rights than mere permanent resident status through a sponsor. At that point, I questioned her why that would be, and we discussed the issue. Firstly, she submitted that the wife could not sponsor the claimant because she did not have sufficient funds. I pointed out that spousal sponsorships do not require minimum income or assets, unlike other sponsorships. Secondly, she stated that if the claimant ran afoul of the law, being a Convention refugee would make it less likely that he would be deported. I noted that there was no evidence that the claimant was a criminal or criminally inclined. Thirdly, claimant's counsel stated that, if the claimant withdrew his refugee claim, and later, his wife withdrew her sponsorship of him, he would be left in the lurch. I note now that, although that might be a concern for any refugee claimant, claimant's counsel did not ask for a postponement of the hearing pending any sponsorship application being completed. At this point, I stated that refugee hearings and all that that entails are costly in human and financial resources and might be seen in some quarters as being an abuse of process. I am not of the opinion that such a remark indicated bias.\n[94] The rule against bias is a common law rule that expresses the fundamental principle of natural justice that 'no man ought to be a judge in his own cause.' The rule against bias disqualifies a decision-maker from determining any case in which there is actual bias or an appearance of bias, also described as a reasonable apprehension of bias.\n[95] The issue, generally, is not whether there is actual bias in a case. Actual bias is quite rare and difficult to establish. More commonly, the allegation is that there is a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the decision-maker or tribunal. Moreover, there may be a reasonable apprehension of bias even though there is no evidence that the decision-maker is actually biased.\n[96] The test for \"reasonable apprehension of bias\" was formulated in the Supreme Court of Canada case, Committee for Justice and Liberty v. National Energy Board72 as follows:\nWhat would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically - and having thought the matter through - conclude? Would he think that it is more likely than not that [the decision-maker], whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly.\n[97] The Federal Court of Appeal stated the following in Satiacum73:\nThe opinion of de Grandpr\u00e9 J., dissenting, in Committee for Justice and Liberty et al. v. National Energy Board et al., [1978] 1 S.C.R. 369 has been accepted in this country as expressing the modern test for determining the existence of a reasonable apprehension of bias. Adopting the formulation proposed by this Court, he said (at pages 394-395):\nThe proper test to be applied in a matter of this type was correctly expressed by the Court of Appeal. As already seen by the quotation above, the apprehension of bias must be a reasonable one, held by reasonable and right-minded persons, applying themselves to the question and obtaining thereon the required information. In the words of the Court of Appeal, that test is \"what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically - and having thought the matter through - conclude. Would he think that it is more likely than not that [the decision-maker], whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly.\"\nI can see no real difference between the expressions found in the decided cases, be they 'reasonable apprehension of bias,' 'reasonable suspicion of bias,' or 'real likelihood of bias.' The grounds for this apprehension must, however, be substantial and I entirely agree with the Federal Court of Appeal which refused to accept the suggestion that the test be related to the \"very sensitive or scrupulous conscience\".\n[98] In Newfoundland Telephone Co., the Supreme Court restated this test as follows: \"whether a reasonably informed bystander could reasonably perceive bias on the part of an adjudicator.\"74\n[99] Thus, the impartiality of decision-makers is not judged from the decision-maker's perspective, but from that of a reasonable bystander, fully informed of all relevant facts. For example, certain activities and associations of a Member may seem quite inconsequential from the Member's perspective, and yet still appear highly suspect from an observer's point of view.\n[100] As stated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Arsenault-Cameron v. Prince Edward Island, \"The test for apprehension of bias takes into account the presumption of impartiality. A real likelihood of bias must be demonstrated.\"75 The Supreme Court reiterated this principle in Wewaykum: \"The standard refers to an apprehension of bias that rests on serious grounds, in light of the strong presumption of judicial impartiality.\"76\n[101] The principles and considerations noted above are equally applicable to administrative tribunals, which are presumed to be impartial in their decision-making.77\n[102] Nevertheless, if there is an allegation that the Member displayed bias, for example, because he or she prejudged the claim, the Court will require clear evidence that a predetermination had in fact occurred. The Federal Court reiterated in Ali78 that:\n... the Court of Appeal in Arthur v. Canada (Attorney General), [2001] F.C.J. No. 1091 [(F.C.A., no. A-991-90), MacGuigan, Linden, Gray, November 2, 1992, reported: 18 Imm. L.R. (2d) 22 (F.C.A.)], has emphasized that an allegation of bias cannot be done lightly. It cannot rest on mere suspicion, pure conjecture or mere impressions of an applicant. It must be supported by material evidence.\n[103] Moreover, as the Supreme Court noted in R. v. S. (R.D.), where Cory, J. referenced the Commentaries on Judicial Conduct published by the Canadian Judicial Council (1991) at p. 12 where it is stated: 79\nTrue impartiality does not require that the judge have no sympathies or opinions; it requires that the judge nevertheless be free from bias; R. v. S. (R.D.), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 484 at para. 113, where the Court noted that \"a mere suspicion is not enough\" to support an allegation of bias.\n[104] It is appropriate for the panel, against whom an allegation of bias is directed, to decide the bias motion.80 The allegation of an apprehension of bias should be first put to the person against whom the allegation is being made in order to allow the person an opportunity to respond.81 The panel should listen to the submissions regarding their alleged bias with an open mind before ruling on them.82 Prior to ruling on the application, I listened to the submissions of counsel. At the end of the pre-hearing conference, I indicated that I had taken notes but I wanted to be certain of her reasons as to why I should recuse, and I asked claimant's counsel to repeat them for me. She told me she did not remember them, but stated that I had found her submissions unhelpful.\n[105] I note that counsel for the claimant has not provided a clear and convincing argument where a reasonably informed person would come to the conclusion or opinion that there is a reasonable apprehension of bias, or actual bias, based on the submissions presented.\n[106] The Federal Court in this matter did not find a breach of natural justice so as to preclude the evidence from the first hearing of the claim, including the transcript, and reasons for decision. I also note a Federal Court of Appeal conclusion with respect to reading the decision of a previous panel:\n[19] ... I see nothing wrong with the Board member at the second hearing reading the prior decision. I agree with the motions judge that no informed person who reviewed the matter thoughtfully, realistically and practically would conclude that the Board member who conducted the second hearing could not proceed with an open mind only because he had read the first decision. The Board member at the second hearing was clearly aware that the first decision was based on incomplete information and he permitted the Appellant to lead whatever further evidence he wished.\n[20] We do not believe that the mere reading of a previous decision which is adverse to the Appellant can lead to a reasonable apprehension of bias as defined by the de Grandpr\u00e9 J. in The Committee for Justice and Liberty et al. v. The National Energy Board et al., 1976 CanLII 2 (SCC), [1978] 1 S.C.R. 369 at 394.83\n[107] The application by the counsel, Catherine Bruce, is hereby dismissed based on what has been mentioned in these reasons, as I find that she has not established that an informed person, who has all the facts of this case, would come to the conclusion that there is a reasonable apprehension of bias, on my part. For these reasons, I decided that I would not recuse myself.\nCONCLUSION\n[108] Based on the foregoing analysis and considering the totality of the evidence, I find that there is no reasonable chance or serious possibility of persecution and, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant would not be personally subjected to a danger of torture, a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, if he returns to Turkey. His claim for protection is rejected.\n[109] Although I have found that some evidence provided by the claimant is likely not genuine, I am not prepared to find that the evidence is \"clearly fraudulent\" and, therefore, I have not found the claim to be manifestly unfounded, as contemplated by the Act.\n(signed)\n\"James Railton\"\nJames Railton\nSeptember 27, 2017\nDate\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended by the Protecting Canada's Immigration System Act, S.C. 2012, c.17 (the \"Act\" or \"IRPA\")\n2 Exhibit 2\n3 An allegation is not established, unless and until so found by the panel\n4 Exhibit 1, Federal Court Record, pages 3-11, Reasons and Decision\n5 Exhibit 4, Federal Court Reasons for Judgment and Judgment, Basbaydar v.

His notebook had fallen to the floor and it contained the names of Allah and the Prophet. As a result, both of the claimant's children were withdrawn from the school and the family received phone threats.\n[7] The claimant stated that there was no charge of blasphemy and the school suppressed the incident in order to avoid press coverage.\n[8] The claimant alleged as well that they had given shelter to his wife's cousin and her children because her husband was falsely accused of blasphemy and threatening a Christian relative who had converted to Islam. Some \"sinister characters\" were seen watching the house and arrangements were made to move the cousin and her children to another place. The claimant stated that the case was proven false but the cousin's family relocated to the Middle East. He further stated that his family were held partly responsible and there was an insinuation that they were converted Muslims and could be targeted.\n[9] The claimant alleged that both he and his wife came from convert families. His father converted from Islam to Christianity and as a result his father's career suffered. As well the claimant alleged that their being Muslim converts made them highly vulnerable targets. The family left Pakistan in XXXX 2012, and came to Canada, where they made refugee claims.\n[10] In an Addendum to his PIF, dated October 5, 2017, the claimant alleged that in 2016, he decided to sell some property in Islamabad and his brother-in-law put the property up for sale. A broker offered a very low price which was refused. The broker noted he was aware of the reason the claimant left Pakistan, and the claimant stated that this meant that some incident could be used to make certain he and his family could never return without a threat to their lives.\n[11] Another buyer was found but when the buyer and the claimant's brother-in-law went to the site, they were met by the broker and armed men who threatened the buyer and told him the land was in dispute. The broker forced the claimant's brother-in-law to call the claimant in Toronto. His wife answered the call and told the broker that it was because of Muslim intolerance towards other creeds that the lives and property of Christians are not safe in Pakistan.\n[12] On September 10, 2017, the brother-in-law called and informed the claimant that a fatwa2 had been posted at the claimant's house in Rawalpindi, stating that his wife was a blasphemer and she and her family should be killed. A photograph of the fatwa was taken by a family friend and subsequently sent to the claimant.\nDETERMINATION\n[13] The panel finds that the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. The reasons for this decision are noted below.\nAnalysis\n[14] The determinative issues in regard to these claims are credibility and internal flight alternative (IFA).\nCredibility\n[15] The claimant was asked why he and his family were making a claim for protection and he responded it was the fatwa. The panel noted that the claimant had left Pakistan in 2012 and he was asked why he made a claim at that time. The claimant responded that there was a new wave of extremist activity in Pakistan and the traumatic experience of his son's beating that had initially brought them to Canada.\n[16] The panel noted that the claimant had indicated that the school incident had been suppressed by the school and there was no blasphemy charge. The claimant responded that his son and the family had a traumatic experience and there were threatening calls. In response to further questions, the claimant confirmed that there were no physical attacks on the family. In addition, no evidence was provided that the alleged calls resulted in any actions against the claimants.\n[17] The panel questioned the claimant as to anything else at the time that placed their lives in jeopardy. The claimant responded that they had provided shelter to his wife's cousin and her children when the cousin's family was involved in a blasphemy charge. The claimant further testified that his father was a convert from Islam.\n[18] The panel asked the claimant if his father's conversion had made an impact on the claimant's career. He said no. The panel notes in this regard that the claimant stated that he has had a successful career as a dentist and his children attended an elite school. In addition, the claimant stated in his PIF that he holds a BSc from the XXXX of Punjab and a dental surgery degree from de'XXXX XXXX in Lahore.3 The panel further notes that no evidence was disclosed indicating that any agent of persecution had mentioned or had knowledge of the claimant's father's conversion.\n[19] The claimant stated that the only basis for their claims in 2012 was the school incident noted above. The panel finds that the claimant has provide insufficient evidence that their lives were in danger at that time, that they had more than a mere possibility of a risk of persecution at the time or that, on a balance of probabilities, they were persons in need of protection pursuant to subsection 97(1) at the time of their 2012 claims.\n[20] As noted above, the claimant disclosed an Addendum to his PIF, received by the Board on October 6, 2017. The contents of the Addendum as noted above, concerns the claimant's effort to sell a plot of land in Islamabad, the resulting confrontation with a broker and \"land mafia\" and the subsequent posting of a fatwa calling for the killing of the claimants.\n[21] The claimant testified that his brother-in-law found out who these people were, a gang involved in a land grab. In an Affidavit4 from the claimant's brother-in-law, it was stated that the broker was \"in cahoots with the notorious land mafia\" active in the area where the claimant's land was located. The brother-in-law further stated that he feared for his own safety, remained in Lahore and visited Rawalpindi only at night and remained in his wife's family home.5\n[22] The panel notes that the brother-in-law's Affidavit has been stamped by a notary four times on the first page but there is no stamp on the second page at the end of the letter where the letter has been signed. Neither is there a date on any of the stamps. The panel finds this raises a doubt as to whether this is a sworn affidavit and as well as to the truthfulness of the letter.\n[23] The panel noted in the hearing that the fatwa did not contain the name of the person who allegedly issued it.6 The claimant explained that the writer did not want to implicate himself because it was a false claim. The panel finds this is not a reasonable explanation as only a person with authority and knowledge of Islamic law is able to issue a fatwa. The panel finds the lack of a signature and name of the person issuing it undermines its legitimacy. The panel notes as well the fatwa refers to an organization titled: Movement for Implementation of Muhammad's Shariah, a group unknown to the panel and not mentioned in any of the documentary evidence available to the panel.\n[24] The claimant also disclosed a letter7 from the pastor of a church in Rawalpindi. The letter notes that the pastor came to know that some land mafia had confiscated the claimant's land and declared him and his family blasphemers.8 The panel notes that this is second hand information and does not reflect the pastor's personal experience other than coming to know it from some source.\n[25] As well, the claimant disclosed an Affidavit from Dr. XXXX XXXX9 who took a picture of the fatwa on the door of the claimant's house. The panel notes the other information in the latter is second hand information received from the claimant's brother-in-law.\n[26] In addition there is an Affidavit from XXXX XXXX,10 a friend of the claimant's brother-in-law, indicating that he saw the fatwa on the door of the claimant's home and informed the claimant's brother-in-law. The other information in the letter is second hand, having been told to Mr. XXXX by the claimant's brother-in-law. The panel notes as well that stamp on this Affidavit is undated as is the letter.\n[27] In the context of the analysis of these documents above, the panel has a serious doubt as to the legitimacy of the fatwa. In addition, the panel finds that none of the supporting documents reduce the panel's concerns as to the legitimacy of the fatwa. The panel draws a negative inference in this regard.\n[28] The panel notes that the claimant disclosed all of this documentation to the Board on October 6, 2017, six working days before the hearing on October 17, 2017, and almost five years after the claimants made their claims. The panel finds this to be an extraordinary coincidence which enhances the panel's doubt as to the legitimacy of the fatwa document, the central issue in this claim. The panel draws a further negative inference in this regard.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[29] Although the panel has a significant doubt as to the credibility of the fatwa document and the coincidental timing of the incident that allegedly led to its issuance, it finds that if the claimants were required to seek a safe haven, they could do so in either Karachi or Hyderabad in Pakistan.\n[30] The claimant was asked if he and his family could find a safe haven in either of these cities and he responded that this was not possible as \"they have a strong network.\" The claimant was further asked who he was referring to and he said \"clerics\" and it was not easy to hide.\n[31] The panel noted that it appeared that the only interest of the claimant's alleged persecutors was the possession of his land, and according to the letter of the pastor of his church,11 the \"land mafia\" had confiscated and taken legal possession of the land. The claimant responded that clerics go after people and the threat remains.\n[32] The panel noted in the hearing that there was no evidence in the documents disclosed by the claimant or in his testimony that any extremist organization was involved in the claimant's alleged situation.\n[33] The claimants were asked if they had anything else to add to their testimony. The claimant responded that his family could not have this hanging over their heads. The claimant's wife testified that she had seen what is happening in Pakistan and she believed she would be killed. The claimant's son testified that if they returned to Pakistan there would be a constant sword hanging over their heads any time they went out.\n[34] The panel acknowledges that country document evidence indicates that Christians in Pakistan face discrimination, ill treatment and sometimes violence. They are however allowed to practice their religion and build churches.12 The panel notes there are approximately one and a half million Christians in Pakistan and although they share a risk of violent action directed against minority communities by extremist groups, the panel finds that there is no evidence that the claimants have been specifically targeted for violent action by any of these groups.\n[35] The panel further finds that if the claimant's story concerning the acquisition of his land and the issuance of a fatwa is true, it reflects the actions of the so-called \"land mafia\" and their ability to arrange for someone to issue a fatwa. The panel notes the claimant testified that the cleric was probably bought off. The panel finds as well that having taken possession of the claimant's land there is no apparent reason for those involved to pursue the claimant and no evidence that they have the ability to do so.\n[36] The panel notes that no evidence was disclosed indicating that the fatwa had come to the attention of Pakistani authorities and no evidence that these authorities had acted in this regard. In addition, the panel cites country document evidence concerning Christians in Pakistan indicating that \"where the person's fear is of ill treatment\/persecution at the hands of non-state actors, in general they will be able to relocate to escape that risk.\"13\n[37] The panel notes that both Karachi and Hyderabad are large cities with substantial Christian populations. The population of Karachi is approximately 16 million and of Hyderabad approximately 7 million. Karachi is 1500 km and Hyderabad is 1300 km from Rawalpindi.\n[38] The panel finds, as to the first prong of the IFA test,14 that on a balance of probabilities, there is no serious possibility that the claimants would be persecuted in either Karachi or Hyderabad.\n[39] As to the second prong,15 the panel notes that the claimant is well educated and is a dentist, and finds that he would likely be able to practice his profession and look after his family in either of these cities. The panel further finds that it would not be unreasonable in all of the circumstances, including those particular to the claimants, for them to seek refuge in either of these cities.\n[40] The panel concludes that if the claimants require a safe haven they can find one in either Karachi or Hyderabad and do not require the protection of Canada.\nCONCLUSION\n[41] On the basis of the credibility concerns noted above and also on the basis of the finding that an IFA is available to the claimants, the panel concludes that the claimants are neither Convention refugees not persons in need of protection. The claims are therefore dismissed.\n(signed)\n\"Milton Israel\"\nMilton Israel\nOctober 26, 2017\nDate\n1 Exhibit 8, Claimants' Supporting Document Package.\n2 Exhibit 8, Addendum, Claimants' Supporting Document Package.\n3 Exhibit 2, Personal Information Form, question 6.\n4 Exhibit 8, Claimants' Supporting Document Package, Tab 7.\n5 Ibid.\n6 Ibid., Tab 6.\n7 Ibid., Tab 5.\n8 Ibid.\n9 Ibid., Tab 8.\n10 Ibid., Tab 9.\n11 Exhibit 8, Claimants' Supporting Document Package, Tab 5.\n12 Exhibit 6, National Documentation Pakistan (NDP) for Pakistan ( March 31, 2017), item 12.13.\n13 Ibid., item 1.17, section 2.6.2.\n14 Rasaratnam, Sivaganthan v.

He alleges that he is a member of the Marehan clan. The claimant alleges that while married to one woman, he had sexual relations with another woman by the name of XXXX which occurred during high school when he was in Grade 11. He alleges that in July 2012 he found out that XXXX became pregnant. The claimant alleges that he planned to deny that the child was his. He claims that his wife divorced him after XXXX started telling people that she was pregnant with his child.\n[4] The claimant alleges XXXX family is powerful and that they informed their grievances to Al Shabaab which arrested the claimant in February 2013 and placed him on trial for adultery. The claimant alleges that he was convicted and sentenced to death but that on February 20, 2013, he managed to escape when Al Shabaab was temporarily ousted from El Adde by United Nations AMISOM troops.\n[5] The claimant alleges that he fled to Belad city where he remained until April 2013, then he went to Dolo Somalia where he remained until June 2013 when he went to Addis Ababa in Ethiopia where he remained for three years. In XXXX 2017, the claimant saved enough money by working in a restaurant to hire a smuggler to assist him to leave Ethiopia. The claimant alleges that he was taken to Sweden where he stayed for two months before the smuggler obtained a false Swedish passport for him which was used to travel to Canada. The claimant alleges that he did not make a refugee claim in Sweden because the smuggler said that he was Swedish and he did not want the claimant to expose him to Swedish authorities.\n[6] The claimant alleges that Al Shabaab had visited his parents in El Adde and had informed them that he has been labelled an infidel due to his adultery. The claimant fears Al Shabaab and XXXX family.\nANALYSIS\n[7] The determinative issue in this case is whether the claimant has established his identity with credible and trustworthy evidence.\nIdentity\n[8] According to section 106 of IRPA, the Refugee Protection Division must take into account, with respect to the credibility of a claimant, whether the claimant possesses acceptable documentation establishing identity, and if not, whether they have provided a reasonable explanation for the lack of documentation or have taken reasonable steps to obtain the documentation.3\n[9] In assessing the authenticity of documents, I am guided by the Federal Court decision in Sertkaya, which states that it is open for the board to consider the authenticity of documentary evidence, and the ability of the claimant to obtain and use fraudulent documents.4 The Federal Court has held in Kazadi, that if there are significant irregularities on the face of the claimant's key identity documents, the board is not obliged to seek an expert assessment of these documents before determining their probative value.5\n[10] The claimant provided for his hearing, a colour copy of his original Somali passport, a school certificate and also called an identity witness. Having assessed this evidence, I find for the following reasons, that the claimant has failed adduce any credible and trustworthy evidence to establish his identity.\nFailure to provide the original Somali passport and Identity Card not reasonably explained\n[11] Two days before the hearing, which I note is not accordance with the Rules which require disclosure of documents 10 days before the hearing, the claimant provided a black and white photocopy of his biodata page and the last two pages of his Somali passport. At the hearing, the claimant provided colour copies of the same passport pages. I admitted this evidence into the record, substituting the black and white copies for the colour copies, notwithstanding the late disclosure due to the importance of this evidence to the issue of identity.6\n[12] Also at the hearing, the Board in response to the claimant's late disclosure provided counsel with colour copies of samples of Somali passports from Keesing (a paid subscription website which the Board relies upon) and the attachments to Response to Information Request (\"RIR\") identified as SOM105248.E which is found, without attachments, as item 3.11 to the current Somalia National Documentation Package (\"NDP\"). The claimant was given about twenty minutes to review these Somali passport samples with counsel and the interpreter. After the claimant concluded his consultation, Counsel advised me that he did not object to the admission of the Board's disclosure into evidence on the condition that he be granted one week to provide written submissions and post-hearing documents in response. I granted the request and admitted the documents into evidence on that basis.7 Counsel duly filed post-hearing submissions and some documents.8\n[13] The claimant testified that he obtained his passport in 2013 in Addis Ababa at the Somali embassy. He testified that he was also given a Somali National Identity card. The claimant testified that he did not have the originals of either document. He testified that he left the originals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, with a friend that he used to live with. He testified that after he arrived in Canada, he could not locate his former housemate so instead he reached out to a friend who works in the restaurant who sent him a copy of the passport by email. The claimant testified that the restaurant kept a copy of the passport for employment purposes.\n[14] The claimant is required by RPD Rule 11 to provide documentation establishing elements of his claim:\nThe claimant must provide acceptable documents establishing identity and other elements of the claim. A claimant who does not provide acceptable documents must explain why they were not provided and what steps were taken to obtain them. 9\n[15] I asked the claimant why he did not bring his Somali passport with him to Canada. The claimant explained that he could not use his own passport since he was travelling with a different identity and he did not want to risk being caught with two passports. I then asked the claimant if he considered sending his Somali passport by mail to his witness in Canada (Mr. XXXX XXXX XXXX, who the claimant states is his uncle, and who testified as an identity witness, from henceforth referred to as the \"witness\"). The claimant explained that he did not consider doing this because he did not know what would have happened to him had he been prevented from boarding his flight out of Ethiopia or Sweden. He feared that he would be returned to Somalia and be persecuted by Al Shabaab. When I asked the claimant if his witness in Canada could have sent him back his Somali passport if he ended up back in Africa, the claimant repeated his prior explanation that his intention was to leave the passport behind with a man in Ethiopia so that he could retrieve it in the future if he needed it.\n[16] The Federal Court has held that it may be reasonable in the particular circumstances of a claim for the Board not to accept these sort of explanations which may revolve around the claimant losing his passport.10 The Federal Court has held on this issue as follows:\n\u00b615 There can be no doubt, as Reed J. stated, that the passport \"would have provided some objective evidence of her travels through the various countries which she asserts took place\"...\n\u00b617 I take this opportunity to add that it is entirely reasonable for the Refugee Division to attach great importance to a claimant's passport and his air ticket. In my opinion, these documents are essential to establish the claimant's identity and his journey to come to Canada. Unless it can be assumed that a refugee status claimant is actually a refugee, it seems unreasonable to me to ignore the loss of these documents without a valid explanation. In my view, it is too easy for a claimant to simply state that he has lost these documents or the facilitator has taken them. If the Refugee Division insists on these documents being produced, the facilitators may have to change their methods.\n\u00b618 Minimizing the importance of the passport and air ticket as documents to be produced or ignoring their non-submission for all sorts of reasons in my opinion only serves to encourage all those whose only purpose is to take advantage of a system which is intended solely to enable genuine refugees to come to Canada.11\n[Emphasis added]\n[17] I find it reasonable to attach significance to the production of an original and allegedly genuine Somali passport because it has great evidentiary weight when considering the claimant's personal and national identity. In the particular circumstances of this case, the original passport would have been important in ascertaining whether the passport itself is genuine as the claimant alleges given the inconsistencies between the claimant's birthday in the middle of the passport's biodata page and in the coding.\n[18] I would adopt the reasoning of the Court set out above as my own. I find the claimant's first explanation that he did not want to carry his passport due to the use of a false travel identity to be not credible or reasonable given his clear intention to seek asylum in Canada. The claimant according to his testimony was at all times in contact with his witness in Canada, including just before he travelled to Canada. The witness during his testimony also stated that they were in contact prior to the claimant's travel. Given that the claimant was in contact with his witness who was successfully sponsored to immigrate to Canada, I would have expected that the claimant would be aware of the need to prove his genuine identity to Canadian immigration authorities in a similar fashion (the witness testified that he also had a Somali passport issued from the Somali embassy in Nairobi, Kenya which he used to prove his identity). I find it not credible or reasonable that the claimant would leave behind in Ethiopia his main source of identity documentation.\n[19] At the very least, I would have expected the claimant to take reasonable efforts to preserve his passport, namely by mailing it to his witness in Canada. I note that the claimant's explanation for failing to take such a step was non-substantive, namely he reiterated his first explanation to the effect that he always intended to leave his passport behind in Ethiopia and retrieve it later. The only other explanation he gave was that he feared that he would be deported to Somalia to the hands of Al Shabaab if he was turned away from the plane and his Somali passport was in Canada by then. I find that the claimant's explanations are not reasonable because I do not see how the absence of a Somali passport in the possession of his friend in Ethiopia would lead to the claimant's deportation to Somalia in the event that his false travel identity was discovered. The claimant did not adduce any further evidence on this issue notwithstanding the fact that counsel had time to do so on a post-hearing basis.\n[20] I find that the totality of the claimant's explanations indicate that he simply had a subjective desire to leave his Somali passport behind and that he took no reasonable efforts to bring that passport to Canada when he could. The claimant is not entitled to withhold his original passport from the Board or Canadian immigration authorities. His explanations are otherwise not reasonable. Accordingly, I draw an adverse inference as to the claimant's general credibility from his failure to provide his original Somali passport.\nThe claimant's Somali passport is fraudulent on a balance of probabilities\n[21] The claimant's passport indicates that he was born on XXXX XXXX, 1988. The claimant testified that he was born on that date. The claimant's passport indicates that it was issued on XXXX XXXX, 2013 in Addis Ababa. I acknowledge that travel documents issued by foreign governments are presumed to be valid.12 However, in this case, I find that there is a significant irregularity on the face of the document that rebuts this presumption.\nAs stated earlier, the Board's country documentation on Somalia includes RIR SOM105248.E which pertains to passports issued between 2013 and July 2015.13 The RIR indicates that Somali passports contain a national identity number which contain the last two digits of bearer's birth year, month and day along with a random number.14 This is consistent with earlier country condition evidence researched by the Board which indicates that in February 2007, the Somali government began issuing computer-readable e-passports.15 I find that the coding of the passport with the bearer's birthday is important because it signifies that the passport is computer or machine readable.\n[22] In the sample passport attached to the RIR, the relevant part of the code which is on the bottom of biodata page states as follows: 'XXXX.16\n[23] Similarly, in the Keesing passport sample the coding states as follows: 'SOM8410216F'.17 The coding is consistent with the sample passport bearer's date of birth of XXXX XXXX, 1984 which is listed in the middle of the biodata page in that sample.\n[24] I asked the claimant to explain to me why the coding at the bottom of his passport's biodata page states XXXX which is inconsistent with his stated date of birth of \"XXXX XXXX 1988\". In other words, I asked the claimant why the machine readable zone coding indicates that he was born in 1986 while the rest of passport indicates that he was born in 1988.\n[25] The claimant explained that he was assisted at all times by a cousin who worked at the Somali embassy in Addis Ababa. He explained that the cousin swore the required oral testimony to establish the reliability of his alleged biodata to the satisfaction of the embassy staff which then agreed to issue him the passport. The claimant explained that when he initially went to pick up his passport from the embassy he noticed that the date of birth in the middle of his biodata page was erroneously listed as 1986. He testified that he complained and handed back the erroneous passport. He was told to return in a week to pick up a corrected passport. Upon his return, the claimant states that he was given the present passport. The claimant testified that he accepted the passport because it looked like the date of birth line was fixed to state 1988 and his mother's name was correctly listed. The claimant testified that he did not look at the coding line on the bottom. The claimant testified that he could not explain why the coding still appeared to indicate a 1986 birth year, after the embassy purportedly corrected the problem.\n[26] In post-hearing submissions, counsel does not contest that an irregularity in the claimant's date of birth is readily apparent on the face of his passport. Rather, counsel makes the following argument that the Board should nevertheless accept the claimant's passport as evidence of his national and personal identity:\n\u00b615. With respect to the error in the date of birth of the claimant at the bottom line of the passport presented into evidence it is submitted that these errors can occur. Further, as the evidence from the RPD concerning Somali passports indicates the Somali government took steps to try to enhance the passports that they were being issued, thus, suggesting that that errors could be made and that a better passport had to be produced. It is submitted that this can corroborate the claimant's testimony an error was made on his passport and that when he retrieved the passport all the errors had not been corrected, specifically, the bottom line of the passport.\n\u00b616. It is therefore submitted that given the new additional evidence provided by the witness' passport which seemed to suggest the claimant's passport is in fact a genuine document that the Biodata page of the claimant's passport be accepted as evidence of the claimant's personal as well as national identity.18\n[27] Counsel's mention of the witness' passport refers to a black and white copy of the witness's passport which is attached to the post hearing submissions.19 That copy appears to be of a similar vintage to the claimant's passport since it was issued on XXXX XXXX, 2012, more than one year before the claimant's passport issue date. The witness's biodata page on his passport also displays a camel figure on the top right hand corner, consistent with the claimant's passport. However, unlike the claimant's passport, the witness's stated date of birth in the middle of his biodata page is internally consistent with the machine readable zone coding.\n[28] I ultimately find the claimant's explanations and counsel's submissions to be not reasonable because it is not credible that the Somali embassy, after allegedly correcting the line which listed an erroneous date of birth, would neglect to correct the machine readable code on the bottom of the passport. Such a failure to correct the entire passport would be inconsistent with the Somali government's experience in issuing machine readable passports since 2007.20 The claimant's explanations do not cure the internal inconsistency within this document. I find that counsel's submissions are speculative since he has not provided any further documentary evidence to indicate that such \"errors can occur\". Counsel is relying on the reports that biometric passports appear to only have been issued in December 2013, a few months after the claimant's passport was issued on XXXX XXXX, 2013.21 I find that counsel's reliance on this evidence to be misplaced because the \"biometric\" refers to the additional security features of embedding fingerprint data within a chip that is woven into the passport. This is an additional security feature that many modern passports currently contain. However, there is no causal connection between the failure of a passport to contain \"biometric\" data and internal inconsistency between the date of both line and machine readable zone coding. The witness's passport contains consistent information in this regard and this is the same vintage of passport that is missing \"biometric\" data. In other words, I find that the lack of biometric security features in the claimant's passport does not explain the internal inconsistency in the date of birth on the face of the passport.\n[29] I find that this internal inconsistency is a significant irregularity since it undermines claimant's year of birth which he says is 1988. I find that this irregularity in combination with the evidence in the country documentation which indicates that Somali passport fraud is \"widespread\" within and outside Somalia;22 leads me to conclude that the claimant's Somali passport is on a balance of probabilities a fraudulent document. I assign no evidentiary weight to this passport for the purpose of establishing the claimant's personal and national identity. Furthermore, I draw an adverse inference as to the claimant's general credibility from the submission of a fraudulent document.\nInconsistencies in the claimant's addresses and when he left Somalia not credibly explained\n[30] The claimant testified that he fled Somalia to Ethiopia in XXXX 2013 and settled in the Bulaymakeal neighbourhood of Addis Ababa. I asked the claimant to explain to me why his Schedule \"A\" list of addresses states that he moved to Bulaymakeal in XXXX 2013.23 The claimant then stated that he left Somalia in XXXX 2013. I asked the claimant to explain to me why he now says XXXX after he told me that he left in XXXX.24 The claimant explained that he may have left Somalia at the end of XXXX, maybe XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX. I asked the claimant to explain to me why the BOC does not specify those dates. The claimant testified that he was asked (I assume during the BOC preparation phase) when he left Somalia and he answered the \"end of XXXX XXXX XXXX\" but he was then told to simply state XXXX. Lastly, I asked the claimant to confirm if the reference to him residing in Bulaymakeal in Addis Ababa in Ethiopia in XXXX 2013 is not correct. The claimant confirmed that this is an incorrect reference. I asked him to explain this. He explained that he was asked (I assume in the port of entry) where he used to live but he was asked for specifics.\n[31] Even before considering the explanations, I observe that the claimant's testimony on this issue was not straightforward. His demeanor was not credible in that he did not answer the questions put to him directly. The previous paragraph sets out the convoluted nature of the claimant's testimony. I draw an adverse inference as to the claimant's general credibility from his demeanour.\n[32] Counsel in post-hearing submissions states that no negative inference as to the claimant's credibility should be taken with respect to the discrepancies between the claimant's evidence and his Schedule \"A\" because of the nature of telephone interpretation services at the port of entry and the fact that it was the officer who asked the questions and wrote the answers which were not put to the claimant to review and confirm.25 At the hearing, counsel pointed at other anomalies in Schedule \"A\" such as in the personal history section.\n[33] While I acknowledge that there are reliability concerns with documentation prepared in the port of entry upon landing from an international flight, I find that in the circumstances that I cannot accede to counsel's submission due to the fact that the inconsistencies and omission crossed over into the claimant's testimony and BOC form. At any rate, the claimant was represented by counsel shortly after arrival in Canada including at the BOC preparation stage. I would have reasonably expected the claimant to amend his forms such as Schedule \"A\" or at least seek to explain the inconsistencies in the BOC by the time of hearing or at the beginning of the hearing.\n[34] Turning now to the claimant's specific explanations, I find them to be not credible or reasonable because they are internally inconsistent and contradicted by other documents prepared by the claimant, namely his BOC. The claimant's explanation that he left Somalia to Ethiopia in XXXX XXXX, or XXXX, in the year 2013, is itself not consistent with question 2(e) of the BOC form where the claimant answered \"2013XXXX XXXX\" (which I find is a reference to XXXX 2013) to the question \"when did you leave your country? (provide dates)\".26 There is no credible or trustworthy evidence to establish that the claimant was provided with inadequate interpretation services at the BOC preparation stage. The BOC includes a duly signed interpreter declaration. The claimant did not seek to amend his BOC at the beginning of the hearing. The claimant's answer to question 2(e) in the BOC undermines his explanation that the reference to Schedule \"A\", that he moved to Bulaymakeal in XXXX 2013, is incorrect or inherently unreliable because it was done at the port of entry. I draw an adverse inference as to the claimant's general credibility from the inconsistencies in his testimony concerning when he fled from Somalia to Addis Ababa.\n[35] I find the claimant's explanation for his failure to specify in the BOC narrative the days in XXXX (XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX) 2013 when he allegedly fled Somalia to be unreasonable because the BOC instructions clearly required the claimant to \"include everything that is important\" including \"dates...whenever possible\".27 The date when the claimant actually left Somalia and crossed into Ethiopia goes to the core of the Convention refugee definition since this is the first date when the claimant would have been outside his country of nationality. I would have expected the claimant to fully set out the date, including actual day or days, when he left Somalia, as opposed to merely the month. His explanation, to the effect that he was asked to simply put \"XXXX\" in the BOC narrative instead of providing more specific information raises a serious allegation of inadequate assistance at the BOC preparation stage by the professional assistance he received, be it from counsel or the interpreter. I am not prepared to accept this explanation as reasonable in the absence of further evidence such as an affidavit from the interpreter who assisted the claimant during BOC preparation that explains what went wrong. At any rate, I find it unreasonable and not credible that the claimant would not include in his narrative the actual day in XXXX 2013 that he fled to Ethiopia given that there were already inconsistencies on the face of his BOC form and in his Schedule \"A\" concerning this issue. I draw an adverse inference as to the claimant's general credibility from the omissions in his BOC narrative in the absence of a reasonable explanation.\n[36] I find that the claimant has failed to provide any credible and trustworthy evidence to establish that he fled Somalia as alleged.\nWitness's testimony doe nots cure the deficiencies in the claimant's evidence\n[37] The claimant's witness provided sworn testimony in support of the claimant's identity. However, I find that the witness's prior interaction with Canadian immigration officers who questioned and the claimant and the nature of his relationship with the claimant adversely affect the reliability of his testimony.\n[38] The witness, who is a sponsored Canadian permanent residence and a citizen of Somalia testified that the first time he met the claimant in person was in July 2013 in Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. The witness testified that he never saw the claimant in Somalia. I asked the witness to explain to me how he knows who the claimant is. He testified that the claimant's father is his cousin. When the claimant fled to Ethiopia, the claimant's father told the witness the name of the claimant. The witness also testified that there were some people in Addis Ababa that knew both the claimant and him. I find that these are not circumstances which establish sufficient reliability because the witness's testimony is ultimately based on the second hand information of the claimant's father (who has not provided an affidavit) or unnamed third parties. I find that this adversely affects the reliability of the witness's testimony. I find that the witness's failure to provide first hand testimony that places the claimant in Somalia leads me to assign a low evidentiary weight to his testimony.\n[39] The more serious problem with the witness's testimony results from his prior interaction with the immigration officers who examined the claimant upon his arrival in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2017. The port of entry notes from that day which were signed by Examining Officer Goncalves, XXXX XXXX XXXX indicate that when the officer contacted the witness by telephone the witness \"did not know\" the claimant's age.28 In his testimony at the hearing, the witness confirmed that when he got the call from the immigration officer on XXXX XXXX, 2017 that he did not know exactly how old the claimant was at the time, although he testified that he knew the age group. The witness explained that he did not place too much importance on the age of the claimant at the time. The witness testified that he now knows the claimant to be 29 years old.\n[40] The claimant, seeking to further explain the witness's failure to provide his age to immigration officers on XXXX XXXX, 2017, testified that the witness got to know him better since he came to Canada. The claimant also stated (in connection with a question about XXXX age) that in Somalia people do not ask about each other's date of birth.\n[41] I find that the witness's and claimant's explanations are not reasonable or credible in the circumstances of their alleged relationship which includes spending approximately two years together in Addis Ababa between 2013 and 2015 before the witness left for Canada under a sponsorship. The witness and claimant both testified that they saw each other two or three times a week while in Addis Ababa. This is a lengthy period of time and a significant frequency of meetings. These two individuals are relatively close in age and consider themselves to be family relatives, albeit distant. They are not mere acquaintances. In those circumstances, I would have expected the witness to be aware of the claimant's date of birth or at least his accurate age in years when the immigration officer questioned him by telephone on XXXX XXXX, 2017.\n[42] I find that the witness's failure to provide the claimant's age when questioned upon the claimant's arrival in Canada in the absence of a reasonable explanation adversely affects the reliability and trustworthiness of the witness's testimony. I find that the witness's testimony is not trustworthy or reliable such that it may establish the claimant's age, which I find is an important part of the claimant's personal identity, in light of the claimant's submission of a fraudulent passport that contains an irregularity with respect to the year of his birth.\nThe claimant's school certificate is fraudulent\n[43] The claimant provided a school certificate which states that he \"successfully completed his\/her intermediate school studies in the school year 2001\/2008\".29 The claimant provided the original document at the hearing. The Board temporarily retained the original after the hearing for the purpose of making colour copies.30\n[44] The school certificate contains Arabic and Somali text on one side and provides the claimant's biodata in handwritten blue ink pen while the other side contains an English translation which is almost completely computer generated.\n[45] In assessing the weight to be given to this document, I note that it does not include a picture of the claimant which limits the value of this document in establishing the claimant's personal identity. Furthermore, whether the claimant attended school in Somalia does not strictly establish whether he is a national of that country. Both of these concerns reduce the evidentiary weight that can be assigned to this document.\n[46] Furthermore, the overall appearance of this document raises several irregularities which adversely affect its reliability and alleged genuineness.\n[47] For example, on the non-English side, both stamps from the \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in Somalia\" appear blurry and slightly pixelated to the same degree as the neighbouring computer generated text. When one looks at both stamps with the naked eye it is clearly evident that they are composed of tiny bluish dots associated with a colour printer as opposed to an ink stamp. Similarly, on the English side, there are two blurry Ministry of Education stamps on the bottom of the page that seem to have displaced the green and slightly beige background of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX crest which functions as the document's watermark. The same displacement effect on the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. crest is visible with the \"Ministry of Foreign Affairs\" stamp on the right side of the English language page. That displacement is particularly noticeable given the double square shape of the stamp (one thin line followed by a thicker line). Lastly, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stamp, while it displaces the green watermark, seems to be under the black text namely the '%' symbols. In other words, it appears as if the black text of the various school marks was printed over the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stamp.\n[48] I put to the claimant in the hearing that it appeared to me that the various stamps on the original school certificate may actually be computer generated. The claimant explained that this is how the school issued the document to him. Counsel notes in submissions that the claimant provided the original school certificate but he otherwise makes no submissions with respect to the appearance of this document.31\n[49] I find that I cannot accept the claimant's explanation as reasonable because the main security features in this document, the stamps, are on a balance of probabilities, computer generated images that were digitally inserted and printed on the original certificate at various stages of its preparation. The practice of scanning a stamp on a computer and applying the scanned picture to a document, instead of using an actual physical stamp would be an unorthodox practice. It causes the reader to doubt whether the institution that issued the document possesses the physical stamp which appears to have been the chosen security feature to assure the reader of the authenticity of the document. I find that the use of a scanned computer images of stamps from important institutions such as the Somali Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Education (as opposed to the use of a physical stamp) adversely affects the reliability of this document.\n[50] Given above deficiencies on the face of the school certificate and the failure of the claimant to provide a reasonable explanation, I find that the school certificate is on a balance of probabilities, a fraudulent document. I assign it no evidentiary weight. I draw an adverse inference as to the claimant's general credibility from the submission of a fraudulent document. I find that the claimant has failed to adduce any credible and trustworthy evidence to establish that he completed his \"intermediate school studies\" in Somalia in 2008 as alleged.\nUnreasonable failure to provide a translated version of a letter from his mother - post-hearing\n[51] The claimant and counsel advised me at the hearing that a letter in the Somali language had been obtained from the claimant's mother but that due inadvertence, an English translation was sourced in time for the hearing. While I advised claimant and counsel that I could not admit the mother's letter in the absence of an English translation, leave was given for the claimant to provide the mother's letter and English translation on a post-hearing basis along with counsel's written submissions and any other documents. Counsel requested an indulgence of one week which I had no difficulty granting.\n[52] Counsel provided his written submissions by the deadline. Included in the package was the witness's Somali passport, single journey document, and a DHL envelope.32 There was no mention in the written submissions of the purported letter from the mother or the status with respect to the translation of this document. An application seeking an extension of time to file the mother's letter with an English translation was not sought.\n[53] It is the burden of the claimant to establish, on a balance of probabilities, with credible evidence that the facts which he alleges and which underlie his claim are true.\n[54] The claimant is required by RPD Rule 11 to provide documentation establishing elements of his claim:\nThe claimant must provide acceptable documents establishing identity and other elements of the claim. A claimant who does not provide acceptable documents must explain why they were not provided and what steps were taken to obtain them.33\n[55] Given the serious irregularities with the claimant's evidence particularly as it affect his alleged date of birth, I would have expected him to make reasonable efforts to adduce additional evidence to cure these deficiencies. The claimant's mother would naturally be in the best position to provide credible and trustworthy evidence with respect to his date of birth. While the Board sympathises with the claimant due to the inadvertence that prevented the timely translation of the mother's letter before the hearing, I find that the absence of the letter and its English translation from the post-hearing package, the silence in the written submissions regarding the status of the translation, and the failure of the claimant to request (if needed) additional time to complete the translation to be unreasonable efforts or explanation pursuant to Rule 11. I draw an adverse inference as to the claimant's general credibility from his unreasonable efforts to obtain readily available corroborative evidence about his identity in the absence of a reasonable explanation.\nThe claimant was not a generally credible witness\n[56] Given the credibility findings set out above, I find that the claimant is generally without credibility in regard to his identity and the basis of his claim. I do not believe he is who he says he is, how old he is, that he lived in Somalia as alleged and that he is a national of that country.\n[57] Even without disbelieving every part of a claimant's testimony, the claimant may be found to be so lacking in credibility that the panel concludes there is no credible evidence relevant to his claim.34 I find that the claimant was generally lacking in credibility and this lack of credibility extends to all of his allegations and relevant parts of his testimony.\n[58] The claimant testified in Somali, his alleged native language. However, I find that his general credibility is so tarnished that I am not able to assign any parts of his testimony that may have been consistent and delivered in Somali any evidentiary weight. The claimant may be one of the many individuals of Somali ethnic descent that reside and hold nationality in any number of states that border Somalia.35 The fact that the claimant can speak Somali is insufficient in and of itself to establish his nationality, let alone the basic aspects of his personal identity and where and when he allegedly lived in Somalia.\n[59] Since the claimant has not demonstrated with credible evidence his identity and nationality, the credibility of his entire basis for claiming refugee status is undermined.\nNo remaining credible or trustworthy disclosure to establish identity\n[60] The claimant provided a letter from XXXX XXXX which purports to verify the personal identity of the claimant and his nationality as a Somali.36 The letter indicates that this organization uses \"a rigorous process of Community Verification\" which requires the claimant to answer a written questionnaire in the Somali language script and attend an oral interview in Somali and answer questions about \"background, geography, history, heritage, socio political, clan lineage and culture of Somalia\" from a \"professional Somali settlement counsellor\". There is no indication in the letter that any of the information imparted by the claimant in his self-reporting to this organization was under oath. Accordingly, I find that the underlying responses and the ultimate opinion rendered by this organization to be entitled to less evidentiary weight than testimony under oath.\n[61] There is no mention in the letter that the XXXX XXXX was aware of the irregularities in the claimant's date of birth as it appears on his passport. It is not clear to me from reading the letter how this organization is able to verify the claimant's date of birth in these circumstances.\n[62] I find that I cannot assign any evidentiary weight to this letter because it is not reliable. The entire \"community assessment verification\" process appears to be focussed heavily on the ability of the claimant to speak and write in Somali and provide general information about Somalia and his clan lineage. Geographical and political information about Somalia is publicly accessible can be learned for the specific purpose of passing this test. Furthermore, the fact that the claimant is fluent in Somali does not establish his nationality since he may be of Somali ethnicity but a national of any number of neighbouring countries where ethnic-Somali individuals but otherwise nationals of their host states normally reside.37 I find that these deficiencies adversely impact the reliability of this document.\n[63] The Federal Court has held that caution should be exercised in accepting expert reports at face value, particularly when they propose to settle important issues to be decided by the tribunal.38 The Court held that unless there is some means to corroborate either the neutrality or lack of self-interest of the expert in relation to the litigation process, they generally should be accorded little weight.39\n[64] I find that in addition to the above reasons, this letter is also unreliable because there is insufficient information within to qualify its author or the organization as an expert entitled to provide opinion evidence on the important issue of identity. The letter in this case proposes to settle the important question of the claimant's identity through opinion evidence.\n[65] I find that this letter is unreliable because it fails to explain what education, experience and professional qualifications entitle Dr. XXXX to \"confirm\" that the claimant is who he says he is and possesses Somali nationality. The letter does not indicate what education, experience and professional qualifications are held by the \"professional Somali settlement counsellor\" who interviewed the claimant and the counsellor is not actually named in the letter. While the letter indicates that this organization has been delivering settlement services for many years, there is no indication for how long the specific service of identity verification has been performed by this organization, apart from the usual settlement services that are funded by the government.\n[66] Accordingly, I find that there is insufficient evidence to qualify Dr. XXXX or the XXXX XXXX organization as experts on the issue of Somali identity. In the absence of sufficient evidence to qualify these individuals and organization as experts, I find that the statements in the letter are mere advocacy.\n[67] In this case, I find that the deficiencies in the letter itself that impacts its reliability in combination with the insufficient evidence to allow the Board to qualify the above individuals as experts, leads me to conclude that I cannot assign any evidentiary weight to this letter. I find that the particular deficiencies in this letter fall even below the circumstances in the Czesak case decided by the Federal Court and cited above. It is not appropriate to assign this letter any evidentiary weight.\n[68] I find that the statements and conclusion of this letter does not address the credibility problems set out earlier in these reasons. I find this letter does not overcome the serious credibility problems with the claimant's evidence.\nNo credible basis\n[69] In assessing whether this claim has no credible basis, the Board refers to subsection 107(2) of the IRPA requires a consideration of two factors:\n1. whether there is any credible or trustworthy evidence; and\n2. whether the RPD could have made a favourable decision on that evidence\n[70] A finding of \"no credible basis\" can be made where the claimant lacks credibility (e.g., the claimant's identity or story is disbelieved) and there is no independent, credible evidence linking the claimant to potential persecution under IRPA, s. 96 or risk of harm under IRPA, s. 97(1) (Sheikh v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1990] 3 F.C. 238 (C.A.). at 244.).\n[71] The leading case on the issue of \"no credible basis\" is Rahaman v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2002] 3 F.C. 537 (C.A.); 2002 FCA 89, where the Court stated:\n[28] ... the Board member may not make a \"no credible basis\" finding if there is credible or trustworthy evidence before it that is capable of enabling the Board to uphold the claim, even if, taking the evidence as a whole, the Board decides that the claim is not established.\n[29] However, ... the claimant's oral testimony will often be the only evidence linking the claimant to the alleged persecution and, in such cases, if the claimant is not found to be credible, there will be no credible or trustworthy evidence to support the claim. Because they are not claimant-specific, country reports alone are normally not a sufficient basis on which the Board can uphold a claim.\n[30] On the other hand, the existence of some credible or trustworthy evidence will not preclude a \"no credible basis\" finding if that evidence is insufficient in law to sustain a positive determination of the claim. ...\n[51] ... the Board should not routinely state that a claim has \"no credible basis\" whenever it concludes that the claimant is not a credible witness. ... [subsection 107(2) of IRPA] requires the Board to examine all the evidence and to conclude that the claim has no credible basis only when there is no trustworthy or credible evidence that could support a recognition of the claim.\n[72] Given that the panel has found that the claimant is not credible and the documents he has provided in support of his identity are fraudulent or are otherwise not entitled to any evidentiary weight, the panel finds per subsection 107(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act that there is no credible evidence on which the panel could have found this claimant to be a refugee or a person in need of protection. Therefore the panel finds that there is no credible basis for this claim.\nCONCLUSION\n[73] In considering the totality of the evidence, the panel finds the claimant is not a credible witness and has not met the burden to establish his identity on a balance of probabilities as required by Section 106 of IRPA and Rule 11 of the Rules.\n[74] The panel concludes that the claimant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection and therefore rejects his claim.\n[75] In rejecting the claim, the panel determines there was no credible or trustworthy evidence on which the panel could have made a favourable decision, given the claimant's lack of credibility and the lack of independent, credible evidence establishing the claimant's identity and linking the claimant to potential persecution or a risk of harm under section 96 and 97 of IRPA. In accordance with section 107(2) of IRPA the panel determines that there is no credible basis for this claim.\n(signed)\n\"Yonatan Rozenszajn\"\nYonatan Rozenszajn\nAugust 16, 2017\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n2 Exhibit 2, Basis of Claim Form (BOC).\n3 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, section 106.\n4 Sertkaya, Ismail v.

She claims refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant alleges she is a bisexual woman who fled Uganda where, on account of her gender and sexual orientation, she fears persecution by her husband Denis, her community, and the authorities.\n[3] The claimant, 35 years of age, alleges that in 2008 she married XXXX, with whom she has four children. He was abusive towards her throughout the marriage and so the claimant made efforts to seek a divorce in 2015. In that same year, the claimant met her same-sex partner XXXX XXXX with whom she remains intimately involved. Though they met clandestinely, XXXX grew suspicious of the claimant's activities in 2016.\n[4] In May 2017, the claimant came to Canada for a conference. After her husband cut off her communication with her children, the claimant began to fear that he may be aware of her same-sex relationship with XXXX. She decided to remain in Canada and filed her claim for protection in June.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] I find that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\n[6] The determinative issue in this claim is credibility.\nIdentity\n[7] The claimant's identity is established by way of a certified copy of her Ugandan passport.1\nCredibility\n[8] Having considered the claimant's oral and written testimony, I find that the claimant did not provide credible or trustworthy evidence to establish that she was assaulted by XXXX or that she is a bisexual woman. Several significant issues led me to question the credibility of her evidence: her relationship with XXXX and the alleged abuse she suffered at his hands is grounded on fraudulent documentation; she also relies on fraudulent documentation to establish her sexual orientation; her testimony regarding her relationship with XXXX is not reliable; she had no reliable corroborating evidence of this two-year relationship; and the claimant provided no reasonable explanation for not calling XXXX as a witness.\n[9] In my questioning and in rendering this decision, I carefully considered the Chairperson's Guideline 9: Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression and Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.2 Guideline 4 highlights that women refugee claimants may face special problems in demonstrating that their claims are credible and trustworthy. Factors that may affect their ability to provide evidence include difficulty in providing testimony on sensitive matters, cross-cultural misunderstandings as well as social, religious, and economic differences. The Guidelines were used to help assess the claimant's circumstances and to understand and apply the added sensitivities necessary to properly assess her evidence.\n1) History of domestic violence based on fraudulent documentation\n[10] The claimant's allegations of domestic violence are grounded on a letter from the Chairman of her village's Local Council - often the first line of reporting for Ugandan women who suffer domestic abuse -,3 police reports, affidavits from her divorce lawyer and her neighbour, and a notice of divorce. For the reasons specified below and in light of the prevalence of fraudulent documents in Uganda,4 I find that each of these documents are fraudulent.\n[11] The majority of these documents contained fraudulent ink stamps. As rubber ink stamps are more difficult to reproduce than the simple text documents upon which they appear, they bolster the authenticity of the document, assuring the Board member that the document emanates from the relevant institution and a specific date. The claimant provided originals for some of the documents she submitted as evidence. The ink stamps on most of the probative original documents were digitally printed in a manner to appear as though they are authentic ink stamps.\n[12] This is apparent when viewing the originals, but not necessarily the photocopies. Upon close inspection, one can see that the stamps do not match the generally observed characteristics of ink stamps. The stamps on the claimant's documents will either be too crisp to be produced by a rubber ink stamp, lack the characteristics of ink stamps and more closely resemble a digital imprint, and\/or the stamp will sit below the document's text, rather than above as one would typically expect if the document were stamped after the document were drafted and printed. That the author would attempt to deceive the reader by digitally reproducing an ink stamp, suggests that the document itself is fraudulent. When I put one of these stamped documents5 to the claimant, describing the above, she could not provide an explanation.\n[13] While the standard practice of the Board is to return all original documents to the claimant once a decision is rendered, I have directed the Board to hold on to the original documents to facilitate any potential review of my decision. These have been entered as Exhibit 11.\nLetter from Village Local Council Chairman\n[14] The claimant submitted a letter from her Local Council Chairman, which summarizes the history of abuse she suffered.6 I find it fraudulent for two reasons. First, upon close inspection of the original letter, the two ink stamps at the top right and bottom left of the letter are not authentic. Second, the village Chairman misspells the name of the village - Nayiyoya instead of Namyoya - not only in the body of the letter but in his signature line. I find it unreasonable that the Local Council Chairperson would misspell the name of the village he oversees.\nPolice report from Ntinda Police Station\n[15] The claimant submitted a police report documenting an incident of domestic violence between the claimant and her husband from March 17, 2015.7 As above, the ink stamp on the document is not authentic. When examining the original, one can see that the letter's handwriting lies above the stamp, rather than underneath it. I therefore find that this report is also fraudulent.\nDocuments from claimant's divorce lawyer\n[16] The claimant submitted an affidavit from her lawyer outlining his efforts to assist her with divorce proceedings and the events that prompted the claimant to file for divorce.8 The affidavit is fraudulent as the commissioner for oaths and notary public stamps are not authentic. In examining the commissioner's stamp on the original affidavit, I note that the printed dotted line sits above the red and blue text of the stamp, again confirming that the stamp was digitally printed.\n[17] The claimant submitted a \"Formal Notification of Divorce\" letter addressed to XXXX, dated XXXX XXXX, 2015.9 I find that the letter is fraudulent as XXXXs' address is listed as \"XXXX XXXX XXXX, Kampala\" yet XXXX and the claimant were not living in XXXX XXXX Kampala, but in XXXX XXXX Mukono at the time.10\nAffidavit from uncle\n[18] The claimant submitted an affidavit from her uncle XXXX XXXX which outlines, from his perspective, the troubled relationship between the claimant and XXXX.11 On the original, I noted that the notary public stamps are not authentic ink stamps; the first stamp sits below the printed dotted line. Furthermore the pressed lettering in the red seals is inverted, indicating that the individual who pressed the seal, mistakenly did so from behind the page. I find it implausible that a licensed notary public would make such a mistake. I find that this affidavit is fraudulent.\n[19] The claimant's reliance on the above fraudulent documents that establish key elements of her allegations of being abused by XXXX lead me to doubt the reliability of her testimony and her other documentary evidence. I find that the claimant is not at risk of domestic violence in Uganda and therefore her gender-based claim must fail.\n2) Evidence regarding her same-sex relationship and sexual identity is not reliable\nFraudulent documents supporting her sexual orientation\n[20] The claimant alleged that she was a member of Pan Africa ILGA (International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association), an advocacy organization for the African LGBTQ community. I asked the claimant what she did as a member, and she provided a vague response of meeting with other members, sharing her story, and encouraging other bisexual women to be open about their sexual orientation, though the claimant herself was not open about her sexual orientation. She said she did not participate in any of its conferences.\n[21] In support of her membership, the claimant provided a letter from the Country Director of Pan Africa ILGA.12 Based on my review of the original, I find the letter to be fraudulent for two reasons. First, the ink stamp at the bottom left is not authentic. Second, the e-mail address in the letterhead \"panafrica@africamail.com\" does not correspond with the e-mail address found on the official Pan Africa ILGA website \"info@panafricailga.org\".13 When asked about this discrepancy, the claimant stated that the e-mail address on the letter corresponds to the Ugandan branch of Pan Africa ILGA. I find this explanation unreasonable as the email address \"panafrica@africamail.com\" gives no indication of it being that of the Ugandan branch, nor does it use the same domain name (\"@panafricailga.org) as the e-mail from the official website. I provided the claimant and her counsel an opportunity after the hearing to contact Pan Africa ILGA to confirm this e-mail address, and they could not.14\n[22] In light of the claimant's vague testimony regarding her activities with the Pan Africa ILGA and her reliance on a fraudulent support letter, I find that the claimant was not a member of Pan Africa ILGA.\n[23] The claimant presented a plastic Pan Africa ILGA membership card at the hearing.15 Given the claimant's access to and reliance on fraudulent documents, I give it no weight.\n[24] The claimant also provided an affidavit from her sister XXXX stating that she was expelled from school owing to her homosexuality.16 I find this affidavit, prepared by and sworn before the same lawyer and notary public as the previous affidavits, to also be fraudulent. The notary public stamp was digitally printed in a manner that replicates an authentic ink stamp.\n[25] Given her reliance on fraudulent documents to establish her membership in an LGBTQ advocacy group and her past persecution as a bisexual woman I draw a negative credibility inference as to her sexual orientation.\nRelationship with XXXX\n[26] The claimant provided vague testimony regarding her two-year same-sex relationship with XXXX, despite her allegation that this was and remains her most significant relationship. Whenever pressed for details about the things they did together in Uganda or special moments they shared, the claimant would answer by providing a rehearsed statement about the two having sex.\n[27] The claimant provided no proof of their communication over the two years while they were living in Uganda, only a series of their WhatsAapp text messages.17 As these messages begin only after the claimant had filed her claim for protection in Canada, I confer these text messages little weight. The claimant provided a few pictures of a woman she alleges to be XXXX.18 I find none of her evidence sufficiently probative to establish their relationship.\n[28] The claimant testified that she is still communicating with XXXX. I asked the claimant if she thought about having XXXX testify on her behalf, and the claimant said she didn't know she could do that. I asked if she thought of having XXXX provide an affidavit, and she responded that XXXX could not find a friendly lawyer - i.e. one who would help someone who is a sexual minority. I find the claimant's explanations unreasonable. First, she is represented here in Canada by experienced counsel who is aware of the Board's capacity for and practice of accommodating testimony by phone. Second, the claimant's divorce lawyer, given the disclosure by the claimant's sister,19 is aware of the claimant's alleged homosexuality and could have assisted XXXX with an affidavit.\n[29] The claimant's vague testimony about her relationship with XXXX, the absence of any reliable evidence of their relationship, and the claimant's failure to call XXXX as a witness lead me to find that the claimant was not in an intimate same-sex relationship with XXXX.\nSummary\n[30] In attempting to establish her sexual orientation, the claimant has relied on fraudulent documents and an alleged same-sex relationship that is not genuine. As this long-term same-sex relationship with XXXX is a central component of her sexual orientation claim, I doubt the veracity of all her remaining evidence regarding her sexual identity. The claimant also relied on fraudulent documentation to establish her allegation that she was abused by her husband XXXX.\n[31] I find that on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has not established her claim on the basis of credible and trustworthy evidence and has not established the central elements of the claim, namely that she was a victim of domestic violence or that she is a bisexual woman.\nManifestly Unfounded Claim\n[32] Section 107.1 of the IRPA reads,\nIf the Refugee Protection Division rejects a claim for refugee protection, it must state in its reasons for the decision that the claim is manifestly unfounded if it is of the opinion that the claim is clearly fraudulent.\nThe claimant's allegations of domestic violence and a same-sex relationship are key components of claims based on gender and sexual orientation respectively. In this case, the claimant provided the Board with fraudulent evidence to support the determination of her key relationships and victimization. By doing so, the claimant has deliberately attempted to deceive the Board of a matter which is both material and substantive and therefore highly relevant to the determination of her status. As such, I find that her claim is manifestly unfounded.\nCONCLUSION\n[33] Having considered all of the evidence, I find that the claimant has not established that she faces a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, or that, on a balance of probabilities, she would personally be subjected to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture upon return to Uganda.\n[34] I find that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n[35] This claim is therefore rejected. In addition I find that the claim is manifestly unfounded.\n(signed)\n\"M. Huynh\"\nM.

He is married. The marriage produced one child, a son. The claimant also has XXXX adopted sons. The claimant is a member of the English speaking minority in Cameroon and as such has been marginalized with respect to employment.\n[4] In 1999 the claimant began to attend closed door meetings of the Southern Cameroon's National Council (SCNC). The claimant promoted the SCNC in his home village of XXXX. His political activities made the claimant a target of the government. In XXXX 2000, while he was working in Duala, his family home in XXXX was raided by security forces who searched for the claimant and accused him of being a traitor. The claimant moved from Duala to XXXX in order to seek safety.\n[5] In XXXX 2000 the claimant became a member of the SCNC. He supported the party by XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[6] On XXXX XXXX, 2004, during Independence Day celebrations, the claimant was arrested and subsequently detained with 40 other demonstrators. The claimant escaped from detention with the assistance of a policeman who was a former classmate. On XXXX XXXX, 2004 the claimant was again arrested. He was held in XXXXCentral Prison for XXXX days. He was released with the assistance of his lawyer and the human rights organization, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[7] While he was leaving an SCNC meeting on XXXX XXXX, 2004, the claimant was re-arrested. He was detained for one week. During this time police searched the claimant's home for SCNC documents; none were found. The claimant was again released with the assistance of his lawyer and the XXXX organization.\n[8] On XXXX XXXX, 2005 the claimant was arrested and held in XXXXCentral Prison. The claimant was tortured during his detention. He received medical attention at the XXXX General Hospital. The claimant was released from prison on XXXX XXXX, 2005. He joined his family members who were hiding in a remote village near the Equatorial Guinea border. The claimant fled to Equatorial Guinea in XXXX 2005. On XXXX XXXX, 2007 the claimant was arrested and detained due to his immigration status. The claimant's boss assisted him in obtaining his release.\n[9] With the assistance of a cousin in the United States (US) the claimant obtained a US visa on XXXX XXXX, 2007. He arrived in the US on XXXX XXXX, 2007. On XXXX XXXX, 2008 the claimant was arrested and detained as a result of using false documents to obtain employment. When the claimant was released from detention on XXXX XXXX, 2008 he made a claim for asylum in the US. While in the US, the claimant was actively involved in the SCNC. The claimant's claim for asylum in the US was ultimately denied as was his appeal. The claimant was deported from the US to Cameroon on XXXX XXXX, 2012.\n[10] The claimant was arrested upon his arrival in Cameroon. He was detained and subsequently transferred to the XXXX Central Prison where he remained for XXXX months. He was informed that he had been detained because of his political activities in the US. The claimant was able to escape from prison when his uncle bribed a prison officer. The claimant hid for one month at the home of his uncle's friend, a XXXX. During this time, arrangements were made for the claimant to leave Cameroon with the assistance of an agent.\n[11] The claimant arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2012 and made a claim for refugee protection on November 22, 2012.\nDetermination\n[12] I find that the claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX, is not a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the IRPA, nor is he a person in need of protection, pursuant to s. 97(1) of IRPA.\nANALYSIS\nWritten submissions3\n[13] At the end of the hearing it was agreed that counsel would provide written submissions within one week. The submissions arrived within that time. I have considered these submissions when making my decision.\nIssues\n[14] The issues in this case were:\n* Identity\n* Credibility\n* Delay in claiming for protection in the United States (US)\nIdentity\n[15] The claimant's personal identity and country of citizenship have been established, on a balance of probabilities, as per certified true copies of his National Identity Card and his Birth Certificate4 as well as his oral testimony. The claimant also provided his marriage certificate5 and a copy of two biographical pages of his Cameroonian passport6.\nCredibility\n[16] In assessing the credibility of the evidence presented by the claimant, I kept in mind the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Maldonado7 wherein the Court stated, in part, that \"when a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there be reason to doubt their truthfulness.\" However, I find that the claimant failed to advance his claim with evidence that is credible. I am aware that none of the credibility concerns raised here may be sufficient, each on its own, to negate this claim. However, the cumulative effect of all of them is that I do not have sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence upon which to base a determination that the claimant is a Convention refugee. As the court of appeal in Sheikh,8 MacGuigan, J.A. held:\n... even without disbelieving every word [a claimant] has uttered, a ... panel may reasonably find him so lacking in credibility that it concludes that there is no credible evidence relevant to his claim ... In other words, a general finding of a lack of credibility on the part of the applicant may conceivably extend to all relevant information emanating from his testimony.\nClaim for asylum in the United States\nMore than XXXX months delay\n[17] As indicated above, the claimant made a claim for refugee protection in the US more than XXXX months after he arrived in the country.\n[18] During the hearing I asked the claimant what or whom he feared in Cameroon when he first arrived in the US. The claimant testified that he feared that if he had returned to Cameroon he would again be detained by government agents and that he might be killed. I asked the claimant why he had not made a claim for asylum in the US at the time he entered the US or shortly thereafter. He testified that Cameroonians he met in the US advised him that he had a year to make a claim and he thought it was necessary to have all of his documents before making his claim. When asked if he had made inquiries beyond word of mouth, the claimant responded in the negative. I do not find the claimant's explanations for the delay in making his claim to be satisfactory. The claimant is a well-educated man with XXXX years of formal education.9 His first language is English.10 I, therefore, find that he was very capable of making inquiries from credible sources with regards to the requirements for making a claim for asylum in the US. The claimant's subjective fear is undermined as a result of his more than XXXX month delay in claiming for protection. I, thus, find the claimant's credibility undermined.\nExpired visitor's visa\n[19] During the hearing I noted to the claimant that before he made his claim in the US, his visitor's visa was no longer valid. When asked, he testified that he had not renewed his visa. The claimant testified that he had been na\u00efve and that his people did not rush to make asylum claims. I do not find the claimant's explanations satisfactory. Having let his visa expire, the claimant was at risk of being deported. Such behavior is not that of a person who fears persecution if deported. I, thus, find the claimant's credibility further undermined.\nIllegal activity\n[20] During the hearing I pointed out to the claimant that his attempt to obtain employment in the US by using someone else's documents was illegal behaviour and that he risked deportation. He testified that when you are hungry you do not care what happens. He testified further that he had not realized that his actions could get him in trouble. He testified that he had been wanted by authorities before and that hardship in the US had pushed him to use false documents in an attempt to obtain work. I find the claimant's explanations unsatisfactory. The claimant is not an unsophisticated man and it strains credulity that he would not consider that his actions were illegal. His behaviour in committing an illegal act which might cause him to be deported is not that of a person who fears persecution if he were to be returned to Cameroon. I, thus, find the claimant's credibility diminished.\nTiming of claim\n[21] I find it more likely than not that the claimant made a claim for asylum in the US only to avoid deportation related to his illegal activities. My reasons are as follows. During the hearing I referred the claimant to the timing of his claim for asylum in the US which coincided with his arrest for using identity documents that were not his own. I suggested to him that his claim for asylum was made only to avoid deportation. The claimant repeated earlier testimony that being desperate to obtain employment he had used his friend's documents. I do not find the claimant's explanation satisfactory. I believe that the claimant claimed for asylum as a method of avoiding deportation and not because he feared persecution in Cameroon. I find, on a balance of probabilities and on the basis of findings noted above, that the claimant's decision to make a claim for asylum in the US was not based on a fear of persecution in Cameroon, but rather to avoid deportation as a result of being caught by US authorities using false documents.\nSummary of delay of claim\n[22] With respect to the issue of delay of claim, I considered the jurisprudence. In the case of Assadi, Nasser-Eddin v. MCI, the Court held:\nFailure to immediately seek protection can impugn the claimant's credibility, including his or her testimony about events in his country of origin.11\n[23] In the Ilie decision the Federal Court held:\nThe tribunal was entitled to consider the applicant's failure to claim refugee status in other countries, and to consider how the applicant's evidence was to be weighed in light of that failure.12\n[24] With regards to allowing his visa to expire before making a claim, the Court declared as follows:\n'It is trite law that a delay in submitting a refugee protection claim, while not decisive, remains a relevant element that the tribunal may take into account in assessing both the statements and the actions and deeds of a claimant. The claimant knew upon his arrival that he was only authorized to stay in Canada for a specific and limited period of time. Under these circumstances it was reasonable to expect that he would regularize his status as soon as possible if he truly feared for his life and physical integrity in India.'13\n[25] In conclusion, I find the claimant's credibility seriously impugned.\nLack of documentation regarding the claim for refugee protection in the United States\n[26] The claimant provided documentation from the US Department of Justice regarding the appeal of his asylum claim and an application for withholding of removal.14 In the negative decision of the claimant's appeal, the following was noted:\nThe numerous discrepancies listed by the Immigration Judge are present in the record (of the decision on the claimant's asylum claim) and form an adequate basis upon which to find the respondent (the claimant) not credible.15\n[27] The claimant did not provide the documentary evidence with regards to his application for asylum in the US or the Immigration Judge's decision of his original claim. Although I am not bound by a decision made by an immigration judge in the US, because of the absence of the documents under discussion I am unable to thoroughly question the claimant about the basis of his claim in the US and, in particular, discrepancies referred to in the quotation above .\n[28] The claimant provided documentary evidence for his present claim that he had previously used for his claim in the US, such as medical reports,16 documents issued by SCNC,17 an affidavit from his Cameroonian lawyer18 and from XXXX19. When asked, the claimant testified that he had left all of the documents from his US claim in the US and that they had been mailed to him after he arrived in Canada from Cameroon. I asked the claimant if he had completed an application in the US for asylum with a written narrative; he responded in the affirmative. He testified that he attended a hearing in the US. Upon being asked, he testified that while he was in the US he had kept a copy of his application for asylum. I asked the claimant why he had not provided this application or any other documentation from US authorities regarding his initial asylum claim. He testified that this was what he got from the person in the US whom he had asked to send him the original documents. The claimant provided a copy of an application he sent to the US Homeland Security, dated XXXX XXXX, 2017, requesting all documentation regarding his asylum claim.20 I asked the claimant why he had not applied for these documents until less than one month before his hearing. The claimant testified that the US was not very far way and he, therefore, did not think it would take too long. I find the claimant's explanations unsatisfactory for the lack of documentary evidence from US authorities regarding his claim in the US. As I have stated previously, the claimant is a well-educated man. The timing in which the US authorities might respond to the claimant's request for documentation is not related to the proximity of the US to Canada. He has been represented by the same experienced counsel since the time he completed his PIF five years ago.21 The instructions for completing the PIF advise the claimant to provide details of steps he took to seek refuge in another country and to provide documents to support his claim.22 Counsel submits that once the hearing date was set, she advised the claimant to submit an application to US authorities requesting the file regarding his asylum claim. Respectfully, I do not accept this submission a satisfactory explanation for the absence of these documents. The submissions provide no explanation why the claimant was not instructed to obtain these documents at a much earlier date in a reasonable anticipation of the time such documents might take to be issued. The submissions provide no explanation as to why the claimant, on his own, did not make inquiries before the hearing date was set as to how he might obtain such documents.\n[29] I take a decided negative inference from the absence of documentation regarding the claimant's claim in the US.\nThe claimant's deportation from the US to Cameroon\n[30] The claimant alleges in his PIF and in his oral testimony that he was deported from the US to Cameroon XXXX XXXX, 2012. He alleges that he was immediately detained in Cameroon for XXXX months then escaped and went in hiding for one month before he travelled to Canada. Given that the claimant received from the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement notice23 on XXXX XXXX, 2012 of his imminent deportation to Cameroon I have concerns of the timing of the claimant's alleged deportation to Cameroon and his arrival in Canada XXXX months later.\n[31] When asked, the claimant testified that he travelled to Cameroon on a laisser-passer issued by the Cameroonian embassy in Washington, D.C. The claimant explained during his testimony that the US authorities would not return his Cameroonian passport. Upon being asked, the claimant testified that he travelled from XXXX, XXXX to XXXX via XXXX XXXX and from XXXX to Cameroon via XXXX XXXX. He testified that he bought his own tickets on-line. He testified that when he arrived in Cameroon his laisser-passer was taken from him.\n[32] The claimant was asked if he had attempted to obtain evidence of his travels from the US to Cameroon. He asked what type of evidence I was referring to. I suggested that since he purchased his tickets on-line, he might have obtained copies of airline documents issued electronically. I asked if he had contacted the Cameroonian embassy in Washington, DC, to request a copy of the laissez-passer. I asked if he had contacted the airlines to request a manifest.The claimant testified that he had made no inquiries or requests. Thus, there is no satisfactory documentary evidence before me that the claimant returned to Cameroon from the US in XXXX 2012 or at any time. As for the lack of such documentation, the claimant has failed to provide, contrary to his onus to do so, relevant documentation to establish his claim. His allegations of abuse in Cameroon in 2012 due to his involvement with the SCNC hinge upon his allegation that he returned to Cameroon from the US. Rule 1124 of the Refugee Protection Division stipulates that the claimant \"must provide acceptable documents establishing their identity and other elements of the claim.\" If the claimant does not provide such documents, he\/she must be able to explain the reason they were not provided or at least relay what steps were taken to obtain them.25 The claimant has been in Canada for five years and during that time has had the assistance of counsel. He has failed to provide any satisfactory reason for not obtaining such documentation. I believe that such documentation, particularly from the Cameroonian embassy in Washington, DC, would be readily available. I also believe it to have been a straightforward matter to have contacted both airlines with details of his flights to obtain evidence. In the Kante decision, the Federal Court held that the claimant's evidence was lacking in that he failed to submit supporting evidence that he could have obtained.26 The claimant has failed to establish that he returned to Cameroon. I find, therefore, that the claimant's credibility is compromised.\n[33] In the absence of reliable documentary evidence and the various credibility concerns surrounding the claimant's alleged return to Cameroon, I find it more likely than not that the claimant never returned to Cameroon as he claims he did, and that he entered Canada in a different manner than he alleges.\n[34] With regard to the claimant's Cameroonian passport, I am not persuaded, as the claimant alleges, that it was kept by the US authorities. My reasons are as follows. I asked the claimant why he had not produced his Cameroonian passport as evidence of his identity. He testified that the US authorities confiscated his passport when he was arrested in 2008. He testified further that the authorities did not return his passport to him. He explained that the US authorities asked him to renew his expired passport but the Cameroonian embassy refused to do so because he could not provide to them his passport. I find it illogical and, therefore, unreasonable that US authorities would require the claimant to renew his passport without providing the passport to him to allow him to do so. I note that in one document issued, the US Homeland Security states that the claimant failed to apply for a new passport.27 The claimant failed to provide any documentary evidence from US authorities to support his allegation that his passport was not returned to him. I take a further negative inference as a result of the failure of the claimant to satisfactorily explain the absence of his passport.\nAbsence of information in the Port of Entry notes\n[35] I find that on his first encounter with Canadian authorities the claimant was not a trustworthy witness. At the interview with the referring Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) office, the claimant was asked to state any other names he had used or was known by; he provided the answer 'N\/A' [not applicable]28. In the same document, the claimant was asked if he had been arrested or detained by police, the army or any other authorities in any country29; he stated that he had been arrested and detained in the US because he refused to renew his passport and because he did not comply with his conditions of release. He also stated that he had been detained in Equatorial Guinea.30 During the hearing the claimant testified that about XXXX months after he arrived in the US he was arrested and detained because he had attempted to use a friend's identity documents to obtain employment. I referred the claimant to the information from the referring CIC and asked him why he had not provided the alias he had used in the US when attempting to obtain employment. He testified that he had never actually used or was known by his friend's name. He testified further that when he handed over his friend's documents almost immediately he was arrested by police. I do not find the claimant's explanation satisfactory. The fact that he offered his friend's identity cards as his own indicates that he used another name. I find the claimant's testimony was an attempt to minimize his illegal activities. The time at which the police stepped in does not alter the fact that the claimant used another name. I also asked the claimant why he did not provide information at the POE that he had been arrested and detained for using false documents to obtain employment. The claimant testified that he believed this detention and arrest was wrapped up with his detention related to immigration matters. I find the claimant's explanation unsatisfactory. I appreciate that when the claimant was arrested and detained in 2008 for using false documents he was placed into removal proceedings; he provided documentary evidence in this regard.31 However, according to a document issued by Homeland Security the claimant was taken into custody on XXXX XXXX, 2011 because he had failed to abide by the conditions of his release and had failed to apply for a new passport.32 Therefore, the two arrests and detentions were more than three years apart and, thus, quite separate matters that could not reasonably be conflated. The claimant signed form 5611 as \"truthful, complete, and correct\".33 I, therefore, find on a balance of probabilities that in his first dealings with Canadian authorities, the claimant chose not to provide evidence of his illegal activities. As a result of the claimant's testimony I find his credibility compromised.\nDocumentary evidence\nPsychological evidence34\n[36] The claimant provided a letter from Dr. XXXX XXXX, MD, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, dated XXXX XXXX, 2009 as evidence for his claim.\n[37] For the following reasons, I give little evidentiary weight to this document.\n[38] The information is well over 8 years old. In the first sentence of the one paragraph letter, the doctor states that the claimant was treated for symptoms of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The doctor makes no specific diagnosis in this regard. In the final sentence the doctor states the claimant has XXXX XXXX XXXX. There is no other medical evidence provided. The doctor provides no information regarding her credentials for assessing the claimant's psychological state nor does she provide information as to how any assessment was made.\nDocuments issued in Cameroon35\n[39] Given my adverse credibility findings stated above, I find that the documents issued in Cameroon are not sufficient to offset my adverse credibility findings. The credibility findings irreparably taint the probative value of this evidence. I am supported in this finding by jurisprudence.36 I am also guided by the Federal Court of Appeal in Sheikh37\nI would add that ... even without disbelieving every word an applicant has uttered, a ... panel may reasonably find him so lacking in credibility that it concludes there is no credible evidence relevant to his claim... In other words, a general finding of a lack of credibility on the part of the applicant may conceivably extend to all relevant evidence emanating from his testimony.\nDocuments issued in the US by SCNC38\n[40] The claimant provided a Membership Card of the SCNC, North America, issued to him in XXXX 2008, and two subscription cards indicating that the claimant made XXXX $XXXX donations to the SCNC in 2008 and XXXX $XXXX donations in 2011. I, therefore, find that the claimant joined the SCNC in the US in 2008 and made XXXX $XXXX donations over a three year period in the US. However, given my findings above that on a balance of probabilities the claimant was not deported to Cameroon from the US in 2011, I find that the Cameroon authorities did not, on a balance of probabilities learn of the claimant's involvement with the SCNC in the US.\n[41] The claimant did not allege nor did he provide evidence that he has had any involvement with the SCNC since he arrived in Canada over five years ago.\n[42] I, therefore, find that the claimant's brief involvement with the SCNC in the US would not put him at risk if he were to return to Cameroon.\nPhotographs39\n[43] I find that the photographs submitted as evidence of the claimant's political activities are insufficient to overcome my determination that the claimant is not credible. There is nothing in the photographs themselves to provide information regarding the context in which the photographs were taken. Some of the photographs have been labelled. However, it is not possible to ascertain from the photographs themselves who is in the photographs or the dates and purposes of the gathering.\nSummary\n[44] I am aware, as stated at the outset, that none of the credibility concerns raised above may be sufficient on their own to negate this claim; however, the claimant provided instances of evidence that were inconsistent or simply unsatisfactory because it made little or no sense in the context of his allegations. The cumulative effect of these is that I do not have sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence, upon which to base a determination that the claimant is a Convention refugee.\n[45] I find, therefore, that the claimant is not a Convention refugee.\nSection 97 (1)\n[46] The claimant advanced no persuasive evidence to suggest he would face any danger, that is more likely than not, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the \"Convention against Torture.\"\n[47] Given the findings above, that the claimant is not credible, I find that his removal would not subject him personally to a risk to his life, or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he returned to Cameroon.\nCONCLUSION\n[48] I determine that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee, pursuant to section 96 of IRPA, nor is he a person in need of protection, pursuant to section 97(1) of IRPA. The Refugee Protection Division rejects his claim.\n(signed)\n\"Lesley Mason\"\nLesley Mason\nDecember 19, 2017\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, sections 96, 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b).\n2 Exhibits 2, 5a and 5b\n3 Exhibit 10, Post-hearing written submissions, received on December 12, 2017\n4 Exhibit 1, Package of information from the referring CBSA\/CIC\n5 Exhibit 6, Personal documents, received November 16, 2017, at p. 3.\n6 Ibid., at p. 4.\n7 Maldonado, Pedro Enrique Juarez v.

It should be noted that the claimant amended his narrative with regards to dates of allegations 6 weeks after he first filed his BOC. The claimant completed a degree in XXXX XXXX at the XXXX XXXX University in 2009. While at the university, the claimant volunteered as a XXXX for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX including XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX. He completed XXXX months of XXXX course at the Azerbaijan XXXX XXXX in XXXX 2010 and began to work as a XXXX in XXXX 2010 at XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, the claimant was asked by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Mr. XXXX XXXX, to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX two members of the Ministry of National Security. These two members of the MNS were being targeted by the government. Mr. XXXX was called to the police station several times when a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX \"XXXX XXXX\" was introduced. On XXXX XXXX, 2016 members of the riot police in black masks entered the XXXX office and detained Mr. XXXX until the following day. On XXXX XXXX, 2016 Mr. XXXX had a meeting at work and told XXXX XXXX that if they continued to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that they could face threats. However, the claimant continued XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX \"XXXX XXXX\" on XXXX XXXX, 2016. The claimant was arrested on XXXX XXXX, 2016 while at the XXXX office. The claimant was beaten and insulated while in detention. On XXXX XXXX, 2016 the claimant was forced to sign a document in which he agreed to leave Azerbaijan in 3 months; and that he would be imprisoned if he ever returned to Azerbaijan. The claimant was released after he signed this document and was taken to the hospital by his friends. He was treated for closed \"XXXX\" trauma and prescribed ointments.\n[3] The claimant's house was raided by the police on XXXX XXXX, 2016 and they seized documents, a computer and other valuables including jewelry. The police threatened the claimant's wife with deportation to Georgia. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, after meeting an agent to get a USA visa, the police officers came back to the claimant's house to remind him he had to leave Azerbaijan. The claimant left his house to stay with an uncle in XXXX and stopped XXXX XXXX. The claimant had an interview on XXXX XXXX, 2016 at the USA embassy and received his visa on XXXX XXXX, 2016. The claimant left for the USA on XXXX XXXX, 2016 and crossed the border into Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2016 and asked for refugee protection at the border.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] After considering the totality of the evidence and the submissions, the panel determines that the claimant is not a Convention refugee, pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, nor is he a person in need of protection, pursuant to section 97 of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\n[5] I am satisfied that the claimant has established his identity, on a balance of probabilities, as a citizen of Azerbaijan based on his Azerbaijani passport seized by Immigration authorities3.\n[6] The determinative issue in this claim is credibility.\nCredibility\n[7] After careful consideration of all of the evidence and representations, I find that there is insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence with regards to pivotal areas of the claimant's testimony and the documentary evidence. The claimant alleges that he is a XXXX and because of his XXXX XXXX he was targeted by the government. He was forced to leave Azerbaijan by signing an \"agreement\" that he would leave the country within 3 months. I find on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant was not a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX since he could not provide credible and trustworthy evidence that he was a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimant also could not provide credible evidence that the alleged XXXX he worked for existed prior to it being shut down in 2016. The claimant was not a credible witness. The claimant was vague and evasive in providing responses to questions. Questions were repeated in a quest for clarity. There were many credibility issues central to the claim; however, for the sake of brevity the following is a sample of some of the claimant's evidence I did not find to be credible.\nXXXX Evidence is Untrustworthy\n[8] The claimant did not provide trustworthy evidence that he was a XXXX. The claimant finished his university in 2009 and obtained a degree in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He alleges that in the last year of university he was a volunteer XXXX for XXXX XXXX XXXX such as XXXX where he met XXXX XXXX (Mr. XXXX), who would eventually XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and offer him a position. However, the claimant during the hearing could not name one XXXX or XXXX from any of the other XXXX he allegedly volunteered for during his university time. Further the claimant testified that although he \"volunteered\" with these XXXX he was not in contact with any specific XXXX or knew anyone from these XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimant was unable to provide a coherent explanation how he volunteered for XXXX but had no contact with the actual XXXX organizations.\n[9] The claimant also could not provide any names or supporting documents from any XXXXhe worked with from 2009 until 2016. He had no reasonable explanation how he could have worked for 6 years as a XXXX and not have any contacts, friends, or colleagues in the field of XXXX. The claimant testified that he does not have any contact with any of his former colleagues and that he had their phone numbers but could not contact them. The claimant testified that he knows no one currently in Azerbaijan who is XXXX or a XXXX who would know him as a XXXX.\n[10] At one point the claimant also testified that he could not remember the names of his colleagues who he worked for because he was nervous. Later during the hearing, he named several people as his colleagues, but had no evidence to show whether these people XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The panel finds it improbable that in the age of social media, and digital communication, the claimant is unable to contact anyone who could vouch that he was a XXXX or anyone who is currently a XXXX who may know him. I expect a XXXX working full time for 6 years in a XXXX to know other XXXX in his field or be able to provide some supporting documentation from these colleagues or XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I draw a negative inference from the untrustworthy evidence provided by the claimant.\n[11] At one point during the hearing, the claimant testified that someone named XXXX XXXX was a XXXX while he was a student and the claimant XXXX XXXX and gave them to XXXX XXXX XXXX. He also testified that XXXXis now a businessman. When I asked whether he could provide any corroborating evidence from XXXXthat he used to volunteer as a XXXX, the claimant testified that he has no contact with XXXXsince 2015 when he ran into him in XXXX. I expect the claimant who alleges he is an XXXX XXXX could at least find XXXXto provide corroborating evidence that the claimant was a volunteer XXXX in 2009. I find that the claimant has not discharged the onus of providing credible and trustworthy evidence.\n[12] The claimant's testimony about how the XXXX operated lacked common sense and logic. The claimant at the first sitting testified that XXXX XXXXwas the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. When the claimant was questioned further about XXXX XXXX it became apparent to the panel that the claimant did not understand what is meant by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He testified that the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimant's testimony about XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who manages the day to day operations XXXX XXXX XXXX, and the responsibilities XXXX XXXX XXXX, was not credible. I do not agree with counsel's submissions that \"things\" run differently in Azerbaijan and I should not be using a \"Canadian perspective\". A XXXX in XXXX in 2016 would not be running as if it is still the 19th century. I expect a \"XXXX\" or a \"XXXX\" or a \"XXXX\" of XXXX XXXX that has been XXXX for seven years to know XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, to know all XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (since only 7 or 8 people worked in XXXX XXXX), and to understand the basic tenants of XXXX. The claimant testified that he decided to continue to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXinXXXX XXXX 2016 even though XXXX XXXX, Mr. XXXX, told him XXXX XXXX could be shut down. It is common knowledge that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. If Mr. XXXX decided not XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I expect the claimant would not be able to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Based on the claimant's testimony, I find on a balance of probabilities that he did not work as a XXXX.\n[13] The claimant testified that he earned 600 to 700 manat per month which would be around 300 to 400 USD per month; however he was paid each month in cash in an envelope so that here is no record of his salary. He could not explain whether there were deductions, or benefits given to him as an employee and how these benefits or deductions operated, except to say there was an accountant in the XXXX who took care of those details. The claimant testified; however, that since the government destroyed the office, there is no trace of any records. The claimant did not provide a copy of an employment contract, pay stubs, or copies of the XXXX XXXX to support the allegations that XXXX XXXX existed from 2009 until 2016. The lack of reliable evidence diminishes his credibility.\n[14] The claimant's testimony and evidence was not credible about Mr. XXXX. The claimant testified that he met Mr. XXXX while Mr. XXXX was working as a XXXX in 2008\/2009 at XXXX XXXX and the claimant volunteered at XXXX XXXX. However the claimant could not provide any evidence that XXXX XXXXwas a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in 2008 or 2009, which is available on the internet. Furthermore, there is nothing that indicates Mr. XXXX is the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX except his name on the claimant's \"XXXX XXXX\" which as indicated below I find to be unreliable.\n[15] The claimant provided a typed letter dated XXXX XXXX, 2016 from XXXX XXXX with a copy of his identity card4. The letter is unreliable since it does not connect the claimant or Mr. XXXX to a XXXX. The letter also lacks details. The claimant alleges he no longer can get in touch with Mr. XXXX and therefore no further evidence is available about his job as a XXXX. No objective evidence was provided that Mr. XXXX is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I put no weight on this letter as an indication that the claimant was a XXXX or that he was detained because of his XXXX.\n[16] The claimant also provided a certificate for taking a course from the Azerbaijan XXXX XXXX5, which he alleges qualified him to become a XXXX in XXXX XXXX XXXX. According to the claimant, this organization is a union for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The XXXX XXXX is not a school of XXXX or a college. The claimant did not provide any evidence that the Azerbaijan XXXX XXXX exists or what it does. The certificate which is printed out from a jet printer indicates that he completed 'XXXX courses'. When asked what he took at this institution for 6 months, the claimant testified he took \"one\" course in XXXX without clarifying what this one course in XXXX entailed. Further he testified that the XXXX XXXX exists but that the \"XXXX course\" no longer exists. Although the claimant alleges that he is a XXXX, he testified that he is not a member of this association which apparently is a union XXXX XXXX. The claimant was silent when he was asked why he did not join this organization if he is a XXXX. The claimant was unable to explain why XXXX XXXX would hire someone who had taken one \"XXXX\" course from a XXXX XXXX, except to say that he had met Mr. XXXX as a volunteer. I find the certificate6 provided by the claimant unreliable evidence and put no weight on this certificate as an indication that the claimant was trained as a XXXX or that he worked as a XXXX in Azerbaijan.\n[17] The Board disclosed a very short memo from the Research Directorate at the second sitting7. I had indicated at the end of first sitting that I may ask the Research Directorate for some information on the claimant's Facebook page and whether XXXX XXXX was published in XXXX from 2009 to 2016. Counsel for the claimant objected that I should not enter this one page document as an exhibit since it was provided late and he did not have a chance to rebut the information provided by the Research Directorate. Furthermore, counsel questioned whether the Board's Research Directorate is a reliable source of information. It is notable that the Research Directorate provides the National Documentation Package for all the countries at the Division and has been deemed to be a reliable source of information. The memo dated XXXX XXXX, 20178 (the same day as the first sitting of this claim) indicates that no publication called \"XXXX\" was found for Azerbaijan. The same memo indicates that an excerpt from BBC article from July 8, 2009 cites XXXX XXXX as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (not XXXX)9. The claimant testified that he does not know someone named XXXX XXXX. I give this memo probative weight, and I find on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant fabricated the name of this XXXX and that Mr. XXXX was not a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[18] Since the fear in refugee claims is forward looking, the claimant was asked whether he intended to be a XXXX presently even if he was not a XXXX previously. The claimant testified that he has XXXX XXXX XXXX since XXXX 2016. The claimant first testified that he wants to XXXX XXXX Azerbaijan and then he said he does not want to XXXX XXXX Azerbaijan. He also indicated that he wants to go to university in Canada to become a XXXX, which contradicts his allegations that he became a XXXX by volunteering and taking a course in Azerbaijan. I find that the claimant cannot decide about XXXX because he has XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX before. The claimant testified that since leaving Azerbaijan he has XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX because he is afraid for his family's safety in Azerbaijan. However, when it was pointed out to him that his wife and children are living in Georgia, he testified he is under lots of stress because of the refugee hearing so XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimant later testified he still has uncles and aunts in Azerbaijan therefore he XXXX XXXX because he fears for their safety. The claimant could not clarify when he XXXX XXXX XXXX since there is no indication that all of his relatives will be leaving Azerbaijan any time soon. The claimant's testimony evolved as questions were asked and became more convoluted. I find that the claimant does not understand what XXXX entails and fabricated this story in order to migrate to Canada.\nCopies of XXXX XXXX not Reliable\n[19] The claimant provided photocopies of XXXX XXXX10 he alleges XXXX XXXX in XXXX 2016 which led to his detention and exile. The claimant did not provide originals of XXXX XXXX XXXX and the copies were not reliable evidence. The photocopies of XXXX XXXX were XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX not centered properly.11 There was no XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimant testified that there were XXXX for XXXX XXXX but there was no indication XXXX XXXX XXXX on these photocopies. The claimant testified that he could not get any XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX because all XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX were destroyed. He testified that Mr. XXXX had sent him the copy not the original XXXX XXXX XXXX and Mr. XXXX was no longer available to help the claimant. I do not find the claimant's explanation about XXXX XXXX XXXX, original XXXX XXXX reasonable. I expect that a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for 6 years to be able to provide more than a photocopy XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I put no weight on a photocopy of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The onus to provide reliable and trustworthy evidence lies on the claimant and he did not discharge this onus by providing photocopies of an XXXX.\n[20] Furthermore, the claimant testified that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX he attended. When asked if he could provide a copy of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, he was unable to do so. I expect that the claimant or his family may have kept a copy of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, especially since it was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I find on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant was not a XXXX and did not XXXX XXXX XXXX in Azerbaijan.\nXXXX XXXX not Reliable\n[21] The claimant provided a card to indicate that he worked at XXXX XXXX 12. The card has XXXX on one side in English. The claimant testified that the card was renewed every three years. He also testified that the card was in his wallet and therefore not taken by the police when they raided his house, which does not explain why he still had it in his wallet after he was detained and tortured. This card does not have any security features and there is no address of XXXX XXXX on this card. I put little weight on this card to corroborate the claimant is a XXXX or XXXX XXXX XXXX existed.\nThe Timelines for Work as a XXXX not Credible\n[22] The claimant's passport indicates that he travelled extensively outside of Azerbaijan 13. The claimant first testified that he was on leave while in Turkey for one month for vacation from the XXXX in 2013. However; when it was pointed out to him that he was in Turkey for 4 months, he said he was on leave without pay from the XXXX and was working with a friend as a XXXX in a resort. He testified that he was learning XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which contradicts his previous evidence that he was a volunteer XXXX and learning how to be a XXXX with XXXX XXXX in 2009 and 2010. The claimant then changed his oral testimony that while he was in Turkey in 2013 he was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to his manager. When asked how he was sending XXXX to his manager since XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, he testified that he emailed XXXX to his manager. When asked why he could not provide emails demonstrating that he was corresponding to XXXX XXXX from Turkey, the claimant testified, he forgot his password to the email account which was a Russian email address. He also testified that he has a Gmail address currently, but he does not use this email address to contact other people but he only used it to get the letter from Mr. XXXX; however, he now has also lost contact with Mr. XXXX. I draw a negative credibility inference from the claimant's incoherent and improbable testimony.\n[23] The claimant's testimony about his work in 2013, whether he was in Azerbaijan or Turkey, was inconsistent. The claimant also indicated in his Port of Entry notes,14 which were filled out with the help of his counsel, that from XXXX 2013 until XXXX 2013 he was unemployed\/travelling\/ XXXX in Turkey as a visitor. This contradicts the claimant's oral testimony that he was XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX from Turkey. I draw a negative credibility inference from the inconsistent evidence of the claimant and find on a balance of probabilities that he was not working as a XXXX from 2010 to 2016 and specifically not in 2013.\nXXXX Corroborating Evidence not Reliable\n[24] I asked the claimant whether he had any of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX \"XXXX\" when he was volunteering with XXXX XXXX as a university student. The claimant testified that he did not XXXX XXXX XXXX to prove he XXXX XXXX and that he had XXXX XXXX XXXX. At the second sitting of the hearing the claimant provided several copies of photos printed from the internet15. The photos showed an incident of shooting in Azerbaijan in 2009. The claimant testified that he used Google search engine to search for these photos and that they were printed from the internet. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimant also testified that anyone could Google the shooting at the State Oil Academy in 2009 and the same photos would be available. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. In fact, he testified that he XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which contradicts his earlier evidence that he was a volunteer XXXX in 2009 and did not get paid. He also testified that XXXX pretended that they XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I do not find this to be reasonable for several reasons. Firstly, I put no weight on photos printed from the internet XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Secondly, he testified that in 2013 he was learning XXXX in Turkey from his friend, which contradicts his previous statement. The claimant was asked whether he XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and he testified that they were XXXX XXXX XXXX but when he XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I do not find the claimant's explanation reasonable. The claimant failed to provide any evidence that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in 2009 and did not provide any explanation why another XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimant was also unable to provide any XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on his Facebook account or anywhere else XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[25] The claimant was asked questions about how he was able XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX terrorist attack XXXX XXXX XXXX. He testified he heard about the incident on the radio XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Azerbaijan State Oil Academy XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. According to the claimant's testimony he does XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. It was not clear how the claimant could hear about the terrorist attack on the radio XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX State Oil Academy XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimant testified that the police was trying to stop people from getting close to the scene of the crime, but was unable to explain how he could, as a volunteer \"XXXX\", XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimant's testimony changed over the course of the hearing. He was vague and evasive when asked for concrete proof of being a XXXX. I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant did XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I find that the claimant fabricated the story of being a volunteer and or paid XXXX to bolster his claim.\nClaimant's Facebook Account\n[26] The claimant testified at the first sitting that he used to be active on Facebook until 2016, but that he had never made any kind of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. However, he then testified that he has a Facebook account presently, but it is in his son's name. The claimant provided, at the second sitting, a print out of his Facebook account. 16 The posts on the account are in Azari and Russian. The comments on the timeline of the Facebook page are other people's comments on the political situations and the claimant does not have any political postings originating from him. The copy of the claimant's Facebook page indicates that he has shared some other people's comments and photos on his timeline. The claimant is not a blogger and he has not posted any of his own photos on Facebook. I expect a XXXX to have at least a few political or XXXX XXXX XXXX on his Facebook page. He testified that he reads XXXX which is a blog created by XXXX XXXX on line. It appears that when the XXXX Blog shares some articles; that sharing of the blogs' articles may appear on the claimant's Facebook page timeline. I do not find the claimant's Facebook activities indicate he is a XXXX, a blogger, or XXXX active.\nCorroborating Letters from the Claimant's Sister, Wife, Friends and Other Relatives are not Persuasive\n[27] The claimant provided several supporting letters from family and friends with regards to his claim.17 As far as the claimant's sister's letter18 is concerned, I put little weight on this letter since she was in Canada during the alleged problems of the claimant. The claimant's sister has been in Canada for 8 years and her corroboration of the claimant's alleged problems is not probative since she was not in Azerbaijan when the alleged incidents occurred. Further, since the claimant's own testimony is not credible, I put little weight on the claimant's aunt, uncle, wife and friend's letters as corroborating the alleged persecution of the claimant as a XXXX.\nDr. XXXX's Report\n[28] The claimant provided a report from Doctor XXXX, who is a psychologist, dated XXXX XXXX, 201719. Dr. XXXX met for an hour with the claimant and the report purports that the claimant has XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX severity and XXXX XXXX. I find the claimant may be depressed or anxious; however, I assign no weight to this document as persuasive evidence of this claimant's allegations of persecution. I note that while the psychologist interviewed the claimant for one hour, the doctor's report does not establish satisfactorily or persuasively that the claimant's experiences are a result of what he is alleging in respect of his refugee claim. Further, the doctor's only clinical assessment, based on his professional opinion, is that the claimant suffers from symptoms of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX. This is not persuasive evidence for this panel that the psychologist is in any position to state that the claimant is credible or that he has been persecuted.\n[29] As stated in Rokni20,a psychiatric report submitted as evidence \"cannot possibly serve as a cure-all for any and all deficiencies in a claimant's testimony\". The court reiterated its position in Danailov 21, with respect to the assessment of a physician's evidence and the question of the assessment of credibility. It was stated \"that opinion evidence is only as valid as the truth of the facts on which it is based\". I find that, although the claimant may be XXXX or XXXX XXXX for leaving his family behind this may or may not be related to the causes described by the claimant in his evidence. Accordingly, I give the psychological report no weight.\nMedical Note\n[30] The claimant provided a medical note from a XXXX hospital22. He alleges that he was injured during detention. The claimant could not remember the name of the doctor who examined him. When asked why there is no date on the medical note to indicate when it was issued, the claimant was silent. The claimant also testified that he asked for the medical note so that he could go to the doctor where he lived to get further treatment. However; he did not go to the doctor, instead he started to think about ways to leave the country, such as meeting with an agent and going for an interview at the USA consulate. The claimant's testimony changed to having a \"XXXX\" XXXX XXXX XXXX and when prompted he testified that he had a XXXX. I do not find the claimant's oral testimony to be credible about his alleged injuries and put little weight on the medical note as an indication that the claimant was detained and injured in Azerbaijan.\nCourt Document\n[31] At the second sitting of the hearing, the claimant provided23 a letter from Azerbaijan dated XXXX XXXX, 2017, which he testified is a court document. He testified his uncle sent this letter to him from Azerbaijan. The original of this letter was examined at the hearing. The letter is printed from a black and white printer with no court stamp or seals. The claimant testified that he knows nothing about this court document. The translation of the letter in English indicates that the authorities want to expropriate the claimant's car. The claimant does not own a car. The claimant insisted at the hearing that the letter indicates that he owes money. The claimant also alleges he was forced to leave Azerbaijan by the authorities because he signed an agreement that he must leave Azerbaijan while in detention; therefore I am not persuaded that he is wanted for a court proceeding whether it is about a car or a debt or false charges. In any event I do not find this document persuasive that the claimant is at risk of persecution if he is to return to Azerbaijan and put little weight on it as indicating that claimant is wanted by the authorities presently.\nSubjective Fear\n[32] Although delay is not determinative of a claim, the actions of the claimant in this claim affect his credibility negatively. The claimant testified that he was born in Georgia, his parents were born in Georgia, he married a Georgian woman, his youngest son was born in Georgia, he has family living in Georgia, and his wife's family live in Georgia. Presently his wife and children reside in Georgia. I find the claimant's failure to leave for Georgia when he feared for his life to diminish his credibility. There is nothing indicating that the authorities told him he must leave for the USA or Canada, only that he must leave Azerbaijan in three months. The claimant further alleges that the police came to his home to remind his family that the claimant had to leave Azerbaijan. It was not clear why the claimant did not leave for Georgia when the authorities came and asked him to leave Azerbaijan and he paid an agent to get a USA visa.\n[33] The claimant testified at the hearing that Georgia is not safe for him because it is close to Azerbaijan and they could extradite him from Georgia. The documentary evidence indicates that there have been some Azaris forcibly returned to Azerbaijan from Georgia, but this would not be the scenario for the claimant since he alleges that the authorities told him he must leave Azerbaijan. As stated previously, there is nothing to indicate that the Azari authorities only wanted him to leave for the USA or Canada within three months.\n[34] The claimant's narrative indicates that as a XXXX he was harassed and persecuted long before 201624; however, in 2015 when he was in midst of his XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX he went to Lithuania as a tourist. The claimant testified that in 2015 he did not have any big problems based on his XXXX XXXX. At the same time he testified that the \"they had problems with the police and authorities\". The claimant's testimony was vague and he could not clarify what kind of problems he had prior to 2016. I expect that if the claimant was XXXX XXXX in 2015 as an XXXX XXXX he would have had problems in 2015. The claimant also travelled to Georgia many times to visit his family. I find the multiple exists of the claimant from Azerbaijan while he was being harassed and persecuted by the authorities to diminish his credibility.\n[35] The claimant obtained a visa for the USA in XXXX 2016 and left Azerbaijan in XXXX 2016 for the USA. The claimant stayed for XXXX days in the USA prior to coming to Canada. The claimant testified that since his sister lived in Canada he chose to come to come to Canada and not ask for asylum in the USA. I do not find that to be a reasonable explanation since the claimant alleges that he is a XXXX who was forced to leave Azerbaijan because he signed an agreement while in detention. I find that his credibility is diminished since he did not ask for refugee protection at the earliest opportunity which can indicate that the claimant was \"asylum shopping\".\n[36] The central issue to be assessed in this case is whether the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution in his country of nationality by reason of one of the Convention grounds. In making this determination, the panel must assess whether the claimant has established that, on a balance of probabilities, he has a subjective fear and that this subjective fear, when objectively assessed in the context of country conditions, is one that is well-founded. Based on the foregoing analysis, I find that the claimant could not provide credible evidence that he was targeted by the Azerbaijani government because he was a XXXX or his perceived political opinion. Therefore, there is not a reasonable chance or a serious risk of persecution if he is to return to Azerbaijan presently.\n[37] Since I find that the core elements of the claim lack credibility, I find that, more likely than not,25 the claimant will not face serious harm, should he return to Azerbaijan. Therefore, I conclude that the claimant is not a person in need of protection pursuant to sections 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b) of the IRPA, as there is no risk to life, or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture upon returning to Azerbaijan.\nCONCLUSION\n[38] Based on the above analysis, the panel determines that the claimant is not a Convention refugee and not a person in need of protection in accordance with sections 96, 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b) of the IRPA. Accordingly the panel rejects the claim.\n(signed)\n\"Sudabeh Mashkuri\"\nSudabeh Mashkuri\nOctober 3, 2017\nDate\n1 As enacted by S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibit 2, Basis of Claim Form (BOC); amended BOC Exhibit 7.\n3 Exhibit 1, copy of the claimant's seized passport.\n4 Exhibit 6\n5 Exhibit 6, Certificate from Azerbaijan XXXX XXXX\n6 Ibid\n7 Exhibit 14, Memo from Research Directorate Dated XXXX XXXX, 2017\n8 Ibid\n9 Ibid\n10 Exhibit 6, pages 9-11\n11 Ibid\n12 Exhibit 6, Employment Card\n13 Exhibits 1 and 6\n14 Exhibit 1\n15 Exhibit 16\n16 Exhibit 13\n17 Exhibits 6,8,10\n18 Exhibit 6\n19 Exhibit 6, report from Dr. XXXX, psychologist dated XXXX XXXX, 2017\n20 Rokni, Mohamed Mehdi v.

You are a citizen of Croatia and Bosnia Herzegovina. You claim refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \"Act\")1 against both countries.\nI have considered your testimony and the other evidence in the case and I am ready to render my decision orally. A written form of the reasons will be provided to you. The written reasons will be a transcript of what I am saying now. The written form may be edited for general readability and references to the applicable case law and to the documentary evidence may also be included. I have considered the Chairpersons Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation Gender Identity and Expression.2\nI will provide a brief overview of your claim as described in your personal information form3 and your testimony. You were born in XXXX in the former Yugoslavia. XXXX is now in Croatia. Your mother is Croatian and Roman Catholic and your father is a Muslim Bosniak. You were born out of wedlock and you were raised by your mother's family. When you were a young child you and your mother moved to XXXX, her hometown. XXXXis now in Bosnia Herzegovina.\nYou encountered discrimination and harassment in XXXX which was predominantyly Croatian, by reason of your mixed ethnicity. You had your father's surname of XXXX. Your name brought you negative attention. Your biological father was a XXXX during the civil war and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX including the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Also, your father is somehow related to XXXX XXXX, a political figure in Bosnia Herzegovina.\nYou realized that you were different in elementary school as you were attracted to boys. You started going to XXXX on the weekends to go to gay bars. You were in a relationship with a man called XXXX from 1992 to 1997 until he disappeared.\nOver the next 15 years you were in a number of brief relationships with five different men which lasted about one month each in Croatia. As an adult you lived in Croatia for varying periods of time while you completed XXXX and other jobs. The rest of the time you lived in XXXX in your grandparents' home.\nYou encountered discrimination, harassment and violence in Croatia by reason of your sexual orientation. You faced difficulty securing permanent employment by reason of your sexual orientation and mixed ethnicity. You attended the pride parade in Split in 2011; however, you encountered violence by people who threw rocks at you. You were also assaulted on three occasions in XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. You reported some of these incidents to the police but they did not assist you and told you that you deserved to be beaten. In XXXX you had to run away from homophobic persons who wanted to physically assault you on about 15 occasions.\nYou have also testified today that you fear various political figures in Croatia and the mafia and their associates. You feel that they know who you are because of your perceived ties to your dad who was XXXX XXXX during the war and XXXX XXXX, a political figure.\nYou departed from Croatia on XXXX XXXX, 2012 and arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2012. You made a refugee claim at the port of entry upon your arrival.\nI'm sorry to tell you that my decision is a negative one. I find that that you are neither a Convention refugee, nor a person in need of protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act because you have not provided clear and convincing evidence that the state is unwilling and unable to protect you in Croatia.\nI find that you have established your identity as a citizen of Croatia and Bosnia Herzegovina through your testimony and identity documents. You have submitted a Croatian passport, a Croatian National ID card, a Croatian birth certificate and a Bosnia Herzegovina national identity card and a Bosnia Herzegovina drivers licence.4\nI will turn to my consideration of your credibility. The Federal Court of Appeal stated in Maldonado that when a claimant swears that certain facts are true this creates a presumption that they are true unless there is a valid reason to doubt the truthfulness.5 Overall, I have found you to be a credible witness and, therefore, believe what you have alleged in support of your claim. You testified in a straightforward manner and there were no material inconsistencies in your testimony or contradictions between your testimony and the other evidence before me. You provided spontaneous and detailed testimony about your relationship with your partner XXXX in Croatia and your other relationships with gay men in Croatia and Canada.\nYou provided extensive accounts of your experiences as a gay man in Croatia and Canada. You have provided some documentary evidence of your sexual orientation. You provide a letter from an LGBTI organization called XXXX in Toronto which provides details of your regular involvement in its support groups, programs and volunteer work since your arrival in Canada in XXXX 2012. You have also provided photos of your participation at pride parades in Toronto.6\nI find on a balance of probabilities that you are a gay man. I also accept that you are of mixed ethnicity, being half Croatian and Bosniak.\nThe determinative issue in your claim is whether state protection is available to you in Croatia. Except in situations where the state is in a state of complete breakdown, states must be presumed capable of protecting their citizens. This presumption can be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence of the state's inability to protect.7 No state can guarantee perfect protection. Evidence that efforts to protect are not always successful does not rebut the presumption.\nThe onus is on the claimant to establish that protection is inadequate. The claimant must approach his or her state for protection if state protection might reasonably be forthcoming. The more democratic the state's institutions, the more the claimant must have done to exhaust all the courses of action available to him or her. There is a heavy burden to exhaust all recourses in a democratic country.\nIn the present case there is a presumption that Croatia is capable of protecting its citizens. Croatia is not in a state of complete breakdown. Croatia is a constitutional parliamentary democracy. A reference can be found at the US Department of State Report, NDP item 2.1.8 There is not clear and convincing evidence that the Croatian Government is unwilling or unable to provide state protection to you. The objective documents confirm that Croatia has a functioning police force and provides adequate protection to its citizens.\nThe US DOS Report, NDP item 2.1 states that \"[t]he National Police under the control of the Ministry of the Interior, have primary responsibility for domestic security.\"\nIt further states that \"[c]ivilian authorities maintained effective control over police, the armed forces and the intelligence services. The government had effective mechanisms to investigate and punish abuse and corruption.\" [...] There were no reports of impunity involving the security forces during the year. The law also provides for an \"independent judiciary and the government generally respected judicial independence.\"9\nThe CIA World Facts Book, NDP item 1.3 states that Croatia joined the European Union in July 2013.10\nI have considered whether state protection is available to you, given that you are a gay man who is of mixed ethnicity. There is little information about the treatment of persons of mixed ethnicity, in particular, persons who are Croatian and Bosnian. There is a Response to Information Request, NDP item 13.5, that discusses mixed marriages and it states that mixed marriages are rare in Croatia. It states that information on the treatment of Bosnian minorities in Croatia was scarce among sources consulted by the Research Directorate.11\nOne source notes that Bosnians are often discriminated against due to their religion, Islam; however,12 another source, the Vienna Review, published an article about racism against Roma and Muslim people in Croatia while trying to rent housing.13 The article states that Bosniaks and Muslims are generally well integrated as they do not differ visually or socially. The article also found that both Roma and Muslims encountered discrimination when trying to rent housing.\nWhile there is some level of discrimination against Bosnians, I do not find that the documentary evidence indicates that you would not receive state protection by reason of your mixed ethnicity.\nHomophobia is deeply embedded in Croatian society according to NDP item 6.2 which is a Research Information Request on the treatment of sexual minorities in Croatia.14 There are shortcomings in the Croatian Government's protection of sexual minorities; however, I find that it is overall adequate.\nThe US DOS Report, NDP item 2.1 states that \"[t]he law prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. NGOs indicated police were responsive to reported violations against LGBI persons.\" There is some criticism that the police and judges didn't always handle cases of discrimination in a \"consistent manner\". This report also states that the \"[a]uthorities opened 20 investigations of public incitement to violence and hatred in response to online bullying and harassment of LGBTI persons in the first three months of the year\" and \"NGOs also noted ambiguity in the Penal Code regarding penalties for violent behavior towards such individuals.\"15\nWhile there are some inconsistencies with which the state responds to violations of LGBTI persons, I find that the state's response to generally be operationally effective. The NDP item 6.2 which is a Response to Information Request states that the Antidiscrimination Act prohibits discrimination on 18 grounds, including sexual orientation.16\nThe Criminal Code defines hate crimes as a \"crime perpetrated on the basis of a personal characteristic\" and sexual orientation has been mentioned on the list of such characteristics. A law on life partnership adopted in July 2014 granted equal rights to same sex partnerships in all matters except adoption.17\nI do recognize that this is still a live issue in Croatia. As you mentioned, there is a conservative, Catholic group called, In the Name of the Family that ran a successful campaign for a referendum over the constitutional definition of marriage. It gathered enough signatures for a referendum aimed at entrenching the definition of marriage as \"a union between a man and a woman in the constitution\". The referendum was passed with 66 percent approval rate.18 There is no information before me about whether the amendment has been enacted. While this appears to be a step backwards, this development in and of itself, does not indicate that state protection is inadequate in Croatia.\nZagreb Pride stated that the attitude of Croatian authorities towards the LGBT community has improved between 2011 and 2015; provided as examples, \"the participation of five government ministers in the 2012 Split Pride March and the 2012 invitation of the LGBT community to be a part of the drafting of same sex partnership legislation.\"19\nCroatian authorities regularly report hate crime data to the OSCE's office for democratic institutions and human rights. According to Zagreb Pride, \"the police regularly participate in LGBT sensitization training sessions; however, she also noted that the police generally lack other types of training such as legal training since the adoption of anti-discrimination legislation.\"\nThe same source described the police protection in Zagreb \"with respect to hate crimes 'as satisfactory' whereas she noted that in other regions, particularly, Dalmatia, research by the organization \"[...] 'found cases of secondary victimization even hostility' by the police towards LGBT people who report hate crimes.\"20\nThere is certainly some criticism of the implementation and the enforcement of the laws protecting LGBTI persons. Regarding discrimination complaints, the representative of Zagreb Pride stated that Zagreb Prides:\n'have been witnessing a lack of efforts by the police who conduct all necessary measures in procedures with antidiscrimination complaints (mostly harassment) which led to some of our clients feeling that it is pointless to report the complaints directly to the police.'\nThe UN Human Rights Committee expressed concern about the \"lack of effective investigation and prosecution of acts of violence against LGBTI people.\" 21\nI recognize that there are problems in the implementation of protection of LGBTI persons on certain occasions in Croatian and there is a perception by some that the police are sometimes unwilling to help victims of discrimination; however, I find that there is insufficient credible evidence to show that there is a broader pattern of the Croatian police and government's inability and unwillingness to protect sexual minorities.\nI further note that gay pride parades in Split and Zagreb were held without violence in 2013. They were also held peacefully in both cities in 2014. Sources mention that in 2014 a pride parade took place for the first time in the City of Osijek. According to sources there were between 300 and 400 participants in Osijek's pride. ILGA Europe reports that the police had cooperated fully during preparations for the Osijek's pride. According to Croatia\nWeek, in English language Croatian News Portal around 100 police officers and more private security guards kept an eye on proceedings with no major incident reported.22\nI note that another source called the Annual Review of Human Rights situation of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Intersex People, NDP item 6.1, states that:\nNGO Zagreb Pride conducted training on a range of issues including LGBTIQ terminology, human rights, hate crime and support for victims; 142 police officer, 29 state attorneys, criminal and magistrate judges and 15 victim and witness support staff were trained throughout the year.23\nThe police in Croatia are generally responsive to violence against sexual minorities and have provided protection at large events such as pride. There are some shortcomings in the response and the level of protection provided by the state is not necessarily perfect but I find that it rises to the level of being adequate.\nYou have, in your testimony you said that you reported one incident to the police. You encountered violence at the 2011 pride parade and you testified that you went to the police station where the police were not responsive to your complaint at all.\nFollowing other physical attacks earlier in XXXX, 2002 or 2003 and another attack ten years earlier ago, you did not go to the police. You read news articles about an incident where the police attacked the gay man and you believed that it would be futile to approach the police for protection.\nThe Federal Court has held that local failures to provide effective policing do not amount to a lack of state protection unless they are a part of a broader pattern of a state's inability or refusal to provide protection.24 I also note that these instances occurred quite some time ago. While they may have reflected the situation in the early 2000s, a fair amount of time has passed since then. There have been positive developments in Croatia's protection of gay people referenced by the NGOs and other organizations and individuals, as I mentioned, in the past number of years.\nWhile I do not question the veracity of your experiences with the police in Croatia, I find that the more recent objective documents portray a government that has made serious\nefforts to protect LGBTI persons and the implementation of this framework, while not perfect, is adequate.\nYou have also alleged a fear of powerful political figures in Croatia. A number of them originate from XXXX, your hometown and they are now in Croatia or have associates in Croatia. You fear veterans of the war and ultranationalists who are powerful who may want to harm you by reason of your perceived relationship to your father's side of the family in Bosnia Herzegovina. You believe that certain persons have been following or watching you in Croatia and they are connected to these powerful political figures.\nYou testified that at various times in Croatia, random strangers have approached you and they seem to know your name and indicated that they knew who you are and that you cannot hide from them. While these events may have occurred, the harm you have described from these people does not rise to the level of persecution, it is unknown who these people are and why they have approached you. While it is irritating and disturbing to have strangers approach you in this manner, I find that this is harassment rather than persecution. The level of harm is not serious enough to constitute persecution.\nFurthermore, there's no evidence that any of these people you fear have any connection or ability to influence the Croatian police's ability to protect you.\nUnder section 96, a claim must be established against each country of nationality. As I find you are neither a Convention refugee, nor a person in need of protection in Croatia, I am not considering your claim against Bosnia Herzegovina.\nFor the foregoing reasons, I find that you are neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nDECISION CONCLUDED\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson's Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression Effective date: May 1, 2017.\n3 Exhibit 2.\n4 Exhibit 1.\n5 Maldonado v.

Further, the panel finds that they are not persons in need of protection as their removal to Hungary would not subject them personally to a risk to life, to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or to a danger of torture.\n[4] The panel finds the claimants to have established their identities as nationals of Hungary based on photocopies of their national identity documents contained in the Minister's information4 on the Board's file.\nALLEGATIONS\n[5] The principal claimant's experiences are set out in the narrative portion of his Personal Information Form (PIF) and in the amended narrative. The other claimants rely on the experiences set out in the principal claimant's PIF. Summarily, the principal claimant and his family lived in XXXX, Hungary. The principal claimant was attacked several times by \"anti-Roma paramilitaries\". The principal claimant recounted incidents in XXXX 2007, when he was hospitalized, as well as in XXXX and XXXX 2008. He referenced two incidents that prompted him to go to the police. The first was in 2010 after \"paramilitaries\" threw rocks at a window of his mother's house where the principal claimant and his family were also living. He went to the police to report this incident but the police did not take a report from him because the principal claimant could not give them the license plate number of the car that the people were in. Shortly after, someone set off a Molotov cocktail near the house of his mother's neighbour. The principal claimant said that neighbour went to court to get the police to provide a letter to collect insurance, but he did not know the outcome of that case. The family subsequently obtained and moved into a subsidized apartment.\n[6] The second occasion when the principal claimant interacted with the police was after an assault on him by paramilitaries in XXXX 2011, which required XXXX XXXX hospitalization for a concussion. On that occasion, the police came to the hospital to speak with the principal claimant about this assault. However, because of the principal claimant's condition, the police asked him to come to the police station to file a report once he was out of the hospital. When the principal claimant went to the police station, he said the policeman there told him the police could not take his complaint because it was too late. He said he signed something but he did not understand what he was signing.\n[7] The principal claimant said he felt vulnerable in XXXX because he was living in a subsidized unit and the city was forcing Roma to leave and resettle in XXXX, a village about XXXX kilometres east of XXXX. Roma-vacated units in XXXX were then being given to ethnic Hungarians. In XXXX 2011, two paramilitaries pulled up to the principal claimant in a car as he was walking the minor claimants home from school and they beat the principal claimant with wooden poles and threatened to kill him and his family if they did not leave Hungary. The principal claimant said he recognized them as the same men who had attacked him a month earlier. The principal claimant said his family decided they had to leave Hungary.\n[8] The principal claimant also wrote in his narrative that the only job he could get was a menial job in a XXXX company but the factory closed in 2009 and he could not find other work because of his ethnicity. The only work he could get was menial work provided by the city for 90 days a year, which enabled him to qualify for social assistance. He was paid less than ethnic Hungarians and he was never offered full-time work. More incidents occurred in 2010 and the principal claimant's wife was also threatened by paramilitaries in downtown XXXX and they pulled her hair. The principal claimant ended his narrative with references to the deteriorating condition for Roma in Hungary, the rise of the Jobbik Party and concerns with inequality in \"education, freedom and access to facilities, racial\/ethnic slurs and beatings, housing, health care, and law enforcement, justice and protection.\"\nISSUES\n[9] While credibility is an issue in all refugee claims, the central issues in this case are whether the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution in Hungary and whether state protection is available to them in Hungary.\nANALYSIS\nIs what the claimants faced discrimination or does it amount to persecution?\n[10] The principal claimant explained that he and his family experienced discrimination in XXXX; he was assaulted by \"paramilitaries\"; and the female claimant was threatened and had her hair pulled by similar types of people. While persecution is not defined in the Convention, persecution involves harm that is serious, threatens a person's fundamental human rights, and is generally repetitive or persistent. The panel finds that these conditions are evident in the present claim and on a balance of probabilities, what the principal claimant faced in the mid-2000s until his departure for Canada, amounts to persecution when considered cumulatively (that is, general discrimination combined with several assaults by unknown assailants). The panel finds the female claimant's generally-referenced experiences to constitute discrimination. The narratives of both claimants do not recount discriminatory treatment of their XXXX although the panel must consider what all four of these claimants might face were they to return to Hungary.\nResidency in XXXX\n[11] The principal claimant said he felt vulnerable in XXXX in his subsidized apartment because the city was forcing Roma to leave and resettle in XXXX, a village about 10 kilometres east of XXXX. Roma-vacated units in XXXX were then being given to ethnic Hungarians. The panel has no information before it to corroborate this forced resettlement event in the 2009-2010 period; in fact, all the objective documentary evidence before the panel is silent on this incident. In contrast, the only example of the XXXX city council's attempt to evict Roma from its 'low comfort' neighbourhoods (generally, poor and mostly-Roma occupied neighbourhoods, the 'numbered streets' or 'gypsy row') contained in the documentary evidence is the well-publicized incident in the spring and summer of 20145, three years after the claimants had already left XXXX. In the 2014 case, the local city council of XXXX adopted a housing measure on XXXX XXXX, which would effectively permit the city's eviction of residents of the aforementioned neighborhoods (where approximately 3,000 persons lived, most of Romani origin) by 2018 with the official aim of improving public safety and \"the social situation of the inhabitants.\"6 The measure offered tenants of the affected municipality-owned apartments' two million Hungarian forints (HUF 2million or approximately $9,500 CAD) as compensation on the condition they use the money to purchase a residence or property outside city limits.7 In response, the nearby town of XXXX and eight other neighboring municipalities adopted decrees to exclude persons from local social services who settle in their localities using financial aid issued by another local government.8 On XXXX XXXX, 2015, the Hungarian Supreme Court, or Curia, determined that the relevant provision of the decree discriminated against persons with social needs in respect of housing benefits, allowances, and tenancy in municipality-owned apartments, hindering the free use of their compensation, and annulled the town's edict.9 On XXXX XXXX, 2015, Hungary's Equal Treatment Authority (ETA) established that the XXXX municipality had subjected residents of a segregated area to the threat of homelessness or having to move to other segregated areas and, by doing so, discriminated against them because of their social status, financial situation, and Romani origin.10 The ETA fined the municipality HUF 500,000 and ordered it to cease discrimination.11 On XXXX XXXX, 2015, the Curia also annulled the XXXX municipality decree on the grounds of discrimination, and the other eight municipalities withdrew their similar decrees by the end of the year.12\n[12] These claimants were never evicted from their apartment or forced to resettle elsewhere. The panel finds no basis for the principal claimant feeling vulnerable to eviction or forced resettlement, especially since there is no objective evidence to corroborate the allegation and three years before the only documented incident to evict the city's poorest residents ever occurred. Further, it was the action of XXXX city council in 2014 that drew international attention and condemnation and it also required the city to enact a decree to substantiate its intention to resettle residents. No such information or action is documented prior to this time.\n[13] As stated, the principal claimant told the panel that he and his family had obtained a state-subsidized apartment during their residency in XXXX. They were never evicted or resettled; the principal claimant chose to leave the country instead. The panel acknowledges that, generally, Roma live in poverty and many cannot afford to purchase property. Many live in subsidized housing like these claimants did and many live in Roma settlements within municipalities. The panel does not find these claimants were discriminated against when it came to their housing. The panel does not find their housing situation to be discriminatory let alone persecutory. Further, these claimants failed to establish satisfactorily for this panel that their fundamental rights to housing were ever violated. By extension, the claimants never testified to being homeless and in fact they were living in a city or state-subsidized apartment at the time they chose to leave Hungary. Further, in analyzing the information surrounding the 2014 XXXX decree, even if the claimants had been in that city at that time, which they were not, the panel finds the city's action to compensate people to move from the 'low comfort' numbered street areas of XXXX does not rise to the level of persecution for these claimants. Moreover, there is no persuasive reason to show why the claimants would be required to settle in, or near XXXX, upon return to Hungary. To re-emphasize, these claimants have failed to demonstrate that their fundamental rights to housing in Hungary have been violated or impacted in any way and the panel does not have any persuasive evidence that XXXX was forcibly evicting and resettling Roma at the time the principal claimant alleged.\nEmployment\nThe principal claimant is the only member of this family who alleges that he experienced discrimination in obtaining work. However, in the circumstances of this case, the panel finds that the discrimination experienced is not serious because the principal claimant was able to support his family until 2009 through full-time employment and thereafter by participating in government-sponsored public works programs at various times through the years thereafter. In reaching this conclusion, the panel was guided by the decision of Horvath v. Canada, wherein the Court confirmed that:Bri...to assess whether basic human rights are threatened in a fundamental way, a board must analyze the ability to earn a livelihood in an individual's specific circumstances, and recognized the evidence of unemployment of Roma in Hungary, at paragraphs 38 - 43, 58 - 60.13\n[14] The principal claimant testified that he worked in a factory slaughtering XXXX; a menial job that most people would not like. He did not lose his job because of his ethnicity, however; he lost his job like everyone else who worked there else because the factory closed in 2009. The high unemployment in XXXX and the impact of the 2008-2009 global recession on Hungary and on the northeast of Hungary in particular are well-documented. Thereafter, despite complaining that he could not obtain work because of his ethnicity, the principal claimant participated in government-sponsored public works program that guaranteed him and his family ongoing social assistance and health care benefits as long as he worked steadily for 90 days per year. The panel notes that the principal claimant was able to find part-time temporary employment and earn enough money to support his family.\n[15] The Federal Court of Appeal in the case of Sagharichi14 stated:\nIt is true that the dividing line between persecution and discrimination or harassment is difficult to establish, the more so since, in refugee law context, it has been found that discrimination may very well be seen as amounting to persecution. It is true also that the identification of persecution behind incidents of discrimination or harassment is not purely a question of fact but a mixed question of law and fact, legal concepts being involved.\n[16] Appropriately, it is the purview of this adjudicative panel to make its findings on the matter of discrimination versus persecution in a practical and factual context by undertaking a careful analysis of the evidence before it as well as by balancing the various elements contained in that evidence and the particular circumstances of these claimants. Therefore, in assessing the totality of the evidence in this case, the panel finds that what these Appellants experienced and fear upon return to Hungary is discrimination. The undisputed evidence in this case establishes, on a balance of probabilities that the principal claimant was gainfully employed until 2009 and then he participated in government-sponsored work programs. His wife, the female claimant, apparently elected to stay at home to raise the couple's two XXXX. Moreover, by virtue of their ages, these minor claimants have no employment history in Hungary; rather, they are teenagers now and they are only several school grades away respectively from graduating from high school. While Roma face more difficulty in obtaining steady employment than ethnic Hungarians and they experience levels of unemployment far greater than ethnic Hungarians do, some Roma nevertheless do find jobs and do enjoy full employment in spite of their ethnicity.\n[17] To address the matter of Roma exclusion and the disadvantages Roma experience generally, the Government of Hungary undertook a comprehensive National Social Inclusion Strategy (2011-2020) to address the issues of poverty, unemployment and segregation that have characterized the Roma experience in Hungary:\nThat is why the adoption of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 was one of the priority areas for the Hungarian Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2011. The Framework provides a unique opportunity to make a real difference in the lives of Roma people throughout Europe and requested member states to adopt before the end of 2011 their National Roma Integration Strategies which determine the medium-term challenges and targets of the social and labour market integration of the Roma, as well as the necessary interventions, over a period of 10 years. On 30 November 2011 Hungary sent its National Social Inclusion Strategy 2011-2020 (NSIS) as the first one to the European Commission. The Strategy is complex: it lays down an immediate action plan, and also assigns long term tasks. In addition, it systemizes all those areas and actors which deal with inclusion policies such as state measures, specified programmes, institutions and other actors. The aim of the Strategy and its Action Plan for the period of 2012- 2014 is to improve the social and living conditions of people living in extreme poverty. The two special target groups are the Roma and children. Both documents deal with child well-being, education, employment, health, housing as well as involvement, awareness-raising and fight against discrimination. A framework agreement with the National Roma Self-Government which designates concrete numerical targets for Roma in the most important fields is annexed to the Strategy.15\n[18] Regarding the government's employment-related programs, the documentary evidence shows that:\n387,069 people participated in public employment programs in 2013, with most of them having no more than primary school education, among them an estimated number of 77,000 Roma (20%). 27.6% managed to find a job within 180 days after leaving public employment. Living allowance is given to those participating in EU-funded training programs. In order to facilitate access to the labour market, decentralised employment programmes, EQUAL ESF funded programmes (Social Renewal Operational Programme) and public employment programmes have been launched. Moreover, support programmes were also started with the contribution of the National Public Foundation for Employment. In addition, employment of the Roma is promoted by grants supporting job creation projects, as well as by training subsidies.16\n[19] The panel is aware that discriminatory practices continue to exist at many levels; however, the documentary evidence shows that the conditions in the country are not such that the Roma population is subject to persecution. The Roma are able to obtain education; there are programs to integrate them more actively with oversight not only by the government but by the European Union as well, which holds the Government of Hungary to account through in-country monitoring and oversight; and there are a number of state-developed and state-organized work initiatives to assist Roma in obtaining employment throughout the country. And as referenced, even those who have availed themselves of social assistance are required to participate in employment for no less than a quarter of the calendar year in order to qualify for social assistance. Even the principal claimant referenced these facts, while explaining to the panel and his counsel that it might take a bit longer for him and his family to qualify for social assistance and health care benefits, the principal claimant did not deny that they would receive those benefits. The panel finds that the principal claimant has not established with sufficiently reliable or satisfactory probative evidence that he would not find work upon return to Hungary or that his experiences constitute persecutory treatment.\n[20] The panel notes that the Hungarian constitution and laws prohibit discrimination based on race among other things and the labor code provides for the principles of equal treatment17. While the government failed to enforce these regulations effectively and penalties (in the form of fines) were generally inadequate to deter violations, the principal claimant was employed full-time until 2009 and he participated in government-sponsored public works programs thereafter. The panel also acknowledges that the employment level of the Romani population is much less than that of the non-Romani population and their unemployment rate is much higher, 18 but the panel finds that this is not the claimants' experience. The panel finds the principal claimant's experience with employment in Hungary does not rise to the level of persecution.\nEducation\n[21] The panel finds that the principal claimant and the female claimant were discriminated against in school and this likely contributed to their inability to receive education beyond grade 8. The discriminatory treatment of Roma in the Hungarian education system is well-documented19 with Roma children regularly being held back, segregated in Roma-only classes or worse, forced into special classes for children with mental incapacities and learning disabilities. The panel notes, however, that neither the adult claimants nor their XXXX were forced to attend a segregated school, or in any type of institution that the documentary evidence indicates provides substandard education, which led to a denial of equal learning opportunities for them.\n[22] That being said, in April 2014, the ombudsman (now, the Commissioner for Fundamental Rights) released a comprehensive report on the educational situation in secondary schools with a curriculum designed for children belonging to any of the 13 officially registered national minorities.20 The report concluded that secondary schools featuring curriculum designed for Roma and operated by the National Roma Self-government (ORO) or churches generally provided substandard education to children, which raised the risk of denial of equal opportunities.21 Schools with a majority of Romani students employed a simplified teaching curriculum, lacked well-trained minority language teachers, were generally less well equipped, and were in significantly worse physical condition than those with non-Romani majorities.22 However, as stated above, this is not the type of school that any of these claimants attended in XXXX. Thus, while the panel finds that the two adult claimants likely faced discrimination during their school years, the panel does not find that they received a substandard level of education and other than not going to school beyond grade 8, they made no allegation of having experienced substandard education during their childhood. Further, there are no reported incidents of substandard education for the two minor claimants.\n[23] The documentary evidence also states, however, that the Government of Hungary has made improvements in respect of education for minorities, including the Roma. For example:\nA substantial reform of education, which included \"[r]enewal of pedagogical methods, revision of legislation on education concerning multiple disadvantages and financial incentives,\" began in 2003. [footnotes omitted] According to the Minorities Ombudsman, through the Roma Integration Policy, the Hungarian government provides financial support for schools that have special programs for integration of disadvantaged students, including Roma, non-native, and disabled children. [footnotes omitted] A report of the working group on the UN Universal Periodic Review states that in order to fight segregation and decrease school dropout rates, Hungary implemented several programmes in 1,800 education institutions; the budget assigned for this purpose was about US$ 40 million. [footnotes omitted] Similarly, the Hungarian government indicates that by 2010, those programs \"covered almost 300,000 pupils and reached approximately 13,000 teachers in 1,800 schools.\" [footnotes omitted] Hungary's Social Renewal Operation Programme (SROP) 2007-2013, co-financed by the European Union, includes the Promotion of Implementation of Equal Opportunities Programmes that are designed to improve the situation of children with multiple disadvantages. [footnotes omitted] For example, SROP co-ordinates and supports programs related to the development of methodological documents, teacher training courses, and extracurricular activities that encourage opportunities of informal learning. [footnotes omitted] The Open Society Foundations (OSF), an international organization that works to build democracies with accountable governments and implements initiatives at the local level in its study on Roma integration strategies, points out that the SROP project is a positive policy example.23 [footnotes omitted].\n[24] The government also devised its Sure Start Children Centers for Roma children:\nDuring the 2014-15 school year, the government continued to operate Sure Start Children Centers that provided early intervention programs for disadvantaged, mostly Romani children below kindergarten age and parenting advice for their parents. There were 112 such centers that reached 12,000 children and their parents. The government provided scholarships for socially disadvantaged students, including 5,668 elementary and secondary school children and 858 vocational school students who declared themselves to be Roma. It also provided scholarships for socially disadvantaged higher education students, including 132 Roma. There were 178 \"Tanoda\" afterschool centers around the country providing tutoring and extracurricular activities for disadvantaged, mostly Romani children. During the year the Tanoda network assisted approximately 5,000 disadvantaged students. There were eight Romani special colleges across the country sponsored by the government using EU funds, five of which were operated by Christian denominations and three managed by universities. The special colleges provided housing and tutoring for approximately 235 Romani students enrolled in higher educational institutions.24\n[25] The panel acknowledges that there a long history of segregation of Roma in Hungary's school system. It is a troubling reality not only in Hungary but it is also referenced by the European Union in the other states of Central and Eastern Europe. In Hungary, however, the government is demonstrating that it is taking and steps and implementing actions to provide better opportunities for Roma children. Indeed: Amnesty International25 reported the following last year:\n...a court in Eger issued a first-instance verdict that Roma children in Heves County were unlawfully segregated in schools and classes providing education designed for children with special needs. In June, the European Commission initiated infringement proceedings against Hungary for discrimination of Roma in education.\n[26] The panel finds no persuasive evidence before it to conclude that Roma cannot and do not pursue higher education opportunities in Hungary, if desired. The documentary evidence before this panel does not establish that Roma are being denied outright the opportunity to obtain an education at any level. Set against this background of objective information, both the principal claimant and his wife expressed concerns for the level of education their two teenaged XXXX might receive in Hungary. The principal claimant said the impact of returning to Hungary and not having money or a job would mean he would be unable to send his children to school. The panel reminded the principal claimant that education is free and compulsory in Hungary; the principal claimant meant that he would not have the money to support his children the way he would like to do. The principal claimant told the panel that if he returned to Hungary, his XXXX, who are in nearing completion of their secondary school education in Canada, would be forced to start back in grades XXXX and XXXX in school in Hungary. He said he heard this from other people who returned to Hungary. The principal claimant's wife made the same statement, adding that she would worry that her children would not be able to continue their education in Hungary.\n[27] The panel explained to the claimant that there was no documentary evidence or national\/international reports on hand and specifically nothing in the European human rights monitoring reports before the panel to support the claimants' allegation that their XXXX would be sent back to grades XXXX and XXXX. The female claimant said she heard this from someone back in XXXX. The claimant's counsel asked the female claimant whether there is any redress to deal with education if the school system hold the XXXX back; she responded that there is not and since she never had help with other problems, no one would help her with that problem.\n[28] The panel is also not persuaded by the principal claimant's and the claimant's responses that because someone back in XXXX told them that their XXXX would have to repeat their education essentially all over again, it is a true statement. The panel is unable to find this statement to be anything more than conjecture on the claimants' part. The comment is neither reliable nor verifiable in the context of the objective documentary evidence before the panel. While the issue of segregation of many Roma children is well-documented and many Roma children have not been educated beyond grade 8, there is no evidence before the panel that teenaged Roma youth who return to Hungary from abroad are forced to start their education over again in much lower grades. As stated, not only is the monitoring of the educational system and reforms occurring within the country by the Hungarian Government, the European Union also engages in ongoing monitoring and it gauges the country's performance against laws and legislation and regularly holds Hungary to ongoing reviews as the evidence shows. The panel can reasonably conclude that in the absence of any documents to support the claimants' statements regarding the prospects for their education, the panel finds their comment to be speculative at best. To emphasize, nothing in the evidence supports their opinion that their teenaged XXXX, who speak fluent English and who are being educated in Canadian schools for the past five years, would be returned to grades for 7 and 8-year-old children in the Hungarian school system and no such reports exist for XXXX schools or elsewhere in Hungary. The panel places little weight on the claimants' speculative statements and finds them to be unfounded.\n[29] On the basis of these two elements of the claimants' narratives - employment and education - the panel considered the decision of Pinter v. Canada and the Court's statements regarding persecution:\nIn Pinter v. Canada, 2012 FC 1119 at paragraph 11, the Court found marginalization of Roma people in Hungary through under-employment, under-education, the commonality of subsistence housing, and violence from racially motivated radical groups ... and that the worsening of problems for Roma contradicted finding an absence of persecution. At paragraph 12, the Court held that persecution in education is present when students face harassment, vulgar and offensive comments, and physical abuse when attending school, and at paragraph 13 that access only to employment that is rare and not meaningful or long-lasting does not address lack of persecution and whether these is social service support available is irrelevant to the existence of persecution.26\n[30] The panel may distinguish the facts of these claims from the above-cited case. The claimants have not shown that their individual experiences as recounted to this panel enable the latter to make a finding of persecution. As described in these reasons, the panel finds that the documentary evidence shows that Roma are discriminated in many spheres of life but in a reading of all the documentary evidence about the situation of Roma in Hungary, the panel determines that it not possible for it to conclude, or by extension find, that 1) all Roma in Hungary are persecuted; and 2) that the particular circumstances of these claimants demonstrate they will face persecution if they return to Hungary. Moreover, the panel is able to find that as a group, the Roma in Hungary face discrimination but the evidence referenced in this case does not establish that Roma, as a group, face persecution. But for the panel's finding that the principal claimant was persecuted in the past based on the assaults he experienced, the cumulative experience of these claimants in Hungary is one of discrimination alone - and does not rise cumulatively to the level of persecution. Specifically, and based on the evidence before it, the panel finds that the principal claimant experienced discrimination in respect to his education and employment, but that opportunities exist for him, his family, and other Roma to obtain education and to find employment if they seek it in Hungary. This is backed up by the fact that the principal claimant has done so in the past.\nPhysical Assaults\n[31] The panel finds that both the principal claimant and the female claimant have been assaulted because of their Roma ethnicity. A document in the National Documentation Package reported that, between 2009 and 2012, several Hungarian and international NGOs documented what they characterized as disturbing, a pattern of violent attacks against Roma in Hungary including severe beatings in broad daylight [and] murders by arson, shootings, or the throwing of Molotov cocktails.27 While not as extreme as these violent incidents, the panel finds that the principal claimant experienced physical assaults as a result of his Roma ethnicity and the female claimant recounted having her hair pulled by an unknown person because of her ethnicity. As stated above, the panel finds the principal claimant's experiences to amount to persecution.\nCumulative Discrimination\n[32] The panel finds that the discrimination experienced by the principal claimant and the female claimant in education; the discrimination experienced by the principal claimant in employment; and the general incidents of discrimination they both alleged do not amount to persecution on their own as stated in paragraph 31. However, the panel finds that the principal claimant suffered persecution because of being physically harmed by anti-Roma people. Given that their parents have been physically harmed, the panel finds that the two minor claimants face a forward-looking risk of discriminatory attitudes by some people because of their Roma ethnicity as they are similarly-situated persons.\n[33] Based on the above analysis, the panel finds that the treatment the principal claimant experienced as a Roma living in Hungary amounts to persecution. To be considered persecution, the mistreatment suffered or anticipated must be serious.2829 The panel finds his two assaults were serious. The essential question for the panel to answer, however, is whether the persecution alleged by the claimant threatens his or her basic human rights in a fundamental way.30 A second criterion of persecution is that the inflicting of harm occurs with repetition or persistence, or in a systematic way.31 The panel finds that being physically harmed by someone to be a serious incident and to threaten the claimants' basic human right to security of the person. I find that the harm experienced by the principal claimant to be repetitive harm. Notwithstanding this finding, the panel must assess whether the claimants would face such harm if they returned to Hungary. In this regard, the panel was required to assess whether state protection would be forthcoming for this family were they to return to Hungary.\nIs there state protection for these claimants in Hungary?\n[34] There is a presumption that countries are capable of protecting their citizens.32 The claimants bear the legal burden of rebutting the presumption that adequate state protection exists, by adducing clear and convincing evidence which satisfies the panel on a balance of probabilities.33 The panel has carefully reviewed the country conditions as set out in the National Documentation Package and in counsel's packages.34 The panel finds that the claimants have not rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence.\n[35] Refugee claimants are expected to make reasonable efforts to seek protection in their own country before seeking it internationally. The responsibility to provide international protection only becomes engaged when national or state protection is unavailable to the claimant. This principle reinforces the underlying rationale of international protection as a surrogate, coming into play where no alternative remains to the claimant.35 For this reason, international refugee law scholar James Hathaway refers to the refugee scheme as \"surrogate or substitute protection,\" activated only upon failure of national protection.36\n[36] Except in situations of complete breakdown of the state apparatus, it should be assumed that the state is capable of protecting a claimant. The presumption of state protection was articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in the Ward decision where the Court stated:\nThe issue that arises, then, is how, in a practical sense, a claimant makes proof of a state's inability to protect its nationals as well as the reasonable nature of the claimant's refusal actually to seek out this protection. On the facts of this case, proof on this point was unnecessary, as representatives of the state authorities conceded their inability to protect Ward. Where such an admission is not available, however, clear and convincing confirmation of a state's inability to protect must be provided. For example, a claimant might advance testimony of similarly situated individuals let down by the state protection arrangement or the claimant's testimony of past personal incidents in which state protection did not materialize. Absent some evidence, the claim should fail, as nations should be presumed capable of protecting their citizens. Security of nationals is, after all, the essence of sovereignty. Absent a situation of complete breakdown of state apparatus, such as that recognized in Lebanon in Zalzali, it should be assumed that the state is capable of protecting a claimant.37\n[37] The Court has established that the onus is on the claimant to produce \"clear and convincing evidence\" that the state cannot provide protection. The Court has held that the evidence that state protection is inadequate must not only be reliable but also probative; it must also satisfy the assessor of the claim that, on a balance of probabilities, state protection is inadequate.38 A claimant's burden of proof is \"...directly proportional to the level of democracy in the state in question: the more democratic the state's institutions, the more the ...claimant must have done to exhaust all courses of action open to him or her.\"39 In a functioning democracy, an Appellant will have a heavy burden when attempting to show that one should not have been required to exhaust all of the recourses available to him\/her domestically before claiming refugee status internationally.40 Local failures by authorities to provide protection does not mean that the state as a whole fails to protect its citizens, unless the failures form part of a broader pattern of the state's inability, or refusal, to provide protection.41 No government is expected to guarantee perfect protection to all of its citizens at all times, and the fact that a state is not always successful in protecting its citizens is not enough to justify a claim, especially where a state is in effective control of its territory, has military, police and civil authorities in place, and is making serious efforts to protect its citizens.42 Less than perfect protection is not a basis to determine that a state is either unwilling or unable to offer reasonable protection.43\n[38] The Court has indicated that it is not enough to say that steps are being taken that one day may result in adequate state protection. It is to determine the state protection provided at the present time that is relevant.44 Regard must be given to what is actually happening and not what the state is endeavouring to put in place.45 Any efforts must have \"actually translated into adequate state protection\" at the operational level.46 Accordingly, given a number of opinions furnished by the Court in respect of state protection, the panel has identified a number of these, which have application in the case at hand. For example, and as stated for emphasis, the onus is on the claimants to rebut the presumption of state protection with \"clear and convincing\" evidence of the state's inability to protect its citizens.47 The Appellant must satisfy the board that the state protection is, in fact, inadequate, on a balance of probabilities.48 \"...[A] refugee claimant does not rebut the presumption of state protection in a functioning democracy by asserting only a 'subjective reluctance to engage the state'.\"49 Doubting the effectiveness of the protection offered by the state when one has not really tested it does not rebut the existence of a presumption of state protection.50 The onus is on the refugee claimant to approach the state for protection in situations where state protection might be reasonably forthcoming.51 \"...[I]n the absence of a compelling explanation, a failure to pursue state protection opportunities within the home state will usually be fatal to a refugee claim, at least where the state is a functioning democracy with a willingness and the apparatus necessary to provide a measure of protection to its citizens.\"52 And finally, the refugee claimant's burden of proof is \"...directly proportional to the level of democracy in the state in question; the more democratic the state's institutions, the more the ...[refugee] claimant must have done to exhaust all courses of action open to him or her.\"53\n[39] In this context, the burden of proving an absence of state protection is directly proportional to the level of democracy that exists in the state.54 The documentary evidence before me indicates that Hungary is a functioning democracy.55 It has functioning political and judicial systems in place and an official apparatus sufficient to provide a measure of protection to its citizens. Hungary is in control of its territory and has functioning security forces, both military and police, in place. This is a high-functioning parliamentary government based on a multi-party system that held national elections as recently as 2014 and there is no evidence whatsoever of a \"total breakdown of state authority\" in Hungary.\n[40] The panel finds that the documentary evidence shows that Roma are discriminated in many spheres of life; however, the panel also finds that general documentary evidence about the situation of Roma in Hungary is not sufficient to make the determination that Roma are persecuted.56 Moreover, regarding discrimination and harassment, and physical abuse perpetrated against Roma, the panel finds that Roma have recourse to seek remedies against discrimination and protection against physical abuse. The panel finds that the government of Hungary has enacted legislation, developed infrastructure to enforce the laws, and put in place numerous government agencies for obtaining remedies against discrimination.\n[41] The panel will add its voice to other panels who find that the Roma minority population in Hungary experience discrimination in many aspects of their daily lives and at times, violence and abuse at the hands of some racist elements in Hungary including the indifference of some police officers who also harbour anti-Roma sentiments. Such racist-based violence reached its height during the 2000s in various northeastern Hungarian towns and villages at the time these claimants were living in this region in XXXX. The documentary evidence outlines the corresponding rise to prominence of the Jobbik Party in 2010, currently a third-place opposition party in Hungary. This contributed to a corresponding rise in the vocal expression of anti-Roma sentiments that took the form of organized rallies, parades, protests and a heightened animus toward Roma that manifested in increased incidents of discrimination and violence. However, with the dissolution of the Hungarian Guards in 2013 and with the right-wing Jobbik Party re-casting itself as a more inclusive but still nationalist party, it has attempted to distance itself from the right-wing rhetoric that characterized its platform in the pre-2014 elections:\nGabor Vona, Jobbik's 37-year-old leader...declared [in late 2013] a new direction for his party - towards the political centre, and away from the extreme right which won it its ugly reputation. \"We are a people's party now,\" Mr. Vona told me. \"Naturally we have kept our basic values, but now we are trying to represent the whole of society, with all the different views which people hold....I will not accept any crude or extreme views in the future. I want this to be party [sic] which everyone can calmly and honourably vote for.\"57\n[42] The BBC report58 references Jobbik's role in the 2000s in contributing \"to a serious worsening of relations with the Hungarian Roma minority\" but \"...Jobbik's programme calls for an end to positive discrimination for minorities.\" A member of Political Capital, a prominent 'think tank' in Budapest, interviewed for the BBC article, opined: \"Mr. Vona wants to move the party toward the centre and push out the extremist elements\" and \"...if he manages to tone down the anti-Gypsy and anti-Semitic rhetoric, that has to be welcomed.\"59 The panel also notes from its reading of the documentary materials, including human rights monitoring groups, the customary annual reports that the Board references and the diverse media sources, that there are no current reports of right-wing and nationalist marches or gatherings in Hungary that are targeting, harassing and threatening Roma.\n[43] The incidents prior to 2015 are well-documented and the events of the 2000s, up to 2011 and 2012, form the bulk of Roma Legacy Task Force cases and are regularly cited both generally and with specificity by claimants. However, without analysis to explain the phenomenon of silence in respect of contemporary reports, the panel can reasonably infer two possible reasons: 1) the government's efforts as documented to implement its national inclusion strategy for Roma, its ongoing educational reforms and employment programs for minorities and related steps for total integration and 2) the move of the Jobbik Party - the source of many of the extremist and right-wing incidents involving Roma - moving away from these elements to a more mainstream party seeking to appeal to all segments of Hungarian society - and as the aforementioned report notes, in order to make significant gains in the 2018 elections. Accordingly, while the panel is not satisfied that there has been some fundamental shift in circumstances regarding the general discriminatory attitude toward Roma in Hungary, as there is no evidence to suggest such a shift, and Roma are still discriminated against, it nevertheless finds that, cumulatively, the types of incidents that the claimants have experienced when they lived in XXXX to be discriminatory at most. And, although the panel finds the principal claimant experienced discrimination amounting to persecution based on his mistreatment by these right-wing elements, the panel also finds that state protection is available to him and his family should they return to Hungary.\n[44] The panel then turns to the matter of the principal claimant's specific experiences with the police. In the case at hand, the principal claimant's narrative said he reported that paramilitaries threw rocks at the windows of his mother's house in 2010. However, the claimant did not identify the vandals and he was unable to provide to the police the license plate number of the car they purportedly arrived in, although he wanted this example to serve as an example of the police being unhelpful. The panel does not find this incident to be persuasive evidence of a lack of state protection for the principal claimant. The panel does not consider the police's failure to do something for the principal claimant's mother or for him to be evidence of no state protection. In considering the matter, the panel notes that the principal claimant reported the rock-throwing incident to police after it was over and the perpetrator(s) had left; the principal claimant had no details or witnesses to describe the people and he could not identify them; and he could not provide a license plate number of the car they were driving. There is in effect little difference between someone filing such a report in Canada. If one cannot provide relevant and pertinent details of what occurred, it is unreasonable to expect the police to launch an investigation.\n[45] In the Racz decision,60 the Federal Court dealt with a highly similar incident as that recounted by the principal claimant. In that claim, the applicants:\n...were at home when stones were thrown through their windows. Denes Csaba Racz, the father in the applicant family, ran out of the house to see what had happened but he was immediately kicked in his stomach and assaulted. By the time Timea Raczne Marodi, the mother in the applicant family, went outside, her husband was on the ground and his attackers were fleeing in a car. They were shouting that \"this is not over\" and that the applicants would die. Mr. Racz called the police. When they arrived, he showed them the broken windows and where he was kicked and punched. The police asked if he saw the perpetrators, and Mr. Racz replied that he did not because he was kicked very suddenly. Ms. Marodi did not get the license plate. The police said that there was not much they could do, but that they would patrol the area more often. They left without taking a report. They patrolled one more time that night but no additional patrols were made. The applicants also asked the Mayor of their village to help them but he said the police would take care of things.61\n[46] In dismissing the appeal, the Federal Court also referenced a similar analogy to that employed by the panel in this decision. The Court stated:\nI agree with the submission of the respondent that the Board's examination must focus on whether these persons, on clear and convincing evidence, have established that there is not adequate state protection at the operational level. I am unable to find, based on their submissions in this application, that the Board's decision that they did not establish the inadequacy of state protection is unreasonable. In fact, although not perfect, the response of the police to the applicants' complaints, given the specific circumstances of the assaults taken to the police, appears to have been adequate and in keeping with what Canadian police forces would be likely to do.62\n[47] For these reasons, and as found in the above-cited case, the panel does not find the police response to the rock-throwing incident in 2010 to be evidence of a lack of state protection. Moreover, the panel finds that, in considering the case at bar as well as the Court findings above, the failure by some police to provide protection is not indicative of the fact that there is no protection in the country as a whole.63\n[48] With reference to the case of a Molotov cocktail being thrown, this incident did not involve the principal claimant directly. He simply related that the police \"came out to see that the fire was subdued\" and his mother's neighbour went to court \"to get the police to provide a letter in order to collect insurance but I don't know the outcome of the case.\" The panel has no persuasive evidence before it that the police did not offer state protection to the neighbour following this incident because the principal claimant's narrative did not offer sufficient details on whether the matter was addressed substantively. Furthermore, the principal claimant only made scant reference in oral testimony after his counsel asked him about it. This incident does not establish for the panel that state protection was not forthcoming for the unnamed neighbour.\n[49] The only other incident the principal claimant recounted of personal experience with the police was when he tried to report the XXXX 2011 assault. He called his wife who came and took him to the hospital where he was hospitalized for eight days and treated for a concussion. During his time in the hospital, the police came there to talk to him in response to the attack he experienced. However, because of his concussion, they instead asked the principal claimant to come to the police station to file a report once he was out of the hospital. When the principal claimant was well enough to leave the hospital, he said he went to the police and alleged that they told him it was too late to file a report so they did not take his complaint. The principal claimant told the panel that he signed something at the police station \"that I did not understand because of my condition and level of medication.\"\n[50] The panel does not consider this second experience with the police to constitute evidence of a lack of state protection. The principal claimant did not know his attackers but it is evident that someone reported the incident because the police attended at the principal claimant's bedside in the hospital. The initial response that they would wait for the principal claimant to leave the hospital sounds plausible to the panel. Given the principal claimant's concussion, this is a plausible response. However, the principal claimant's statement that a policeman told him later that it was too late to report the incident is not plausible. The panel raises two points in this regard. First, it is implausible to the panel that a police officer would tell the principal claimant it is too late to make a report and then go to the trouble of having the principal claimant \"sign something.\" If there is not report to be taken, then it makes no sense that the claimant would be asked to sign something, which both reasonably and logically constitutes a record of something in the first instance. Second, by his own evidence, the principal claimant indicated he was not in any condition to be there. He was told to come to the police station when he was better; however, the principal claimant was still feeling the effects of a concussion and he was on a \"level of medication\" that clearly caused him to fail to understand what he was even signing. As with his other incident, the panel is not persuaded that the principal claimant has demonstrated a lack of adequate or effective state protection in this encounter with the local police in XXXX.\n[51] Simply put, the panel is not persuaded that the principal claimant, even if it accepted the policeman was rebuffing his effort to report the assault, would then willingly sign something for which he did not know its contents. If he felt he was not going to be helped, it is implausible that he would then sign an unknown paper. The panel does not find the principal claimant's story to be a credible one. And, in this discussion of state protection generally, and as it relates to this case, the panel makes two findings: 1) even if the police officer decided not to open a report for the principal claimant, this failure to do so is not sufficient or persuasive evidence that there is a general pattern of a lack of state protection for Roma from all police in Hungary; and 2) there are other avenues of operationally adequate state protection available to Roma who require assistance from the police. The panel finds that the principal claimant did not experience a lack of state protection in 2011 because a police officer refused to take a report. The principal claimant's own health and medical condition were, by his evidence, contributing factors in his account of what occurred. The panel finds that the principal claimant has attempted to use this incident at a local police station in XXXX to suggest that operationally adequate state protection was not forthcoming.\n[52] In contrast, the documentary evidence64 shows that Hungary has a functioning police force to uphold the laws of the country and provide protection against criminality, including physical violence, and if required, for seeking redress, if citizens, including Roma, are denied state protection or if their complaints are not taken seriously. The government has put in place other agencies, including the Independent Police Complaints Board (IPCB)65 which is specifically mandated to address complaints against the police. The panel determines that adequate state protection is available to these claimants in Hungary in their particular situation and circumstances.\n[53] The panel finds the behavior of some officers who are no doubt unhelpful; and\/or who hold right-leaning views; and\/or who hold anti-Roma opinions to be reprehensible and to be sure, these types of police officers do exist in Hungary. The panel also acknowledges that this factor is an oft-cited reason for Roma Legacy Task Force claimants from northeastern Hungary and given as a reason for their decision to leave the country. However, this does not mean that every police officer in northeastern Hungary is unhelpful to every Roma, or that every police officer in Hungary treats Roma this way, or that an unhelpful police officer is prima facie evidence of a lack of state protection. In its analysis of the facts of this case, the panel finds the principal claimant has failed to show that his experiences with the police constitute a lack of state protection.\n[54] In undertaking its analysis of the adequacy of state protection in Hungary and the operational adequacy of that protection, t would be remiss of the panel if it did not acknowledge the ongoing efforts of the Hungarian Government to achieve social integration of Roma into all aspects of Hungarian society, in order to resolve the problems that Roma face. For a high-functioning and developed central European state like Hungary, whose laws and legislation related to minorities and its treatment of all the country's minorities cast it under the watchful eye of the European Commission and the European Court of Human Rights as legislated arms of the European Union, the evidence before the panel demonstrates persuasively that the government does take steps to hold to account and to prosecute officials and individuals when such abuse occurs.66 For example, in respect of the claimants' concerns with right-wing elements, the Government of Hungary has also taken action against extremist organizations, successfully banning the Hungarian Guard Association in 2013 as stated, and initiating processes for banning the Civil Guard Association on the grounds that their anti-Roma activities threaten public order.67 These actions demonstrate specific actions taken by the Government to address anti-Roma treatment in Hungary. As it relates to police indifference and discriminatory treatment of Roma, the panel accepts that Roma in northeastern Hungary - that is, the majority of Roma whose Canadian claims are assessed by this panel and from whence these claimants come - often face such treatment by some police officers who refuse to take their statements or file a report of an incident. The documentation, however, is neither uniform nor consistent in this regard and there is evidence in the National Documentation Package that the police have, and do, intervene to protect the Roma community in Hungary.68\n[55] For example, most notable among the anti-Roma incidents of 2011 was the 6 March right-wing gathering and de facto occupation of Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6spata by paramilitary groups who made Roma the victims of their random threats, harassment and assaults for weeks. The Red Cross intervened and removed Roma from this village by coaches when a significant march was organized in the village until the threat subsided. Pressed by the European Union, which sent observers along with international human rights groups and monitoring agencies and the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, the government established an ad hoc parliamentary committee in June 2011 to investigate the background of criminal activity and to eliminate it.\n[56] In the Board's Response to Information Request of 19 August 201669, a lawsuit filed by the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union was heard by a court in Eger in 2015 with the following information recorded:\nSources report that in September 2015, a court in Eger ruled that the police failed to protect Roma inhabitants of the village of Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6spata from extremist groups that organized marches in the village in 2011 [3] (US 13 Apr. 2016, 7; AI 2016, 181). Sources note that the court found that the police not only failed to protect Roma during the march, but later imposed misdemeanor charges against members of the minority community (US 13 Apr. 2016, 7; HCLU Jan. 2016, 20). The Hungarian Civil Liberties Union (HCLU) [4], which filed the lawsuit, states that the ruling represents \"a very important achievement, as this is the first Hungarian court ruling that deems the practice of the police against the Roma to be discriminatory, and therefore unlawful\" (ibid., 21). Sources note that the verdict on the case is not final (ibid.; US 13 Apr. 2016, 7), remaining open for an appeal (ibid.). Sources further report that in October 2015, the European Court of Human Rights found that Hungary discriminated against a Roma man when the police failed to investigate a 2012 racist attack against him in Szeged (AI 2016, 181; ERRC 27 Oct. 2015).\n[57] From the Board's Supplemental Disclosure Package70, the European Court for Human Rights the ECHR ruled in 2017 that police had failed to protect the Roma that day and that Hungarian authorities failed to take sufficient action when investigating the \"hateful and abusive\" speeches given at the rally. The court also found the perpetrators of the crimes \"remained virtually without legal consequences\" - which, it added, could have been perceived by the public as the state's legitimization or tolerance of such abuse. As the article stated: \"This decision sends an important signal to the Hungarian government at a time when the climate of racism and xenophobia is becoming ever more toxic.\" And: \"This week's ECHR decision sends a clear message to Hungary's authorities that hate crimes must not be tolerated. They must take urgent steps to fully investigate these and other racist crimes and bring those who commit them to justice.\"\n[58] It is also relevant for the determination of state protection in this case to reference the Hungarian Supreme Court (Curia) ruling of 2017 on the Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6spata incident that \"Hungarian police officers discriminated Roma in one town by failing to take appropriate action against extremist organizations.\" As reported by the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union in this article:\nThe judgment represents a particularly important and decisive development in terms of the protection of rights and case law in Hungary: this was the first time that the Curia stated in a public interest lawsuit that the police committed negative discrimination against Roma citizens.\nIn addition to affirming the violation of rights, the Curia also banned the police from committing similar acts in the future, and the court called on the police to publicly apologize....All of this may help the police have more respect for members of the largest minority group in Hungary.71\n[59] The panel finds these recent decisions to be persuasive evidence that the government is acting at the highest levels when incidents, such as those that occurred in 2011, were reported and further, evidence of the discriminatory behavior of the XXXX city council were similarly treated substantively and effectively.\n[60] From its reading of the counsel's documents and even those in the National Documentation Package, the panel is concerned that in reporting various incidents from the 2000s through 2014\/2015, many of the materials portray the entire policing system in Hungary, which provides law enforcement at no less than local, provincial and national levels, as wholly discriminatory vis-\u00e0-vis treatment of Roma people and uniformly unhelpful and\/or hostile toward all Roma. Indeed, a fair reading of the materials would lead a reasonable person to consider that police in Hungary almost never take reports from Roma; they never help the Roma; or worse, they were all complicit in all anti-Roma activities throughout the 2000s. A deeper and more comprehensive reading of the materials, as conducted by this panel, in this case does not support such characterizations, however; the panel does acknowledge that the statements of some monitoring groups and observers in these documents, as they relate to specific and individual incidents and reports, have been and are regularly taken out of context and misapplied broadly to all law enforcement agencies and their personnel. The panel finds that, through a more careful reading of the evidence as presented, which also includes substantive reports and examples, the government has demonstrated that it is capable of, and does hold to account officers who engage in discriminatory practices and abuse.\n[61] The panel finds that the claimants in this case have not provided clear and convincing evidence, on a balance of probabilities, that state protection for them in Hungary is inadequate. Like the principal claimant, the female claimant explained in testimony that she too had approached the police for assistance but they would not help her. The counsel asked her whether she could think of other problems she experienced. She responded: \"The same problems my husband mentioned.\" Then, the counsel asked the claimant whether she ever went to the police in Hungary. She said she went once to file a complaint but the police did not help her. The panel immediately queried the absence of this information from her and the principal claimant's narratives. The claimant simply responded that it was not in her narrative. The claimant said it happened on the street in XXXX and people were calling her derogatory names and saying that she should leave the country. She opined that the people were Guardists because they were wearing black clothing so she went to police to complain but they did not pay attention to her and they did not take a report. She was there for five minutes before they sent the claimant out.\n[62] The panel notes that the principal claimant referenced an assault on his wife in downtown XXXX in his narrative but there is no information that the claimant went to the police. Even if the panel accepted her story as referenced in the principal claimant's narrative, the claimant failed to explain why her testimony about going to the police to report the incident was missing from her husband's narrative; a document on which she relied. The panel noted that the claimant's counsel also did not ask the claimant why the information was missing from the personal information on file about the claimants' experiences, nor did he make any submissions on this lack of detail.\n[63] Claimants are expected to furnish all the particulars and details of their experiences in their PIF narratives and most notably to explain all steps they took in seeking state protection. These claimants furnished amended narratives close to the hearing date despite having been in Canada for more than five years. The panel finds that these claimants have had more than sufficient time to ensure their materials were complete and accurate and they swore to the truthfulness of their evidence. It is reasonable to expect that if this happened to the claimant, the principal claimant would have also included it in his narrative. He did not, and it is not plausible to the panel that the two claimants prepared their statements in isolation and neither claimant raised issues of translation or objected to the content of their narratives. The female claimant's omission of a very significant detail in her PIF, only to raise it during the counsel's leading question to her, as referenced above - which was: 'Can you think of other problems you had in Hungary?' - to be fabricated by her to bolster the family's claim for protection. The panel finds the omission of an important and relevant fact - that otherwise was supposed to establish a lack of state protection - to undermine the female claimant's credibility. The panel was unable to rely on this new evidence from the female claimant in any meaningful way; either to assess the overall truthfulness of her oral evidence or to find that her experience is an example of inadequate state protection.\n[64] There are reports in the National Documentation Package, as well as the claimants' country condition documents in evidence, which include reported incidents of discrimination, harassment and physical abuse against Roma in Hungary from the early\/mid-2000s to 2014\/2015. The panel finds these reports show societal discrimination and exclusion of Roma and evidence of anti-Semitism and anti-immigrant attitudes in Hungarian society.72 However, the panel also notes that the documents in evidence show that the Government of Hungary prosecutes and punishes officials who commit abuses, whether in the security services or elsewhere in the government. Of note:\nIn a resolution adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe regarding the implementation of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities for Hungary, it is noted that the Hungarian \"authorities have made efforts to curtail abuse by the police by increasing the recruitment of Roma police officers, providing training in human rights and setting up, in 2008, the Independent Police Complaint Committee (IPCC) responsible for receiving complaints against misbehaviour of the police.\"73\n[65] The principal claimant's counsel asked him whether he had ever met a Roma police officer. The principal claimant said he had not. The panel was unsure of the relevance of the question in the context of state protection but there is no evidence before the panel that Roma can only obtain assistance from Roma police or that Roma police are any more effective in the fulfilment of their law enforcement duties than ethnic Hungarian police. However, it is relevant to cite that the government has instituted programs for Roma police and to play a role in the offering of state protection as follows:\nThe Ombudsman for minority rights indicated that the National Police Headquarters from \"time to time passes action plans on better co-operation with the Roma community\" (Hungary 19 Sept. 2011). The initiatives include providing grants, numbering from ten to fifteen, for \"talented Roma pupils,\" as well as \"a set of county co-operation contracts with local communities, Roma self-governments,\" and \"children and school programs\" which, for example, organize public days for informing the public and Roma about law enforcement (ibid.).\nThe HHC is of the opinion that when it comes to programs for Roma to become involved with the Police, \"the number of [a]ffected Roma people is extremely low, [and] the intensity and effectiveness of the programs are questionable\" (HHC 15 Sept. 2011).\nHowever, the HHC also indicated that, based on their research on Roma-police relations, one of the main goals of the police is to recruit Roma youth into the police force (ibid.). One way for the police to do this was to issue a \"call for proposals\" for Roma high school students, with the program allowing for selected Roma students to receive a monthly scholarship that varies between 11 and 22 US dollars, based on \"their achievement at school\" (ibid.).\nIn its Third Report submitted to the Council of Europe in 2009 concerning the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, the government of Hungary noted that a scholarship program for \"talented Roma secondary school students\" pursuing police careers has been active since 2000, sponsored by the Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Justice, and the ORFK (Hungary 4 June 2009).\nThe Vice President of the Phralipe Independent Roma Association indicated that to her knowledge, scholarship programs for police schools cover only half the year, and then it becomes a \"question [of] who is able to remain in the police school\" (15 Sept. 2011).\nThe Ministry of the Interior reported that on 28 March 2011 \"the Budapest Police Headquarters (BRFK) held an open day for the Roma-Gypsy under-privileged youth, who are interested in police career,\" which included presentations by employees from the BRFK's Department for Crime Prevention and representatives of secondary vocational schools for Police (Hungary 28 Mar. 2011). This day was organized with the help of Budapest's Gypsy Self-government, whose Chair \"underlined the importance of the cooperation with the police\" (ibid.). Corroborating this information, the Ombudsman indicated that on 28 March 2011 the Capital Police Station, along with the Crime Prevention Department and the Capital Roma self-government, organized \"a public day for pupils to present the operation of law enforcement\" (Hungary 19 Sept. 2011). The Ministry of the Interior also announced in March 2011 that there would be a police \"preparatory camp\" for Roma applicants in July 2011 (Hungary 28 Mar. 2011).\nThe HHC report notes that annual summer camps are often organized by regional police for young children coming from a \"poor\" environment (15 Sept. 2011). There is also an annual summer camp for Roma high school students lasting for five days in which they learn about law enforcement and requirements to enter the Police College (HHC 15 Sept. 2011). Forty students attended the camp in 2011 (HHC 15 Sept. 2011).74\n[66] The panel finds this to be persuasive evidence of the government's steps to use recognized police programs to involve Roma in the state's security apparatus and to encourage young Roma to join their ranks. The panel also notes that the authorities had some success in curtailing abuse by the police by increasing the recruitment of Roma police officers, providing training in human rights, and as far back as 2008, by setting up the IPCC, which is responsible for receiving complaints against misbehaviour of the police.75 As discussed above, the principal claimant said he made two attempts to report vandalism and an assault by paramilitaries and neither were acted upon. While the panel does not find the police's failure to open a report on an incident of vandalism to be evidence of a lack of state protection, and the panel finds the principal claimant's story of the policeman's refusal to take a report not to be credible, there are established avenues for any citizen including Roma to pursue complaints against any police officer they find did not discharge their duties to assist. For example, the following information from the National Document Package is referenced herein:\nSubmitting a complaint against a police officer\nThe Parliamentary Commissioner for the Rights of National and Ethnic Minorities, also referred to as the Minorities Ombudsman, noted in correspondence with the Research Directorate that the Police Act of 1994 allows for a complaint against the \"unlawful action\" of a police officer to be submitted to the local captain of the police, with a higher ranking captain having the option to appeal the decision (Hungary 19 Sept. 2011). The resulting decision can be reviewed by the court (ibid.). In correspondence with the Research Directorate, the HHC similarly noted that the Police Act allows for any individual who has his or her \"fundamental\" rights violated by the police to \"file a complaint with the police unit responsible\" for the violation (15 Sept. 2011).\nThe HHC further informed the Research Directorate that\ncomplaints shall be submitted within 30 days of the alleged violation by the concerned person or his\/her representative. (Complaints may also be represented by human rights NGOs or foundations, minority self-governments or certain law professors.) The complaint is decided on in an administrative procedure by the head of the respective police unit within 30 days after receiving the complaint.\" (HHC 15 Sept. 2011)\nThe HHC noted that this \"first instance decision\" can be appealed \"on any ground\" to the \"superior of the concerned police unit\" (ibid.). The appeal must be filed within 15 days after the delivery of the first instance decision, which shall forward the appeal and all the documents concerning the case to the superior unit within eight days after the appeal deadline, unless the unit which decided on the complaint withdraws the decision, refuses it without in-merit examination, or amends, corrects or supplements it in accordance with the appeal. If the appeal is forwarded to it, the superior body shall deliver a reasoned decision, affirming, modifying or annulling the first instance decision. (ibid.)\nThe subsequent \"second instance decision may be challenged before the court by the complainant\" (ibid.). However, the court \"may not change the decision: it may only send the case back to the police and order a new procedure (however, the police are obliged to follow the guidelines set by the court in the new procedure)\" (ibid.)....\n...\nAccording to Hungary's UN submission, the Complaints Body is \"independent\" of the government to ensure that the rights of citizens are protected (ibid. 16 Feb. 2011, para. 70). The HHC also notes that the Complaints Body is \"functionally external to the police authorities, and [that] its budget is included into the budget line of the Office of the Hungarian Parliament\" (HHC 15 Sept. 2011). The five members of the Complaints Body are lawyers chosen by Parliament to serve a six-year term (Hungary 16 Feb. 2011, para. 70). According to the HHC, the members cannot be re-elected, and they must all be \"lawyers with outstanding experience in the field of fundamental rights protection\" (HHC 15 Sept. 2011).\nThe HHC stated that to file a complaint with the Complaints Body, it has to be\nfiled within eight days of the alleged violation by the concerned person, who may also be represented by human rights NGOs or foundations, minority self-governments or certain law professors. Anonymous complaints or complaints arriving from someone acting on behalf of the victim without a proper authorization are rejected automatically. (ibid.)\nAccording to Hungary's report to the UN, the National Police Commissioner (also translated as the National Chief of Police and Chief Police Captain) is required to submit monthly reports to the Complaints Body about \"complaints submitted to the Police\" (Hungary 16 Feb. 2011, para. 70). If the Complaints Body finds that a citizen's \"fundamental rights\" have been seriously violated, it sends its decision to the Police Commissioner (ibid.; HHC 15 Sept. 2011), \"who shall deliver a resolution within 30 days\" (Hungary 16 Feb. 2011, para. 70). Although the Police Commissioner \"delivers the decision on the individual complaint,\" he can only deviate from the Complaint Body's recommendation on \"the basis of detailed argumentation\" (HHC 15 Sept. 2011). The Police Commissioner's decision can be submitted to court for judicial review (ibid.; Hungary 16 Feb. 2011, para. 70; ibid. 19 Sept. 2011), as can decisions made by the Complaints Body (ibid.). The Minorities Ombudsman said that although the Police Commissioner can accept or refuse a decision from the Complaints Body, \"[i]n practice,\" he \"neglect[s]\" 90 percent of the Complaints Body's decisions (ibid.).\nIf the Complaints Body determines either that there has been no violation of fundamental rights or that the violation was not \"substantial,\" the complaint is forwarded to the police unit of the officer who committed the violation, unless the complainant does not allow it, in which case the case is \"terminated\" (HHC 15 Sept. 2011). If the complaint does not fall under the mandate of the Complaints Body, it is forwarded to the appropriate authority (ibid.). The Complaints Body will \"[r]eject the complaint if the competent authority may not be established, or the complaint is filed after the deadline\" (ibid.).\nIn a March 2011 ERRC report on anti-Roma violence in Hungary, which looked at 22 cases of violence against Roma, the organization noted that\n\"[p]olice misconduct and procedural errors were documented during the investigation of one of the violent crimes against Roma, as raised by NGOs and later confirmed by the Independent Police Complaint [Body] and by the Head of Police. Misconduct by the National Security Service was also revealed.\" (ERRC Mar. 2011, 19)\nThe HHC indicates that in 2009 the Complaints Body issued 457 decisions on 737 complaints and that, of those 457 decisions, 59 were considered \"severe\" violations of fundamental rights and sent to the National Police Commissioner for adjudication (HHC 15 Sept. 2011). The Police Commissioner fully agreed with the Complaints Body in 11 of the 59 cases and partly agreed in 26 (ibid.). In 2010, the Complaints Body received 531 complaints and delivered 428 decisions, out of which 166 cases were considered \"severe\" violations of fundamental rights (ibid.). These cases were also sent to the Police Commissioner, who fully agreed with 14 of the Complaint Body's decisions and partly agreed with 4 others (ibid.).\nComplaint mechanisms\nThe Minorities Ombudsman indicated that there is a general lack of information about appropriate forums through which victims of human rights violations can submit their complaints (Hungary 19 Sept. 2011). He further stated that the main mechanisms for submitting human rights violations are only located in Budapest (ibid.). For many settlements, the only available mechanism is something called a \"minor-offence authority,\" which can be local municipal clerks, the police, or the tax office (ibid.). These authorities deal with minor \"unlawful behaviour,\" such as the refusal to provide service or the delivery of poor service in retail outlets, and their decisions can be contested in court (ibid.).\nIn addition, the Minorities Ombudsman pointed out that the majority of the Roma live in poor towns and small villages in rural areas of Hungary, making it difficult for them to find legal aid, whether from legal experts or NGOs that are working in cities. (Ibid) He noted that although the country has no specific complaints mechanisms for Roma whose human rights are violated, their anti-discrimination legal network was \"integrated into the free legal aid system inside county\/capital governmental administration offices in 2010\" (ibid).76\n[67] The panel finds that there are sufficient and effective mechanisms available to Roma to bring complaints against the police. Even if the panel believed the principal claimant's allegation that the police were unhelpful to him in 2011 by failing to make a report of his complaint, the panel finds that the principal claimant has not offered any persuasive evidence that recourse to complaints against the police was unavailable to him had he sought it.\n[68] There are in fact a number of state mechanisms charged with the protection of Hungary's national minorities. For example, and perhaps most prominently, the work and mandate of the Commissioner for Fundamental Rights and his Office \"are determined by Article 30 of the Fundamental Law of Hungary adopted in 2011 and based on the Act CXI of 2011 on the Commissioner for Fundamental Rights, both which enter into force on 1t January 2012.\" The Commissioner for Fundamental Rights is responsible for, among other things, the protection of the rights of children, the rights of nationalities living in Hungary, the rights of the most vulnerable social groups, and the values determined as 'the interests of future generations'. Below the Commissioner is a Deputy-Commissioner (Ombudsman for the Rights of National Minorities) and there is also a Department for General Inquiries and National Minority Rights as well as a Department for Equal Opportunities and Children's Rights.\n[69] The Commissioner surveys and analyses the situation of fundamental rights in Hungary, and prepares statistics on infringements of those rights in Hungary which are related to fundamental rights. The Commissioner submits an annual report to Parliament on the Office's activities and makes recommendations and proposals for regulations or any amendments. As a new mandate, the Commissioner for Fundamental Rights may initiate the review of rules of law at the Constitutional Court as to their conformity with the Fundamental Law. The panel noted the submission of the claimants' counsel that the Commissioner's Office is not mandated to provide protection and that it is available as a matter of recourse after other avenues are exhausted. Notwithstanding this submission, which the panel considers to be a statement that diminishes an important government institution, it is still a service available to all citizens and all Roma who seek assistance when demonstrable efforts to seek protection at the local level fail. The panel acknowledges such incidents occur but there are reasonable steps that Roma can take as outlined in these reason that can include this important office.\n[70] In Nagy,77 the court upheld the board's decision that the claimant should have sought the protection of the Ombudsman and Prosecutor's investigative offices, which has the power to lay charges against the police, under Penal Code provisions that deal with racially motivated crimes. In that case, the panel concluded that the Ombudsman, Prosecutors and investigative offices were capable of protecting Roma citizens. Other than initially reporting to police that people had thrown rocks at his mother's house, the panel does not believe these claimants sought protection from the police after the claimant's release from the hospital or when the female claimant had her hair pulled.\n[71] Regarding the government's actions to specifically address issues faced by the Roma population, the documentary evidence demonstrates:\nAt its meeting held on 29 January 2013, the Government decided on the establishment of the Roma Affairs Council (CET), which elevates the cause of inclusion to the highest level. The main task of the body is to identify proposals concerning the strategic directions of inclusion and Roma policy and to keep track of their implementation. The establishment of CET allows the evaluation of the implementation of the measures taken as part of a direct dialogue at the highest level of the government structure and in response to direct feedback with the involvement of the ministers and stakeholders concerned, while it also creates a forum for identifying further measures necessary for promoting the inclusion of Roma. The Council makes recommendations with respect to the Government's social inclusion and Roma policy, monitors the attainment of the targets in the framework agreement between the Government and the National Roma Self-Government, and reviews the reports prepared by ministers involved in the implementation of the framework agreement and the National Roma Self-Government. The Council is chaired by the Prime Minister and co-chaired by the President of the National Roma Self-Government. Other members include the Minister of Human Resources, the Minister for Internal Affairs, the Minister for National Economy and the Minister of State leading the Prime Minister's Office. The Council meets at least quarterly.\n...\nThe Anti-Segregation Roundtable was established in June 2013. Both governmental and civil parties are involved. It aims to review the current issues of educational integration and segregation, to discuss the competencies of churches, civil sector as well as of state and local actors, to review current professional standards and, where relevant, to propose new ones.\n...\nThere is ad hoc local cooperation between Roma civil society organisations and local governments based on local programmes and topics. The State Secretariat for Social Inclusion does not seek to oversee these relations but enhances their ongoing development, inter alia, by providing grants for the operation of civil organisations and training programmes with a view to helping the representation of local Roma communities.78\n[72] The National Police Headquarters (ORFK), under the direction of the Ministry of Interior, is responsible for maintaining order nationwide.79 The country's 19 county police departments and the Budapest police headquarters are directly subordinate to the ORFK.80 City police have local jurisdiction but are subordinate to the county police.81 Two hierarchically equal units are directly subordinate to the minister of interior: the Counterterrorism Center (commonly known by its Hungarian acronym \"TEK\") and the National Protective Service (NPS).82 The NPS is responsible for preventing and detecting internal corruption in law enforcement agencies, government administrative agencies, and civilian secret services.83 Both the TEK and the NPS are empowered to gather intelligence and conduct undercover policing, in certain cases without prior judicial authorization.84 Therefore, the panel finds that Hungary has a functioning police force.\n[73] While there is evidence that suggests that the state response to Roma victims has not been ideal, Hungary has taken a number of steps to improve monitoring of Romani legal rights and treatment.85 A 27 member Roma Coordination Council was formed in 2011, bringing together the minister for public administration and justice, the leader of the national Roma self-government, as well as representatives of local self-governments, NGOs and churches.86\n[74] Article 174\/B of the criminal code criminalizes violent acts committed against a person for belonging to a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.87 Following the \"Roma murders\" in 2008-2009, a specialised unit was set up in the police on hate crime and in addition, one officer in every county is now specialised in hate motivated crime.88 Training sessions have been organised with the help of NGOs, focusing on the identification of evidence, awareness raising, and support to victims.89 Police now monitor files in cases of violence and can re-qualify an offence if any hate motivation is suspected.90 Officers have good contacts with civil society, Roma organisations, and LGBT groups.91 This is seen as a very positive development and the police have been commended by numerous NGOs.92 The panel finds that improvements made by the police establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the police are willing to provide adequate state protection to Roma generally.\n[75] In addition to the police, there are the aforementioned government institutions that oversee the police and deal with matters related to Hungary's various national ethnic minorities. Moreover, there are government institutions in place that enforce human rights legislation in response to violations caused by public as well as private actors. The panel notes that recourse for Roma is also available through Hungary's Equal Treatment Authority (ETA), an independent tribunal established by the Government of Hungary in fulfilment of its obligations under European law specifically designed to address and deal with all forms of discrimination in Hungary, including complaints of Roma. The ETA operates under the Ministry Justice and Public Administration, and while located in Budapest, its members travel countrywide to hear complaints involving discrimination.\nThe ETA receives complaints based on race, religion, nationality, and health conditions, and it has the authority to impose fines (Hungary 19 Sept. 2011). Similarly, the Hungarian government's report to the UN further details that the ETA was established in 2005 as an \"independent administrative body\" that \"protect[s], enforce[s], and promote[s] equality and the right to equal treatment\" (ibid. 16 Feb. 2011, para. 13). The ETA deals with \"direct\/indirect discrimination, segregation, harassment, [and] victimization\" based on gender; racial origin; colour; nationality; national or ethnic origin; mother tongue; disability; state of health; religious or ideological conviction; political or other opinion; family status; maternity or paternity; sexual orientation; sexual identity; age; social origin; financial status; part-time, temporary and other types of employment contract; the membership of an organization representing employees' interests and any other status, attribute or characteristic. (ibid., para. 14)\n[76] Although the ETA is directed by the Minister of Public Administration and Justice, the government cannot \"instruct the Authority when it performs its duty under the Equal Treatment Act\" (ibid., para. 13). According to the Hungary report to the UN, the ETA \"can initiate proceedings upon individual complaints\" (ibid., para. 14); that is, it conducts \"independent investigations based on individual complaints\" (HHC 15 Sept. 2011). Its authority \"extends to all actions and omissions of all public actors and a limited circle of private persons (e.g., employers and persons offering goods and services to the public)\" (ibid.). Thus, it can also initiate an \"actio popularis submitted by NGOs and other stakeholders or ex officio\" (Hungary 16 Feb. 2011, para. 14) with \"a view to protecting the rights of persons and groups whose rights have been violated\" (EU Nov. 2010, 86).\nIf the \"right to equal treatment\" is \"violated\" (Hungary 16 Feb. 2011, para. 14), the ETA can impose sanctions (EU Nov. 2010, 85; HHC 15 Sept. 2011). For example, it \"may order the elimination of the situation concerned, prohibit further continuation of the conduct concerned; publish its decision or impose a fine\" (Hungary 16 Feb. 2011, para. 14). The Hungarian government's UN report describes the ETA's decisions as \"legally binding and enforceable,\" saying they \"cannot be altered or set aside by the Government or public authorities\" (ibid., para. 13). However, in a November 2010 report discussing anti-discrimination laws in the European Union, the European Commission notes that the ETA provides a \"usually non-binding opinion\" on complaints it receives from \"victims of discrimination\" (EU Nov. 2010, 85).93\n[77] The ETA performs \"most of its duties in co-operation with a six-member Advisory Committee, whose members have extensive experience in the protection of human rights and in enforcing the principle of equal treatment\" (HHC 15 Sept. 2011). The ETA authority excludes Parliament, the President, the Constitutional Court, the State Audit Office, the ombudsmen, the courts, and public prosecutors (ibid.). According to the HHC, the ETA must deliver a decision within 75 days of receiving a complaint unless the complaint concerns a minor or was submitted by an Ombudsman, in which case it has 45 days (ibid.). For example:\nThe Equal Treatment Authority (hereafter the Authority) was established by the Act on Equal Treatment and Promotion of Equal Opportunities (the Act) and has been functioning since February 2005. Following legislative amendments in 2011 and 2013, the Authority is now an autonomous administrative body; it is independent and cannot be instructed in the performance of its duties; and its budget constitutes a separate title within the budget chapter of Parliament. The Authority is headed by its president, who is appointed by the President of Hungary for a term of nine years. The vice-president is appointed by the Authority's president for an indefinite period. Civil servants and other employees of the Authority are also appointed by its president.\nThe Authority is a quasi-judicial body whose main task is to make legally binding decisions in cases of alleged violation of the Act either at the request of an injured party or ex officio. If it establishes a violation, a number of remedies are available, including the imposition of fines ranging from 50 000 to six million HUF (around 160 to 19 000 Euros). The proceedings are entirely free of charge.\nECRI is pleased to note that the structure and powers of the Authority are now in line with the principles set out in its GRP No. 2 on specialised bodies to combat racism, xenophobia, antisemitism and intolerance at national level and the key components of its GPR No. 7. ECRI concludes with satisfaction that the general legal framework for a national specialised body is complete.\nMoreover, ECRI welcomes the creation of a network of equal treatment consultants across the country; there are 20 in total, one in each of Hungary's 19 counties and one in Budapest. They offer advice free of charge, record all complaints and assist victims of discrimination in compiling submissions and forwarding them to the Authority. They are responsible for assisting local authorities in preparing local equal opportunity plans, as required under the Act, as well as raising awareness of non-discrimination requirements and disseminating information concerning equal treatment.94\n[78] The ETA reportedly received 1,500 complaints of discrimination in 2010, and launched proceedings in 377 cases.95 The ETA's annual reports for the years 2010 to 2016 are publicly available in the English language and are posted on the ETA's Hungarian website.\n[79] As noted, the ETA used its powers to protect the human rights of Roma in response to discriminatory municipal action in housing. Referencing the panel's earlier analysis regarding the 2014 XXXX housing issue - something that occurred years after these claimants left Hungary - on 15 July 2015, the ETA established that the Municipality of XXXX subjected residents of a segregated area to the threat of homelessness or having to move to other segregated areas and, by doing so, discriminated against them because of their social status, financial situation, and Romani origin. The ETA fined the municipality 500,000 forint ($1,800) and ordered it to cease discrimination.96 The panel finds that the actions of the ETA establish, on a balance of probabilities, that it is willing and able to provide adequate state protection to Roma. Besides, with respect to these particular claimants, they never experienced such concerns beyond feeling vulnerable, as the principal claimant wrote. But even that feeling is based on an event for which there is no information and no credible and objective documentary evidence that even speaks of the matter. Rather, the panel is persuaded that when a real issue of forced eviction was planned, various Hungarian state agents sanctioned the city of XXXX and forced the city to reverse its controversial decree that targeted the city's poorest residents. This is evidence of effective state protection and the panel finds that the decree in XXXX poses no forward-facing risk to these claimants even if they chose to return to that city.\n[80] Included in the documentary evidence before it is the 2016 \"Report on the activity of the Equal Treatment Authority in 2016 and on the experiences gathered in the context of applying Act CXXV of 2003 on Equal Treatment and the Promotion of Equal Opportunities\"97, which details two of its decisions where the ETA found in favor of Roma who charged they had been discriminated against. In the case of a Roma woman who had been discriminated against by hospital staff including her physician98, the ETA \"placed a special emphasis on preventing similar cases from recurring in the future, which is why it found it essential to use the sanction of barring future manifestations of the infringing conduct.\" Fines were assessed and the ETA's finding was ordered to be posted on the hospital's website. In another case in 2016, the ETA fined a town mayor for posting on the municipality's website that people should not sell real estate to Roma and it ordered the posting removed and the ETA's decision to be posted instead along with publication in the local newspaper. Similarly, a Roma woman who was spoken to disparagingly by a municipal administrative employee complained to the ETA. Even before the ETA had acted, the local municipality commenced its own investigation into its employee's conduct and accepted the municipality's action that it had reprimanded the employee for his behavior toward the woman.\n[81] Like the claimants' counsel's submission on the Office of the Commissioner of Fundamental Rights, the claimants' counsel submitted that ETA fines and posting of decisions does not dissuade people from continuing their discriminatory behavior, or that the ETA and these measures are evidence of effective state protection. The panel assigns very little weight to these submissions. The ETA is a government-established organization established in response to Hungary's obligations by virtue of its membership in the European Union. The ETA operates at arms-length from, and independently of, the government. Its decisions carry weight in the panel's view. The posting of decisions that establish persons have acted in a discriminatory manner against Roma is a tangible and substantive response to behaviors that are not being tolerated by the government with verifiable and measurable consequences for such behaviors. The panel does not ascribe to the ETA the power of oversight of Roma issues exclusively; rather, it is a body that investigates all types of discrimination; and the panel acknowledges that state protection comes through a variety of other forms as cited, such as the police. The panel has articulated its reasons for finding that there is operationally adequate state protection for the claimants should they return to Hungary; the presence of the ETA as an independent body that has demonstrated it will sanction and take action against those who discriminate against Roma strengthens the panel's finding that protection takes various forms in Hungary beyond the traditional forms of such protection like the police. The evidence demonstrates that there are various avenues of recourse open to Roma beyond the police - including help when local police fail Roma - should these claimants return to Hungary.\n[82] The panel also finds that the government has enacted legislation, and put in place important and substantive initiatives like the ETA across several departments and they are producing results on the ground. The panel finds that the documentary evidence as noted above demonstrates that Hungary continues to provide protection for all its citizens, including Roma and other ethnic minorities. Although not perfect, the panel finds that the evidence demonstrates that Hungary's progressively evolving measures\/actions to provide protection for its citizens, including Roma, are actually having an impact operationally on the ground. The evidence also demonstrates that police do investigate crimes against Roma and that perpetrators are being held responsible when there is sufficient evidence.\n[83] The independent court system is also available to correct discriminatory conduct against Roma. On September 17, 2015 the Tribunal of Eger ruled in a case initiated by the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union (HCLU) that the police discriminated against Romani residents in Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6spata during a march by the \"For A Better Future\" far-right neighborhood watch group and other extremist groups in 2011.99 The court found that police failed to protect the Romani residents threatened by the extremist groups and later imposed excessive fines on local Roma for minor misdemeanors.100 This ruling by the court does not affect the panel's earlier finding that the police offer adequate state protection because the failings of one local police station outside of where these claimants have lived, and having occurred more than five years ago, is in no way a reliable indicator that every police department and every police officer in Hungary discriminates, or will discriminate, against Roma individuals in the future; particularly given the recent measures cited in the evidence that the police have taken to improve the monitoring of Roma legal rights and treatment. The panel finds that the actions of the court system establish, on a balance of probabilities, that Hungary is willing and able to provide operationally adequate state protection to Roma.\n[84] In Dinok,101 the Court stated that the RPD reflected in its analysis laws against abuses by the police, but went on to look at the evidence of how many disciplinary charges were prosecuted against members of the police force. As it was acknowledged in Hercegi,102 in Konya103 Madam Justice Snider explained the flaw with this argument:\nEach case will be decided on the basis of the facts and arguments before the court. In the course of analysis, a judge may express views of what the documentary evidence tends to show. However, these judicial comments cannot be elevated to factual findings. Only the Board is able to make such findings.\n[85] In Mudrak,104 the Court states:\n...[I]t is also incorrect to, in effect, reverse the presumption of adequate state protection in a democratic society when a country enacts legislation, or when there is evidence of increasing acts of violence, thereby requiring the Board to demonstrate the operational adequacy of measures taken to prevent incidents of persecution in its reasons.\n...Nor should the fact that a democratic government enacting legislation and putting other measures in place to combat persecution, somehow be seen as an admission of a failure of state protection. ...[E]xtensive and substantial legislation and other measures being undertaken should be treated as evidence supporting the democratic foundations of the country, thereby enhancing the presumption of adequate state protection as opposed to requiring the Board to demonstrate operational adequacy.\n[86] Based on the foregoing analysis, the panel finds that state protection measures put in place by the authorities in Hungary are demonstrative of the availability of recourse to obtain state protection for these claimants. The panel finds that these claimants, in their particular situation and circumstances, would nevertheless receive, although not perfect, adequate state protection upon return.\n[87] Despite the above, the panel acknowledges that the quality of life for most Roma in Hungary is not what it should be, but the evidence nonetheless shows that their existence is not threatened by the state. While the country's progress in combating racism is not as rapid, it is a slowly evolving process, the panel finds that Hungary is showing its commitment through its legislation and its actions, to achieve its stated goal for national inclusion of the Roma minority into mainstream society. It is, in the view of the panel, both unreasonable and insupportable for critics to expect that state measures should have prevented or eliminated all racism or acts of physical violence related to race.\n[88] Based on the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that Hungary is not only making serious efforts to turn around the endemic racism that has historically been present in Hungarian society, including in elements of its police forces, but it has also enacted legislation, developed infrastructure and functioning police forces at three levels, allocates defined and sustained funding and operates effectively by implementing Roma-focused programs and initiatives on the ground as identified herein. Further, state mechanisms operating independently within and outside the government apparatus demonstrate that protection is forthcoming and effective as evidenced in these reasons. The documentary evidence demonstrates that it is reasonable to expect authorities to take action when complaints are made, and that there are organizations in place to ensure that the police are held accountable. Therefore, while the panel acknowledges that the situation in Hungary is not perfect, operationally adequate state protection will be reasonably forthcoming to these claimants if they require it and if they diligently avail themselves of the modalities and remedies as presented by the state* should they seek such protection upon return to Hungary.\n[89] In the panel's view, it cannot characterize the principal claimant's experience with the police - particularly when referencing the alleged 2011 incident - as evidence of a lack of state protection. In reviewing his evidence against the totality of the evidence before it, the panel reasonably characterizes all of the evidence before it as highly comparable and contrasting insofar as the situation for Roma is considered. The panel prefers to assign persuasive weight to the extensive evidence before it to find that there has been demonstrative and positive results made by the state in recent years; through several fully operational, legislated programs, agencies and institutions to address substantively those examples and forms of discrimination and abuse perpetrated upon minorities, including Roma.105 Not only are such actions borne from the government's commitment to address substantively the plight of Roma but they have also been developed by virtue of Hungary's place as a member state of the European Union.\n[90] The panel finds that the claimants have not rebutted the presumption of state protection upon return to Hungary. The panel finds that adequate state protection would be reasonably forthcoming to them in their particular situation and circumstances, if they were to need it and were to diligently seek it upon return to Hungary. The panel also takes guidance from the Federal Court that each claim must be decided on its own merits.106 In other words, it is unreasonable to make sweeping generalizations that all Roma do not enjoy state protection. The panel finds that, in the circumstances particular to this case, these claimants have not established a serious possibility of persecution, or that they would, on a balance of probabilities, be personally subjected to a risk to life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or to a danger of torture upon return to Hungary.\n[91] Claimants have an obligation to approach the state for protection providing that state protection might be reasonably forthcoming.107 The claimants have the burden of providing clear and convincing evidence that they cannot obtain adequate state protection in Hungary. The principal claimant and the female claimant adduced no reliable evidence that they adequately sought state protection for the assaults. \"...If a refugee protection claimant failed to take all available measures to seek state protection, ...it is not enough to rely solely on documentary evidence of flaws in the justice system of the refugee protection claimant's country of origin.\"108 By not taking measures to seek state protection before making a claim for refugee protection, the applicant failed to rebut the presumption of state protection.109 In this case, and for the reasons already stated, the panel finds that the principal claimant did not approach the state for protection after his assault in 2011 and that the female claimant did not approach the police as she testified orally. In terms of the principal claimant's first experience with the police, the panel finds that the principal claimant did not give the police enough information for a successful investigation. The panel also finds that, when considered in the context of all the documentary evidence on state protection before it, the claimants have not rebutted the presumption of state protection in Hungary.\n[92] The panel notes that even beyond the work of the Hungarian Government regarding its efforts to improve the lives, experiences and opportunities of Roma, there are other sources available to these claimants and to Roma generally who require support and assistance. Among these are the Chance for Children Foundation (CFCF) is \"a Budapest-based Roma NGO founded with the express purpose of fighting structural discrimination against Roma and impoverished children in education through collective legal action coupled with community organising and local action.\" The European Roma Rights Centre (ERRC) is \"an international public interest law organisation working to combat anti-Romani racism and human rights abuse of Roma through strategic litigation, research and policy development, advocacy and human rights education.\" The Legal Defence Bureau for National and Ethnic Minorities (NEKI) is \"an NGO aiming to combat discrimination of Roma. Its main objectives are maintaining a free-of-charge legal aid service for disadvantaged Roma and conducting anti-discrimination strategic litigation.\" The Hungarian Helsinki Committee (HHC) is \"a non-profit organisation founded in 1989 in Hungary. The HHC monitors the enforcement in Hungary of human rights enshrined in international human rights instruments, provides legal defense to victims of human rights abuses by state authorities and informs the public about rights violations.\"\n[93] Most notable among the organizations charged with promoting and defending Roma rights within Hungary are the Nationality Self-Governments and the largest of these are the Roma Minority Self Governments. The National Documentation Package provides a comprehensive but succinct overview110 of these bodies and their role in promoting Roma rights.\nSources indicate that Roma are one of the 13 nationalities officially recognized by Hungary (Council of Europe 9 June 2015, para. 69; US 3 Mar. 2017, 56). Sources indicate that members of the 13 officially recognized nationalities, including the Roma minority, can register to vote for a \"minority list\" in parliamentary elections (Freedom House 19 May 2017; US 3 Mar. 2017, 56).\nThe US Department of State's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2016 indicates that the Hungarian law provides for the cultural autonomy of nationalities and recognizes the right to \"foster and enrich historic traditions, language, culture, and educational rights,\" as well as to form and operate institutions and \"maintain international contacts\" (US 3 Mar. 2017, 56). An article by Bal\u00e1zs Dobos, a researcher whose research interests include, among others, ethnicity, politics, the representation of minorities in public life and the Roma political parties in Hungary (HAS n.d.), published in 2016 by Autonomy Arrangements in the World [1], states that nationality self-governments [also known as minority self-governments] were created to guarantee the cultural autonomy of minorities and to allow them to decide on issues related to the establishment, operation and \"maintenance\" of cultural and educational institutions and media at the local and national levels (Dobos Jan. 2016, 19). A 2015 reply by the Hungarian government to the UN's Questionnaire of the Special Rapporteur on Minority Issues to Member States indicates that Roma self-governments contribute to the preservation of Roma cultural values, to the development of Roma institutions and organisations, and to the promotion of the Roma language (Hungary [30 Mar. 2015], 16).\n[94] The document notes111 that, \"as of January 2016, there are 1,147 local Roma self-governments (Hungary 1 Jan. 2016, 21). The same source provides the following information indicating the number of local Roma self-governments per region as of 1 January. The National Roma Self-Governments have the aim of:\npromot[ing] the social inclusion of the Roma and the efficient convergence of the Gypsy population\" (Hungary [30 Mar. 2015], 16). An undated document published by the Human Rights Working Group, founded in 2012 by the Hungarian government with the aim of monitoring human rights in Hungary and making recommendations to the government (Hungary n.d.a), explains that the 2011 framework agreement between the national Roma self-government and the Hungarian government established a cooperative decision-making scheme used for development and grant programmes, and for investment and employment initiatives that improve the quality of education and living conditions for Roma (Hungary n.d.b). The same source says that\n[t]he objective of the system is to help [the national Roma self-government] (as an organisation for the representation of the interests of the Roma) to guarantee that disadvantaged or destitute Roma and non-Roma children, young persons and adults participate in such programmes in adequate numbers and that these activities actually contribute to the betterment of their situation. (Hungary n.d.)112\nThe document also states113 that there is a Roma Coordination Council, which is:\na consultative body \"for social inclusion\" established by \"Government Decision No. 1102\/2011 (IV. 15.)\" (Hungary [30 Mar. 2015], 19). Its goal is to \"socialize\" the social inclusion policy and to monitor the implementation of the Framework Agreement between the Hungarian government and the national Roma self-government (Hungary [30 Mar. 2015], 19). The Roma Coordination Council's responsibilities include: \"raising awareness\" of the issues that hinder measures directed at the inclusion of Roma, giving opinions on proposals for action and on domestic and international reports, formulating proposals and developing professional networks, participating in the evaluation of \"tasks\" related to the social inclusion of Roma, and promoting the social inclusion of Roma (Hungary [30 Mar. 2015], 19).\nAccording to the same source, [The Roma Coordination Council's] co-chair is the president of the National Roma Self-Government. Its members include representatives of Roma NGOs, churches, local government associations, national and regional Roma self-governments, representatives of the National Economic and Social Council, the deputy of the commissioner for the protection of fundamental rights, who is responsible for the protection of the rights of nationalities living in Hungary, and the expert delegated by the President of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. The Equal Treatment Authority and Chairman of the Central Bureau of Statistics are permanent invitees of the Council. ... [T]here are two more permanent invitees in the Council: the Roma nationality spokesperson of the Committee of Nationalities in Hungar[y] of the National Assembly, as well as the president of the Christian Roma Vocational College Network. (Hungary [30 Mar. 2015], 19, emphasis in the original)\n[95] The panel notes that Roma are represented in Hungary's Parliament. For example, Article CCIII of 2011 on the Elections of Members of Parliament in Hungary provides the conditions under which the nationalities participate in the National Assembly.\nThe same source explains that a \"preferential quota,\" amounting to a quarter of the vote usually required to obtain a mandate in the National Assembly, was set for representatives of the recognized nationalities (Hungary [30 Mar. 2015], 16). According to the same source, should the preferential quota not help a representative of a certain nationality into the National Assembly, the law provides for the election of a spokesperson for that nationality, who can be the first person on the list of candidates of the nationality self-government (Hungary [30 Mar. 2015], 16-17).\nAnd: \"The US Country Reports 2016 states that the \"Romani minority had a spokesperson in parliament\" in 2016 (US 3 Mar. 2017, 56).114\n[96] The panel notes that Roma political parties have representation in the Government of Hungary and are represented in Hungary's Parliament. For example, Article CCIII of 2011 on the Elections of Members of Parliament in Hungary provides the conditions under which the nationalities participate in the National Assembly.115\nMCF is a Roma political party created in 2005 that collaborated with the Socialist government of Hungary (Ferkovics 2015, 8). According to the same source, MCF has been considered one of the \"most relevant Roma political entities competing with Longo Drom\" (Ferkovics 2015, 8). Similarly, in his 2010 book entitled Who Speaks for Roma? Political Representation of a Transnational Minority Community, Aidan McGarry, a Principal Lecturer in Politics at the University of Brighton, whose research \"focuses on political representation and participation of minority and marginalised communities, particularly Roma\" (University of Brighton n.d.), states that Lungo Drom and MCF Roma Union are the two largest Roma political organizations in Hungary (McGarry 2010, 123).\nAccording to sources, the head of Lungo Drom is Fl\u00f3ri\u00e1n Farkas (Ferkovics 2015, 7; MTI 27 May 2017). Without providing further detail, the same sources indicate that Lungo Drom has an \"electoral agreement\" with the ruling party [FIDESZ] (Ferkovics 2015, 7; MTI 27 May 2017).\nAccording to the Freedom House's report, Freedom in the World 2017, \"the Roma population in particular has long been underrepresented in political office\" (Freedom House 19 May 2017). In his 2015 thesis, Ferkovics cites Jeno Setet, a Roma civil rights defender and activist in Hungary, as stating that Roma political parties are not well established in local communities, because they are not \"preceded by long years of political work\" (Ferkovics 2015, 28). The same source further explains that according to a 2014 article by Dobos, on Roma ethnic parties in Hungary, 30 Roma political parties were registered in the two decades preceding 2014 (Ferkovics 2015, 27). And the Hungary Gypsy Party (MCP) ran in the 2014 elections \"to represent Roma interests, to fight Roma child poverty, to give free education in \"unsegregated schools\" and to give \"normal\" jobs to Roma (AFP 30 Mar. 2014).\"\n[97] The panel also notes that all Roma are permitted to complain about police behavior. The Board's Response to Information Request HUN 103826.E of 12 October 2011 explains that:116\nThe Independent Police Complaints Body, which is based in Budapest (Hungary 19 Sept. 2011), has been responsible for \"performing civil control over Police activities\" since 1 September 2007 (ibid. 16 Feb. 2011, para. 70). The Complaints Body is mainly involved in investigating \"complaints received in connection with police actions and omissions\" (ibid.). The HHC also noted that since 1 January 2008, the Complaints Body \"investigates violations and omissions committed by the Police, provided that such violations and omissions substantively concern fundamental rights\" (HHC 15 Sept. 2011). The Minorities Ombudsman specified that the Complaints Body receives complaints against the police for such things as discrimination and \"racial brutality\" (Hungary 19 Sept. 2011).\n[98] According to Hungary's UN submission, the Complaints Body is \"independent\" of the government to ensure that the rights of citizens are protected (ibid. 16 Feb. 2011, para. 70). The HHC also notes that the Complaints Body is \"functionally external to the police authorities, and [that] its budget is included into the budget line of the Office of the Hungarian Parliament\" (HHC 15 Sept. 2011). The five members of the Complaints Body are lawyers chosen by Parliament to serve a six-year term (Hungary 16 Feb. 2011, para. 70). According to the HHC, the members cannot be re-elected, and they must all be \"lawyers with outstanding experience in the field of fundamental rights protection\" (HHC 15 Sept. 2011).\n[99] According to Hungary's report to the UN, the National Police Commissioner (also translated as the National Chief of Police and Chief Police Captain) is required to submit monthly reports to the Complaints Body about \"complaints submitted to the Police\" (Hungary 16 Feb. 2011, para. 70). If the Complaints Body finds that a citizen's \"fundamental rights\" have been seriously violated, it sends its decision to the Police Commissioner (ibid.; HHC 15 Sept. 2011), \"who shall deliver a resolution within 30 days\" (Hungary 16 Feb. 2011, para. 70). Although the Police Commissioner \"delivers the decision on the individual complaint,\" he can only deviate from the Complaint Body's recommendation on \"the basis of detailed argumentation\" (HHC 15 Sept. 2011). The Police Commissioner's decision can be submitted to court for judicial review (ibid.; Hungary 16 Feb. 2011, para. 70; ibid. 19 Sept. 2011), as can decisions made by the Complaints Body (ibid.). The Minorities Ombudsman said that although the Police Commissioner can accept or refuse a decision from the Complaints Body, \"[i]n practice,\" he \"neglect[s]\" 90 percent of the Complaints Body's decisions (ibid.).\n[100] While the information on state protection in nevertheless finds that these claimants have not rebutted the presumption of state protection when they did not make sufficient efforts to ask the state authorities for assistance. Based on the insufficient efforts of the claimants to avail themselves of the protection of their own state and the objective country documentation before the panel, it finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimants have failed to adduce clear and convincing evidence that rebuts the presumption that Hungary provides adequate state protection at the operational level in response to discrimination against Roma persons. The panel also notes the actions of the government to improve the quality of life for the Roma, including the development of programs to enhance education, employment healthcare and housing, especially by launching important legal, policy and institutional tactical measures. 117 In contrast, the panel prefers its' reading of the evidence that establishes that operationally adequate state protection is available to these claimants should they return to Hungary.\nCONCLUSION\n[101] As the claimants have failed to rebut the presumption of adequate state protection, there is no serious possibility that the claimants will be persecuted if they return to Hungary. Further, on a balance of probabilities, their removal to Hungary will not subject them to a risk to life, to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or to a danger of torture.\n[102] For these reasons, the panel finds that XXXX XXXX (the principal claimant), his wife XXXX XXXX (the claimant) and their two XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX (minor claimants), are not Convention refugees. Their claims are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Reid Rossi\"\nR. ROSSI\nNovember 28, 2017\nDate\n1 The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, as amended.\n2 Can. Reg.

They claim refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The alleged circumstances underlying the claims are contained in the Claimants' Basis of Claim (\"BOC\") forms,2 and are supplemented by the Claimants' oral testimony and supporting documents.3 The Claimants relied on the same allegations and evidence.\n[3] The Claimants allege that they are sought by the Chinese authorities for their membership in an underground Christian church in China. By way of background, the Claimants, who are married to one another and are from XXXX province, both have a limited education and were both employed as workers in a XXXX factory. The Principal Claimant was born in XXXX 1966 and the Secondary Claimant was born in XXXX 1966.\n[4] The Principal Claimant began to suffer from migraine headaches in early 2013, which caused her personal difficulties. Her cousin introduced her to Christianity in XXXX 2013 and she began to attend services at a small, unregistered XXXX church in XXXX 2014. The Secondary Claimant began to attend services in XXXX 2014. In XXXX 2014, the Claimants learned that members of their church had been arrested by the Public Security Bureau (\"PSB\") and, as a result, they went into hiding. PSB officers attended their home on XXXX XXXX, 2014, and told the Claimants' son that the Claimants were to surrender themselves for their involvement in the underground church. The PSB subsequently returned with a summons.\n[5] On XXXX XXXX, 2014, the Claimants departed China with the assistance of a smuggler. They arrived in Canada later that same day. The smuggler took away their identity documents pending payment of his fees. In XXXX 2015, the Claimants learned that the Principal Claimant's cousin, who introduced her to Christianity, had been arrested by the PSB. In XXXX 2016, after paying the smuggler, they initiated claims for refugee protection. They fear arrest, imprisonment, abuse, and restrictions on their religious freedom by the Chinese authorities.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] For the reasons that follow, the Panel determines that the Claimants are not Convention refugees, nor persons in need of protection. Therefore, the claims are rejected.\nANALYSIS\n[7] The determinative issue in this case is credibility.\nIdentity\n[8] The Panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the Claimants have established both their personal identities and identities as nationals of China on the basis of their Resident Identity Cards (\"RIC\"s). The Principal Claimant provided her original RIC to the Panel, a copy of which is also in evidence.4 A certified true copy of the Secondary Claimant's RIC was provided by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (\"IRCC\").5 Having reviewed the RICs, the Panel is satisfied as to their authenticity.\nCredibility\n[9] After having heard the testimony of the Claimants and carefully considering the whole of the relevant evidence, as well as their counsel's able written submissions, the Panel has the following credibility concerns. As a result of these concerns, the Panel finds that the Claimants are not credible or trustworthy witnesses and finds that the allegations are not established.\nThe Claimants Delayed Claiming for Refugee Protection\n[10] The Panel does not find the Claimants' evidence that they fear harm by Chinese authorities to be credible as they delayed claiming for refugee protection in Canada for nearly two years after their arrival. Accordingly, the Panel draws a negative credibility inference upon their allegations that they are sought in China for practicing Christianity in that country.\n[11] In 2014, the Claimants applied for and were granted Canadian multiple-entry visitor visas, valid from May 2014 until early 2024.6 The Claimants arrived in Canada at XXXX by air on XXXX XXXX, 2014.7 They initiated their claims for refugee protection through BOC forms dated September 27, 2016. Their supporting declarations were declared before a Canadian immigration official on November 8, 2016.8\n[12] The Principal Claimant was asked what the Claimants' purpose was in travelling to Canada; she indicated it was to seek protection. She was then asked whether it was their intent when they departed China to make claims for refugee protection; she confirmed that they were seeking the protection of the Canadian government so that they could freely practice their religion. The Principal Claimant indicated that after discussions with the Secondary Claimant, she decided on the destination of Canada as she felt it was a safe place.\n[13] The Claimants' BOC narrative indicates that upon their arrival in Canada, the smuggler took their passports and RICs pending payment.9 Their narrative indicates that the smuggler warned them it would be \"unwise to seek refugee protection without proper identification\", advice which they confirmed through a consultation with an immigration consultant. The narrative indicates that they finally completed payment to the smuggler in XXXX 2016.\n[14] The Principal Claimant confirmed in testimony that they arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2014, and entered Canada through a customs checkpoint. She was asked by the Panel why they did not claim for refugee protection when at the customs checkpoint. She stated that they were advised by the smuggler not to claim for refugee protection at the airport because there was a possibility of arrest. The Principal Claimant was asked why she believed circumstances would be different if a claim for protection was made after the airport; she indicated that she did not know and that they had followed the smuggler's advice.\n[15] The Principal Claimant was then asked to explain why there was a delay in claiming for refugee protection, given the Claimants' arrival in XXXX 2014 and the completion of their BOC forms in September 2016. She stated that the smuggler took their documents. She also testified that she had asked their fellow churchgoers if she could file a claim for refugee protection; she indicated that she was advised by the churchgoers not to do so without any documentation. The Panel asked if she did anything else to inform herself of the requirements for a refugee protection claim; she indicated that she had no one to seek advice from other than her fellow churchgoers. She then confirmed that she had only sought advice from fellow churchgoers. She was asked whether the churchgoers had special knowledge of immigration matters; she indicated that they did not, and that she relied on them because they were the only people that she knew in Canada.\n[16] The Panel noted to the Principal Claimant that her narrative indicates that she consulted with an immigration consultant; she then responded that they did consult and that the Panel had not specifically inquired about the use of a consultant. The Panel noted to the Principal Claimant that she had confirmed that she had only consulted with churchgoers. The Principal Claimant then testified that it was her fellow churchgoers that had called the consultant and spoke to the consultant on her behalf. The Panel noted to the Principal Claimant that the narrative states that \"we confirmed\" with an immigration consultant, thereby indicating that the Claimants had been in contact with the consultant; she responded that \"we\" was meant to refer to the Claimants and the churchgoers. The Panel asked the Principal Claimant why she did not mention that the churchgoers had contacted an immigration consultant when asked whether the churchgoers had special knowledge of immigration matters. She indicated that the churchgoers did not have special knowledge and that they had simply telephoned the immigration consultant on behalf of the Claimants.\n[17] The Principal Claimant confirmed that the Claimants did not claim for refugee protection as they were concerned that they could not prove their identity. She was asked if they had considered proving their identity through alternative means, such as through their household registration, their birth certificates, and affidavits. She indicated that they had not because they did not believe there were other methods of proof.\n[18] The Panel asked the Principal Claimant whether the Claimants were concerned that they were in Canada for nearly two years without filing a refugee protection claim. She indicated that they were fearful to the point that they did not dare to go out, even to use the subway.\n[19] As reflected in Semextant v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) and the cases cited therein, the Federal Court and the Federal Court of Appeal have consistently held that a refugee claimant has an obligation to claim asylum as soon as possible upon entry in a country where protection is available.10 A claimant's failure to seek protection at the earliest available opportunity may undermine the claim, as such a failure may indicate a lack of subjective fear.11 Such conduct may also undermine the credibility of the testimony.12 Although such actions are not an automatic bar to a claim, the Panel is entitled to consider such factors in its assessment of a claimant's credibility.13\n[20] In Ibrahim v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), which was a judicial review of a Refugee Appeal Division (\"RAD\") decision, the RAD had drawn a negative credibility inference due to a delay in claiming for refugee protection.14 The basis for the claim arose over the period of February 2014 through to May 2014, but a refugee protection claim was not made until the end of November 2014.15 The applicant possessed a valid work visa at the time of her claim.16 Mr. Justice Zinn stated as follows with respect to the RAD's assessment of the delay:\nThe applicant also challenged the RAD's finding that her delay in claiming also diminished her credibility relating to her fear. I am unconvinced. Here there was a substantial delay, and the fact that the applicant still had a right to work in Canada did not grant her status to remain in Canada after it expired. Accordingly, it was not unreasonable to expect a person who feared to return to her country of origin to take active and timely steps to regularize her status in Canada so that she would not have to return home.17\n[emphasis added]\n[21] The Panel rejects the Claimants' explanation for their delay in claiming refugee protection. The Claimants' BOC narrative indicates that they relied on the advice of an immigration consultant in delaying their claim. However, the Principal Claimant's evidence respecting the use of an immigration consultant was inconsistent and evolved during examination. Initially, the Principal Claimant failed to mention in her oral testimony the use of an immigration consultant, instead indicating that the Claimants only relied on the advice of their fellow churchgoers, when asked to explain what steps the Claimants took to inform themselves of the refugee protection process. Once this inconsistency in her testimony versus the BOC narrative was noted to her, she responded that they did use an immigration consultant, but that the Panel had not asked about the use of one. However, the Panel had asked broadly about the steps taken by the Claimants in informing themselves of the process. Further, once it was noted to her that she had confirmed their reliance only on the churchgoers' advice, the Principal Claimant's testimony then shifted again to indicate that it was actually the churchgoers that had consulted with the immigration consultant on behalf of the Claimants.\n[22] This is not consistent with the Claimants' own narrative, which indicates that \"we confirmed this through a consultation with an immigration consultant\". Further, when initially questioned about their reliance on the churchgoers, insofar as whether the churchgoers had some form of special knowledge regarding immigration matters, the Principal Claimant did not make any reference to the churchgoers having consulted with an immigration consultant.\n[23] As a result of the inconsistent and evolving testimony, the Panel is not satisfied that the Claimants relied on the advice of an immigration consultant, whether directly or through fellow churchgoers, in delaying their claim for refugee protection. Further, owing to the credibility issues in this area, the Panel does not find the Principal Claimant's explanations for the nearly two year delay to be credible and those explanations are, therefore, rejected.\n[24] The Claimants allegedly fled China while being actively sought by authorities in order to seek refugee protection in Canada. Despite this, upon their arrival, they simply passed through a customs checkpoint instead of identifying themselves to Canadian officials as seeking protection. The Claimants allegedly believed that they may have been arrested if they approached Canadian authorities at the airport to identify themselves as refugee claimants. Yet, they left China for the very purpose of seeking protection from Canadian authorities. The Principal Claimant's explanation is paradoxical. For that reason, the Panel does not find this explanation to be credible.\n[25] Further, and more problematic, is the nearly two years that passed between the Claimants' arrival in Canada and their initiation of claims for refugee protection. This is a substantial period of time. During this time, they not only allegedly feared harm in China, but they also allegedly feared problems with Canadian authorities for not taking action with their refugee claims. For the above reasons, this delay was not credibly explained.\n[26] As per Semextant and Ibrahim, the Panel finds that, in all of the circumstances, the Claimants' alleged fear of harm by Chinese authorities for their purported practice of Christianity is not credible. Accordingly, the Panel draws a negative credibility inference upon their evidence that they are sought by authorities in China for practicing Christianity in that country.\nThe Claimants Exited from the XXXX Airport while Wanted by Chinese Authorities\n[27] The Panel draws a further negative credibility inference upon the Claimants' evidence that they are sought by the PSB for practising Christianity as they were able to exit the country through an international airport under their own identity.\n[28] The Claimants departed China by air on XXXX XXXX, 2014, travelling direct from XXXX to XXXX.18 The Principal Claimant confirmed that the airport they travelled from in XXXX was a large, international airport. They travelled on passports in their own name;19 their boarding passes were also issued in their own names.20 The Claimants allege that they were aided in exiting China through the use of a smuggler.\n[29] As noted, PSB officers had allegedly attended at the Claimants' residence on XXXX XXXX, 2014, at which time the officers searched the residence and questioned their son regarding their whereabouts as well as their religious associations.21 The PSB officers also informed their son that the Claimants were wanted for involvement in an illegal religious group and demanded the immediate surrender of the Claimants.22 On or about XXXX XXXX, 2014, PSB officers returned and served a summons for the Claimants to their son.23 The PSB officers also attended at the homes of various relatives to make inquiries.24 Therefore, the Claimants were clearly wanted by the authorities at the time of their departure.\n[30] The Principal Claimant provided details of the procedures the Claimants encountered when departing through the XXXX airport on XXXX XXXX, 2014. She indicated that the smuggler went to the check-in counter to obtain the boarding passes for the Claimants; he was in possession of their passports at this point. The Principal Claimant indicated that the Claimants were then provided their passports in order to pass through security screening; she indicated that she presented her passport at this stage, but that it was not scanned into a computer. The Claimants then returned their passports to the smuggler, who then proceeded to the customs checkpoint, which the Principal Claimant described as the \"VIP\" special customs checkpoint.\n[31] The smuggler subsequently called the Claimants over to the customs checkpoint; both of their passports were stamped by a customs officer and the Claimants were allowed to proceed. The Principal Claimant indicated that she did not clearly observe whether the passports were scanned into a computer by the officer. She indicated that she did not know when the boarding passes were stamped, although she confirmed that they were stamped at the airport.\n[32] Following customs, the Claimants' passports were returned to them. The Principal Claimant described providing her passport and boarding pass to airline staff immediately prior to boarding the aircraft. She testified that her passport was looked at by the staff member, but it was not scanned into a computer.\n[33] The Panel asked the Principal Claimant whether she knew how the Claimants were able to pass through the XXXX airport while wanted by Chinese authorities. She indicated that, according to the smuggler, he had bribed the customs personnel so that they could successfully pass through the checkpoint.\n[34] The National Documentation Package (\"NDP\") for China describes the general security procedures at Chinese airports.25 According to a Canadian embassy official in Beijing, a traveller will pass through four points: a check-in counter, a security checkpoint for entry into the airport's secure zone, departure immigration where border authorities are located, and the boarding gate; at each of the points, the traveller's passport may be checked, with scanning occurring at the check-in counter and the immigration checkpoint.26 The Panel infers here that the immigration checkpoint is the same as a customs checkpoint. Another source cited in the NDP, an assistant director for aviation security at the International Air Transport Association (\"IATA\"), indicates that three checkpoints exist, without making reference to the boarding gate, and states that a traveller's passport is checked at each of these locations.27 The IATA official also noted that specific departure procedures vary at each airport, but that the general procedures are consistent.28\n[35] The NDP also indicates that freedom to exit China is not absolute.29 Under Article 12 of the Exit and Entry Administration Law of China, exit from the country is denied under certain circumstances, including instances where the citizen does not hold valid exit documents, or is a suspect or defendant in a criminal case.30 Chinese border authorities have also effectively implemented exit control measures, although there are isolated incidents of successful evasion.31\n[36] As an aid to exit control measures, border authorities have access to a government computer system known as \"Policenet\" or \"Golden Shield,\" which contains a database of fugitives and those convicted of offences; it appears that this database is automatically searched when border authorities scan a passport.32 More broadly, the system, designed as a vast network of surveillance infrastructure, is both powerful and pervasive in its monitoring of Chinese citizens.33 Through it, Chinese authorities are able to \"search out any Chinese citizen's photograph, work history, family background, political leanings, Internet history, and at least 60 days of emails.\"34 The system is described as \"multi-pronged\" in its approach to locating and identifying problematic individuals.35 Further, it is also mobile and easily accessible.36 The system has been said to allow the security services to \"ferret out political dissidents and Falun Gong practitioners for years.\"37 Predictably, all police services nationwide, via the system, have access to a citizen's border exit and entry information.38 Designers of the system also appear to have taken system security and integrity into account, and have implemented identity authentication and access control measures; it also appears that anti-hacker intrusion and virus detection are considerations in the system's implementation.39\n[37] In addition, Chinese border authorities are provided what is described as \"advance passenger information\" on arriving and departing passengers.40 This information contains a number of details of that passenger, including full name; date of birth; gender; nationality; country of residence; travel document type; and passport number, expiry date, and issuing country.41 With respect to flights into the country, it appears that China maintains a \"stop list,\" which bars the passenger from boarding the aircraft; however, the NDP remains silent on whether a similar list exists for outbound flights.42 In any event, it is evident that border authorities are provided detailed information on the passengers aboard outbound flights.\n[38] The Panel does not accept the Claimants' evidence as credible with respect to their passage through the XXXX airport while wanted by the PSB. The Panel is cognizant of the explanation that a smuggler was used in order to successfully pass through the XXXX airport. The Panel is also aware that such individuals are engaged in the business of smuggling people. Although the Panel does accept that there may be successful evasion of border controls and that a smuggler may successfully bribe border authorities, in the circumstances described in this matter, the Panel finds that the Claimants were not able to circumvent such controls if they were wanted by the PSB.\n[39] The Claimants, on their own evidence, appear to have followed a generally standard boarding procedure, passing through security screening, a customs checkpoint, and the boarding gate. There were some atypical aspects described, based on the NDP information, with regard to the smuggler obtaining the boarding passes from the check-in counter and calling the Claimants over to the customs checkpoint after first approaching the checkpoint with their passports. However, these details, on their own, do not indicate that China's pervasive exit controls would be defeated.\n[40] The Panel also notes that the Claimants indicated that they passed through a \"VIP\" customs checkpoint. However, there is no evidence before the Panel that indicates that a \"VIP\" customs checkpoint would impose less stringent exit controls upon travellers or that those travellers would be excluded from detection through the Golden Shield\/Policenet system. Further, the actions of the customs official here do not suggest that the official had been compromised, as the official stamped the Claimants' passports, thereby indicating that the Claimants had been processed by a customs official. Their boarding passes were also stamped, indicating that they had been processed, at some stage, by airport officials.\n[41] Even if it is accepted that the Claimants passed through the customs checkpoint with the assistance of compromised airport personnel, the Claimants' own passports were used as identification at the airport. Further, their boarding passes were also in their names. These factors indicate that they would be registered in the airport's computer systems and, considering the objective country documentation regarding advance passenger information, their travel would be subject to detection by the authorities.\n[42] The remaining issue, then, is the potential for the wanted status of the Claimants to have been simply deleted from the system by a corrupt official or for the system to have been otherwise manipulated to prevent detection of the Claimants. Some jurisprudence has taken the view that \"one official with access to the computer system would be sufficient\".43 However, that original statement was based on country condition material dating from February 2001.44\n[43] In the case at bar, the material before the Panel respecting the Golden Shield\/Policenet system is from 2014, which is an era apart from 2001 in terms of technology. That material indicates that the system takes a \"multi-pronged\" approach in identifying individuals of concern; there are also various measures in place to guard against improper usage and to ensure system integrity. The Panel finds, based on this evidence, that removing the wanted status or otherwise preventing detection of a fugitive in the Chinese government's centralized and powerful law enforcement network would be a formidable task and not easily accomplished. Determinations of fact are made on a balance of probabilities versus possibility. The Panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the Golden Shield\/Policenet system was not manipulated to remove the wanted status of the Claimants.\n[44] While the Panel acknowledges that Federal Court jurisprudence is mixed on the issue of exiting China on one's own identity while wanted, there are decisions of that court that have found a negative credibility finding by the Board to be reasonable in circumstances similar to the present case.45 This latter view was upheld very recently by Mr. Justice Brown in Yan v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration).46\n[45] As the Claimants were able to exit China on their own identity with their own travel documents in the manner described, despite allegedly being the target of an aggressive campaign by the PSB to locate and arrest them, the Panel finds that they were not wanted by the PSB when they passed through the XXXX airport. Based on the evidence before the Panel in this matter and for the reasons set out above, the Panel draws a further negative credibility inference upon the Claimants' evidence that they are wanted by the Chinese authorities as a result of their alleged practice of Christianity in China.\nThe Claimants' Hukou and Testimony Undermine their Personal Profiles\n[46] The Panel draws a negative inference upon the Claimants' general credibility as their personal profiles have been undermined by an inconsistent design to their household registration document, or hukou, and inconsistencies in their oral testimony.\n[47] The Claimants submitted a copy of their purported hukou into evidence.47 It provides details as to their personal backgrounds, including with respect to their employment and education. With regard to the Principal Claimant, it indicates that she is a worker at a XXXX factory who reached the middle school level; with regard to the Secondary Claimant, the hukou indicates that he is a skilled worker at a XXXX factory who also reached the middle school level. The hukou shows an issuance date of XXXX XXXX, 2014. The Panel examined the original hukou; it was comprised of a burgundy cover with loose, light blue pages placed into separate plastic sleeves within the booklet cover.\n[48] The Secondary Claimant alleged that he obtained the hukou directly from the PSB in XXXX 2014. He was asked about the use of plastic sleeves versus a sewn booklet binding. He indicated that when it was obtained in 2014, all hukous issued in the Claimants' city followed the same format as the hukou that is in evidence. In follow-up testimony, the Principal Claimant indicated that she went to the PSB in XXXX 2014 to get an updated hukou and that the loose pages were provided with the updated information. However, the old hukou cover was not updated. She indicated that the Secondary Claimant was in error in his indication that he had been the one to obtain the hukou.\n[49] According to a Canadian embassy official in Beijing in January 2015, hukou records issued prior to 2006 were comprised of a booklet and loose pages.48 For hukou records issued since 2006, the pages were stitched into the booklet itself.49 The official further stated that, although hukou document registration is not centralized, standardized, or well-regulated, hukou documents are relatively the same with respect to appearance and security features, with some \"slight differences\" by locality, \"especially among older hukou documents\".50 Another source, a senior researcher from the China Law Center at Yale University Law School who conducted independent research on hukou documents, indicated in January 2015 that hukou physical and security features follow a nationwide standard that is determined by the Ministry of Public Safety.51 A professor of international relations at Georgia Institute of Technology, who has published research on the hukou system, also indicated that there are national regulations on the standardization of the hukou booklet, although some hukou documents, such as residence and temporary permits, feature some regional variation, such as the style and color of the cover.52\n[50] Although the sources cited above disagree as to whether hukou documents are completely standardized, it is clear from the same sources that hukou booklets are essentially consistent, with older documents more subject to variation. Indeed, two academic sources that have specifically conducted research on hukou documentation agree on the use of a consistent design. Therefore, it is evident, on a balance of probabilities, that post-2006 hukou booklets are of a stitched design.\n[51] The Claimants' hukou, purportedly issued XXXX XXXX, 2014, used loose entry pages; it was, therefore, of an obsolete design that had not been used for approximately seven to eight years prior to its issuance. The intervening years are a significant period of time to permit the local PSB office to align with the contemporary hukou design. This, in itself, leads the Panel to have concerns with respect to the authenticity of the Claimants' hukou.\n[52] Even more problematically, however, is that these concerns arise in the context of incongruent and vague details regarding the Claimants' personal profiles, particularly their employment histories. The Claimants' Canadian visa applications indicate that they have relatively accomplished backgrounds.53 The visa application with respect to the Principal Claimant indicates that she was a XXXX factory technician from XXXX 1992 to XXXX 2010; however, the material also indicates that she was a XXXX owner from XXXX 2010 to XXXX 2014. The visa application with respect to the Secondary Claimant indicates that he studied accounting at the XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX 1993 to XXXX 1996, was section chief of a XXXX factory from XXXX 1983 to XXXX 2007, and was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX 2007 to XXXX 2014. The visa applications were allegedly completed by the smuggler.\n[53] During her initial testimony, the Principal Claimant indicated that she had a total of XXXX years of education and worked from XXXX 1983 to XXXX 2014 in a XXXX factory workers' XXXX. The Secondary Claimant indicated in his testimony, following the Principal Claimant, that he had a Grade XXXX education and worked as a XXXX worker at a XXXX factory. He denied that he studied at XXXX XXXX XXXX. He was asked if he was ever a section chief in his employment; he indicated that he had been in that position for over XXXX years. When asked as to the timeframe, he indicated that he did not recall, but that it was perhaps from 2005. He was then asked whether he had ever been a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX; he indicated that he had been many years earlier. When asked about the timeframe, he indicated that he did not recall, but he was in the role for a period of approximately two weeks before he was found to be incapable of the position. He then testified that the Principal Claimant was a XXXX owner from approximately 2011 to 2013 and that she held no other employment during that period.\n[54] Following the Secondary Claimant's testimony, the Principal Claimant was recalled and provided an opportunity to respond to the Secondary Claimant's testimony regarding her ownership of a XXXX. She indicated that there had been a XXXX in her XXXX, but that someone else was the chef. She further indicated that the XXXX was close to the XXXX factory where she worked and that she would sometimes assist at the restaurant after work. The Principal Claimant was asked why the XXXX ownership was not mentioned in her supporting declaration which set out details of her employment.54 She indicated that she did not benefit from the XXXX; the real owner was the chef, who placed the XXXX into her name in order to make it easier to obtain a license from the city, as his hukou was from the countryside.\n[55] At best, the Claimants' testimony respecting their employment backgrounds is nebulous. The Principal Claimant initially alleged that she was a factory XXXX worker for much, if not the entirety, of her working life. Yet, after the Secondary Claimant agreed that the Principal Claimant was a XXXX owner for a number of years, she confirmed that she was, but only on paper, and that she only occasionally helped at the restaurant after working at her own regular employment. However, this conflicts with the Secondary Claimant's testimony that the Principal Claimant held no other employment while the owner of the XXXX. In terms of the Secondary Claimant, he allegedly had an upward management trajectory in his employment, before being employed most recently as a XXXX worker. However, he was unable to provide clear timeframes as to his management positions, despite holding one position in excess of XXXX years. Further, after apparently reaching a senior management position in a XXXX XXXX, he returned to a XXXX factory as a XXXX worker. Overall, the evidence respecting their personal backgrounds was incongruent and vague.\n[56] Returning to the Claimants' hukou, the Panel notes that the obsolete design of that document lends itself to easier manipulation than the current design, as the loose pages may simply be placed into the plastic sleeve without any binding into the booklet. Such ease of manipulation is preferential in the use of inauthentic documents. Further, the Panel also notes that fraudulent documents, including hukous, are widely available in China.55\n[57] With respect to the Claimants' hukou design, the Panel prefers the country condition material in this area over the Claimants' testimony, as the former is based on objective, knowledgeable sources of information that have no interest in the outcome of this matter. Further, there was conflicting testimony between the Claimants as to who obtained the hukou and, as outlined above, there are additional credibility concerns related to the Claimants' personal backgrounds. The country condition material indicates that the Claimants' hukou design followed a long-obsolete design at the time of its issuance and, therefore, its design is inconsistent with the document's expected design.\n[58] Accordingly, in all of the circumstances, the Panel finds that the Claimants' hukou was not obtained from the PSB and is not authentic. As the hukou contains details of the Claimants' personal backgrounds, such as their employment and education, coupled with the vague and incongruent testimony respecting their employment, the Panel draws a negative credibility inference upon their alleged personal backgrounds. Such details are critical in assessing the Claimants' actions and the quality of their testimony; further, such details are elementary aspects of credibility. As a result, the Panel also draws a negative inference regarding their general credibility.\nThe Genuineness of the Claimants' Christian Practice Turns on Credibility\n[59] The Claimants provided details of their Christian practice in both China and Canada. As noted, they allege that they were members of an underground church in China. Both Claimants allege that they now regularly attend the XXXX XXXX XXXX church in Canada. The Principal Claimant testified as to why Christian practice was significant to her and spoke about her favourite Biblical story. The Secondary Claimant also testified as to why his religious practice was significant to him, indicating that people are nice to each other at church and that it is a nice religion in which he believes.\n[60] Christianity is a faith-based religion; it is trite law that the jurisprudence has repeatedly cautioned the RPD from entering into a stringent knowledge-based analysis in determining genuineness of religious belief, particularly with respect to Christianity and other faith-based religions. It is, therefore, important to consider the totality of the evidence.\n[61] The Claimants provided baptismal certificates from their church in Canada, photographs of their baptism, and a letter of reference from a Rev. XXXX XXXX, indicating that they attend and are involved in XXXX XXXX XXXX church and that he \"trust[s] them that they are the real Christians\".56 While baptismal certificates and photographs of the baptism are indicative that the Claimants were baptized, the materials do not, in themselves, indicate the genuineness of the Claimants' alleged practice. With respect to the letter, while it is indicative that the Claimants have attended the church for a period of time, attendance in itself does not, again, indicate the genuineness of practice. As for Rev. XXXX assessment that he trusts the Claimants to be genuine Christians, it is for the Panel to make that determination for the purposes of this process.57\n[62] There was no documentary material placed into evidence respecting the Claimants' alleged practice of Christianity in China.\n[63] In Li v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), a claim involving the practice of Falun Gong, Mr. Justice LeBlanc stated as follows:\nUltimately, the RPD is tasked with determining if adherence to Falun Gong is motivated solely by a desire to support a refugee claim, in which case it is open to the RPD to find that the claimant's religious beliefs are not genuine, or if the claimant has developed faith to a point where he or she has become a true adherent to that religion, even if, initially, the adherence to that religion might have been motivated to support a refugee claim.\n[...] Findings that the claimant lacks credibility, that he or she has fabricated stories about practising the claimed religion in the country of origin and that his or her knowledge of the details of the claimed religion is lacking, have been held by this Court to reasonably support a conclusion that the sincerity of the claimant's religious beliefs is not genuine.58\n[citations omitted]\n[64] Therefore, it is helpful here to consider the genuineness of the Claimants' professed practice of Christianity through the lens of their overall credibility, including whether their allegations of practice in China are credible.\nThe Claimants' Allegations of Practice in China are Not Credible\n[65] The Panel has found credibility issues in three areas of this claim: first, with respect to a significant delay of nearly two years in claiming for refugee protection; second, with respect to the Claimants' ability to exit China on their own identities while purportedly sought by the PSB; and third, with respect to the Claimants' personal profiles, which included a finding that they had submitted an inauthentic hukou into evidence.\n[66] These issues have led the Panel to draw negative credibility inferences upon the Claimants' evidence of being sought by authorities in China for practicing Christianity in an underground church. As the PSB is the alleged agent of persecution, the issue of the PSB's pursuit of the Claimants is a central component of the claims. Further, specifically with respect to the credibility issues around their personal profiles, this has resulted in a general negative credibility inference. As noted above, the Claimants' personal backgrounds are critical in assessing their actions and the quality of their testimony. Further, such details are elementary aspects of credibility. In addition, their reliance on fraudulent documentation before the Panel is a significant credibility concern as it is indicative of the manufacturing of evidence. As a result, the credibility issues arising with respect to their personal backgrounds are also central to the claims.\n[67] Therefore, given the constellation of negative credibility inferences on central aspects of the claim and the finding that false documentation was submitted in evidence, the Panel finds, as per Sheikh v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration),59 that the cumulative effect undermines the credibility of the Claimants in general. Accordingly, the Panel finds that the Claimants are not credible or trustworthy witnesses. Further, the Panel finds that this lack of general credibility extends to all relevant aspects of their evidence.\n[68] In making this finding, the Panel has considered the totality of the relevant documentary evidence. The number of significant credibility issues, coupled with the finding that false documentation has been tendered in evidence by way of the hukou and the objective country documentation material which indicates that fraudulent documents are widespread in China,60 leads the Panel to assign little weight to the remaining corroborative documents going to the Claimant's allegations of persecution, such as a purported summons and arrest notice for the Principal Claimant's cousin.61 The Panel is guided in this assessment by the decision in Huang v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) and the authorities cited therein; a claimant's \"overall credibility may affect the weight given to the documentary evidence\".62\n[69] With respect to the alleged summons in particular, the Panel also notes that, despite the Claimants' non-compliance with the summons, there was no evidence that a coercive summons was issued in follow-up. This is inconsistent with the country documentation. The summons in evidence, addressed to both Claimants, is purportedly issued pursuant to s. 82 of the Public Security Administrative Punishment Law of the People's Republic of China (sic) (\"PSAPL\").63\n[70] Article 82 of the PSAPL indicates that anyone who evades a public security administration summons may be summoned by force.64 Article 74 of the Ministry of Public Security's Regulations Concerning the Handling of Criminal Cases by Public Security Authorities empowers authorities to issue a coercive summons in order to bring a suspect to a specified location for questioning where that individual has failed to respond to a summons issued by the public security authority.65\n[71] The Panel notes that there are numerous decisions of the Refugee Appeal Division in which it was found, in similar circumstances, that non-compliance with a summons would result in the issuance of a coercive summons and the lack of such evidence is a basis for a negative inference regarding the allegations of pursuit by the PSB, as well as the authenticity of related documentation.66\n[72] Counsel was invited to make submissions on the matter. After considering those submissions, the Panel finds that non-compliance with a summons within the context of the present allegations would, on a balance of probabilities, result in the issuance of a coercive summons. There was no evidence before the Panel that the issuance of a coercive summons occurred in this matter despite the non-compliance. Accordingly, the Panel finds that this provides a further basis to doubt the authenticity of the summons, as well as the PSB arrest notice pertaining to the Principal Claimant's cousin.67 With respect to the latter, the Panel also notes that the document does not directly pertain to the Claimants' status with the PSB.\n[73] Consequently, the Panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the Claimants were never sought by authorities in China. Further, given the totality of circumstances and again on a balance of probabilities, the Panel finds that the Claimants never practiced Christianity in an underground church in China or otherwise. Accordingly, the Panel is not satisfied that the claims, insofar as the allegations, are established whether they are assessed pursuant to s. 96 or ss. 97(1) of IRPA. The specific allegations are not credible.\nPractice in Canada\/Refugee Sur Place\n[74] As noted, the Claimants allege that they continue to practice Christianity in Canada. As noted, there is evidence of their regular attendance and involvement in a church in Canada. The remaining issue, then, is whether the Claimants' alleged practice of Christianity in Canada is sufficient to establish a claim pursuant to s. 96 or s. 97(1) of IRPA.\n[75] The Panel is entitled to \"import its credibility findings into its assessment of an applicant's sur place claim.\"68 The Panel has already determined that the Claimants are not credible or trustworthy witnesses in general and has found that they were not members of an underground church in China. The Claimants' Christian practice in Canada is allegedly an extension of their practice in China; the practice in China has been found not to be credible. There is insufficient evidence before the Panel of a conversion following the Claimants' arrival in Canada. As such, the Panel further finds that the Claimants participated in church activities in Canada for the express purpose of bolstering their refugee protection claims. Consequently, the Panel is not satisfied that the Claimants would practice Christianity upon return to China.\n[76] The Panel must also consider whether the Claimants' participation in Christian activities in Canada has come or will come to the attention of Chinese authorities and whether the Claimants will face more than a mere possibility of persecution as a result.69 There is insufficient evidence before the Panel to indicate that the Claimants' Christian practice in Canada has come to the attention of Chinese authorities. Further, the Panel is not aware of any evidence before it, nor was it directed to any, that indicates that Chinese nationals who practice Christianity in Canada, at least insofar as Pentecostalism, would be of any concern to Chinese authorities. The Panel notes here that Christianity itself is not illegal in China.70 Indeed, China's government provides official recognition of five religions: Catholicism, Protestantism, Buddhism, Taoism, and Islam.71\n[77] Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to establish that the Claimants have come to the attention of Chinese authorities, or would come to their attention, and, further, that the Claimants would face more than a mere possibility of persecution in China as a result of their religious activities in Canada. Accordingly, the Panel is not satisfied that a sur place claim has been established, whether it is assessed pursuant to s. 96 or ss. 97(1) of IRPA, the latter of which requires a higher standard of risk than the former.\nCONCLUSION\n[78] The Panel concludes that the Claimants are not Convention refugees, pursuant to s. 96 of IRPA, as they do not face a serious possibility of persecution in China. The Panel further finds that the Claimants are not persons in need of protection pursuant to ss. 97(1) of IRPA. Therefore, the claims are rejected.\n(signed)\nRobert L.

He claims refugee protection pursuant to subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1 Counsel indicated at the hearing that a claim was not being made pursuant to section 96 of IRPA.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The alleged circumstances underlying the claim are contained in the Claimant's Basis of Claim (\"BOC\") form,2 and are supplemented by the Claimant's oral testimony and supporting documents.3\n[3] The Claimant alleges that he will be harmed if he returns to Mexico as he has been targeted for extortion through telephone calls by an unknown person or persons. By way of background, the Claimant was born in 1976 in XXXX XXXX. For the last 33 years, he has resided in XXXX, XXXX, which he described as a small town of approximately XXXX XXXX XXXX. He completed high school and worked over a number of years as a XXXX XXXX in Mexico. Since 2008, the Claimant has been employed in Canada on work visas for various periods as a XXXX worker. Between jobs in Canada, he returned to Mexico, during which time he continued to work as a XXXX XXXX.\n[4] The allegations provided by the Claimant in his BOC form are exceedingly brief. However, he was examined with respect to the details of his allegations. The Claimant testified that he began to receive threats by telephone at the beginning of 2013. He received the most recent threat in XXXX 2015. Over that time, the phone calls were made to him approximately XXXX a month. He alleged that he received the phone calls only on his cellular phone while at home in XXXX. He was not threatened through other means.\n[5] The Claimant described the first threat that he received. He indicated that the caller identified himself as the chief of police, specifically a XXXX XXXX, and that the caller could provide protection to the Claimant if he complied with a demand for payment of 80,000 pesos. If the Claimant failed to comply, he was told he would suffer consequences. The Claimant stated that he did not believe the caller was a police officer, because the name that the caller provided was not consistent with the name of the local police chief.\n[6] The Claimant stated that he was not certain whether the caller for each phone call was the same individual. However, he indicated that the caller was always a male, always identified himself as a police officer, and the amount demanded always remained the same. The phone calls were made from a private number. Over time, the phone calls allegedly became more aggressive. However, the Claimant never made payment to the caller nor were there any apparent attempts to harm him for his non-compliance.\n[7] As noted, the last extortion demand was received in XXXX 2015. The Claimant was told that if he did not pay, the caller would go to the Claimant's home; he was also threatened with death. He decided, as a result of this call, that it would be too dangerous to remain in Mexico. In XXXX 2016, the Claimant travelled to Canada on a work visa, although his stated purpose was to seek refugee protection. Upon his arrival, however, he worked at a farm until XXXX 2016, the month that his work visa expired. In January 2017, he initiated a claim for refugee protection.\n[8] The Claimant fears that if he returns to Mexico, the caller will carry out the threats to harm him and, as a result, he believes that his life is in danger. The Claimant indicated that he experienced no other problems in Mexico.\nDETERMINATION\n[9] For the reasons that follow, the Panel determines that the Claimant is not a person in need of protection, pursuant to ss. 97(1) of IRPA.\n[10] As noted, counsel for the Claimant indicated that a claim for Convention refugee status was not being made pursuant to s. 96 of IRPA. In any event, nexus considerations aside, as a result of the Panel's findings with respect to state protection and objective fear, as set out below, the Panel finds that the claim does not satisfy s. 96 of IRPA and, therefore, the Claimant is not a Convention refugee.\n[11] Accordingly, the claim is rejected.\nANALYSIS\n[12] The determinative issue in this case is state protection. In the alternative, the determinative issue is the likelihood of harm, or the objective basis of fear. In making its determination in this matter, the Panel has considered the submissions of counsel as well as the whole of the relevant evidence.\nIdentity\n[13] The Panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the Claimant has established both his personal identity and identity as a national of Mexico on the basis of his passport, a certified true copy of which was provided by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.4\nState Protection\n[14] The Panel finds that the Claimant failed to rebut the presumption of state protection in Mexico insofar as applicable to his allegations.\nThe Claimant's Testimony\n[15] The Claimant was asked whether he ever approached the authorities to make a complaint about the threats that he had received by telephone. He indicated that he had not done so; in explaining why he had not made a complaint, he indicated that there are many doubts about the police in Mexico and he believed the local police to be corrupt through involvement with a gang.\n[16] The Panel asked the Claimant whether he could have made a complaint to other levels of police, such as at the state or federal level. He responded that he could have done so, but that the police would normally want to know the identity of the caller making the threats. The Claimant indicated that he did not make a complaint to the state or federal authorities because he did not know the identity of the caller. The Panel asked him why he did not make a complaint using the information that he could provide to the police. He stated that, in Mexico, such information would be of no use to the authorities.\n[17] During examination by his counsel, the Claimant was asked how he knew the police were corrupt in Mexico. He stated that people go to the police for problems and are told by the police that they are unable to take action without facts. He was then asked for examples where the police have not taken action. The Claimant stated that he had once made a complaint to the police about being robbed and was told that they could not take action as the identity of the robber was unknown; he was also told by the police that some people make up complaints.\nThe Applicable Law\n[18] The foundational principle underlying the concept of state protection is that a state is presumed to be capable of protecting its own citizens unless the nation is in a complete breakdown.5 A claimant bears the burden, on a balance of probabilities, of rebutting the presumption through clear and convincing evidence.6 In order to assess whether the presumption of state protection has been rebutted, a contextual approach must be applied; this involves an assessment of relevant factors, including the following:7\n1. The nature of the human rights violation;\n2. The profile of the alleged human rights abuser;\n3. The efforts that the victim took to seek protection from authorities;\n4. The response of the authorities to requests for their assistance; and\n5. The available documentary evidence.\n[19] Mexico is a democratic nation, in which observers have deemed recent elections to be free and fair.8 Civilian authorities have effective control over police and other security forces in Mexico.9 There is also a functional court system.10 Accordingly, the Panel finds that the presumption of state protection applies in the present matter. Therefore, it is necessary to consider whether the presumption has been rebutted by the evidence. While the five factors listed above are not exhaustive in making an assessment, there are no other relevant factors apparent on the circumstances in this matter.\nConsideration of the Framework of Analysis\nNature of the Violation\n[20] Turning to the first factor of the framework, the nature of the violation is relevant in that adequate state protection may be generally available, yet inadequate with respect to certain matters, such as domestic violence.11 Further, the nature of the violation is also relevant in assessing the extent to which a claimant should reasonably pursue state protection.12\n[21] In the case at bar, the nature of the violation, or more appropriately the harm or threat of harm, is that the Claimant received numerous phone calls of an extortive nature over a period of approximately three years, threatening violence for non-compliance. Extortion, in itself, appears to be a relatively common issue in Mexico, particularly at the hands of organized crime and also through some police officials.13 Violence is also an issue in Mexico, although, as will be discussed further below, it appears to have been on an overall decline since 2011.14\n[22] A further relevant factor, and of some significance, is that the caller never took any apparent action to collect on the extortion demand or to inflict physical harm on the Claimant. Rather, the demands and threats did not extend beyond phone calls, which commenced, according to oral testimony, in early 2013 and were last received in XXXX 2015, a number of months prior to the Claimant's most recent departure to Canada in XXXX 2016.\n[23] The demands and threats that the Claimant received occurred over an extended period of time. There is no evidence here that the Claimant was compelled to quickly flee or to go into hiding as a result of the phone calls. Therefore, there was ample opportunity for him to approach the authorities in order to seek protection.\n[24] Insofar as whether state protection would be reasonably forthcoming in cases of extortion, it is appropriate to consider the matter further with respect to a more detailed discussion of country conditions. This is addressed further below in the analysis.\nProfile of the Abuser\n[25] The profile of the abuser is relevant in that certain individuals may be \"above the law\", or sufficiently powerful to avoid effective intervention by the authorities.15 In terms of the abuser in the present matter, or more appropriately the perpetrator of the extortion, very little detail was provided in evidence as the Claimant indicated that the caller was unknown. The Claimant was uncertain whether there was a single individual or multiple individuals involved in the calls. However, the language used and professed identity of the caller appear to be consistent across the calls, indicating that the caller, at least, was a single individual.\n[26] While the caller repeatedly identified himself as a police officer, the Claimant does not believe that to be the case and there was no other clear evidence to indicate that the caller was indeed a police officer. The Panel does note that the Claimant allegedly changed his phone number, although the caller continued to be able to contact him. This indicates that the caller had the capability to learn the Claimant's new contact information; however, this is not indicative, in itself, that the caller is a police officer. There are multiple other explanations for such capability, such as the caller being someone who is acquainted with the Claimant, his family, or his friends. This is also the case with regard to the caller's apparent knowledge of when the Claimant was present in XXXX.\n[27] Also relevant here, as above, is the caller's apparent inaction in proceeding beyond phone calls with the extortion demands. This suggests, to a degree, that the caller lacked the means or was hesitant to act on the threats.\n[28] This is also not a case where a claimant did not seek protection from the authorities because he believed that the perpetrator was one of them. Rather, the Claimant here expressly disbelieved the caller's assertions that he was a police officer. There is no clear evidence that the caller is a person of any authority whatsoever or even involved in organized crime, based on the Claimant's indication that he did not know the identity of the caller and based on the surrounding circumstances provided to the Panel. Therefore, it is not established that the perpetrator's profile would undermine the likelihood of obtaining adequate state protection or otherwise indicate that seeking state protection would be unreasonable in the circumstances.\nEfforts to Seek Protection\n[29] The actions of a claimant in seeking state protection are relevant to the assessment \"because absent evidence of similarly situated individuals, the claimant's efforts to seek protection are all that can rebut the presumption of state protection, unless the agent of persecution is the state itself.\"16 Here, the Claimant did not make any attempt to approach the police. However, the assessment does not end there, as the reasons for failing to make any attempt must also be considered.17 Further, it is also necessary to consider evidence of similarly situated individuals.18\n[30] As noted, the Claimant explained that he did not approach the local police because he believed that the local police were corrupt; he also mentioned the general doubts held by Mexicans of the police. In terms of whether he could approach the state or federal levels of police, he agreed that he could have done so, but he did not because he could not identify the caller. He cited a previous experience, with respect to a robbery, where the police did not help him as he could not identify the perpetrator and also mentioned that police, generally, require facts in order to take action. He believed that the information he could provide to the police would not be helpful.\n[31] In terms of similarly situated individuals, the Claimant did not provide any relevant oral evidence in that respect. In terms of documentary evidence on the point, counsel provided a number of articles of general country conditions, evidencing crime and corruption.19 A consideration of country conditions will be addressed further below.\n[32] The Claimant did not make the most minimal of attempts to seek state protection in this matter. He chose not to initiate a police complaint at any level. Despite agreeing he could have done so, he did not seek protection from the state or federal levels of authorities because he believed that he would not be able to provide them with sufficient information to obtain assistance, based on his experience from a previous robbery complaint wherein the police required further information. However, that does not indicate that the authorities in the present circumstances would be unable or unwilling to provide assistance. Undoubtedly, police officers require information in order to pursue an investigation. While the Claimant would only be able to provide limited information given his assertion that the caller was unknown, he would be able to provide the alias used by the caller, the nature of the demands, and to indicate that the matter was ongoing, amongst other details.\n[33] Ultimately, the Claimant engages in speculation by stating that the authorities would have been unable to assist him in the present case based on the information he could provide to them. He foreclosed the opportunity to seek protection without testing his belief. On this point, the Panel notes Mr. Justice Lagac\u00e9's statement in Rio Ramirez v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration):20 \"Doubting the effectiveness of state protection when she did not really test it does not rebut the presumption of state protection in her country of origin.\"\n[34] The Claimant's failure to take any action over a number of years to make even an initial complaint of the extortion demands is a significant factor in the consideration as to whether he has rebutted the presumption.\nResponse of the Authorities\n[35] The response of the authorities to a complaint or complaints with regard to the impugned conduct is relevant as to assessing whether they are making attempts to provide protection.21 In the present case, there was no response by the authorities, as the Claimant did not report the extortion demands and threats to them.\n[36] Accordingly, there is no direct evidence of how the Claimant's specific allegations would have been handled by the authorities.\nCountry Conditions Documentation\n[37] Finally, the country conditions documentation is relevant to assessing a number of factors, such as whether \"violations are a regular event in a given country, whether the response of the authorities is in line with what normally happens, whether other avenues of protection exist that were not sought, and whether the institutions present in a country are regularly able and willing to provide protection.\"22\n[38] As noted, civilian authorities have effective control over police and other security forces in Mexico, and there is also a functional court system.23 The Panel also notes, however, that there are numerous issues with regard to the criminal justice system in Mexico, including official corruption.24 Certainly, there is a high prevalence of general crime in Mexico, including extortion, and there are issues with organized crime in many locations throughout the country.25 There are \"extremely low\" prosecution rates \"for all forms of crime.\"26\n[39] However, the Panel notes that there has been significant investment in the development of police agencies, including training, and attempts to curb corruption.27 Further, the Panel also notes a 2016 report by the Institute for Economics and Peace that indicates an overall long term trend, since 2011, of marked improvements in \"peacefulness\", which includes considerations of violent and organized crime measures.28 Of course, this must be considered within the context that many crimes, nonetheless, go unreported in Mexico.29 The report also indicates that the Mexican government has increased expenditures towards controlling crime, and that \"significant effort\" has been made in reforming the police, judicial, and penal systems.30 The Claimant's home state of XXXX is ranked as the 13th most peaceful state out of 32, including the Federal District.31 This measure includes considerations of homicide, violent crime, weapons crime, detention without a sentence, police funding, organized crime, and justice system efficiency rates.32\n[40] Counsel did not direct the Panel to any material which indicates that similarly situated individuals to the Claimant would be unable to obtain a response or assistance from the authorities. While there are undoubtedly issues with crime and official corruption, including with respect to extortion, the Panel's review of the country conditions documentation does not clearly indicate that the authorities would be unresponsive to complaints of extortion, especially carried out by an individual who, it appears, is masquerading as a police officer and where there is no clear link to organized crime. Although the Panel has noted that prosecution rates for criminal offences are low, this does not, in itself, mean that the police are not responsive to criminal complaints of extortion, particularly in these circumstances, or inadequate in their response.\n[41] Therefore, while in some instances, country conditions documentation may clearly establish that adequate state protection would not be forthcoming, that is not the case in the present circumstances. It is evident to the Panel that the country conditions evidence is somewhat mixed with respect to the adequacy of state protection provided by the Mexican authorities. However, it is also evident that the authorities are engaged in providing law enforcement services and that there has been a general improvement over recent years with respect to the security situation in Mexico. Accordingly, the country documentation material indicates, on a balance of probabilities, that adequate state protection may be available to the Claimant.\nConclusion on State Protection\n[42] After considering the relevant factors, the Panel finds that the Claimant has failed to rebut, on a balance of probabilities, the presumption that state protection is available to him in Mexico.\n[43] There is a functional law enforcement system in Mexico, which is a democratic country. The documentary evidence does not establish, on its own, that adequate state protection is unavailable in the circumstances of the Claimant.\n[44] It was reasonable in the circumstances for the Claimant to test the availability of state protection and he had ample opportunity to make such an attempt. In this regard, there is no persuasive evidence that the perpetrator is \"above the law\" and, therefore, someone who may fall outside the reach of the authorities. Further, the Claimant received extortion demands over an extended period, from early 2013 to XXXX 2015, during which time there were no attempts to enforce the demands made against him. Despite that, the Claimant did not take even basic steps to avail himself of state protection by reporting the matter to the police at any level. Of course, the police were unable to respond to a matter of which they had no knowledge.\n[45] Given the totality of the evidence, the Panel is left to speculate as to whether the Claimant would have been provided adequate state protection. Accordingly, in all of the circumstances, the Panel is not satisfied that the Claimant has rebutted, on a balance of probabilities, the presumption that state protection is available to him.\n[46] Accordingly, the Panel is not satisfied that the Claimant has established a claim pursuant to ss. 97(1) of IRPA, nor is the Panel satisfied that the allegations support a claim pursuant to s. 96 of IRPA.\nLikelihood of Harm\/Objective Fear\n[47] In the alternative, the Panel finds that the Claimant has not established that he faces a risk of harm on a balance of probabilities, as per ss. 97(1) of IRPA, nor that there is an objective basis for his fear of a serious possibility of persecution, pursuant to s. 96 of IRPA.\n[48] The Claimant alleges that he faces physical injury and potentially death as a result of the extortion demands for 80,000 pesos. As noted, the demands started in early 2013 and the last was received in XXXX 2015. The calls came, on average at least, XXXX a month when the Claimant was home in XXXX. He never made a payment to the unknown caller. When asked why he did not pay the caller, the Claimant indicated that each time that he was contacted, he would respond in an aggressive manner and tell the caller that he wanted to see him in person to see if he was a \"real man\". Arrangements to meet were never made and no instructions on how to make payment were ever provided to the Claimant.\n[49] While the Panel notes the Claimant's allegation that the threats became more aggressive over time, the specifics of how the calls became more aggressive are somewhat equivocal. When asked by the Panel to provide details of the increased aggressiveness, he indicated that the caller used rude words about the Claimant's mother.\n[50] Over the period of early 2013, when the phone calls commenced, until the Claimant's most recent trip to Canada in XXXX 2016, the Claimant resided in XXXX, Mexico, for a total of approximately 29 months.33 He travelled to and returned from Canada on three occasions; he was resident in Canada from XXXX 2013 to XXXX 2013, XXXX 2014 to XXXX 2014, and XXXX 2015 to XXXX 2015.34\n[51] Action was not taken against the Claimant for his failure to comply with the caller's demands over a period of approximately three years. When he received the last phone call, and most aggressive, in XXXX 2015, the caller alleged that he would go to the Claimant's home if he did not pay the money. However, the caller did not go to the Claimant's home following this conversation. The Panel notes that the Claimant remained in XXXX from the time of the XXXX 2015 phone call until departing to Canada in XXXX 2016. During that time, the Claimant did not receive any further extortion demands.\n[52] The Panel asked the Claimant why he believed he would be at risk from the caller if he returned to Mexico given the lack of action by the caller after the series of phone calls, including following the last phone call in XXXX 2015. He referenced a general rise in crime in his local municipality, such as kidnappings and homicides. However, the Claimant, when asked by the Panel, confirmed that the only targeting that he had experienced was through the phone calls. He was then asked if there was a particular reason that he believed the caller would now take action against him. He indicated that people in his municipality are aware of where people work and when a person returns, the locals assume that the person is carrying a lot of money. He stated that the locals are aware that he worked as a labourer in Canada.\n[53] The Claimant was then asked why he believed he would be pursued if he were to return from his present trip to Canada, given that he had returned on previous occasions without any action against him. He indicated that his lengthy time in Canada would lead people to think that he was returning with more money. The Claimant was then asked if he knew why he was targeted by the caller; he indicated that he did not know a reason. However, his BOC form indicates his belief that he was targeted by the caller because his work in Canada suggests that he is wealthy.\n[54] Counsel, in his examination, revisited the issue of why the Claimant believed he would be in danger on return if the threats had never been acted upon in the past. The Claimant indicated that organized crime has grown stronger in his state. He was then asked how he connected that to the phone calls. The Claimant indicated that there are people on the streets who watch others and who will engage in extortion. He was then asked when he believed the threats would be carried out; he indicated it would be within six months due to the growing criminal element in his state.\n[55] An assessment under ss. 97(1) of IRPA, like s. 96, is of a forward-looking risk of harm. Under ss. 97(1) of IRPA, the risk of harm must be established on a balance of probabilities. With respect to s. 96 of IRPA, there must be an objective basis to a claimant's fear that he faces a serious possibility of persecution.\n[56] There are two key considerations here. First, the extortion demands stopped approximately XXXX months prior to the Claimant's departure from Mexico. Based on the previous pattern of calls, this indicates that the caller has either lost interest in the Claimant or is unable to continue with the extortion demands. Second, the caller never acted on the threats to harm the Claimant if payment was not made. The Claimant refused to comply over approximately three years, although, the Panel notes, he was not in Mexico the entirety of that time. However, the Claimant resided in XXXX for a total of approximately 29 months since the time that he first began to receive the threats in early 2013 until he departed for Canada most recently in XXXX 2016. This is a substantial period of time that he was within the \"realm\" of the caller. Despite that, he was never harmed, nor were there any known attempts to harm him. It appears on the evidence that the extortion demands that the Claimant has faced have ceased and that, in any event, the caller either lacked the capability or determination to act on his threats.\n[57] The Claimant's reasons for believing that he continues to be in danger from the caller are speculative and are not rationally linked to the matter of the phone calls. He asserts through his testimony that an increase in crime, particularly organized crime, in his municipality means that the caller who has personally targeted him is more likely to take action against him now. There is no apparent link on the evidence as to why the caller would, as a result, become more motivated. It is speculative that an increase in crime generally would somehow empower or embolden the caller. It is also speculative that the caller, after targeting the Claimant over a period of approximately three years, which involved three previous return trips from Canada, would be spurned into taking action simply because the Claimant had remained in Canada for an extended period of time compared to previous trips. Accordingly, the Claimant's assertions as to why he would continue to be at risk from the caller are not persuasive.\n[58] Considering that the threatening phone calls have ceased for an extended period of time without resumption and there has been a lengthy period of time where the caller has never acted on his threats despite non-compliance, all within the context of the equivocal nature of the alleged escalation in the caller's aggressiveness, the Panel is not satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the Claimant has established that he has a forward-facing risk of harm in Mexico on account of the allegations. On the same evidence, the Panel is also not satisfied that there is an objective basis to the Claimant's fear, nexus concerns aside, in that it is not established that he faces more than a mere possibility of persecution.\n[59] Accordingly, the Panel is not satisfied that the Claimant has established a claim pursuant to ss. 97(1) of IRPA, nor is the Panel satisfied that the allegations support a claim pursuant to s. 96 of IRPA.\nCONCLUSION\n[60] The Panel finds that the Claimant is not a person in need of protection pursuant to ss. 97(1) of IRPA. The Panel further finds that the Claimant is not a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of IRPA. Therefore, the claim is rejected.\n(signed)\nRobert L.

In short, the claimant alleges that she fears forced marriage and Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) in Nigeria.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] The panel determines that the claimant has not satisfied her burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground or that it is more likely than not that she would be subjected personally to a danger of torture or to a risk to life or to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment upon return to Nigeria.\n[5] The determinative issue in this claim is the existence of an internal flight alternative.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[6] The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant's identity is established by the copy of her passport on file that was provided by Citizenship and Immigration Canada and is at exhibit 1.\nCredibility\n[7] The panel did have some concerns about the claimant's credibility that are discussed in the Internal Flight Alternative section of this decision. That said, the panel found the claimant's core allegations to be credible. The panel accepts that the claimant has been promised by her father to marry a man, XXXX XXXX (XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Her future husband is now insisting that the claimant undergo FGM prior to the marriage, in line with his family tradition.\n[8] The claimant states that she was betrothed to the XXXX at a very young age and that he has consequently been supporting her family her entire life. She states that she had received a visa to study in Canada starting in XXXX 2016 and a few weeks prior to her departure, at the beginning of XXXX 2015, her father informed her that she was to marry the XXXX. The claimant states that her father did not accept her refusal and that he persisted with the plans, telling her on XXXX XXXX, 2015 that a wedding had been scheduled two weeks hence. The XXXX came to the claimant's house and explained to her the importance of FGM in his cultural tradition, stating that it would ensure that the claimant would not cheat on him during their marriage, especially with her impending time abroad in Canada. The claimant describes the way that her mother objected to the marriage and attempted to put a halt to the FGM, but her father and the XXXX took her to a traditional Priest in their village who was to inflict it upon her. The Priest decided that the FGM would be delayed because the claimant vociferously struggled against the procedure and hit her head during that struggle.\n[9] The claimant testified that her mother has helped her to escape this situation. She states that her mother attempted to involve the police in these events, but they refused to intervene, identifying this as a matter to be resolved between the family members. The claimant states that she escaped her dad and the XXXX by going to her aunt's house in northern Nigeria at this point. Her father found out that she was at her aunt's and threatened to call the police on her aunt, saying that she had no right to keep his daughter, who was then a minor. At that point, the claimant's mother got her passport and bought an airline ticket for the claimant to leave Nigeria. The claimant left Nigeria on XXXX XXXX, 2015.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[10] The panel has considered the availability of an internal flight alternative (IFA) and whether the claimant could relocate to a place outside the city of Abeokuta, specifically Ibadan or Port Harcourt, and live without a serious possibility of persecution or risk of harm contemplated by s. 97(1) of IRPA.\n[11] In order to determine whether a viable IFA exists, the panel considers the two-prong test from Thirunavukkarasu v. Canada.2 The panel must be satisfied that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country in which it finds an IFA exists. Furthermore, conditions in that part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable, in all circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for her to seek refuge there. The claimant bears the burden of proof to show that she would be persecuted under one of the Convention grounds, or be subject personally, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in all of Nigeria and specifically in the potential IFA areas of Ibadan and Port Harcourt (the \"IFA locations\") in this case.3\n[12] The panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant does not face a serious possibility that she would be persecuted or that she would be subjected to harms contemplated by s. 97(1) of IRPA if she were to relocate to the IFA locations, and that it would not be unreasonable for the claimant to seek refuge there. The panel's reasons follow:\nSafety of IFA locations\n[13] The panel finds that the claimant has not established that there is a reasonable possibility that her father, XXXX XXXX, or the police would locate her in the IFA locations proposed.\nFear of Father and XXXX\n[14] The claimant articulated several concerns that she has about her safety if she relocates in Nigeria. The first is that she would not be safe in Ibadan because \"It's very close to where I am staying. The XXXX can locate me from there.\" She testified that \"anybody might recognize me or know my dad or the XXXX.\" The claimant provided no details about how her father or the XXXX would locate her in Ibadan, other than the fact that Ibadan is close to where her parents and the XXXX live. She stated that she does not specifically know anyone who lives in the city of Ibadan, a city with a metro area population of about 3 million people that is about a 1 hour drive from the city her parents live in, Abeokuta.\n[15] The claimant did not provide any further details about how the XXXX or her father would locate her in Ibadan, aside from her own assertion that they would. The panel is aware that large urban areas cannot be assumed to be an IFA by virtue of their population size alone,4 and that the distance between the proposed IFA and the location of the persecutors does not in itself serve to establish that the proposed IFA is viable.5 That said, the IFA need not be far away from where the claimant has previously lived: the concept of an internal flight alternative does not require that the safe haven be in another city or province of the state of origin so long as it is truly an area in which the applicant can seek refuge from the persecution experienced in her home district.6\n[16] The objective documentary evidence states that internal relocation is generally a realistic option for women who experience harm in Nigeria from non-state actors. For example, the United Kingdom Home Office Country of Origin Information Report on Nigeria addresses the freedom of movement for women in Nigeria. The report states:7\nWhere the person's fear is of persecution or serious harm at the hands of non state agents (including rogue state agents), relocation to another area of Nigeria is likely to be generally viable depending on the nature of the threat from non-state agents and individual circumstances of the person, and as long as it would not be unduly harsh to expect them to do so.\n[17] The onus is on the claimant to show that she does not have an IFA, and given that the claimant has provided very little detail about any mechanisms through which the XXXX and her father would be able to search for her, the panel finds that the claimant has not offered sufficient persuasive evidence to establish that her father or the XXXX would have the capacity to locate her in Ibadan.\nFear of Police\n[18] The claimant also stated that she is afraid of the police and that \"the police would be looking at me like a child and they would take me back to my parents.\" She states that her father threatened her aunt that he would have the police go to her house when she had fled her parents' and went to stay with her aunt in XXXX, in northern Nigeria. She states that she is at risk specifically because \"the police normally receive bribes and they know that I am still a young person\" and that her mom has told her that the XXXX requested that the police be on the lookout for the claimant. The claimant stated that her parents also fear police involvement if she refuses to go through with the marriage, as the XXXX could send her parents to prison in that circumstance. Upon consideration of this testimony, the panel finds that the claimant's concerns about the police are speculative, exaggerated, and not credible.\n[19] The panel has considered the claimant's testimony that the XXXX has tasked the police with being on the lookout for her, and the claimant's statement that her parents fear police involvement if she refuses to go through with the marriage, as the XXXX could send her parents to prison in that circumstance. The documentary evidence before the panel does not indicate that the Nigerian police would become involved in a domestic matter such as this by doing either of those things. The police frequently dismiss complaints of domestic violence on the grounds that the state has no right to interfere in private or family matters. This includes FGM cases, which are viewed as a \"private, family matter\"8 where the \"police will most likely consider it a family affair and refuse to intervene.\"9 In cases of forced marriage, the RIR Nigeria: Prevalence of forced marriage, particularly in Muslim and Yoruba communities; information on legislation, including state protection; ability of women to refuse a forced marriage at 5.7 of the NDP has a section on Refusing a Forced Marriage. It quotes an assistant professor of Anthropology at the University of Kansas who indicates that the consequences of refusing a forced marriage are \"contingent upon the family,\" not that the police would generally become involved to ensure that such a marriage occurs. The legal practitioner quoted in the section on \"Rituals Related to Marriage, Marital Relations, Pregnancy\" of the RIR Nigeria: Availability and effectiveness of state and police response in both urban and rural areas of southern Nigeria, for people who refuse to participate in ritual practices at 10.13 of the NDP stated that the police would, in general, treat ritual practices related to marriage, marital relations, and pregnancy or widowhood \"as a family [or] community affair and may not interfere at all.\" This is supported by the information in the claimant's BOC narrative that her mother made a report to the police about these events, including the forced marriage, and asked for protection, but the police told her that there was nothing they could do, and rather she should \"[settle] it amicably with her husband\": on balance, the panel determines that the country condition evidence in the NDP establishes that the police generally do not intervene in such matters, either to provide protection to victims, or to aid perpetrators.10\n[20] The panel places more weight on the documentary evidence which is current and comes from objective, reliable, and reputable sources, with respect to the issue of whether the police would make efforts to keep a lookout for the claimant or arrest individuals who refuse to force family members to partake in forced marriage, over the claimant's statements. It also appears that the police would have a limited ability to keep a lookout for the claimant even if they wanted to, especially when considering the evidence at 10.5 of the NDP in the section on the nature and extent of police communication across Nigeria that \"one of the greatest challenges police are facing in Nigeria is a lack of adequate communication equipment,\" and other tools for accessing and sharing information. The panel accepts that corruption is rife within the Nigerian police force, that officers can act arbitrarily, and that it operates as a single national force, but the claimant has provided no credible and reliable evidence that would suggest that either her father or the XXXX have the influence or resources to enlist the police to search for the claimant across the vast swathe of Nigeria, home to more than 15% of all persons in Africa, or that there is a reasonable possibility that the police would be able to find her. The evidence is that while there is an ability to register with the government, a large number of people do not, and a lack of documents does not result in denial of education, health care, or other public services; efforts to implement a National Identity Card are nascent, but progressing.11\n[21] Additionally, while the claimant testified that her father was able to find her when she went to hide at her aunt's home in XXXX, something that the claimant stated she could not explain as she does not know how her father found her, the claimant's evidence is that otherwise her mother has supported her and withheld information from her father about her whereabouts over the last year and a half. The claimant's mother has supported her in running away from home, and the claimant testified that her dad is not aware of her mother's support, which has included purchasing the claimant a plane ticket to come to Canada and providing the claimant with her passport. Indeed, the claimant's mother went as far as to report her father's activities to the police, requesting that they intervene. The panel finds that in these particular circumstances, any risk of the claimant's whereabouts being divulged to her agents of persecution through contact with her mother has not been demonstrated. If the claimant does not wish to inform others of her presence in Ibadan or Port Harcourt, there is no reason to believe that her location would be found out. While the police may have been willing to return the claimant to her parents at the time that she left Nigeria while she was a minor, when the claimant claimed refugee protection she had turned 18. She is now 19. The panel prefers the evidence discussed above that the police do not become involved in family matters such as these, to the claimant's assertion that the police would detain her, as a young adult, and take her to her parents.\n[22] The claimant suggested that the XXXX is wealthy and that he has special influence with the police. There are no particulars about this in her BOC or narrative. During the hearing, the claimant stated that none of her family members, or anyone else, has actually told her that about specific instances of bribing the police, but she did say that her mom has told her that the XXXX has asked the police to look for her. The claimant stated that after she refused this marriage, the XXXX fired her father from his job. She did not provide any other details about any other attempts to find her over the last year and a half. While the claimant's father may have the motivation to pursue the claimant in an effort to restore his employment with the XXXX, the claimant testified that he has limited financial resources and there is no persuasive evidence that he would be able to locate the claimant. Furthermore, the information provided about the XXXX instructions to the police is vague, not dated, and insufficient to establish that his motivation continues after the amount of time that has passed.\nConclusion on Safety in IFA locations\n[23] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has not established that she would face a serious possibility of persecution or a risk of harm as defined in s. 97(1) of IRPA in the IFA locations proposed. Risk of harm in the locations by her father, the XXXX, or the police is no more than speculative based on the evidence that the claimant has adduced.\nReasonableness of Internal Flight Alternatives\n[24] There is \"a very high threshold for the unreasonable test. It requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant in travelling or temporarily relocating to a safe area. In addition, it requires actual and concrete evidence of such conditions.\"12 The Gender Guidelines also specify as follows: \"in determining the reasonableness of an IFA, the decision-makers should take into account factors including religious, economic, and cultural factors, and consider whether and how these factors affect women in the IFA.\"\n[25] The panel finds that it is not objectively unreasonable for the claimant to relocate to the IFA locations proposed.\n[26] In addition to the safety concerns addressed above, the claimant testified that she could not live in Port Harcourt because she does not speak the language there, she does not know anyone there, she is not an indigene of the state, and because her Yoruba ethnicity would stand out there; for Ibadan, the claimant suggested that she could not live there because she does not know anyone there. The claimant also expressed concern about where she would stay and what type of employment she would be able to find to support herself. The panel notes that these are not reasons which would normally make the IFA unreasonable:\nWe read the decision of Linden J.A. for this Court as setting up a very high threshold for the unreasonableness test. It requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant in travelling or temporarily relocating to a safe area. In addition, it requires actual and concrete evidence of such conditions. The absence of relatives in a safe place, whether taken alone or in conjunction with other factors, can only amount to such condition if it meets that threshold, that is to say if it establishes that, as a result, a claimant's life or safety would be jeopardized. This is in sharp contrast with undue hardship resulting from loss of employment, loss of status, reduction in quality of life, loss of aspirations, loss of beloved ones and frustration of one's wishes and expectations.13\n[27] The documentary evidence before the panel suggests that generally it will not be unduly harsh for a woman to relocate within Nigeria to escape the types of issues that the claimant faces. For example, the UK Home Office Country Information and Guidance report on Women fearing gender-based harm or violence in Nigeria states:14\nThe constitution and law provide for freedom of internal movement and women all over the country reportedly travel on their own, be it on a long or short journey. In general, it will not be unduly harsh for a woman to internally relocate to escape localised threats from members of their family or other non-state actors, especially if single and without children to support, but the individual circumstances of each case will need to be taken into account.\n[28] The documentary evidence before the panel on internal relocation in Nigeria indicates that victims of family violence can generally relocate within Nigeria, find employment, shelter, and support. The panel notes that the United Kingdom (U.K.) Home Office Country Information and Guidance Report entitled Nigeria: Women fearing gender-based harm or violence indicates that women are able to move throughout Nigeria and \"it is likely that internal relocation will be a reasonable option, depending on their individual circumstances.\"15 The panel has considered the documentary evidence in the context of the claimant's personal circumstances.\nJobs and Accommodation\n[29] An RIR on women who head their own households in Nigeria suggests that there are more female-headed households in the south, and that women living without male support are better off in the South of Nigeria,16 which is where Port Harcourt and Ibadan are located. The same RIR notes that there is a very high rate of unemployment in Nigeria generally and that obtaining employment can be very difficult. One source quoted in the RIR stated that it is generally easier for women in the south to obtain work than women in the north, although they often end up working in difficult jobs. Ethnicity is also less of a factor in obtaining employment in the south when compared to the north.17\n[30] The claimant is young - 19 years of age. However, she has completed high school and commenced work XXXX XXXX shortly thereafter. She also has a Certificate in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX reflecting her post-secondary studies. Being a teenager who has completed the upper levels of high school places the claimant in the upper half of Nigerian women by education.18 The panel here notes that the claimant's mother provided financial assistance for her to leave Nigeria, including by purchasing a plane ticket for her, and that the claimant's student visa application indicates that $40,000 was available for her studies, although her mom has not been supporting her since she came to Canada because the claimant has been on income assistance and staying at a shelter here, and her parents' financial situation has deteriorated. The evidence reflects that, although most Nigerians depend upon their family, relying on immediate and extended family is not the only option. Many Nigerians try to establish other support networks that may complement or in some cases replace the extended family. Examples of such support networks are religious congregations, religious organizations, political organizations, and charities. Many such organizations are expected to aid their members in ways that would be fairly unusual in a western context.\n[31] The concern noted in the NDP is that \"Women, especially single women with no support network, are likely to be vulnerable and may be faced with destitution in the absence of civil society (e.g. NGO's) to provide practical support.\"19 That said, considering all of these factors, the panel finds it reasonable to expect that someone of her education and experience would be able to obtain employment and accommodation and adapt to new surroundings in the proposed IFA cities.\nReligion, Language, and other social\/cultural constraints\n[32] The panel has considered the personal circumstances of the claimant with respect to her ability to relocate to the IFA locations. The claimant stated in her Basis of Claim form that she is Christian and that she speaks English. She also has attended school in Canada in English and completed her BOC and narrative without the assistance of a translator. Port Harcourt is predominantly Christian and Ibadan has a substantial Christian population. The panel notes that English is the official language of Nigeria and that its pidgin English variant is widely spoken in nearly all of the country, including Port Harcourt and Ibadan.20\n[33] The claimant states that she is Yoruba. Twenty-one percent (21%) of Nigerians are Yoruba.21 The panel finds that there are a significant number of Yoruba in Port Harcourt and Ibadan, and thus the claimant's ethnicity should not make it unreasonable for her to relocate. Ibadan has traditionally been the heart of the Yoruba community, and the Yoruba are the dominant ethnicity there. As stated in the NDP, \"according the Professor of History, indigeneship status is less important in big cities such as Lagos, Abuja, and Port Harcourt than it is in other places, in terms of access to public jobs or ownership of land, because the indigene population in these areas has been \"overwhelmed\" by migrants to the cities.\"22\n[34] The panel finds the claimant would not face social or cultural constraints in Ibadan or Port Harcourt but would in fact be familiar with the language, religion, and culture there, and that there would be facilities for religious worship available in either place should the claimant wish to seek them out for spiritual support.\nPresence of family and friends in IFA locations\n[35] With regards to the claimant's lack of family or friend support in the proposed IFA locations, the panel notes the court's statement in Thirunavukkarasu v. Canada: \"claimants should not be compelled to hide out in an isolated region of their country, like a cave in the mountains, or in a desert or a jungle, if those are the only areas of internal safety available. But neither is it enough for refugee claimants to say that they do not like the weather in a safe area, or that they have no friends or relatives there, or that they may not be able to find suitable work there. If it is objectively reasonable in these latter cases to live in these places, without fear of persecution, then IFA exists and the claimant is not a refugee. [emphasis added]\"23 The claimant has provided no evidence that would cause the panel to conclude that for a resourceful woman such as her, who has now lived abroad for more than a year in a place without pre-existing family or social connections, it would be unreasonable to have her move to one of the IFA cities identified. The claimant engaged in volunteer activities upon arriving in Canada in order to make connections, for instance, as demonstrated by the Africans in Partnership Against AIDS letter at page 37 of exhibit 8 which describes her volunteering.\nPsychological Report\n[36] The report at exhibit 5 from XXXX XXXX, registered psychotherapist, states that the claimant is experiencing a number of psychological conditions, including hyperarousal, paranoia, hypervigilance, anxiety, sleep disturbance, stress, problems with concentration and focus, depressive symptoms, and panic symptoms, including headaches, light-headedness, heart palpitations, tensions and pain in the chest, dyspnea, throat tightening, trembling, hot flashes\/excessive sweating, blurred vision, psychogenic blackouts, dry mouth\/throat, numbing\/tingling in extremities, excessive hair loss, nausea, and dissociation. The report states that the claimant has Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Major Depressive Disorder. It states: \"I believe that Ms. XXXX return to Nigeria will very likely cause her mental and physical stress symptoms to increase considerably, and for her psychological and emotional state to deteriorate.\" It states that the claimant requires \"appropriate counselling and a strong and supportive network\" and that \"if Ms. XXXX was to remain in Canada, a plan of medical and therapeutic care could be implemented involving medication, proper counselling, and strategies which could help him (sic) work through the depression, anxiety, and trauma she currently feels.\" It notes that the claimant has been prescribed medications and that she is currently seeing a counsellor.\n[37] As for the second prong of the IFA test, the applicant has the onus of proof to show that the IFA is not reasonable, and the psychological assessment submitted by the applicant was insufficient to meet the high threshold of showing that seeking refuge in the proposed IFA would be unreasonable. The report did indicate the type of treatment the applicant needed, and provided general statements about how the applicant's condition could deteriorate in Nigeria, but it did not connect those statements to specifics about Nigeria or state whether she could obtain the necessary treatment in Nigeria.24 Nor did the claimant herself provide evidence on this point. The report indicated a concern about an increase in the claimant's anxiety and depression leading to self-harm upon return to Nigeria. This is concerning. However, the report does not state why the recommendation to address this, which is detailed on page 34 of exhibit 5 and largely consists of counselling and a strong support network, would not be available to the claimant in Nigeria.\nConclusion on IFA\n[38] The panel specifically considered the documents in section 5 of the NDP on gender. Considering this evidence, and for the foregoing reasons, the panel finds that while it is not preferable for the claimant to return to Nigeria, the claimant has not established that it would be unreasonable within the meaning of the Ranganathan test for her to relocate to Ibadan or Port Harcourt.\nCONCLUSION\n[39] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel determines that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of IRPA. The Refugee Protection Division therefore rejects her claim for refugee protection.\n(signed)\n\"Joshua Prowse\"\nJ. M.

They are claiming refugee protection against Hungary.\n[2] The principal claimant is the designated representative for the minor claimants for the purposes of their claims for refugee protection.\nBACKGROUND\/ALLEGATIONS\n[3] These claimants, as members of a family consisting of persons of mixed Roma and Hungarian ethnicity, fear persecution upon return to Hungary. The claimants fear skinheads, the Jobbik political party, and racist people in Hungary. The claimants' narrative, included in the Personal Information Form (PIF)1 of the principal claimant, sets out the details regarding these claimants' particular situation and circumstances in Hungary. The claimants provided additional details at their hearing.\n[4] The claimants came to Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2011, and filed their claims for refugee protection upon arrival.\nANALYSIS\n[5] Based on the totality of the evidence submitted\/adduced in this case, the panel accepts that the Appellants are citizens of Hungary. The panel also accepts that the principal claimant and the minor claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX are of mixed ethnicity, i.e. ethnic Hungarian and Roma (hereinafter, \"mixed ethnicity\"), and that the female claimant and the minor claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX are ethnic Hungarian.\nDetermination\n[6] The panel determines that the claimants are not Convention refugees pursuant to section 96, nor persons in need of protection pursuant to subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).2\nDeterminative Issue\n[7] The determinative issue in these claims is Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) in Budapest.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[8] The question of whether an IFA exists is an integral part of the Convention refugee definition. It arises when a claimant, who otherwise meets all the elements of the Convention refugee definition in his or her home area of the country, is not a Convention refugee because the person has an IFA elsewhere in that country.\n[9] In assessing whether a viable IFA exists, the panel is guided by the cases of the Federal Court of Appeal. If there is a safe haven for claimants in their own country, where they could live free from harm, they are expected to avail themselves of it, unless they can show it is objectively unreasonable or unduly harsh for them to do so.3\n[10] The IFA must be realistic, attainable and accessible. Barriers to getting to the IFA must be reasonably surmountable and the claimant cannot be required to encounter great danger or undergo undue hardship either in travelling there or in remaining there. Claimants should not be compelled to hide out in an isolated region of their country, like a cave in the mountains, or in a desert or a jungle, if those are the only areas of internal safety available. But neither is it enough for refugee claimants to say that they do not like the weather there, have no friends or family in the region or are not able to find suitable work there. The fact that a claimant may be better off in Canada economically, physically or emotionally, than they would be in their own country, is not a factor to consider when assessing the reasonableness of an IFA.4\n[11] The key concepts concerning IFA come from two cases, Rasaratnam5 and Thirunavukkarasu.6 From these cases, it is clear that the test to be applied in determining whether there is an IFA available for the claimants is two-pronged:\n1. \"... the Board must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists.\"7\n2. Moreover, conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for him to seek refuge there.8\n[12] Both prongs must be satisfied for a finding that the claimant has an IFA.\n[13] The claimants lived in XXXX. They testified that they were persecuted due to their Roma ethnicity. The principal claimant's mother is a Roma, and his father is an ethnic Hungarian. The claimants were not aware of any problems that the principal claimant's mother encountered as a Roma in XXXX. The principal claimant testified that the problem is with the new generation. The principal claimant, however, was also not aware of any problems that his own brother might have had due to his mixed ethnicity. The principal claimant testified that he was not very close with his brother; however, he added that their mother has also not mentioned to the claimants any problems that the principal claimant's brother might have had due to his mixed ethnicity. The principal claimant's wife, the female claimant, is an ethnic Hungarian. The claimants testified that the principal claimant's family and the female claimant's family have good relations.\n[14] They were asked if they could relocate and reside safely in Budapest. They testified that they could not reside anywhere because Hungary is a small country. They testified and submitted documents9 in support that when they moved within their town, they were located. They added that the threats continued even after they fled Hungary. The claimants added that even if they moved somewhere else, the news about their Roma ethnicity would spread quickly because the principal claimant's mother is of Roma origin.\n[15] The principal claimant's mother is of Roma ethnicity, and his father is an ethnic Hungarian. The panel finds, on a balance probabilities, that the principal claimant's last name does not identify him as a Roma. The evidence shows that the claimants lived in a small town, XXXX. The principal claimant testified that XXXX is mainly ethnic Hungarian, not that many Roma there. The principal claimant testified that in their small town people knew each other. The evidence in this case shows that the principal claimant was recognized as a Roma in and around their small town because his mother is a Roma. Budapest is close by, but it is a large capital city, with a population of 1.714 million people.10 The panel is aware that large urban areas cannot be assumed to be an IFA by virtue of their population size alone.11\n[16] Based on the totality of the evidence, the panel does not find, on a balance of probabilities, that these claimants would have the alleged problems in Budapest because the principal claimant's mother is of Roma origin. The claimants forwarded no significant evidence to establish that the identity of the principal claimant's mother is known in Budapest, or that it is known among any segment of the population in Budapest that the principal claimant's mother is a Roma.\nThe first prong test\n[17] In Thirunavukkarasu,12 the Court held that since the existence, or not, of an IFA is part of the question of whether the claimant is a Convention refugee, the onus of proof rests on the claimant to show, on a balance of probabilities, that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country, including the area which is alleged to afford an IFA. Based on the totality of the evidence in this case, including the claimants' particular situation and circumstances, the panel finds that the claimants have not provided sufficient reliable and satisfactory probative evidence to establish that they would be pursued by the alleged perpetrators, or would be harmed by the alleged agents of harm, in Budapest in their particular situation and circumstances.\n[18] The panel considers these claimants' particular situation and circumstances. The principal claimant's last name is ethnic Hungarian. His wife is ethnic Hungarian. Although, their daughter is of mixed ethnicity because of her father's ethnicity, she also carries an ethnic Hungarian last name. The principal claimant's step-son, the female claimant's biological son, is ethnic Hungarian. There is no significant evidence on the record showing that persons in these claimants' particular situation and circumstances are widely targeted by skinheads, the Jobbik party, or by racist ethnic Hungarians or police officers in Hungary.\n[19] Counsel submitted that the principal claimant's mother is of Roma origin, and people will find out about his Roma ethnicity upon his mother's visit to the claimants' house, or because someone may disclose these claimants' ethnicity at their children's school, or at the principal claimant's work. In this respect, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants' alleged fear of harm, in their particular situation and circumstances, is speculative, and is not objectively well founded such that they would be pursued and persecuted in Budapest as alleged. Based on the totality of the evidence in this case, including the claimants' particular situation and circumstances, the panel finds that the claimants have not provided sufficient reliable and satisfactory probative evidence to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that they would be pursued in order to be harmed in Budapest by the perpetrators as alleged.\n[20] In assessing the issue of whether the claimants could live safely in the proposed IFA of Budapest, the panel has considered whether state protection would be available to them in Budapest. In this respect, the panel is guided by a number of cases. There is a presumption that the state is capable of protecting its citizens, except in situations where the state is in complete breakdown.13 To rebut the presumption of state protection, the claimant must present clear and convincing evidence, on a balance of probabilities, that state protection is inadequate.\n[21] The documentary evidence shows that Hungary is a functioning democracy.14 The burden of proving an absence of state protection is directly proportional to the level of democracy that exists in the state.15 Hungary has functioning political and judicial systems in place, and an official apparatus sufficient to provide adequate protection to its citizens. Hungary is in control of its territory and has functioning security forces in place. There is no significant evidence of a total breakdown of state authority in the country. Therefore, the burden of attempting to show that one should not be required to exhaust all avenues of domestic recourse is a heavy one.16\n[22] In order to determine whether the claimant has discharged his burden of proof, the panel considered whether the state of Hungary is willing to act and capable of providing protection to these claimants in their particular situation and circumstances. In Carrillo17 the Federal Court of Appeal stated that the refugee claimant, who claims that state protection is inadequate, bears the evidentiary burden of adducing evidence to that effect.\n[23] The panel examined the country documents in evidence.18 The panel finds that while in recent years there have been attacks against the Roma, the documentary evidence also reports that following these attacks against the Roma, the government has acted to protect its citizens of Roma origin. Following the series of attacks against the Roma, which occurred in 2008 and 2009, perpetrators were charged and convicted. Three individuals charged with the racially motivated murders of six people including a five year old were convicted. The Curia upheld a lower court's sentence of life imprisonment with no possibility of parole in the case of premeditated murder and other charges. In May 2015, the Budapest Metropolitan Court of Appeals sentenced the fourth defendant, who had cooperated with police during the investigation, to 13 years' imprisonment as an accomplice to the murders.19\n[24] Regarding racism, the panel is aware that right wing extremist groups do exist in Hungary, an article in the National Documentation Package discusses state response to the attacks against Roma individuals by fascist groups.20 Documentary evidence21 shows that in 2011, the Hungarian government proposed changes to the Penal Code in part to deal with the spate of street marches by groups of people dressed in 'non-official uniforms'. In May 2011, the Hungarian Parliament adopted an amendment to the Criminal Code to protect the Roma community from \"extreme right-wing groups.\" The amendment, which was a response to events involving right-wing groups dressed in uniforms, reportedly extends hate crimes legislation to include intimidation of ethnic, racial and religious or other groups. Furthermore, a 2011 Hungarian government report to the United Nations states that, in order to \"prosecute the illegal activity of people not willing to acknowledge\" the Hungarian Guard's court-ordered dissolution, there is:\nlegislation ordered to prosecute participation in the activities of the dissolved social organization as an infringement of the law. The law prosecutes even wearing clothes that resemble to the uniform, usual attire of the dissolved social organization and makes it possible to impose even custodial sentences.22\n[25] According to the Political Handbook of the World 2011,23 in 2009, police doubled the size of a task force investigating anti-Roma attacks. In July 2009, police banned a demonstration that was to be held on Szabadsag Square in Budapest and the police indicated that they would \"take firm action against any private individual or member of any organization, with special regard to the Hungarian Guard\" who want to demonstrate. In April 2010, charges were filed with the public prosecutor against the chief of the Hungarian Guard and two of his associates on \"suspicion of illegally maintaining the uniformed organization\". The AP similarly reported that on the same day, police filed charges against three leaders of the Hungarian Guard. Because the group was still operating in spite of its ban, the charges also included \"incitement against authorities' decrees\". Nine days later, MTI-Eco News reported that police filed charges against ten leaders of the banned Hungarian Guard for violating the laws of assembly. In July 2010, police arrested more than 70 members of the Hungarian National Guard at demonstrations in Budapest that were attended by around 600 members of the organization to commemorate the banning of the Hungarian Guard. Police also arrested another 20 Hungarian National Guard members attending the same rallies because they were in possession of minor firearms.\n[26] The 60-page European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) report on Hungary24 which discusses the Roma minority and their situation states that their situation of disadvantage is such that long-term but intensive efforts will be needed to turn it around. While many of the measures taken to date may have a positive impact, they need to be continued and in some cases intensified. In June 2007, Parliament approved a resolution on the Decade of Roma Inclusion Program Strategic Plan, setting a framework for action in a series of fields where Roma experience discrimination and disadvantage in daily life. Wide-ranging measures have been taken in the field of education and some landmark decisions of the courts have been handed down in recent years. On the basis of the report, it appears that Hungary is providing solutions to the difficulties which the Roma are experiencing.\n[27] The panel finds that the Hungarian government has taken concrete steps to improve the situation of the Roma and it appears that the state can adequately protect its Roma citizens. While discrimination against Roma does still exist, particularly in housing, employment and education, the government has passed laws to rectify the situation and has funded initiatives to implement the laws. When laws are violated charges and prosecution follow and it appears that the police are being held accountable for their actions if they fail to take Roma complaints seriously or if the police themselves become agents of persecution of Roma citizens. There is a legal structure in place that gives victims redress to the rule of law.\n[28] In consideration of these claimants' particular situation and circumstances, the panel finds that these claimants would be able to live safely in the proposed IFA of Budapest. Though the claimants have stated that the alleged perpetrators would find them and harm them wherever whenever they returned to Hungary, the panel finds that the state would provide adequate protection should these claimants be threatened in Budapest by the alleged perpetrators or alleged agents of harm. The panel is aware, that although the alleged perpetrators discovered these claimants when they moved within and around their town, the claimants provided insufficient reliable and satisfactory probative evidence to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the alleged perpetrators would pursue these claimants in Budapest to harm them. Moreover, the claimants provided insufficient reliable and satisfactory probative evidence to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that any of the alleged perpetrators would have influence with the authorities in Budapest such that these claimants, in their particular situation and circumstances, would not be provided adequate protection from the police if they were to need it and seek it diligently upon return to Hungary.\n[29] Hungary has one centralized national police force. In Budapest there are 22 District Police stations.25 Even if these claimants were to be refused state protection by the police, there are police complaint mechanisms in place that would be available to them in Budapest. Penalties for police officers found guilty of wrong doing include reprimand, dismissal, and criminal prosecution.26\n[30] Budapest is the location of the European Roma Rights Center. This Center is an international public interest law organization that works to oppose anti-Roma racism and human rights abuses of Roma.27\n[31] The Appellants testified that they filed complaints with the police but they received no help. The police told them that they could not do anything because the claimants were unable to provide identity information about the perpetrators. These claimants were harassed and physically assaulted by some unknown racist Hungarians. In this regard, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, the police were not in a position to investigate, given the lack of identification that these claimants appeared to have had about the alleged perpetrators. As stated in Kallai, Nikoletta,28 the RPD had determined that the applicant had not discharged her burden of rebutting the presumption of state protection, given the fact that it would be difficult for the police to make arrests in the absence of the identity of her assailants.\n[32] Regardless, in this respect, the panel finds it reasonable to expect these claimants to seek redress, by reporting corruption or the alleged inaction by the authorities, to other appropriate security organizations that are mandated to look into corruption, or unjustified inaction by the authorities, especially if these claimants were to believe that they are being denied protection due to their alleged Roma ethnicity.\n[33] The panel accepts that corruption and racism exists among the police in Hungary. The documentary evidence, however, shows that the Hungarian authorities have had some success in curtailing abuse by the police by increasing the recruitment of Roma police officers, providing training in human rights, and in 2008 by setting up the IPCC which is responsible for receiving complaints against misbehaviour of the police.29\nSubmitting a complaint against a police officer\nFor a complaint against the \"unlawful action\" of a police officer to be submitted to the local captain of the police, with a higher ranking captain having the option to appeal the decision (Hungary 19 Sept. 2011). The resulting decision can be reviewed by the court (ibid.). In correspondence with the Research Directorate, the HHC similarly noted that the Police Act allows for any individual who has his or her \"fundamental\" rights violated by the police to \"file a complaint with the police unit responsible\" for the violation (15 Sept. 2011).\nThe HHC further informed the Research Directorate that\ncomplaints shall be submitted within 30 days of the alleged violation by the concerned person or his\/her representative. (Complaints may also be represented by human rights NGOs or foundations, minority self-governments or certain law professors.) The complaint is decided on in an administrative procedure by the head of the respective police unit within 30 days after receiving the complaint.\" (HHC 15 Sept. 2011)\nThe HHC noted that this \"first instance decision\" can be appealed \"on any ground\" to the \"superior of the concerned police unit\" (ibid.). The appeal must be filed within 15 days after the delivery of the first instance decision, which shall forward the appeal and all the documents concerning the case to the superior unit within eight days after the appeal deadline, unless the unit which decided on the complaint withdraws the decision, refuses it without in-merit examination, or amends, corrects or supplements it in accordance with the appeal. If the appeal is forwarded to it, the superior body shall deliver a reasoned decision, affirming, modifying or annulling the first instance decision. (ibid.)\nThe subsequent \"second instance decision may be challenged before the court by the complainant\" (ibid.). However, the court \"may not change the decision: it may only send the case back to the police and order a new procedure (however, the police are obliged to follow the guidelines set by the court in the new procedure)\" (ibid.).30\n...\nAccording to Hungary's UN submission, the Complaints Body is \"independent\" of the government to ensure that the rights of citizens are protected (ibid. 16 Feb. 2011, para. 70). The HHC also notes that the Complaints Body is \"functionally external to the police authorities, and [that] its budget is included into the budget line of the Office of the Hungarian Parliament\" (HHC 15 Sept. 2011). The five members of the Complaints Body are lawyers chosen by Parliament to serve a six-year term (Hungary 16 Feb. 2011, para. 70). According to the HHC, the members cannot be re-elected, and they must all be \"lawyers with outstanding experience in the field of fundamental rights protection\" (HHC 15 Sept. 2011).\nThe HHC stated that to file a complaint with the Complaints Body, it has to be \"filed within eight days of the alleged violation by the concerned person, who may also be represented by human rights NGOs or foundations, minority self-governments or certain law professors. Anonymous complaints or complaints arriving from someone acting on behalf of the victim without a proper authorization are rejected automatically.\" (ibid.)\nAccording to Hungary's report to the UN, the National Police Commissioner (also translated as the National Chief of Police and Chief Police Captain) is required to submit monthly reports to the Complaints Body about \"complaints submitted to the Police\" (Hungary 16 Feb. 2011, para. 70). If the Complaints Body finds that a citizen's \"fundamental rights\" have been seriously violated, it sends its decision to the Police Commissioner (ibid.; HHC 15 Sept. 2011), \"who shall deliver a resolution within 30 days\" (Hungary 16 Feb. 2011, para. 70). Although the Police Commissioner \"delivers the decision on the individual complaint,\" he can only deviate from the Complaint Body's recommendation on \"the basis of detailed argumentation\" (HHC 15 Sept. 2011). The Police Commissioner's decision can be submitted to court for judicial review (ibid.; Hungary 16 Feb. 2011, para. 70; ibid. 19 Sept. 2011), as can decisions made by the Complaints Body (ibid.). The Minorities Ombudsman said that although the Police Commissioner can accept or refuse a decision from the Complaints Body, \"[i]n practice,\" he \"neglect[s]\" 90 percent of the Complaints Body's decisions (ibid.).\nIf the Complaints Body determines either that there has been no violation of fundamental rights or that the violation was not \"substantial,\" the complaint is forwarded to the police unit of the officer who committed the violation, unless the complainant does not allow it, in which case the case is \"terminated\" (HHC 15 Sept. 2011). If the complaint does not fall under the mandate of the Complaints Body, it is forwarded to the appropriate authority (ibid.). The Complaints Body will \"[r]eject the complaint if the competent authority may not be established, or the complaint is filed after the deadline\" (ibid.).\nIn a March 2011 ERRC report on anti-Roma violence in Hungary, which looked at 22 cases of violence against Roma, the organization noted that \"[p]olice misconduct and procedural errors were documented during the investigation of one of the violent crimes against Roma, as raised by NGOs and later confirmed by the Independent Police Complaint [Body] and by the Head of Police. Misconduct by the National Security Service was also revealed.\" (ERRC Mar. 2011, 19)\nThe HHC indicates that in 2009 the Complaints Body issued 457 decisions on 737 complaints and that, of those 457 decisions, 59 were considered \"severe\" violations of fundamental rights and sent to the National Police Commissioner for adjudication (HHC 15 Sept. 2011). The Police Commissioner fully agreed with the Complaints Body in 11 of the 59 cases and partly agreed in 26 (ibid.). In 2010, the Complaints Body received 531 complaints and delivered 428 decisions, out of which 166 cases were considered \"severe\" violations of fundamental rights (ibid.). These cases were also sent to the Police Commissioner, who fully agreed with 14 of the Complaint Body's decisions and partly agreed with 4 others (ibid.).\nComplaint mechanisms\nThe Minorities Ombudsman indicated that there is a general lack of information about appropriate forums through which victims of human rights violations can submit their complaints (Hungary 19 Sept. 2011). He further stated that the main mechanisms for submitting human rights violations are only located in Budapest (ibid.). For many settlements, the only available mechanism is something called a \"minor-offence authority,\" which can be local municipal clerks, the police, or the tax office (ibid.). These authorities deal with minor \"unlawful behaviour,\" such as the refusal to provide service or the delivery of poor service in retail outlets, and their decisions can be contested in court (ibid.).\nIn addition, the Minorities Ombudsman pointed out that the majority of the Roma live in poor towns and small villages in rural areas of Hungary, making it difficult for them to find legal aid, whether from legal experts or NGOs that are working in cities (ibid). He noted that although the country has no specific complaints mechanisms for Roma whose human rights are violated, their anti-discrimination legal network was \"integrated into the free legal aid system inside county\/capital governmental administration offices in 2010\" (ibid.).31\n[34] Despite the above, the panel would be remiss if it did not acknowledge that racism and discrimination exists throughout Hungary. The panel, however, finds that, in Budapest, these claimants, in their particular situation and circumstances, would obtain adequate state protection if they were to need it and seek it diligently. The panel finds that the government has enacted legislation, and put in place many tactical initiatives across several departments and that they are producing results on the ground. The documentary evidence shows that the claimants have recourse to obtain state protection, or to seek redress if they are denied state protection services due to their alleged Roma ethnicity.\n[35] Based on the totality of the evidence adduced, the panel finds that, if the claimants were to move to Budapest, adequate state protection would be reasonably forthcoming to these claimants.\n[36] The panel finds that the documentary evidence demonstrates that Hungary continues to provide protection for all its citizens, including Roma and other ethnic minorities. Although not perfect, the panel finds that the evidence demonstrates that Hungary's progressively evolving legislation\/measures\/actions to provide protection for its citizens, including Roma, are actually having an impact operationally on the ground. The evidence also demonstrates that police do investigate crimes against Roma and that perpetrators are being held responsible when there is sufficient evidence.\n[37] The panel also takes guidance from the Federal Court that each claim must be decided on its own merits. In other words, it is not reasonable to state that all Roma cannot be afforded state protection.\n[38] In Mudrak,32 the Court states:\n... [i]t is also incorrect to, in effect, reverse the presumption of adequate state protection in a democratic society when a country enacts legislation, or when there is evidence of increasing acts of violence, thereby requiring the Board to demonstrate the operational adequacy of measures taken to prevent incidents of persecution in its reasons.\n...Nor should the fact that a democratic government enacting legislation and putting other measures in place to combat persecution, somehow be seen as an admission of a failure of state protection. ... [E]xtensive and substantial legislation and other measures being undertaken should be treated as evidence supporting the democratic foundations of the country, thereby enhancing the presumption of adequate state protection as opposed to requiring the Board to demonstrate operational adequacy.\n[39] The panel finds, after a thorough review of all of the evidence in this case, acknowledging the situation is not perfect, that adequate state protection would be reasonably forthcoming to these claimants in their particular situation and circumstances if these claimants were to need it and diligently seek it upon return to Hungary.\n[40] Based on the above, the panel finds that these claimants' alleged fear of harm in Budapest has no objective basis.\nThe second prong test\n[41] The panel considers the personal situation and circumstances of these claimants. In this regard, Thirunavukkarasu33 sets a very high threshold for what makes an IFA unreasonable in all the circumstances. The hardship associated with dislocation and relocation is not the kind of undue hardship that renders an IFA unreasonable.34\n[42] The panel notes that the principal claimant had varied work experience. He has twelve years of formal education, including vocational training. Having considered the totality of the evidence in this case, including these claimants' particular situation and circumstances, the panel finds that it is not objectively unreasonable for these claimants to seek refuge in Budapest. The work opportunities in this major city are greater than in the small town in which they had lived prior to coming to Canada.\n[43] Further, the claimants have had experience travelling and living outside their usual place of residence, having resided in Canada for a few years. Moreover, Budapest being a large city, the claimants would be been able to participate in a variety of social, recreational and economic activities in the city.\n[44] The panel has considered the physical and psychological impact on the female claimant of returning to Hungary and living in Budapest. The panel has considered the claimants' medical documents.35 The panel finds that Budapest, being a capital city, has all essential services, including medical facilities and educational institutions.\n[45] These claimants have utilized health services in Hungary. The fact that medical treatment and other health services are better in Canada does not make the IFA in Budapest in Hungary unreasonable. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, these claimants including the female claimant, would be able to access essential medical treatment and other services in Hungary should they return to Hungary and live in Budapest. Moreover, Budapest as a large city would have much more to offer in the way of medical treatment than their small town.\n[46] Therefore, the panel finds Budapest to be a reasonable IFA for these claimants in all their particular situation and circumstances.\n[47] The panel finds that these claimants have a viable IFA in Budapest.\nDISPOSITION\n[48] For the reasons given in the foregoing, and in consideration of the totality of the evidence and the relevant jurisprudence upon which the panel relies, the panel determines that the claimants are not Convention refugees pursuant to section 96, nor persons in need of protection pursuant to subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\n[49] Therefore, these claims are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Susan Kular\"\nS.S.

He claimed that after the Taliban took control of Bamyan in November 2000, they forced him to work with them to XXXX XXXX from the homes in the surrounding villages. He was forced to do this under threat of injury or death to either himself, his mother, or his brother. The claimant states that he was forced to go to some thirty villages in a period of about forty to forty-five days. During this time the Taliban members did not allow him to return home. The claimant stated that while the main aim was to XXXX XXXX, valuables were also taken from the homes. These homes belonged to relatives and friends of the claimant.\n[3] Fearful of retribution from the villagers, the claimant left home and went to the Persian Gulf area of Iran as soon as the Taliban released him. The claimant remained in Iran for more than ten years before he attempted to return home. When he did, he learned that the villagers remained angry at him; that they considered him an infidel; and that many refused to interact with his mother and the brother who were still living on the family farm. His mother pled with him to leave. She told him that he likely would be killed if it were to become known that he had returned home. The claimant left Afghanistan and returned to Iran after about three days.\n[4] On his way to Iran a group of Hazara young men recognised him. The group attacked him. He received a cut to the left side of his XXXX that required XXXX sutures to close. In addition, he had to be hospitalised for about fifteen days. Upon leaving hospital the claimant made plans to leave Iran. With the help of an agent the claimant made his way to Greece. He did not make a refugee claim in Greece, because he was told that such a claim would not succeed. From Greece, the agent took the claimant to either XXXX or XXXX, via XXXX and XXXX, before making his way to Canada. The entire trip took the claimant more than four months.\nNEXUS\n[5] The panel considered the question of nexus to a Convention ground and found that there was a link between what the claimant feared and one of the Convention grounds.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] For the following reasons, I find that the claimant does not meet the definition of Convention refugee as set out in IRPA.\nIDENTITY\n[7] The Claimant's personal identity was open to question as he travelled to Canada using a false Japanese passport. 3 However, on file were translated copies of what appeared to be registration documents that had been issued by the Afghan authorities in Bamyan province. In addition, the claimant's testimony using the Dari language fixed him as a person as likely being from Afghanistan. Therefore, the panel concluded that, on a balance of probabilities the claimant was indeed who he said he was and was a citizen of Afghanistan.\nThe Claimant's Identity as an ethnic Hazara\n[8] The claimant claimed to be an ethnic Hazara. He states he is recognisable as being Hazara by his name and facial features. Based on this aspect of his testimony, which the panel found credible, it accepts that the claimant is ethnically Hazara.\nANALYSIS\nCredibility\n[9] This claim turns on the credibility of the claimant's allegations and the reasonableness of his decision to come to Canada.\n[10] The panel asked the claimant why he was making a claim for Convention refugee status in Canada. In response he stated that his life was in danger from former soldiers who are now members of the Wadhat party, which now holds political power in his home province. In addition, the villagers whose homes he entered to do the bidding of the Taliban are also hostile to him and to a lesser extent to his family members. He testified that they warned him of a future day of reckoning.\n[11] Asked why this threat should persist more than seventeen years after the events; the claimant responded that the villagers did not understand his situation and, therefore, they were not sympathetic. The documentary evidence indicates that as of April 2011,\nThere were numerous credible reports that the Taliban and other insurgent forces recruited children younger than age 18, in some cases as suicide bombers and human shields, and in other cases to assist with their work. NGOs and UN agencies reported that the Taliban tricked children, promised them money or forced them to become suicide bombers.4\n[12] Thus, the objective documentary evidence clearly supports the possibility that the claimant had been truthful in his allegations, that he had been abducted and forced to work for the Taliban. The trouble is, that certain aspects about his evidence regarding his circumstances lack plausibility.\n[13] In particular, the claimant's mother and his oldest brother continue to live in Afghanistan. Not only do they live in Afghanistan, they live in the same village and location in which they lived prior to the claimant's alleged abduction, seemingly without problems. The claimant was unable to provide a satisfactory reason for why that might be so, when the question was put to him by the panel.\n[14] In light of the claimant's testimony that the villagers regard him an infidel and that one of his brothers was badly beaten when he came to his defence, the panel is not persuaded that his mother and older brother would be able to live peaceably in the community as they appear to have done. The panel finds that the ability of the claimant's family members to remain in their village undermines the credibility of his allegation that he cannot return to his village for fear of being killed by vengeful villagers.\n[15] The claimant alleged that the Taliban chose him because he was able to communicate with the villagers in Farsi. He variously testified that when he entered their homes at the behest of the Taliban, the villagers would not have known that the Taliban had taken him hostage, and also that he would tell them that he had been abducted when he entered the homes. Outside of the inherent contradiction, the panel finds that such a scenario is not plausible given that the claimant also testified that his relatives, specifically his mother and brother, remained at home while the Taliban took him away. Therefore, it is more likely than not that the villagers would have known of his abduction.\n[16] The claimant testified that the Taliban regularly abducted young men as a tactic. The panel put the question squarely to the claimant asking him whether, if abduction was a regular tactic of the Taliban, and if, as he testified, the Taliban was taking hostages from every village, whether that fact would not be well known, however, the claimant did not respond. The panel finds that in the circumstances that the claimant alleges, it was more likely than not, his situation would have been known for miles around; and the villagers would have known he had acted out of duress. Accordingly, the panel is not persuaded that the claimant would have been faced with the threats of retribution that he has alleged.\nThe 2011 Attack on the Claimant\n[17] The claimant testified that he was attacked and beaten and cut on his XXXX in 2011 as he was returning to Iran. It was this attack that prompted him not to return to Iran but to make his way to some other country.\n[18] As with everything about this claim, the attack was not substantiated. The panel observed that the claimant does bear a scar on his XXXX as he claims, however, given the absence of independent evidence and the credibility concerns with the claimant's testimony, the panel finds that there is a lack of credible evidence to support the claimant's allegation that he sustained the injury in the way he alleges.\nCould the Claimant Relocate within Afghanistan?\n[19] The panel put the question of a possible IFA to the claimant. He denied the possibility, stating that there was nowhere in Afghanistan to which he could safely go, as he could not move to areas where a different ethnicity is dominant. He also claimed that anywhere that he would go there would be a network of Hazaras who would seek revenge on him. When asked why he could not go to Kabul, where the documentary evidence indicates many Hazara live, the claimant demurred, stating that many people from his village who were soldiers are now living in Kabul making it impossible for him to go back there\n[20] The panel is not persuaded that the claimant would not be able to live in Kabul, because the panel finds that he has not presented credible and trustworthy evidence that he faces serious possibility of harm from vengeful villagers in the XXXX district of Bamyan province.\nCONCLUSION\n[21] The claimant alleges that he would be at risk in Afghanistan, as a person who was perceived as assisting the Taliban in their mission to XXXX and XXXX villagers around where he lived. For the reasons set out above the panel is not persuaded by his allegations. Accordingly, the panel finds that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n[22] Therefore, the claim is rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Hazelyn Ross\"\nH.

Their allegations are set out in a single narrative written from the perspective of the principal claimant. The narrative is attached to each of their Personal Information Forms (\"PIF\").4\n[5] The female claimant, on behalf of herself and the other claimants, allege discrimination in society, education, employment, health care, and housing. They also fear the rise of far right Jobbik political party and potential attacks by Hungarian guards and skinheads. With respect to healthcare, the claimants allege that the female claimant failed to get adequate medical treatment when she was pregnant. They further allege that the principal claimant was demoted from his position to a lower position as a result of the female claimant's ethnicity. The claimants further allege that their daughter was poorly treated when she was left a daycare center.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] I find that the claimants are not Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, nor are they persons in need of protection pursuant to section 97(1) of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\n[7] The determinative issues in this case were whether claimants' testimony was credible, whether the treatment they suffered amounted to persecution, and whether they successfully rebutted the presumption of state protection.\nIdentity\n[8] The claimants' identities as nationals of Hungary are established by their passports.5 The identity of the female claimant, as a person of Roma ethnicity, was established on the basis of her vague testimony, the principal claimant is a Hungarian national and their daughter is also a Hungarian national.\nAlleged discrimination in healthcare not credible\n[9] In accepting the female claimant's testimony, the panel finds that the female claimant was not denied adequate healthcare due to her Roma ethnicity. There was no evidence presented that the principal claimant, as well as the minor claimant, had any issues involving denial of healthcare. The female claimant's testimony was credible as she did not appear to embellish and gave her viva voce testimony in a straightforward manner. However, the female claimant testified about her illness which began in early 2011. The female claimant testified about her trips to the hospital and the manner which she was treated. The female claimant felt that, due to her ethnicity, she was being mistreated. When questioned by the panel about how she was mistreated, the female claimant conceded that she perceived that she was being ill-treated due to her ethnicity. When further questioned by the panel regarding her hospital visits, the female claimant further conceded that she did receive medical attention which included immediate surgery.\n[10] In testimony, it became clear that the female claimant was under the care of a gynecologist due to a gynecology (viral infection) problem which was referred to surgery when she had to return to the hospital in XXXX of 2011. The female claimant produced medical reports6 from doctors in Hungary regarding the medical treatments they performed and treatments she received. No evidence was presented to indicate that the female did not received the appropriate healthcare. There is evidence which she submitted from Dr. P. XXXX, a doctor7 here in Canada, which outlines the surgical procedures and treatments the female claimant has received. Although the female claimant testified that she feels that she was misdiagnosed in Hungary by the doctors, which has resulted in the fact that she can no longer have children, the panel sympathizes with the claimants with this outcome, but unfortunately there is no evidence before the panel to confirm this portion of her testimony that this was a result of her not receiving the proper and adequate healthcare due to her ethnicity.\n[11] Accordingly, I find that the claimants have failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that they suffered discrimination in healthcare.\nTreatment did not otherwise amount to persecution\n[12] For treatment to amount to persecution, it must be \"sustained or systemic violation of basic human rights demonstrative of a failure of state protection\".8 The claimants' remaining complaints relate to discrimination in housing, education, and employment.\n[13] The female claimant alleges they were victims of discrimination, as her husband held the position of XXXX XXXX XXXX, but was demoted to a XXXX position. I reject this submission. The testimony of the female claimant was that the principal claimant was called into the management office and advised that the XXXX that employed him was re-organizing and that his position was no longer viable. The principal claimant in his viva voce evidence corroborated the testimony of the female claimant that he had been summoned to the management office, and was advised that his position was being terminated due to re-organization of the XXXX. The principal claimant further testified that he was offered another position as he have been a loyal employee. The claimants did not offer any evidence that the position was filled by another person. There is nothing discriminatory about a company re-organizing and eliminating position(s), in this case they actually offered the principal claimant another position, albeit not similar to what he had, but they did offer him a position. I find that there is no inherent discrimination in the practice of the companies who re-organize their structure. I find that the treatment suffered by the claimants in the eviction was not discrimination or persecution.\n[14] Based on my review of the claimants' circumstances I am prepared to accept that the female claimant may have suffered discrimination in education and employment. However, I disagree that this discrimination cumulatively amounts to persecution because it is not sustained or systemic violation of their human rights. Furthermore, I find that this discrimination is not demonstrative of a failure of state protection due to the reasons set out in the next section.\n[15] I am also prepared to accept that the claimants may have suffered some mistreatment by society. The claimant testified about dropping off their daughter at the daycare center, and upon returning to pick her up, her diaper had not been changed and there was a rash on the child's buttocks. However, I am not prepared to find that this treatment on its own amounted to persecution in light of the isolated nature of these events and the claimants' failure to seek state protection in response to this treatment.\n[16] Ultimately, the refugee protection is granted on a forward looking analysis in light of the adequacy of state protection. As set out further below, I find that the claimants have failed to rebut the presumption of adequate state protection in Hungary.\nPresumption of State Protection not rebutted in the alternative\n[17] Regardless of the above section, the claimants have not rebutted the presumption of state protection which is sufficient to dismiss these claims, even if I were to find that the cumulative discrimination amounted to persecution.\n[18] There is a presumption that the state is capable of protecting its citizens except in situations where the state is in complete breakdown.9 A claimant who alleges that the state protection is inadequate must persuade the Board that the evidence establishes that the state protection is inadequate.10 The evidence that state protection is inadequate must not only be reliable and probative, it must also satisfy the Board, on a balance of probabilities, that the state protection is inadequate.11\n[19] A claimant can rebut the presumption by providing clear and convincing evidence of the state's inability to protect.12 The onus is on the claimant to approach the state for protection in situations where state protection might reasonably be forthcoming.13\n[20] No government can be expected to guarantee perfect protection of all of its citizens at all times, and the fact that a state is not always successful in protecting its citizens is not enough to justify a claim. This is particularly true when a state is in effective control of its territory and has military, police and civil authorities in place and is making serious attempts to protect its citizens.14\n[21] The burden of proving an absence of state protection is directly proportional to the level of democracy that exists in the state.15 The documentary evidence before me indicates that Hungary is a functioning democracy.16 It has functioning political and judicial systems in place and an official apparatus sufficient to provide a measure of protection to its citizens. Hungary is in control of its territory and has functioning security forces, both military and police, in place. There is no evidence of a total breakdown of state authority in Hungary.\n[22] Furthermore, the claimants cannot rebut the presumption of state protection in a functioning democracy by asserting only a subjective reluctance to engage the state.17\n[23] The Federal Court has held that while the documentary evidence of general country conditions of Roma in Hungary raises human rights concerns, the mere fact of being of Roma ethnicity in Hungary is not, in and of itself, sufficient to establish that an applicant faces more than a mere possibility of persecution upon return.18 The claimants have a burden of establishing a link between the general documentary evidence and their specific circumstances.19\n[24] The other remaining links to the general documentary evidence concern persecution due to cumulative claimants of ethnicity such as Roma, in education, employment, and housing (insofar as the claimants allegedly may encounter racist barriers to obtain a healthcare).\n[25] For the reasons that follow, I find that the claimants have failed to rebut the presumption that Hungary is willing and able to afford them adequate state protection in the future if they needed it.\n[26] There are government institutions in place that enforce human rights legislation in response to violations caused by public as well as private actors. The most important of those is the Equal Treatment Authority (\"ETA\"), which is an independent administrative body that protects, enforces, and promotes equality and the right to equal treatment with respect to direct\/indirect discrimination, segregation, harassment, and victimization.20 The ETA has the power to issue legally binding and enforceable decisions as well as non-binding opinions.21\n[27] There is evidence that the ETA solicits a large number of complaints and acts on them. In 2010, the ETA received 1,300 complaints and started investigations into 377 of them. Discrimination was determined to have taken place in 40 cases. Most of the cases were complaints of employment-related discrimination, but there were also instances of racism in the public service.22\n[28] The ETA has used its powers to protect the human rights of Roma in response to discriminatory state action in housing. On July 15, 2015, the ETA established that the Municipality of Miskolc subjected residents of a segregated area to the threat of homelessness or having to move to other segregated areas and, by doing so, discriminated against them because of their social status, financial situation, and Romani origin. The ETA fined the municipality 500,000 forint ($1,800) and ordered it to cease discrimination.23 I find that the actions of the ETA establish, on a balance of probabilities, that it is willing and able to provide adequate state protection to Roma.\n[29] The independent court system is also available to correct discriminatory conduct against Roma in housing. In the wake of the City of Miskolc's attempts to mass evict Roma, nine nearby municipalities enacted ordinances to exclude evacuees (widely expected to be former Miskolc Roma) from access to social services.24 On April 28, 2015, the Curia (Hungarian court) annulled the Szerencs municipality decree on the grounds of discrimination, and the other eight municipalities withdrew their similar decrees by the end of the year.25 I find that the actions of the Curia, and the responses by the affected municipalities establish, on a balance of probabilities, that when sought, state protection against discrimination in housing will be forthcoming and adequate.\n[30] I note that, as an example in housing using the situation in Miskolc, unlike the other nine cities, Miskolc has responded by seeking review of adverse judicial and ETA decisions against it and resorting to other discriminatory conduct.26 While such conduct is distasteful, on the whole it constitutes a local failure of state protection, as opposed to a widespread national climate of insecurity and inadequate protection as suggested by counsel. The Board documentation on the issue of housing evictions in Miskolc indicates that it is highly localized to the \"Numbered Streets\".27 I find, based on this information, the claimants can avail themselves of adequate state protection to remedy any future discrimination in housing if it becomes an issue, although there was no evidence during the hearing that the claimants had any issue with housing.\n[31] There is evidence that the Hungarian justice system will enforce the human rights of Roma when faced by inappropriate police actions. On September 17, 2015, the Tribunal of Eger ruled in a case initiated by the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union that the police discriminated against Romani residents in Gyongyospata during a march by the \"For Better Future\" far-right neighborhood watch group and other extremist groups in 2011. The court found that police failed to protect the Romani residents threatened by the extremist groups and later imposed excessive fines on local Roma for minor misdemeanors.28 I find that such court decisions indicate that the Hungarian state, while not perfect, will enforce the law when Roma human rights are violated.\n[32] In the education sphere, the government implemented the following programs:\n... provided scholarships for socially disadvantaged students, including 5,668 elementary and secondary school children and 858 vocational school students who declared themselves to be Roma. It also provided scholarships for socially disadvantaged higher education students, including 132 Roma. There were 178 \"Tanoda\" afterschool centers around the country providing tutoring and extracurricular activities for disadvantaged, mostly Romani children. During the year the Tanoda network assisted approximately 5,000 disadvantaged students. There were eight Romani special colleges across the country sponsored by the government using EU funds, five of which were operated by Christian denominations and three managed by universities. The special colleges provided housing and tutoring for approximately 235 Romani students enrolled in higher educational institutions.29\n[33] In my view, these programs constitute operational action to improve the position of Roma in society. Educational scholarships and student housing for Roma, in my view, constitute adequate operational measures to counter private and public discrimination suffered by the claimants in education, healthcare and housing.\n[34] I find that the implementation of these programs establishes on a balance of probabilities that effective state protection exists and is forthcoming in response to discrimination cumulatively amounting to persecution and consequent poverty and marginalization suffered by Roma.\n[35] Implementation of these programs also shows that the extreme racist rhetoric of Jobbik and other politicians, which has been percolating for several years, has not resulted in an abandonment of the Roma minority by the Hungarian state.\n[36] Hungary has a number of state institutions to address abuses, including breaches of human rights such as the ETA which was canvassed earlier in these reasons. I find that the female claimant could have turned to that institution for assistance and that the ETA would have provided her with adequate protection and consideration of her complaints on their merits regarding the alleged mistreatment she got during the hospital visits.\n[37] The panel notes that further to documentation regarding state protection clearly indicates that if Roma or persons have issues with the police they have avenues to pursue their complaints. Although the claimants have not testified about problems encountered by the police, but generally testified about the lack of adequate healthcare received, the panel points out that complaints against police may also be brought through the Prosecutorial Investigation Office, which meet the threshold for criminal liability.30 Otherwise, complaints against police may be brought to the relevant police unit or the Independent Police Complaints Board (\"IPCB\").31 Complaints to the IPCB can be brought with legal assistance and Legal Aid is available for indigent persons who complain about violation of their rights.32 The claimants may be eligible for legal aid, given their testimony that they receive social assistance. While the IPCB findings are not binding, they can be used before the courts in a lawsuit in the event that the chief of police refuses to accept the findings.33 In light of the above resources and mechanism for redress including the court system, I find the claimants failure to test state protection to be unreasonable and short of the clear and convincing evidence they are required to provide.\n[38] Counsel submits that there is a general climate of insecurity for Roma due to persecution by the state itself. Therefore the claimant is discharged from personally having to request protection. I disagree. There is insufficient evidence to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants would risk their lives seeking inadequate protection, merely to demonstrate that inadequacy.34 The objective evidence indicates that while discrimination against Roma, even by some parts of the state exists in Hungary, there are state institutions that offer adequate protection to Roma who complain.\n[39] The Federal Court has rejected the argument that every single one of Hungary's 200,000 to 500,000 citizens of Roma background has a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race and that the only reasonable conclusion with respect to state protection is that it is inadequate.35 If that be so, Hungary would be a failed state, yet it is not.36\n[40] The claimants have demonstrated a subjective reluctance to seek out the protection of their own state before taking the drastic step of immigrating to Canada and seeking surrogate protection. Subjective reluctance on its own does not rebut the presumption of state protection.37\n[41] Based on the insufficient efforts of the claimants to avail themselves of the protection of their own state and the objective country documentation before me, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants have failed to adduce clear and convincing evidence that rebuts the presumption that Hungary provides adequate state protection at the operational level in response to discrimination against Roma.\nPOST HEARING APPLICATION received November 14, 2017\n[42] At the conclusion of the hearing, an article involving a female Roma that had made a complaint to the ETA where she had alleged misconduct on the part of the hospital and its staff, was sent to counsel as a matter of interest. The article was regarding the action taken by the ETA as a result of their investigation. The article was given to counsel as a matter of interest and sharing it was not entered as evidence but merely as information that the panel had run across. Counsel has now taken umbrage to the article and has made submissions, insofar as alleging the panel of \"cherry picking\" and further alleging that the panel is bias towards his clients. Counsel is asking the panel to recuse himself, and further to reconvene the hearing so that he can submit\/produce a post-hearing psychological functioning report for the female claimant.\n[43] First and foremost, the article was given to counsel as a matter of interest. It was not put into evidence, nor has the panel made any reference to said article in his reasons. As such, the panel finds that this is a moot point. The article was not used or was reference made to its existence, therefore the assertion that the panel was \"cherry picking\" is totally unfounded and without merit as alleged by counsel.\n[44] In regards to the application to reconvene for the purposes to produce post-hearing psychological functioning report for the female is denied. If counsel had any concerns regarding the female claimant's functions, he had ample time before the hearing to have the female claimant obtain said psychological report. Counsel is experienced and if he had concerns, he could have contacted the Board in advance and requested accommodations for the female claimant. At no time prior, or during the hearing, did counsel alert the panel to any accommodations concerns he had concerning the state of the female claimant. In light of the above, the panel finds that there are no exceptional circumstances to warrant the hearing to be reconvened. Once again, the panel stresses that the article given to counsel was a matter of interest, nothing else. There was no evidence presented at the hearing of a \"change of circumstances\", nor has the panel relied upon any documentation to support or suggest what counsel alleges.\n[45] The panel is in receipt an application for recusal which was made by counsel post hearing.38 The panel member has read and considered the application made by counsel, and counsel's application for the panel member to recuse himself. As such, the Panel member has considered the matter of bias.\n[46] The common-law principles of natural justice are recognized in section 162(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA):\n162. (2) Each Division shall deal with all proceedings before it informally and quickly as the circumstances and the considerations of fairness and natural justice permit.\n[47] The principles of natural justice include the common-law rule against bias. That rule disqualifies a decision-maker from determining any case in which there is actual bias or an appearance of bias, also described as a reasonable apprehension of bias.\n[48] The test for \"reasonable apprehension of bias\" was formulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Committee for Justice and Liberty v. National Energy Board:39\nWhat would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically - and having thought the matter through - conclude? Would he think that it is more likely than not that [the decision-maker], whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly.\n[49] That Court also held that such a test should not be related to the \"very sensitive or scrupulous conscience.\"\n[50] Clear evidence is required to support an allegation of bias. The Federal Court reiterated in Ali40 that:\n... the Court of Appeal in Arthur v. Canada (Attorney General), [2001] F.C.J. No. 1091 [(F.C.A., no. A-991-90), MacGuigan, Linden, Gray, November 2, 1992, reported: 18 Imm. L.R. (2d) 22 (F.C.A.)], has emphasized that an allegation of bias cannot be done lightly. It cannot rest on mere suspicion, pure conjecture or mere impressions of an applicant. It must be supported by material evidence.\n[51] The allegation of an apprehension of bias should be first put to the person against whom the allegation is being made in order to allow the person an opportunity to respond.41 It is therefore appropriate for this panel member to decide the motion against it.42 The panel member has read Counsel's submissions regarding the alleged bias with an open mind before ruling on the matter.43\n[52] I find that an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically, and having thought it through, could not reasonably conclude that the member, consciously or unconsciously, would not decide this claim fairly.\n[53] Despite Counsel's application and allegations in order to get a De Novo hearing, the claimants received a fair hearing, and their claims must be determined on its merits.\n[54] I am required to adhere to the provisions of the Code of Conduct and the Conflict of Interest Act, and to make my decisions fairly, based on the evidence before me. There is no evidence that I would not do so. When I was appointed to the Immigration Refugee Board, I swore to perform my duties as a member in compliance with these instruments.\n[55] The reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the counsel has no basis in fact, is speculative and unsupported by any evidence whatsoever.\n[56] As for the reasons provided by the panel member in his decision not to recuse himself, the panel member believes they are sufficient as the panel member has correctly applied the test for bias as set out in Committee for Justice and Liberty above, and considered whether any comments made could constitute a valid ground for reasonable apprehension of bias. The panel member also addresses the duty of RPD members under the Code of Conduct for Members of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, to decide every case on its merits and to not be influenced by any extraneous factors.\n[57] The application of counsel that I recuse myself is therefore denied.\nCONCLUSION\n[58] Having considered all of the evidence and based on the above analysis, the panel finds the claimants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.\n[59] Accordingly, I find that the claimants would not face a serious possibility of persecution in Hungary or, on a balance of probabilities, that they would be subjected personally to a risk to their life, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture.\n(signed)\n\"Luis F.

The panel also finds that the claimant is not a person in need of protection, in that his removal to Pakistan would not subject him personally to a risk to life, or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. There are no substantial grounds to believe that his removal to Pakistan will subject the claimant personally to a danger of torture for the following reasons.\nSUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS\n[4] The following is a brief summary of the allegations that the claimant set out in the narrative portion of his Personal Information Form1. The claimant owned XXXX XXXX XXXX in Lahore, which resulted in him being targeted by fundamentalist Sunni fanatics and the Sipah-e-Sahaba Party (SSP), a fundamentalist religious party. The claimant reported the \"persecution\" to the police and had First Information Reports (FIRs) registered against these groups but no one was arrested. The claimant closed his XXXX in 2002 and he subsequently received threats. The claimant traveled to Dubai in 2008 where he worked at a friend's XXXX XXXX until XXXX 2009. He hoped that the fanatics forgot about him and that he could start a new life in Pakistan with his family.\n[5] The claimant returned home and opened a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX business and XXXX XXXX in XXXX 2009. In XXXX 2010, as the claimant was leaving his business on his motorbike, unknown people came up to him, accused him of selling XXXX XXXX, beat him, and stole his valuables along with his motorbike. The claimant said the police did nothing for him when he reported the matter. He then said the local SSP started to make threatening phone calls to the claimant so he closed this XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX business in XXXX 2011.\n[6] Four months later in XXXX 2011, the claimant opened his third XXXX XXXX in another part of the city. In early-XXXX 2011, another local SSP person called the claimant and warned him to close the business. The claimant said he reported the call to the police but they took no action because the police are afraid of the SSP as well. That same month, the claimant's brother, a Canadian citizen, acquired visitors' visas for the claimant and their mother to visit Canada but the claimant said he did not want to leave his family alone so he did not travel.\n[7] The claimant said the Taliban and the SSP attacked his business on XXXX XXXX, 2011 and destroyed his XXXX. Given that all the international flights were booked, the claimant had to wait until January 24, 2012 to fly to Calgary, Alberta to stay with his brother. In February 2012, the claimant came to Toronto, Ontario where he filed a refugee claim.\n[8] The claimant said he is well-known to fundamentalists in Pakistan for running XXXX XXXX; they believe he was letting it operate as a XXXX XXXX; and his life is in danger. His wife has since told him by telephone that he \"had not become very visible to the Taliban\" but the claimant still fears being killed if he returns to Pakistan.\n[9] Finally, the claimant's addendum states that the fundamentalists have branded his business, an XXXX XXXX, as anti-Islamic and he will be persecuted.\nCREDIBILITY\n[10] As with all refugee claims, the credibility of a claimant is always a factor in a panel's assessment of the claimant's capacity to establish a well-founded fear of persecution. It is the duty of this panel to determine if there is reliable and trustworthy evidence that enables it to find the claimant's allegations truthful. However, in this case, the determinative issue is credibility by virtue of the claimant's lack of credibility regarding material aspects of his claim and his failure to provide either satisfactory or reasonable explanations for his actions, and\/or lack of action, in the particular circumstances of his story. While the panel is not obliged to cover all instances, it will provide its findings on these materials aspects that have resulted in finding that this claimant is not deserving of refugee protection for any Convention ground.\n[11] The claimant has presented his clear understanding of the inherent dangers of Islamic fundamentalism in Pakistan as manifested by some of the societal elements he has referenced. Such players and their violent activities are established in the objective documentary evidence. Nevertheless, despite these groups, whose purpose is to target any elements of Western influence, the claimant took chances as early as 2002 to open what can be reasonably characterized as a Western-type business; an XXXX XXXX. Today, it is common knowledge that XXXX XXXX are ubiquitous and are found in virtually every country of the world save for a few exceptions. XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX such as those operated by the claimant continue to operate in many Pakistani municipalities and these businesses, popular with citizens who wish to connect globally, are found regularly throughout Pakistan's large cities. This does not remove the danger in some places of being seen as anti-Islamic and in this case, the claimant was required to establish on a balance of probabilities that he would face serious persecution, on a Convention ground, were he to return to Pakistan.\n[12] Assuming the claimant's evidence of the 2002 closure of his XXXX XXXX was based on threats from fundamentalist elements, the panel asked the claimant why he would return to Lahore after his stay in Dubai and operate the same type of business in 2009 that got him into trouble in the first place. The claimant said he was good at this business and he was successful at it and he hoped that the people who targeted him the first time had, seven years later, forgotten about him. Assuming this to be the claimant's true motivation to reopen the same type of business along with a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX business, he had evidence in XXXX 2010 that this was still a problem when he was allegedly attacked a second time for operating the same business that the fundamentalists had opposed. The claimant has still more evidence of their opposition to such businesses when a third attack against him allegedly occurred in late-XXXX 2011.\n[13] The panel notes the claimant's motivation for opening the same type of business three times: he said these XXXX are very popular in Lahore and in the third location where he opened his business, there were a lot of educated people in the area and XXXX business was good. He said he was known for this business. However, the claimant responded affirmatively to the panel's questioning in three separate instances that he was not targeted for any personal profile he had, but instead for operating an XXXX XXXX business that some fundamentalist elements opposed. Thus, the claimant agreed he had no profile and that is was the nature of the business he operated that drew their attention.\n[14] This then begs the panel's question: why would the claimant continue to pursue and operate the same business several times over when he was, allegedly, repeatedly threatened and attacked for doing so? The panel finds that it is not the claimant himself but the type of business he operated that attracted the attention of some unknown fundamentalists. By extension, there are significant periods where the claimant experienced no issues. There is no supportable evidence in the claimant's documents or in his oral testimony for his claim that he was specifically targeted as being anti-Islamic.\n[15] In the panel's view, every person has the right to pursue one's interests and choices for economic livelihood. The panel supports the claimant's right to do what he knows best: the XXXX XXXX business. However, in a country like Pakistan with active and violently active fundamentalist elements who permeate all segments of society, it is not unreasonable to expect the claimant to minimize such risks to himself, and his family, by considering some other type of business that would not draw attention from fundamentalist elements. In this regard, the claimant failed to offer a plausible explanation to the panel why he would continue to put himself at risk by operating the same type of business over and over, that would draw violent types to attack it, and who oppose its perceived Western influences. There are no special skills or post-secondary requirements to open an XXXX XXXX and the claimant did not allude to any. All that the claimant recounted in his oral testimony is that he clearly enjoys this type of business and he tried to operate this business three times, but on each occasion, he was allegedly threatened and\/or attacked. The claimant has failed to offer any persuasive evidence why he would continue to do so in the face of these problems. Further, telling the panel that he was known for this type of business is not a satisfactory reason to stay in the XXXX business if they are being targeted.\n[16] It is also not unreasonable for the panel to expect a similarly-situated person to consider other means of financially supporting himself than through a business that draws the ongoing attention of fundamentalist types. Moreover, this claimant has significant international travel experience by his own evidence and experience working abroad in XXXX XXXX. In Canada, he is a XXXX XXXX in Toronto's largest and busiest city. It is reasonable for the panel to expect the claimant to be able to draw upon all his considerable and varied business skills and experience - acquired during his varied periods abroad in other types of employment - and to consider other less-visible types of businesses than an XXXX XXXX, which allegedly drew the interest and ire of some unknown fundamentalist types in Lahore.\n[17] This is particularly true after the XXXX 2010 incident when he was beaten and robbed of his personal effects and his motorbike. The panel was not persuaded that the claimant has linked this assault and robbery on his motorbike, to his operation of an XXXX XXXX XXXX The claimant simply failed to establish any persuasive link between the couple of thugs who assaulted and robbed him, or that this was anything other than a random assault common in a city of well over 11 million people. However, given his previous alleged experiences, it is reasonable to find that the claimant had proof that this was not a safe business vocation to continue to pursue. Within less than a year, however, the claimant has once again opened an XXXX XXXX albeit in a different neighbourhood where \"business was good.\" The panel finds that his continued operation of the same type of business undermines his credibility that he was experiencing the types of threats he has alleged, or that he was actually fearful of fundamentalist elements, or that he was in fact being targeted at all.\n[18] The claimant also has a wife and four children in Lahore; all of whom he left behind in Pakistan to come to Canada. It is unclear why the claimant would continue to expose himself to these threats and attacks, as evidenced above, let alone expose his family over the period from 2009 to his 2012 departure from Pakistan. Moreover, he said his wife told him that he is still being sought by the fundamentalists in Pakistan. A photocopy purporting to be a document from his brother-in-law2 (who, with his wife and daughter, lives with the claimant's wife and children) describing a XXXX 2016 break-in at the family home in Lahore is purported to be evidence of the fundamentalists' ongoing interest in the claimant personally. For reasons stated below, the panel finds that the claimant has added this document, of little probative value, in an attempt to connect a random break-in at the family home five years after he left Pakistan to some fundamentalist types who are allegedly still looking for him.\n[19] The panel finds that the claimant's problems, if true, were brought on in large part by exposing himself to those problems by operating a business, which some hardcore elements in Pakistan view as morally corrupt and contrary to their dogmatic views of Islam. The panel also finds, buoyed by the claimant's questionable testimony, that he does not have a profile butrather it was the nature of the business that drew the attention of fundamentalist elements to him, and that the claimant is not targeted for any particular profile. By extension, the panel finds the claimant does not face a serious possibility of cruel or inhuman treatment let alone persecution if he were to return to Pakistan.\n[20] As stated, the panel assigns little weight to the submission that he has a profile and that he has been branded as anti-Islamic, or that the fundamentalists have not forgotten about the claimant. The claimant has offered no persuasive evidence to support his statement that, even if he did some other business, he would be in fear no matter what he did. Given the evidence before it, the panel finds it reasonable that the claimant would pursue a less-visible type of business than an XXXX XXXX if he were truly fearful for his life. Also, the panel was not persuaded by the claimant's explanation why these unknown elements would be interested in him five years later; specifically, that \"they are not prepared to forget me.\" Then he said: \"I really do don't know\" and again confirmed to the panel that he has no profile. For the reasons stated, the claimant's contradictory testimony confirms for the panel that he has not established a profile in Pakistan and there are no persuasive reasons why the claimant cannot pursue any number of other private enterprise business activities that will not cause him problems, such as one perceived to be pro-Western, and therefore anti-Islamic.\n[21] Even if he had been targeted, which the panel does not believe, the panel must also address the claimant's allegations that there is no state protection available to him. There are three occasions that the panel must address.\n[22] First, as for claimant's assertion that he applied to the police and he named the organization he believed had targeted him through threatening phone calls in 2007 and the police did nothing for him, the claimant told the panel he wanted the police to trace the phone calls. The claimant did not specify whether the calls were made from a traceable landline or from a cellular telephone, but in Lahore - a city of more than 11 million people - the panel was not persuaded that the police's failure to set up a trace on the claimant's phone can be characterized as an example of a lack of state protection in Pakistan. In practical terms, the alleged calls were anonymous and did not continue over any significant period of time. Moreover, not once during the claimant's time in Lahore had anyone ever approached his home, targeted him or his family or threatened him, and the claimant made no such claim. The claimant's reason for leaving was to work in Dubai for a while and make enough money there to return to Pakistan to open another business. The claimant chose to open the same business despite the alleged threats.\n[23] Second, the claimant alleged two people threatened him, assaulted him and robbed him in XXXX 2010 as he was leaving the plaza where his business was located. In that case, the claimant ran to a fellow business owner's premises across the street and called the police who subsequently arrived; they attended on scene and took down all the claimant's information including a description of his attackers and the number plate of the attacker's motorbike; and the police registered an FIR for him. The claimant said nothing ever came of the incident.\n[24] Third, and more recently as referenced, the 2016 photocopied statement of the claimant's brother-in-law recounts that unknown people climbed over the walls of the property where the claimant's family lived; they broke into the home while the family was out; and they made off with some of the family's valuables. The claimant told the panel that this is what fundamentalists do in Pakistan. The panel notes, however, that claimant's family reported the break-in; the police responded to the call; they arrived at the house; asked questions; took statements; and they dusted the house for fingerprints3. However, the fingerprints were inconclusive and nothing ever came of that incident. The panel finds that the claimant has failed to link this break-in and theft of property to his allegations that fundamentalists were after him. The claimant has furnished no evidence to establish he has a profile that would make him the object of anti-Western attacks but for his repeated choice to run an XXXX XXXX three times over. The panel assigns little weight to the brother -in-law's statement and it regards the 2016 break-in as insufficient evidence of the claimant being targeted.\n[25] The claimant said he filed police reports in various instances, producing photocopies of these items at the hearing for the panel's review. The panel finds these materials to have little probative value, where the claimant, who said he had no confidence in the police, nevertheless allegedly kept reporting incidents to the police. The panel also put to the claimant the contents of Response to Information Request XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 20164, which reports that the police in Pakistan are corrupt and asked why, if he had no confidence in the police, he chose to keep reporting threats to them and keeping copies of those reports. The claimant said he wanted to keep a record of everything and show that there is no state protection. This response and thinking made little sense to the panel given that, despite alleged police inaction or inability to catch the alleged perpetrators, the claimant kept opening this same type of business and reporting incidents to the police. The panel finds the claimant's evidence not to be credible on this point and it undermines his credibility regarding alleged attacks by fundamentalist types.\n[26] In assessing these instances of alleged police reports, which have little probative value for the panel and the incidents as recounted, the panel notes the claimant's allegation that there is no state protection requires the panel's reference to relevant extracts from the Villafranca5 decision. For example:\nThe burden of showing that one is not able to avail oneself of the protection of one's own state is not easily satisfied. The test is an objective one and involves the claimant showing either that he is physically prevented from seeking his government's aid or that the government itself is in some way prevented from giving it.\n[27] At no time was this claimant ever physically prevented from seeking help from the police and in fact, the police responded to the robbery he experienced and to his family's break-in. The Court gives further direction in this regard as follows:\nNo government that makes any claim to democratic values or protection of human rights can guarantee the protection of all of its citizens at all times. Thus, it is not enough for a claimant merely to show that his government has not always been effective at protecting persons in his particular situation. Terrorism in the name of one warped ideology or another is a scourge afflicting many societies today; its victims, however much they may merit our sympathy, do not become convention refugees simply because their governments have been unable to suppress the evil....[w]here a state is in effective control of its territory, has military, police and civil authority in place, and makes serious efforts to protect its citizens from terrorist activities, the mere fact that it is not always successful at doing so will not be enough to justify a claim that the victims of terrorism are unable to avail themselves of such protection.\n[28] Accordingly, in these three instances involving the claimant, and the latter one referencing a break-in at the family home since he has been in Canada the panel is not persuaded that the police's failure to set up a trace on the claimant's phone in 2007, or to find the people who allegedly assaulted the claimant in XXXX 2010, or to be unable to identify the thieves through their fingerprints following the break-in at the family home in 2016, constitute persuasive examples of the state's failure to protect the claimant. Given that the panel finds the claimant has failed to establish a profile that caused him to be targeted, the panel finds that the claimant has failed to rebut the presumption that state protection was unavailable to him, or that this case is somehow distinguishable from the precedential value of the Villafranca decision.\n[29] After coming to Canada, the claimant alleged that his family continued to receive threats, but there was no evidence proffered as to what steps they took to seek protection if at all. Exhibit C-7 shows that all of the claimant's children have either graduated from school or are in the upper grades.6 They have not been targeted for any abuse and they have been able to complete their education without incident at school. Today, the claimant's wife and children live in Lahore without incident. All the children have completed school and\/or are maximizing their educational opportunities without fear. Ten years ago, the claimant said he had to keep the children home from school and move them to another school after some threatening phone calls were made. With the passage of time, however, and the panel's finding that the 2015 break-in at the house is appropriately characterized as a random event, the panel finds that the claimant's family is not experiencing any problems because of the claimant past ownership of an XXXX XXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX business.\n[30] Finally, as with the other documents as referenced, the panel finds the various statements of his wife, mother and brother-in-law to be self-serving materials that were presented to base a claim of persecution for a Convention reason and to bolster the claim generally.\nDETERMINATION\n[31] The panel finds that the claimant has not established that there is a reasonable possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, or that, on a balance of probabilities, he would personally be subjected to a danger of torture, or face a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he were to return to Pakistan. The claim is rejected.\nCONCLUSION\n[32] The panel considered the totality of the evidence cumulatively and it finds that the claimant was not credible regarding his experiences for the reasons stated. Alternatively, while none of the credibility concerns raised in this decision, in respect of the alleged incidents, may be sufficient on their own to negate the claim, the cumulative effect of all of them is that the panel did not have sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence upon which to base a determination that this claimant is a Convention refugee, or a person in need of protection. The panel accordingly rejects this claim for refugee protection.\n(signed)\n\"Reid Rossi\"\nReid Rossi\nOctober 30, 2017\nDate\n1 Exhibit C-2, Personal Information Form.\n2 Exhibit C-8\n3 Exhibit C-3, \"Latent Finger Print Process\", 27 January 2017\n4 Exhibit R-3, National Documentation Package (NDP) for Pakistan (31 March 2017), Item 10.1.\n5 Villafranca: M.E.I. v.

Their allegations are set out in a single narrative, written from the perspective of the principal claimant. The narrative is attached to each of their Personal Information Forms (\"PIFs\").3\n[4] The female claimant, on behalf of herself and the other claimants, allege discrimination in society, education, employment, health care, and housing. They also fear the rise of far right Jobbik political party and potential attacks by Hungarian guards and skinheads.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] I find that the claimants are not Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, nor are they persons in need of protection pursuant to section 97(1) of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\n[6] The determinative issues in this case were whether claimants' testimony was credible, whether the treatment they suffered amounted to persecution, and whether they successfully rebutted the presumption of state protection.\nIdentity\n[7] The claimants' identities as nationals of Hungary are established by their passports.4 The identity of the claimants as persons of Roma ethnicity was established on the basis of their testimony. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants are of Roma ethnicity and they are the persons they claim to be.\nXXXX XXXX\nIncident XXXX XXXX, 2011\n[8] In his testimony, the male claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, stated that on XXXX XXXX, 2011, he and members of his family were attacked by a group of Guardist. They verbally and physically assaulted him and he suffered bruises and a spinal injury as a result of the physical assault. In fact, the male claimant testified that, when he was assaulted and the police were called, they were the first to arrive and it was the police that called for an ambulance to transport him to the hospital. The male claimant went on to testify that a special ambulance responded due to his back injury. He continued to testify that a police officer rode in the ambulance with him and was taking copious notes. Upon their arrival at the hospital, the police officer tried to take a statement before he was taken to surgery. The police officer then turned his attention to the principal claimant for a statement, but she was unable to provide details of the assault as they related to the description of the suspects, thus giving the police little to no information regarding the assault.\n[9] The male claimant then proceeded to testify that, the impression he got from the police officer who had accompanied him to the hospital and was taking the report, was he seemed like he was happy that the incident had taken place and the male claimant injured. When asked why he thought that, the male claimant was unable to provide a response. No complaint was made about the police officer by the male claimant, nor any member of his family. No follow up was made with the police.\n[10] The panel asked him if he had been able to provide to the police a description of the assailants and he stated that he was not able to provide a description. The principal claimant, when asked, also indicated that she did not provide that information to the police. In fact, she provided very little information to the police. The panel asked if he followed up at the police station, the male claimant stated that, \"they didn't' deal with me as they should with an injured person.\" When asked to explain, he merely stated, \"they were happy it happened to a Roma person.\"\n[11] The panel finds that the authorities did provide protection to the male claimant. The police responded to the call, did attend at the scene, accompanied him to the hospital, and took a statement from the male claimant. The reason as to the lack of investigation was because the male claimant could not identify the assailants. There is no evidence before the panel to indicate that claimants were denied protection because of his Roma ethnicity.\nIncident XXXX XXXX, 2011\n[12] In another incident, this of XXXX XXXX, 2011, the male claimant testified that this date represents a national holiday, and that people were marching in the street to celebrate the holiday which takes place on an annual basis. They heard some people shouting, \"gypsies you are going to die\", \"stinking gypsies you are to die like the Jews\", and throwing things at the house. They called the police, but the male claimant testified that the police did not attend because there was no death involved. When asked by the panel if the police did attend, the male claimant conceded that the police did attend their residence after he called them. No evidence was provided as to whether the claimants followed up with the police in regards to their complaint.\n[13] In light of the above resources and mechanism for redress, including the court system, I find the claimants failure to test state protection to be unreasonable and short of the clear and convincing evidence they are required to provide. However, on the two occasions that they did call the police, the panel finds, based on the evidence provided by the male claimant, the police did respond and carry out investigations based upon the information provided by the claimants. It is abundantly clear that on the two occasions that the claimants requested protection, the police provided same as per the male claimant's testimony.\nAlleged discrimination in healthcare not credible\n[14] In accepting the male claimant's testimony, the panel finds that the male claimant was not denied adequate healthcare due to his Roma ethnicity. There was no evidence presented that the principal claimant, as well as the minor claimant, had any issues involving denial of healthcare. The male claimant's testimony regarding healthcare was credible, as he did not appear to embellish and gave his viva voce testimony in a straightforward manner. The male claimant gave evidence that he had no issues or complaints regarding the medical treatment he received from the alleged assault in XXXX, 2011.\n[15] Accordingly, I find that the claimants have failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that they suffered discrimination in healthcare.\nTreatment did not otherwise amount to persecution\n[16] For treatment to amount to persecution, it must be \"sustained or systemic violation of basic human rights demonstrative of a failure of state protection\".5 The claimants' remaining complaints relate to discrimination in housing, education and employment.\n[17] I am also prepared to accept that the claimants may have suffered some mistreatment by society, such as name calling and such further incidents they allege, including the physical assault described by the male claimant. However, I am not prepared to find that this treatment on its own amounted to persecution in light of the isolated nature of these events and the claimants' failure to seek state protection in response to this treatment.\n[18] Ultimately, refugee protection is granted on a forward looking analysis in light of the adequacy of state protection. As set out further below, I find that the claimants have failed to rebut the presumption of adequate state protection in Hungary.\nPresumption of State Protection not rebutted in the alternative\n[19] The panel, in assessing the issue of state protection, is guided by the jurisprudence from the Supreme Court of Canada, the Federal Court of Appeal and the Federal Court. The courts have established a number of principles relating to state protection and the panel will apply those principles to the appeal at hand.\n[20] The presumption of state protection was articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in the Ward decision where the Court stated:\nThe issue that arises, then, is how, in a practical sense, a claimant makes proof of a state's inability to protect its nationals as well as the reasonable nature of the claimant's refusal actually to seek out this protection. On the facts of this case, proof on this point was unnecessary, as representatives of the state authorities conceded their inability to protect Ward. Where such an admission is not available, however, clear and convincing confirmation of a state's inability to protect must be provided. For example, a claimant might advance testimony of similarly situated individuals let down by the state protection arrangement or the claimant's testimony of past personal incidents in which state protection did not materialize. Absent some evidence, the claim should fail, as nations should be presumed capable of protecting their citizens. Security of nationals is, after all, the essence of sovereignty. Absent a situation of complete breakdown of state apparatus, such as that recognized in Lebanon in Zalzali, it should be assumed that the state is capable of protecting a claimant.6\n[21] Ward7 has established that the onus is on the claimants to produce clear and convincing evidence that the state cannot provide protection.\n[22] There is a presumption that, except in situations where the state is in complete breakdown, the state is capable of protecting its citizens. The presumption that a state is capable of protecting its citizens underscores the principle that international protection comes into play only when a refugee claimant has no other recourse available. Having canvassed the country conditions documents,8 the panel finds that Hungary is a democracy in effective control of its territory and has in place a functioning security force to uphold the laws and constitution of the country.\n[23] Refugee protection is meant to be a form of surrogate protection to be invoked in those situations where the refugee claimant has unsuccessfully sought the protection of their home state. The onus is on the complainants to approach the state for protection in situations where state protection might be reasonably forthcoming.9 To qualify for refugee status, a claimant must satisfy the Immigration and Refugee Board (Board) that he or she sought, but was unable to obtain, protection from their home state, or alternatively, that their home state, on an objective basis, could not be expected to provide protection.10 In the absence of a compelling explanation, a failure to pursue state protection opportunities within the home state will usually be fatal to a refugee claim, at least where the state is a functioning democracy with a willingness and the apparatus necessary to provide a measure of protection to its citizens.11\n[24] To rebut the presumption of state protection, the claimants must provide \"clear and convincing\" confirmation of the state's inability to protect its citizens.12 A claimant who alleges that state protection is inadequate must persuade the panel that the evidence establishes that state protection is in fact, inadequate. The evidence that state protection is inadequate must not only be reliable and probative, it must also satisfy the panel, on a balance of probabilities, that state protection is inadequate.13 Where a state is in effective control of its territory, has military, police and civil authority in place and makes serious efforts to protect its citizens, the mere fact that the state's efforts are not always successful will not rebut the presumption of state protection.14 A claimant cannot rebut the presumption of state protection in a functioning democracy by asserting only a subjective reluctance to engage the state.15 Doubting the effectiveness of the protection offered by the state when one has not really tested it does not rebut the existence of a presumption of state protection.16\n[25] A claimant's burden of proof is directly proportional to the level of democracy in the state in question: the more democratic the state's institutions, the more the claimant must have done to exhaust all courses of action open to them.17 In a functioning democracy, a claimant will have a heavy burden when attempting to show that he should not have been required to exhaust all of the recourses available to him domestically before claiming refugee status.18 The documentary evidence19 before the panel indicates that Hungary is a democracy, and there are free and fair elections. Therefore, in countries such as Hungary, the claimant must do more than merely show that he went to see members of the police force and that those efforts were unsuccessful. A claimant must show that he has taken all reasonable steps in the circumstances to seek protection, taking into account the context of the country of origin, the steps taken and the claimant's interactions with the authorities.20 Local failures by authorities to provide protection do not mean that the state as a whole fails to protect its citizens, unless the failures form part of a broader pattern of the state's inability or refusal to provide protection.21 No government is expected to guarantee perfect protection to all of its citizens at all times, and the fact that a state is not always successful in protecting its citizens, is not enough to justify a claim, especially where a state is in effective control of its territory, has military, police and civil authorities in place and is making serious efforts to protect its citizens.22 Less than perfect protection is not a basis to determine that a state is either unwilling or unable to offer reasonable protection.23\n[26] Although this is the general state of affairs with respect to the law in Canada concerning state protection, recent decisions by the Federal Court have questioned whether state protection is available to members of the Roma community if they were to return to Hungary, and have thrown some uncertainty as to the manner in which this Board is to conduct a state protection analysis with respect to Roma citizens of Hungary. The Federal Court is divided as to how best this analysis should take place. The Court itself acknowledged this diverse opinion in the Mudrak decision where the Court stated: \"It is well recognized that there is a division in the ranks of judges of the Federal Court on the issue of state protection, particularly as it applies to claimants from the Hungarian Roma community.\"24 The court went on to highlight this division by quoting decisions from the Federal Court which provided divergent opinions on state protection for members of the Roma community. There are two decisions which best illustrate the divided legal mind set of the Federal Court on this issue.\n[27] The first decision is that of Moczo.25 In that particular claim, the applicants are an extended family from Hungary. In 2010, they sought refugee protection in Canada based on their experiences of discrimination and persecution as members of the Roma community. In particular, they allege that their home was attacked by a group that pushed a concrete wall onto its roof. Later, someone threw bricks at the house.26\n[28] In allowing the appeal, the Court did not agree with the Board's conclusion that the applicants had not made reasonable efforts to seek state protection. The Court stated:\nThe Board failed to take account of evidence showing that two of the applicants had approached the police on separate occasions to complain about bricks being thrown at their house. The police did not make a report; they simply said there was nothing they could do.27\n[29] The Court also concluded that state protection was unavailable to the applicants:\n...the Board concentrated on evidence relating to improvements not yet realized to the exclusion of the documentary evidence showing that Hungarian police often discriminate against and fail to investigate crimes of violence against the Roma.28\n[30] An opposing legal view, however, was provided by the Federal Court in the Csaba Racz decision.29 In that the particular claim, the applicants:\n...were at home when stones were thrown through their windows. Denes Csaba Racz, the father in the applicant family, ran out of the house to see what had happened but he was immediately kicked in his stomach and assaulted. By the time Timea Raczne Marodi, the mother in the applicant family, went outside, her husband was on the ground and his attackers were fleeing in a car. They were shouting that \"this is not over\" and that the applicants would die. Mr. Racz called the police. When they arrived, he showed them the broken windows and where he was kicked and punched. The police asked if he saw the perpetrators, and Mr. Racz replied that he did not because he was kicked very suddenly. Ms. Marodi did not get the license plate. The police said that there was not much they could do, but that they would patrol the area more often. They left without taking a report. They patrolled one more time that night but no additional patrols were made. The applicants also asked the Mayor of their village to help them but he said the police would take care of things.30\n[31] In dismissing the appeal, the Federal Court stated:\nI agree with the submission of the respondent that the Board's examination must focus on whether these persons, on clear and convincing evidence, have established that there is not adequate state protection at the operational level. I am unable to find, based on their submissions in this application, that the Board's decision that they did not establish the inadequacy of state protection is unreasonable. In fact, although not perfect, the response of the police to the applicants' complaints, given the specific circumstances of the assaults taken to the police, appears to have been adequate and in keeping with what Canadian police forces would be likely to do.31\n[32] Although the Court in Mudrak32 certified two questions, the Federal Court of Appeal has yet to render a decision on the certified questions.\n[33] Given then this divergent view with respect to \"clear and convincing\" evidence, the panel must attempt to come to some form of conclusion with respect to state protection for Romas in Hungary. The question of what is clear and convincing evidence was addressed by the Federal Court in the Sztojka decision.33 In relying on the Flores Carrillo decision of the Federal Court of Appeal,34 the court stated:\nAn applicant bears both an evidentiary and legal burden; she must introduce evidence of inadequate state protection and must convince the trier of fact that the evidence adduced establishes that the state protection is inadequate. The evidence will have sufficient probative value if it convinces the trier of fact on the balance of probabilities that the state protection is inadequate. Therefore the evidence must be relevant, reliable and convincing.35\n[34] In applying the legal principle of clear and convincing evidence, the panel is guided by other legal standards. The first principle is that protection provided by the state is not perfect.36 This applies not just to the country in question in this claim, Hungary, but to any other country. In the Racz37 decision quoted above, the court made a reference as to what Canadian police forces would do under similar situations. I would like to take this analogy a step further. Does the fact that members of the Canadian police unjustly Taser individuals demonstrate a lack of state protection in Canada? Or the fact that an individual armed with a knife is shot nine times by members of a Canadian police force indicative of a lack of state protection in Canada? What these Canadian incidents underlie is the fact that state protection, in any country, is not perfect.\n[35] The second legal principle which aids the panel in determining whether clear and convincing evidence of a lack of state protection has been presented, is that the police are primarily responsible for state protection against violent attacks.38 The failure of one police officer or one police department to investigate a crime does not, by itself, determine that there is no state protection. Just because the police did not apprehend the assailants in a particular incident, or that the claimants' complaint was not pursued with the diligence that the claimants would have preferred, does not mean that state protection in their home country is not adequate. There may be many factors that could contribute to this, including lack of physical evidence, lack of suspects, higher priorities for the police, and lack of witnesses. It is open to the panel to determine if the state was unable to protect them, not in the absolute sense, but rather to a degree that was reasonable having regard to the circumstances of the claimants.39 As the Federal Court has stated on numerous occasions, failures by local police to provide protection is not indicative of the fact that there is no protection in the country as a whole.40\n[36] Given the particular issues of credibility as discussed above, and having canvassed the documentation from the Board and the claimants, the panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants have not rebutted the presumption of state protection.\n[37] Counsel, in her submissions, submits that there is a general climate of insecurity for Roma due to persecution by the state itself. Therefore, the claimant is discharged from personally having to request protection. I disagree with counsel's submissions. There is insufficient evidence to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants would risk their lives seeking inadequate protection, merely to demonstrate that inadequacy.41 The objective evidence indicates that while discrimination against Roma, even by some parts of the state exists in Hungary, there are state institutions that offer adequate protection to Roma who complain.\n[38] The panel would be remiss if it did not acknowledge and consider that there is information in the documentation, both the Board's own documentation and the documentation submitted by the claimants, to indicate that there is widespread reporting of incidents of intolerance, discrimination and persecution of Romani individuals in Hungary.\n[39] Violent attacks against Roma continued, generating strong public concern and intense disputes as to the existence and scale of racially motivated crimes. Human rights NGOs complained that law enforcement authorities, prosecutors, and courts were reluctant to recognize racial motivation for many crimes.42\n[40] According to multiple sources, the Hungarian Guard and other far-right organizations held demonstrations across the country with the goal of inciting 'prejudice' against the Roma. The groups organized the demonstrations under the guise of protecting Hungary against what they termed the 'Gypsy Terror' or 'Gypsy criminality'.\n[41] A fair reading of the documentary evidence indicates that the central government is motivated and willing to implement measures to protect the Roma, but these measures are not always implemented effectively at the local or municipal level.\n[42] The panel recognizes that there are some inconsistencies among several sources within the documentary evidence; however, the objective evidence regarding current country conditions suggests that, although not perfect, there is adequate state protection in Hungary for Roma who are victims of crime, police abuse, discrimination or persecution, that Hungary is making serious efforts to address these problems, and that the police and government officials are both willing and able to protect victims.\n[43] The evidence indicates that police do still commit abuses against people, including the Roma, but there is also evidence that indicates it is reasonable to expect authorities to take action in these cases, and that the police are capable of protecting Roma.\n[44] There is also recourse to the Equal Treatment Authority. Since 2005, it has provided individuals with a direct avenue of redress for violations of the prohibition of discrimination in a variety of public and private law relationships. In the first year, there were nearly 500 complaints lodged and the number has risen steadily ever since. There are also other remedies such as seeking compensation through the courts, or turning to one of the Parliamentary Commissioners where public authorities are concerned. There is also the Roma Police Officers' Association in Hungary, and Roma are able to file a complaint to the association. The complaints mostly concern discrimination in employment, discriminatory treatment and discrimination by law enforcement authorities or police officers.43\n[45] There are government institutions in place that enforce human rights legislation in response to violations caused by public as well as private actors. The most important of those is the Equal Treatment Authority (\"ETA\"), which is an independent administrative body that protects, enforces, and promotes equality and the right to equal treatment with respect to direct\/indirect discrimination, segregation, harassment, and victimization.44 The ETA has the power to issue legally binding and enforceable decisions as well as non-binding opinions.45\n[46] There is evidence that the ETA solicits a large number of complaints and acts on them. In 2010, the ETA received 1,300 complaints and started investigations into 377 of them. Discrimination was determined to have taken place in 40 cases. Most of the cases were complaints of employment-related discrimination, but there were also instances of racism in the public service.46\n[47] The ETA has used its powers to protect the human rights of Roma in response to discriminatory state action in housing. On July 15, 2015, the ETA established that the Municipality of Miskolc subjected residents of a segregated area to the threat of homelessness or having to move to other segregated areas and, by doing so, discriminated against them because of their social status, financial situation, and Romani origin. The ETA fined the municipality 500,000 forint ($1,800) and ordered it to cease discrimination.47 I find that the actions of the ETA establish, on a balance of probabilities, that it is willing and able to provide adequate state protection to Roma.\n[48] The independent court system is also available to correct discriminatory conduct against Roma in housing. In the wake of the City of Miskolc's attempts to mass evict Roma, nine nearby municipalities enacted ordinances to exclude evacuees (widely expected to be former Miskolc Roma) from access to social services.48 On October 28, 2015, the Curia (Hungarian court) annulled the Szerencs municipality decree on the grounds of discrimination, and the other eight municipalities withdrew their similar decrees by the end of the year.49 I find that the actions of the Curia and the responses by the affected municipalities establish, on a balance of probabilities, that when sought, state protection against discrimination in housing, will be forthcoming and adequate.\n[49] I note that, unlike the other nine cities, Miskolc has responded by seeking review of adverse judicial and ETA decisions against it and resorting to other discriminatory conduct.50 While such conduct is distasteful, on the whole it constitutes a local failure of state protection, as opposed to a widespread national climate of insecurity and inadequate protection as suggested by counsel. The Board documentation on the issue of housing evictions in Miskolc indicates that it is highly localized to the \"Numbered Streets\".51 I find based on this information that the claimants can avail themselves of adequate state protection to remedy any future discrimination in housing if it becomes an issue, although there was no evidence during the hearing that the claimants had any issue with housing.\n[50] There is evidence that the Hungarian justice system will enforce the human rights of Roma when faced by inappropriate police actions. On September 17, 2015, the Tribunal of Eger ruled in a case initiated by the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union that the police discriminated against Romani residents in Gyongyospata during a march by the \"For Better Future\" far-right neighborhood watch group and other extremist groups in 2011. The court found that police failed to protect the Romani residents threatened by the extremist groups and later imposed excessive fines on local Roma for minor misdemeanors.52 I find that such court decisions indicate that the Hungarian state, while not perfect, will enforce the law when Roma human rights are violated.\n[51] In the education sphere, the government implemented the following programs:\n... provided scholarships for socially disadvantaged students, including 5,668 elementary and secondary school children and 858 vocational school students who declared themselves to be Roma. It also provided scholarships for socially disadvantaged higher education students, including 132 Roma. There were 178 \"Tanoda\" afterschool centers around the country providing tutoring and extracurricular activities for disadvantaged, mostly Romani children. During the year the Tanoda network assisted approximately 5,000 disadvantaged students. There were eight Romani special colleges across the country sponsored by the government using EU funds, five of which were operated by Christian denominations and three managed by universities. The special colleges provided housing and tutoring for approximately 235 Romani students enrolled in higher educational institutions.53\n[52] In my view, these programs constitute operational action to improve the position of Roma in society. Educational scholarships and student housing for Roma, in my view, constitute adequate operational measures to counter private and public discrimination suffered by the claimants in education, healthcare and housing.\n[53] I find that the implementation of these programs establishes, on a balance of probabilities, that effective state protection exists and is forthcoming in response to discrimination cumulatively amounting to persecution and consequent poverty and marginalization suffered by Roma.\n[54] Implementation of these programs also shows that the extreme racist rhetoric of Jobbik and other politicians, which has been percolating for several years, has not resulted in an abandonment of the Roma minority by the Hungarian state.\n[55] Hungary has a number of state institutions to address abuses, including breaches of human rights such as the ETA which was canvassed earlier in these reasons. I find that the principal claimant could have turned to that institution for assistance and that the ETA would have provided her with adequate protection and consideration of her complaints on their merits regarding the alleged mistreatment she got during the hospital visits.\n[56] In Hungary, Roma, like the other 12 official minorities, are entitled to elect their own minority self-governments (MSGs), which organize minority activities and handle cultural and educational affairs. The president of each MSG also has the right to attend and speak at local government assemblies.54\n[57] If the claimants face discrimination, they have recourse to all of these programs for assistance should they need it. The Hungarian government has taken a number of legal and institutional measures to improve the situation of the Romani minority. According to the Open Society Institute, Hungary has one of the most advanced systems for minority protection in the region. The Hungarian Government lists a number of institutions within the state apparatus, including the Roma Integration Department within the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, the main government body responsible for Romani integration, and the Council of Roma Integration, a consultative, advisory body which coordinates measures between various ministries on the social inclusion of Roma. The documentary evidence indicates that segregation of Roma students has increased in the past decade, but at the same time, the government of Hungary has introduced numerous measures to integrate Roma students into mainstream education. However, relating to these efforts, \"the Minorities Ombudsman indicates that there is not enough monitoring of the programs and the municipalities resist against the investigations by the Ombudsman and courts, which are trying to stop school segregation.\"55 In light of this criticism, the documentary evidence indicates the following:\nA substantial reform of education, which included renewal of pedagogical methods, revision of legislation on education concerning multiple disadvantages and financial incentives, began in 2003. According to the Minorities Ombudsman, through the Roma Integration Policy, the Hungarian government provides financial support for schools that have special programs for integration of disadvantaged students, including Roma, non-native, and disabled children. A report of the working group on the UN Universal Periodic Review states that in order to fight segregation and decrease school dropout rates, Hungary implemented several programmes in 1,800 education institutions; the budget assigned for this purpose was about US $40 million. Similarly, the Hungarian government indicates that by 2010, those programs \"covered almost 300,000 pupils and reached approximately 13,000 teachers in 1,800 schools.\" Hungary's Social Renewal Operation Programme (SROP) 2007-2013, co-financed by the European Union, includes the Promotion of Implementation of Equal Opportunities Programmes that are designed to improve the situation of children with multiple disadvantages. For example, SROP co-ordinates and supports programs related to the development of methodological documents, teacher training courses, and extracurricular activities that encourage opportunities of informal learning. The Open Society Foundations (OSF), an international organization that works to build democracies with accountable governments and implements initiatives at the local level in its study on Roma integration strategies, points out that the SROP project is a positive policy example.56\n[58] Regarding the government's efforts to specifically address issues faced by the Roma population, the documentary evidence demonstrates:\nMost ministries and county labour affairs centers had special officers for Romani affairs focused on the needs of the Romani community. The Ministry of National Resources continued to offer financial incentives to encourage schools to integrate Romani and non-Romani children in the same classrooms and to reintegrate Roma inappropriately placed in remedial programs. The Ministry also operated a program to finance infrastructure development in Romani communities. The prime minister named Zoltan Balog as state secretary for social inclusion, charged with coordinating government efforts to address Roma issues.57\n[59] The Ministry of Public Administration and Justice (formerly the Ministry of Justice and Law Enforcement) operated an anti-discrimination legal service network that provided free legal aid to Roma in cases where they encountered ethnic discrimination. Human rights NGOs lamented that the lawyers' offices were located in the larger cities, rendering them inaccessible to those Roma living in deep poverty in small villages. HCLU received reports that the network's lawyers rejected some Romani cases.\n[60] Since January 2009, in order to apply for EU and government funds for urban rehabilitation and public education projects, every city must attach to its proposal, a desegregation plan outlining planned actions to eradicate segregation in housing and public education. The government opened 200 positions in public administration for Romani college graduates. By year's end, 165 applicants had passed the mandatory civil servant entry exam and 66 were placed in various national and county government offices.58\n[61] Having canvassed the material from both the Board and the claimants, in this particular situation, there is no evidence before the panel to demonstrate that the Hungarian authorities took active steps to prevent the claimants from obtaining employment in their respective professions.59\n[62] As the Federal Court has stated in Blalzs, \"...it is recognized that people of Roma ethnicity are the subject of discriminatory acts and, in some cases, that discrimination is considered persecution...\"60 However, the very fact that discrimination does exist in Hungary does not, de facto, translate into a lack of state protection. I am sure that members of Canada's First Nations would also readily cite attitudes of discrimination against them here in our own country of Canada, and that may well be true. However, this does not mean that Canada does not provide protection for members of its First Nations; and so it is with Hungary. The fact that Romas are discriminated against in Hungary does not mean that there is never any state protection for them or that they are not required to seek that protection prior to seeking refuge in another country.\n[63] There is no boiler template for determining whether the claimants of Roma ethnicity have rebutted the presumption of state protection. Each case must be determined on its individual facts and circumstances. Having considered the evidence and having canvassed all of the documentation in this claim, I wish to rely on the recent decision of the Federal Court in Kotai:\nThe country conditions do not suggest that the situation is so bleak that all Roma, regardless of their particular circumstances, should not be expected to make reasonable efforts to seek state protection before seeking refugee protection in another country.61\n[64] The burden is on the claimant to provide clear and convincing evidence that the state is either unwilling or unable to provide him with adequate protection. The panel is not obliged to provide proof that the state can offer its citizens effective protection, rather the claimant bears the legal burden of rebutting the presumption that state protection exists by adducing clear and convincing evidence which satisfies the panel, on a balance of probabilities.62\n[65] The panel finds that the issue before it was whether adequate state protection is, and would be, available to the claimants in their home country of Hungary should they return. While states are presumed to be capable of protecting their nationals, it is open, according to the law, for the claimants to rebut the presumption of protection with clear and convincing evidence that adequate protection would not reasonably be forthcoming. The panel finds, on the evidence, that the claimants have not rebutted that presumption and, as the issue of state protection is equally applicable to claims based on sections 96 and 97.\nCONCLUSION\n[66] Having considered all of the evidence and based on the above analysis, the panel finds the claimants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.\n[67] Accordingly, I find that the claimants would not face a serious possibility of persecution in Hungary or, on a balance of probabilities, that they would be subjected personally to a risk to their life, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture.\n(signed)\n\"Luis F.

They can be summarized as follows.\n[3] The claimant fears her father, some Islamic fanatics and the police. Her brother is a bisexual and because of the attitude of Nigerians, her support for her brother and her decision to become a Christian make her a target.\n[4] The claimant's parents are devout Muslims, and her father XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of their local mosque in Ibadan, Nigeria. Although the claimant was forced to attend several Islamic classes and teachings, most of which she disliked, she attended a Christian primary school and fell in love with the Christian religion. However, she kept this to herself until she moved to secondary school, which was a boarding hostel. The claimant recalls the Arabic teacher informing her father of her change of religion and absence from Arabic classes, which resulted in several punishments. Accordingly, the claimant remained a Muslim until she went to University.\n[5] On one of her trips home, her father had learned through a cousin that she was now attending church services. He punished her by locking her up for two days without food. Afraid of the consequences, the claimant stopped going to church services at that time.\n[6] The claimant was unaware that her brother, XXXX was a bisexual until he reached 19 years of age. However, when she discovered it, he promised to date a girl, and it wasn't until August 2006, when she learned that XXXX was involved with another man called XXXX. XXXX was picked up by the police, illegally detained and beaten up when his relationship with XXXX was discovered. Since XXXX was in Canada at the time, he made a refugee claim, which was successful.\n[7] In 2011, the claimant's mother visited XXXX in Canada and attempted to convince him that he should change. She was unsuccessful and furthermore, the claimant's father learned that his mother had also become a Christian and then his father began to threaten his mother. She went to the police but they indicated that it was a family matter. The claimant's mother attained refugee status in Canada in 2012.1\n[8] On XXXX XXXX, 2012, the claimant's father called her with anger asking if she had been supporting both her brother and mother with affidavits, and he asked for their phone numbers and addresses, which the claimant refused to give to him. The claimant's father then allegedly told his Imam and others in the mosque, including a member who is a police officer.\n[9] On XXXX XXXX, 2012, the claimant travelled to the US for her cousin's wedding, hoping that this issue would be resolved and forgotten, however, instead she received a visit from the mosque member, who is a police officer on XXXX XXXX. He threatened to beat her up and illegally detain her.\n[10] With the assistance of a friend, XXXX, she was introduced to an agent who assisted her in coming to Canada on July 22, 2012, when she made a refugee claim.\nDETERMINATION\n[11] The RPD finds that the claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, and that, on a balance of probabilities, she would not personally be subjected to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture upon return to Nigeria.\nIdentity\n[12] On a balance of probabilities, the panel finds that the claimant has established her Nigerian citizenship based on a copy of her driver's license and birth certificate.\nCredibility\n[13] In considering credibility, the RPD is aware of the difficulties that may be faced by the claimant in establishing her claim, namely, the setting of the hearing room, and the stress inherent in responding to questions. In deciding the claim, the panel has considered and taken into account the Chairperson's Guidelines on Women Refugee, Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.2 It has examined the risk to the claimant at the hands of her father some five years after her departure from Nigeria. In addition, the panel has considered Guideline 9, which applies to claimants whose fears are based on their sexual orientation.3 Although this claim is not based on the claimant's sexual orientation, it is the perception by her father and allegedly by her community, that by association with her brother, she is a lesbian, which she denies. The RPD accepts that this perception is consistent with homophobic society in Nigeria.\nDETERMINATIVE ISSUES\n[14] The determinative issues are credibility, delay in departure and internal flight alternative (IFA).\nDelay in departure\n[15] The claimant visited the US in XXXX 2012. She was asked by the RPD why she had not either remained in the US or come to Canada given her alleged problems in Nigeria prior to this. She responded that although her father was displeased with her, he had not at that point threatened her and she believed that her circumstances might improve.\n[16] This led the RPD to question the claimant's intentions upon her arrival in Canada. Her exit from Nigeria until her arrival in Canada had been facilitated by the use of a smuggler. She did not claim refugee status at the airport, but two days later, she made an inland claim. According to the claimant's oral testimony, she came to Canada to seek safety, but had no idea of how she would regularize her status, but believed that since her mother and brother had attained status, they would assist her.\n[17] Although not determinative, the RPD finds that the claimant's delay in departure and her lack of knowledge of how to regularize her status in Canada, undermine her credibility. Firstly, although she had not been threatened prior to her visit to the US, her PIF describes incidents, which the RPD finds are alleged as almost persecutory, if not so. For example, she described being locked up by her father for two days without food. Moreover, with respect to the claimant's lack of knowledge of the refugee process, the RPD finds that given the claimant's level of education, coupled with the fact that both her brother and her mother had attained refugee status, flies in the face of the claimant's alleged innocence in this regard. Although as stated above, these findings are not determinative, the RPD concludes that this portion of the claimant's testimony is not credible.\n[18] The RPD does accept that Nigeria is a homophobic society, and family members do perceive others in the family to be part of the LGBT community, if one family member is found to be a part of this community. In this case, the claimant's brother is bi-sexual and this became widely known. The RPD also accepts that as XXXX XXXX XXXX of a mosque in Ibadan, the claimant's father would be displeased that the claimant wanted to convert to Christianity. Having said this, the RPD examined the issue of religious freedom, along with the viability of an internal flight alternative to Port Harcourt.\nThe objective evidence with respect to religion\n[19] The law in Nigeria provides for freedom of religion and while the federal government generally respected religious freedom, there were instances in which limits were placed on religious activity to address security and public safety concerns.\n[20] The law prohibits state and local government from adopting an official religion. In general, however, states whether dominated by Christians or Muslims, favoured the faith practiced by the majority of the residents.4\n[21] The Constitution provides for the freedom to change one's religion or belief, and freedom to manifest and propagate one's religion or belief in worship, teaching, practice, and observance. In nearly all states, ethnic rivalries between \"indigene\" groups and \"settlers\" led to some societal discrimination against minority ethnic and religious groups. Counsel submits that item 13.1 of the National Documentation Package (NDP) highlights the discrepancies in this regard. This will be discussed with respect to the issue of an internal flight alternative.\n[22] Approximately half of the country's population practices Islam. More than 40 per cent practice Christianity. Many persons combine elements of Christianity and Islam with elements of a traditional indigenous religion.\n[23] Counsel for the claimant filed documentary evidence to support the claimant's allegations that there is more than a mere possibility that the claimant would be personally targeted and persecuted or at risk to his life should she return to Nigeria because of her non-indigenes ethnicity5 as well as articles with respect to persecution of Christians.6\nInternal flight alternative\n[24] The issue of an IFA is a question of mixed law and fact that involves the correct interpretation and application of a legal test to the facts of the case. The question of whether an IFA exists is an integral part of the refugee definition. If the claimant can find safety from persecution by fleeing within Nigeria, then he or she is not entitled to Canada's surrogate protection. The IFA analysis is based on the premise that the subjective fear of the refugee claimant is not objectively well founded if a viable IFA exists.\n[25] The Federal Court, in Kamburona, has clearly stated that: 7\n...the IFA is determined by the Board and, thereafter, it is incumbent upon the applicant to establish, on the balance of probabilities, that there is a serious possibility that he or she will be persecuted in the location proposed as an IFA.\n[26] The burden thus falls upon the claimant to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that there is a serious possibility that she would be persecuted in Port Harcourt.\n[27] The Court also stated the two tier test for an IFA:8\nIt is correct that the following two-part disjunctive test for determining whether there is not an IFA is well-settled and continues to be applied:\n(1) The Board must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the proposed IFA; or,\n(2) Conditions in the proposed IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable, upon consideration of all the circumstances, including consideration of a claimant's personal circumstances, for the claimant to seek refuge there.\n[28] The documentary evidence9 shows that there are no restrictions on internal movement within Nigeria.\n[29] The claimant testified that Port Harcourt is a long distance from Ibadan where her father resides. She was uncertain as to the mileage, but said it was a \"whole night's travel\" to get there. When asked why her father would pursue her in Port Harcourt, the claimant responded \"because I, my mother and brother have tarnished his image.\" She further testified that he knows her brother is in Canada, and believes he is aware of the mother's whereabouts, but she is unsure if he knows of her whereabouts.\n[30] When asked how her father would locate her in Port Harcourt, the claimant responded \"I am not sure.\" However, she then stated that Benin City is also far from Ibadan, and she was located there. She further clarified this statement: she was hiding with a friend, and while she was away from the house, purportedly a police officer came by asking of her whereabouts. The claimant testified that she believes that her father has connections, but when questioned further in this regard, she was unable to explain these connections or provide any corroborative evidence in this regard, other than to say \"I just believe he must have.\"\n[31] The RPD questioned the claimant with respect to the fact that the foregoing information surrounding the police in Benin City is not contained in her PIF. Her response that she would have the opportunity to speak to this issue at her hearing is categorically rejected by the RPD. The RPD finds that this is a material aspect of this claim, i.e. that her father would pursue her and that he has connections to do so. Moreover, the claimant then went on to say that the police had been to this same friend's house following her departure from Nigeria.\n[32] Counsel submits that the addendum to the PIF which was submitted during the hearing but admitted by the RPD,10 indicates the pursuit at the home of a friend. With due respect, the addendum states the following:\nI received letters in year 2012 and 2013 from friends that I sought refuge at their place through my brother that I was still being looked for by police officers and unknown people.\n[33] Counsel submits that the letters from the claimant's friend attest to the foregoing, and therefore, it was not necessary to include this information in the PIF. With due respect, even if the RPD accepts this, and it does not, this does not respond to the fact that allegedly the police came to the claimant's friend's home while she was in hiding, prior to her departure from Nigeria. These letters speak to a visit following the claimant's departure. Moreover, no details were provided in this regard, i.e. dates, city, etc. and the RPD concludes that the omission of this significant alleged pursuit seriously undermines the credibility of this incident. The RPD concludes that this visit by the police did not, in fact, occur.\n[34] The Panel finds that the claimant has failed to establish that she could not relocate to Port Harcourt. The Panel notes that Nigeria has a population of 186,053.386 and Port Harcourt has a population of 2.3 million people.11 The claimant did not adduce objective evidence to demonstrate that her father could locate her anywhere in Nigeria. The Panel finds that the claimant's allegations are based on speculation and are without merit. The claimant has not provided a tangible link between her father and anyone in authority in Port Harcourt. In fact, in response to questions by the panel, the claimant acknowledged that her father's position as XXXX XXXX did not extend beyond Ibadan. Nothing was provided about the financial means her father had to pursue the claimant. Given this lack of evidence establishing the father's influence and connections, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant's father would be unable to initiate a nation-wide search for the claimant.\n[35] With no clear and convincing evidence to establish that the claimant's father possesses the ability to navigate through a population of this size to locate the claimant, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that she will not face persecution at the hands of the agent of persecution. The panel does not find it credible that she would be traced to Port Harcourt, if she decided to keep her address private; the panel is not suggesting that she hide but there are ways to limit public knowledge of her home address, even in Nigeria. Furthermore, given the sheer geographical size of Nigeria and the sizeable population there, the panel finds that there is not more than a mere possibility that the agent of persecution would locate the claimant in Port Harcourt.\nReligion\n[36] The claimant has converted to Christianity. In Port Harcourt, the population is predominately Christian. If the claimant's father were to try to find her and cause religious strife, there is insufficient evidence before the panel to indicate that the police authorities would permit them to do so. Moreover, as the family have no history in Port Harcourt which is mostly Christian, there is no reason to believe that the Muslims hold any sway\/influence there with the police. There was no evidence before the panel to suggest that possibility. The panel concludes that if the agent of persecution did manage to locate her in Port Harcourt, she could seek the protection of the police.\n[37] Given the above, the panel finds that first prong of the test12 has been met. The panel now turns its mind to the reasonableness in all the circumstances of this particular claimant to suggest relocation.\n[38] With respect to the second prong of the IFA test, the claimant testified that as a non- indigene, she would encounter problems in Port Harcourt. She believes that this would prevent her from procuring employment, and she would, therefore, be unable to support her Canadian born children. Moreover, she testified that here in Canada, she has the support of her mother and brother to enable her to pursue her employment. On the latter argument, the RPD finds that the fact that her Canadian born children have built-in babysitters in Canada does not meet the high threshold under the reasonableness consideration for the second prong of the IFA. Moreover, the RPD finds that there was insufficient evidence to persuade it that she could not access childcare in Port Harcourt.\n[39] In examining the second prong of the test for IFA, the panel is required to assess the reasonableness for the claimant to relocate to Port Harcourt. In examining the profile of the claimant, she is a sophisticated and a well-educated person, having attended university and received a degree in Political Science. The official language is English. The hearing was conducted in English as the claimant is proficient in the English language. In addition to English, the claimant speaks the Yoruba language. There was nothing adduced to indicate that she could not procure employment if she were to go to Port Harcourt on the basis of lacking the necessary language skills. The documentary material in the NDP indicates that as there are many ethnic groups in Nigeria, over 200 languages are spoken in Port Harcourt.13 According to information referenced in the NDP, Pidgin English is the common language used in Port Harcourt.\n[40] In addition to being unable to procure employment in the claimant's mind, she further testified that as a non-indigene this would exacerbate the problem. Counsel directed the RPD to consider the documentary evidence in this regard14 as well as the claimant's corroborative evidence.15\n[41] The panel has considered the foregoing evidence. However, the RPD finds that what is described for the most part is discrimination not persecution. Moreover, the RPD notes that the preponderance of the evidence with respect to internal flight alternative in the NDP package does not indicate extreme hardships with respect to ethnicity.\n[42] The panel also considered the Chairperson's Guidelines in assessing the viability of the proposed IFA given that the claimant is a female. In regards to the feasibility of a woman to relocate to another area of Nigeria, the country documentary states the following:\nAccording to the University of Nigeria professor, it is easier for a woman to live alone without male support if she is educated and has a high social status because she can use \"family connections,\" and is more likely to gain employment through connections to powerful individuals and politicians than through education (5 Jan. 2012). The Women's Rights Watch Nigeria project coordinator stated that if women are educated, it is \"easier to cope\" with running a household without male or family support (18 Oct. 2012). However, sources indicate that there is a very high rate of unemployment in Nigeria (Professor 5 Jan. 2012; Women's Rights Watch Nigeria 18 Oct. 2012), including for graduates (Professor 5 Jan. 2012).16\n[43] The same professor stated the following regarding employment for women:\nThe University of Nigeria professor indicated that a woman living without male support \"can only get a reasonable job\" in Lagos, Ibadan or Port Harcourt with the help of someone \"in authority or very rich\" (5 Jan. 2012). He said that, when a woman can find a job, it is usually a \"low paying and high demanding\" job in the informal sector, which is \"equally difficult to come by\" due to the \"almost stagnant\" economy, poor infrastructure, and underdeveloped industrial sector (Professor 5 Jan. 2012). The Women's Rights Watch Nigeria project coordinator stated that, although times are changing because more women are going to school, it is \"generally easier\" for women in the south to obtain work than women in the north, although they often end up working in \"difficult\" jobs, such as \"petty trading\" and subsistence agriculture (18 Oct. 2012). Okeke indicated that educated women in the south can obtain employment, but \"many of them face sexual harassment\" (26 Oct. 2012).17\n[44] According to the U.K. Home Office document offering guidance in determining refugee status in cases from Nigeria involving women, reported that:18\n3.1.3 A woman will generally be able to avail themselves of effective protection from the state, albeit women face greater difficulties in seeking and obtaining protection than men particularly for sexual- and gender-based violence.\n3.1.4 Women are able to move throughout Nigeria and it is likely that internal relocation will be an option, depending on their individual circumstances, to escape localised threats from members of their family or other non-state actors.\n[45] From the documentary evidence,19 the panel concludes that based on the sheer size of the country and its population, it would be very difficult for a family member to track down a woman who was a victim at the hands of her father.\n[46] The evidence does not support that the claimant could not relocate to Port Harcourt. The panel does not find it unreasonable in the particular circumstances to suggest that the claimant relocates to Port Harcourt.\n[47] Notwithstanding the claimant's testimony that the claimant's father has in the past located her in Benin City, the panel is not persuaded that this is the case. Furthermore, the RPD concludes that there was insufficient credible evidence upon which to conclude that the claimant's father had any connections or influence such that he could or would locate the claimant in Port Harcourt. The panel notes that nothing was adduced to persuade it that the claimant would not be able to procure employment or housing, given her education and work history. The panel has considered the evidence and notwithstanding the claimants' testimony and the submissions of counsel, the panel finds that there is an internal flight alternative for the claimant in Port Harcourt.\nCONCLUSION\n[48] Having considered all of the evidence and submissions, the panel finds that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, nor a person in need of protection pursuant to Section 97(1) (a) and (b) of the IRPA.\n[49] Accordingly, the Refugee Protection Division rejects this claim for refugee protection.\n(signed)\n\"Roslyn Ahara\"\nRoslyn Ahara\nNovember 10, 2017\nDate\n1 Exhibit 6, item C-3.\n2 Guideline 4: Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution: Guidelines Issued by the Chairperson Pursuant to subsection 65(3) of the Immigration Act, IRB, Ottawa, March 9, 1993, Update: November 1996, as continued in effect by the Chairperson on June 28, 2002, pursuant to subsection 159(1)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n3 Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression: Guidelines issued by the Chairperson pursuant to paragraph 159(1)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n4 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) for Nigeria (March 31, 2017), item 12.1.\n5 Exhibit 8.\n6 Exhibit 7.\n7 Kamburona, Kavijenene v.

As such, they would be persecuted if they were to return to China.\nThe Claimant's Narrative\n[3] The principal claimant alleges that birth control officers forced her to have an abortion in 2004 and again in 2009. As a result of the second forced abortion, her health suffered and she became depressed. When her husband sent her for counselling, she received only sleeping pills (tranquilizers). The tranquilizers, and later, a trip to Europe in 2010 provided temporary relief. It was not until she began to practice Falun Gong with a friend, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX 2010 that her health improved.\n[4] Despite her misgivings the principal claimant accompanied XXXX to a Falun Gong meeting in XXXX 2011. The group was aware that it was illegal to practice Falun Gong and was always on high alert. Precaution was taken in the form of lookouts and changing the location of meetings.\n[5] The principal claimant stated that after attending the meetings her health improved, as XXXX had told her it would, and that on seeing the improvement, the male claimant also began to attend meetings. He went for the first time in XXXX 2011. He was concerned about his high blood pressure, which improved after about three months.\n[6] On XXXX XXXX, 2012 the family came to North America for a vacation. They intended to visit the United States of America, (the US), before coming to Canada where the female claimant had a sister. They spent two weeks in the US before travelling on to Canada. They arrived in Canada on the 17th July 2012. On XXXX XXXX, 2012 they learned that officers from China's Public Security Bureau, (the PSB), had raided the meeting place and had arrested three members of their group, including XXXX. Furthermore, the PSB had gone to their home and left a summons with the male claimant's parents. Both the male claimant and the principal claimant are named in the summons, which required them to appear in court. On receiving this news, the claimants decided to apply for Convention Refugee protection in Canada. They filed their claims on the 5th of September, 2012.\n[7] The claimants state that their daughter is now a practitioner of Falun Gong.\nDETERMINATION\n[8] For the reasons that follow, I find that the claimants are not Convention Refugees.\nISSUES\nThe issues in this claim are: Identity, Credibility and Subjective Fear\nIDENTITY\nThe Claimants' Personal Identities\n[9] The claimants' personal identities as citizens of China are satisfactorily established by means of the package of documents tendered by the Canadian Border Security Agency, (CBSA). These documents include certified true copies of their Chinese passports as well their applications for temporary resident visas. In addition, the claimants have tendered copies of their Household Registers and their daughter's birth certificate, originals of which were disclosed at the hearing.3 The principal claimant's oral testimony also fixed the claimants as citizens of China.\nThe Claimants' Identities as Practitioners of Falun Gong in China\n[10] The principal and male claimants sought to establish their profiles as practitioners of Falun Gong in China by tendering a copy of a summons they state was left with the male claimant's parents as well as a notice that purports to expel their daughter from school because of their Falun Gong activities.\nThe Summons\n[11] The documentary evidence indicates that the summons tendered by the claimants is a chuanpiao.4 They allege the PSB left the document at their home in China. The claimants state that the summons accused them of being involved in illegal Falun Gong activities. They also state that PSB told the male claimants parents they had raided a Falun Gong meeting, arresting XXXX and two others. It was XXXX and the two other practitioners who identified the principal and male claimants as members of the group.\n[12] The claimants sought to present the document as an arrest warrant, however, from the examples provided in the objective evidence the document they provided is consistent with a chuanpiao. The chuanpiao is described in the documentary evidence as a subpoena that is issued to a witness,5 and not to persons that the PSB intends to arrest.\n[13] In addition, the same documentary evidence establishes that there are other court ordered documents (summonses) which are used to compel individuals charged with crimes to appear in court usually in cases where there is no need to place an individual under arrest.6 In addition, there are other PSB-issued summonses which compel an individual to appear for interrogation and investigation.\n[14] In Li7 the RAD found that the chuanpiao could be distinguished from these summonses because it is solely used to compel witnesses to court. The RAD noted that the document itself states that the person subpoenaed must bring the document to the court in order to gain access to the court and it found that the issuance of a non-coercive subpoena is inconsistent with the Appellant's allegation that his fellow practitioner was arrested by the PSB and that they want to arrest him. Furthermore, the chuanpiao is issued by a court and not by the PSB as the claimants allege, and the document tendered is, in fact, issued by a court, the People's Court of Haizhu District, Guangzhou City.8\n[15] The panel applies the RAD's logic to the claimants' argument regarding the summons. Accordingly, the panel finds that the summons tendered is not a genuine summons. As a result, the panel finds that there is valid reason to doubt and to reject the summons as evidence that the PSB wants to arrest the male and principal claimant. The panel draws a negative credibility inference with respect to the tendering of the summons.\nLack of Follow-up to the Summons\n[16] The panel finds additional reason to question the genuineness of the summons as a result of the PSB's seeming inaction in the face of the claimant's failure to attend at Court as ordered by the summons. When asked directly, the principal claimant replied that she did not know if the PSB had issued any further summonses against her or\/and her husband. When the panel pointed out to her that she was in contact with her in-laws, she responded that although they talked to their family a lot they did not talk about such matters for fear that the telephone was bugged. In response to a further question from the panel, the principal claimant responded that she was not sure whether the PSB was, in fact, looking for her because sometimes the news is blocked.\n[17] In the panel's view, the female claimant's responses do no accord with what one might reasonably expect of a person in the situation she alleges. Surely, such a person would want to know the jeopardy he or she is in? A bugged telephone would be of little deterrent considering that the claimants are not in China and are presumably outside of the reach of the PSB. In light of the documentary evidence, the absence of any evidence of a further more coercive summons, taken in conjunction with the fact that the \"summons\" tendered was not in fact a summons, undermines the credibility of the claimant's allegation that they are wanted for arrest as members of Falun Gong.\nLack of Knowledge about the Fate of the Arrested co-Practitioners\n[18] The panel asked the principal claimant whether she knew what had happened to those of her fellow practitioners who had been arrested. Her reply was that she did not know because she was not in contact with them. As well, she does not ask her in-laws whether they have any news about them.\n[19] The panel finds that the principal claimant's responses were not satisfactory because they do not accord with what one might reasonably expect of a person whose fellow practitioners had been arrested. The panel finds that such a person would, on a balance of probabilities, want to know the fates of the arrested persons, if for no other reason than to gauge what their own possible fates might be.\n[20] Taken on a cumulative basis, all of the above, namely, the tendering of a false summons, the absence of any further summonses by the PSB, and the claimant's lack of knowledge about their fellow practitioners in China, indeed their failure to find out what fates of these fellow practitioners, in circumstances where it is reasonable to expect they would, leads the panel to conclude that neither the principal claimant, nor the male claimant, were genuine practitioners of Falun Gong in China, nor that they would be perceived as such.\nThe Notice of Expulsion\n[21] The principal claimant testified that the male claimant's parents continue to live in the family home without incident. However, the claimants submitted a \"notice of expulsion\" from the daughter's school that states that she was being expelled because of their parents' adherence to Falun Gong.\n[22] The panel places little reliance on the document as evidence of the claimants' adherence to Falun Gong because having tendered one false document, namely the summons, the claimants have demonstrated their willingness to tender false documents to the tribunal. Therefore, the panel finds that it could not be certain about the provenance or reliability of the document. The panel finds that it is more likely than not that the daughter was expelled from school because she failed to register at the start of the schoolyear and that her expulsion had nothing to do with her parents adherence to Falun Gong.\nThe Claimants' Travel History\n[23] The passports of the male and female claimant show an extensive travel history and clear pre-planning regarding their trip to the USA and Canada in 2012. The male claimant, who worked for XXXX XXXX XXXX, applied for and obtained temporary resident permits for them on the XXXX XXXX 2012. When asked, the principal claimant stated that their only purpose was their desire to show North America to their daughter. She stated that but for the fateful telephone call, they would have returned to China. Given the lengths to which they have gone to establish themselves as practitioners of Falun Gong in China, the panel is not persuaded by their explanation. The panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimants had always intended to come to Canada and used the refugee process to facilitate their migration.\nThe Claimant's Practice in Canada\n[24] The claimants submitted photographs of themselves practicing Falun Gong exercises in XXXX XXXX in Toronto and at Falun Gong demonstrations in Toronto.9 She also submitted two letters from persons who attest to their adherence to Falun Gong. The first letter states that the claimants practiced in XXXX XXXX until January 2014, while the second states that they practiced at XXXX XXXX XXXX. The author of the second letter also states that the daughter has become a practitioner of Falun Gong.\n[25] For the following reasons, the panel gave little weight to these documents. First, neither of the authors of the two letters attended the hearing as witnesses so that the veracity of their statements could be assessed. Secondly, XXXX XXXX is a public area and anyone could attend and perform the Falun Gong exercises without being genuine practitioners of Falun Gong.\n[26] The same is true of the photographs taken at demonstrations. In any event, the panel finds that it is not enough to assert that one becomes a refugee sur place by simply attending a demonstration and having oneself photographed holding a banner. The claimants must also show that their activities in Canada would likely have come to the attention of the Chinese authorities.10 The panel finds that they have not met this onus. Furthermore, in light of the fact that the claimants have tendered at least one false document to the Board, the panel finds that the photographs do not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants are Falun Gong practitioners.\n[27] In this respect the panel relies on the dicta of Justice Gleason in Su11 where the claimant alleged a sur place Falun Gong claim:\n[17] Contrary to what the applicant asserts, the Board did assess the sur place claim and the evidence the applicant tendered in support of his assertion that he was a genuine Falun Gong practitioner in Canada. It simply found this evidence insufficient to establish the genuineness of the claimed practice. There is nothing unreasonable in this conclusion, especially when viewed in light of the determination that the applicant fabricated what had occurred in China. In short, there is nothing unreasonable in finding that a few letters and pictures do not establish that a claimant is a genuine adherent to a religion, especially where, as here, he has lied about being a practitioner in order to make a fraudulent refugee claim.\n[28] In this regard, I endorse the comment of Justice Pinard in Jin at para 20, that: \"[I]t would be absurd to grant a sur place claim every time a pastor provides a letter attesting to an applicant's membership in his church.\"12\nCONCLUSION\n[29] In light of the above the panel concludes that the claimants have not met their onus to show that they are persons who face a serious possibility of persecution as contemplated by section 96, or would be in danger of being tortured or would face a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, as set forth in section 97(1) of the Act, because of their adherence to Falun Gong.\n[30] The panel finds that XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX are not Convention refugees under section 96 or \"persons in need of protection\" within the meaning of section 97 of the Act.\n(signed)\n\"Hazelyn Ross\"\nHazelyn Ross\nOctober 30, 2017\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,S.C. 2001, C. 27 as amended, sections 96, 97 (1)(a) and 97(1)(b).\n2 Exhibit C-1, Personal Information Form (PIF).\n3 Item 10, Amended Consolidated Lists of Documents.\n4 Exhibit RPD-5 National Documentation Package for China (NDP), (version 20, JuIy 2017) Item 9.10, pp1-2.\n5 Ibid.\n6 Ibid.\n7 Li, Liang v.

However, they can best be described as follows.\n[4] The principal claimant fears her former common-law husband, XXXX. Notwithstanding the police reports and a restraining order, she alleges that he kept coming after her.\n[5] Initially, the principal claimant went to stay at her sister's home; however, when XXXX began threatening her children, went to their schools and harassed them, she left the community of Dennery in XXXX 2012 and went to live with an aunt in Vieux Fort. Following this, XXXX had been telling people that the principal claimant was the one who had encouraged her daughter, XXXX, to date women.\n[6] One month later, XXXX came to Vieux Fort, in the company of a young boy, who managed to lure the principal claimant to a car, when she was grabbed, and a knife held to her throat and threatened by XXXX if she did not return. She promised to return, however, she went to the police, but they did not wish to become involved in family matters.\n[7] On July 12, 2012, the claimants arrived in Canada. The principal claimant was uncertain as to whether or not she would be allowed entry, having been denied on a previous occasion. Initially, the principal claimant believed that things would improve and she could return to St. Lucia. However, meanwhile, XXXX became convinced that the reason the principal claimant came to Canada was to join XXXX lifestyle and date women too. Accordingly, the principal claimant filed her refugee claim on September 17, 2012.\nDETERMINATION\n[8] The RPD finds that the claimants would not face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, and that, on a balance of probabilities, they would not personally be subjected to a risk to their lives, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture upon return to St. Lucia.\nANALYSIS\n[9] The determinative issues in this claim are credibility, which includes subjective fear (delay in claiming), and state protection. These issues relate to two allegations, namely, domestic abuse and the perception of being bi-sexual, having supported her daughter's sexual orientation.\nIdentity\n[10] On a balance of probabilities, the RPD finds that the principal claimant has established her St. Lucian citizenship based on a copy of her passport. The children's identities have been established as per their birth certificates.\nCredibility\n[11] In considering credibility, the RPD is aware of the difficulties that may be faced by the principal claimant in establishing her claim, namely, the setting of the hearing room, and the stress inherent in responding to questions. The panel has also considered and applied the Chairperson's Guidelines1 before coming to its conclusion with respect to domestic violence. The panel has examined the risk to the claimants at the hands of XXXX, which occurred over a number of years leading to her departure in XXXX 2012. The panel has also considered Guideline 92 and questions were posed in a sensitive and respectful manner. In rendering the decision, the panel has carefully reviewed the considerations and the framework of analysis as set forth in this guideline as they relate to matters of weight and credibility of the claimant's evidence. The panel recognizes that the principal claimant, by her own admission, is not bi-sexual, but this issue was addressed from the point of view that she alleges that she is perceived to be bi-sexual, as she supported her daughter, who is a bi-sexual.\nDelay in claiming\n[12] Although the panel does not find a 3 month delay lengthy, nevertheless, it is the intention which it examined. According to the principal claimant's testimony, she did not intend to make a refugee claim at the outset, and she had permission to remain for one month. Nevertheless, she waited another two months before initiating a refugee claim.\n[13] Counsel submits that the principal claimant was unaware of the refugee process, hence the delay. With due respect, although not determinative, the panel finds otherwise. Moreover, in response to counsel, the principal claimant referred to her daughter's lifestyle as to the timing of her refugee claim, something which the panel rejects given that she herself is not bi-sexual. Her daughter had come here in 2009 and she had made a successful refugee claim herself, and she provided no cogent response to the question as to why she had waited. As stated earlier, although not determinative, the panel finds that the principal claimant's intentions are called into question.\nBi-sexuality\n[14] The principal claimant submitted an amended narrative to her PIF at the commencement of the hearing, thereby contravening 34(3) of the RPD Rules. In accordance with Rule 43, the panel allowed the amendment, given its relevance.\n[15] When questioned by the RPD, the principal claimant suggested that her daughter was currently in a bi-sexual relationship. However, later in questioning, she acknowledged that her daughter is married with two children, but was in female relationships initially when she arrived in Canada.\n[16] The principal claimant had no idea when her daughter got married, notwithstanding the fact that she visited her in 2010 and arrived in Canada in July 2012. The panel was not expecting an exact date, and in fact, asked her an approximate time of year, or how long after her arrival. However, she was unable to provide a response.\n[17] Furthermore, the panel notes that the Affidavit from the principal claimant's daughter speaks to the domestic abuse at the hands of her father, but makes no mention of her sexual orientation.\n[18] More importantly, however, is the question posed by the panel with respect to the period between her daughter, XXXX departure in 2009 and when the principal claimant arrived in July 2012. She acknowledged that this was not an issue from 2009 until 2012, since her daughter was already in Canada.\n[19] Finally, the panel concludes that if the principal claimant were to return to St. Lucia, her daughter is a permanent resident of Canada, and therefore, there would be no reason to perceive this connection after the passage of time, namely, a period of 8 years. Accordingly, the RPD finds that the fears of the claimants with respect to perception of bi-sexuality are not well-founded and the claims fail with respect to this issue.\nDomestic violence and state protection\n[20] The principal claimant testified that she approached the police on numerous occasions without success. Moreover, she testified that she sought and obtained a protection order, which the perpetrator contravened. However, she was unable to provide much information with respect to her visits to the police, in terms of when they occurred and what the police informed her. When asked about the restraining order, she testified that the agent of persecution had breached it, but when questioned as whether or not she had notified the courts in this regard, she responded in the negative. Later, she expanded upon her response when she said she was fearful to return to report the breach. Moreover, she testified that she did not have a copy of the restraining order as it had been lost in the hurricane. However, the panel pointed out to her that the Affidavit from her friend, XXXX XXXX 3 indicates that she never received a copy of the Order. More importantly, the principal claimant could not recall when she was issued this restraining order, a significant event, in the RPD's opinion, even if the date were not specific, but approximate.\n[21] The principal claimant was asked if she had attempted to contact the courts to obtain a copy of the restraining order. She had not and did not provide a letter requesting such a document. Moreover, the panel notes that the principal claimant provided no recent documentation, other than an amended PIF at the commencement of the hearing. Most of the affidavits are dated 2015 and one from the principal claimant's aunt is dated 2014. The principal claimant and her children have had no contact with the agent of persecution since her departure in July 2012.\n[22] As counsel submits, the panel must be cognizant of the lack of education, sophistication, and even the inability to respond to questions with spontaneity. The panel at no time expected the principal claimant to provide exact dates, but approximations, particularly with respect to significant events, were expected to be recalled. However, virtually no dates were provided, the most significant being the date of issue of the restraining order, the date of her daughter's marriage, for example 2 years after her arrival or something in that order. No psychological report was proffered in support of cognitive and memory problems. Furthermore, when issues of credibility are raised, it is that much more significant that the principal claimant files some corroborative evidence to corroborate this vague testimony and vague contents of the PIF.\n[23] Moreover, when questioned about the principal claimant's activities prior to her arrival in Canada, initially she stated that she hid with her sister for a month, whereas her PIF states until XXXX 2012 (3 months) , when she was found and went to stay with her aunt. Counsel submits that this contradiction or inconsistency does not go to the material aspect of the claim. With due respect, the RPD disagrees. The RPD finds that these were the precipitating events that led to the principal claimant's departure from St. Lucia.\n[24] The RPD finds that the foregoing casts a doubt on the veracity of the principal claimant's allegations to the extent that she alleges. Moreover, the panel finds that there is insufficient credible evidence upon which to find that the agent of persecution would have reason to harm her now. They have had no contact for five years, and by her own acknowledgment, she is given to understand that he is seeing many women.\n[25] The burden of proof lies with the principal claimant to provide sufficient credible evidence upon which the RPD can find her to be a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. She has not met that burden.\n[26] The panel recognizes that corroborating evidence is not always required to establish a credible claim to persecution. However, when credibility is an issue as it is in this claim, credible corroborating evidence regarding the totality of the claim would have been helpful. The Federal Court case in Bhagat,4 states the following:\nCorroborating evidence is not always necessary to establish the applicant's subjective fear. The Board, however, determined that in the particular circumstances of this case, corroborating evidence of persecution was expected. An absence of corroborating evidence, then, permitted it to make a negative inference against credibility of the applicant. The respondent relies on Sheik v. Canada (M.E.I.) (C.A.), [1990] 3 F.C. 238, at page 244, for its argument that the Board did not err in law when making that conclusion:\nThe concept of \"credible evidence\" is not, of course, the same as that of the credibility of the applicant, but it is obvious that where the only evidence before a tribunal linking the applicant to his claim is that of the applicant himself (in addition, perhaps, to \"country reports\" from which nothing about the applicant's claim can be directly deduced), a tribunal's perception that he is not a credible witness effectively amounts to a finding that there is no credible evidence on which the second-level tribunal could allow his claim.\nIn Adu v. Canada (M.E.I.), [1995] F.C.J. No. 114 (QL), the Federal Court of Appeal found that it is reasonable to expect documentary evidence of the existence of a law and stated:\n. . . The \"presumption\" that a claimant's sworn testimony is true is always rebuttable, and, in appropriate circumstances, may be rebutted by the failure of the documentary evidence to mention what one would normally expect it to mention.\n[27] The RPD further notes the instructions that accompany the principal claimant's PIF, in which it indicates the requirements of corroborative evidence, efforts made to obtain such evidence, or in their absence, reasons for being unable to provide this information. The principal claimant simply said she had contacted the court to obtain a document and they would not provide it unless she appeared in person. She did not provide the RPD with proof of this request, i.e. a proxy or proof that the courts indicated that such a document could not be provided.\n[28] The RPD notes that the National Documentation Package (NDP) indicates that one is able to obtain police and medical reports, without specifically referring to copies of restraining order, simply by authorizing an individual to obtain such reports.5 The RPD, given the foregoing information contained in the NDP, and in the absence to the contrary, finds that the principal claimant did not make any effort to obtain such documentation.\n[29] The RPD has carefully reviewed the country condition articles, reports filed by the Refugee Protection Division and counsel regarding the issue of adequate state protection with respect to victims of domestic violence and gender violence, particularly the articles in the Refugee Protection Division which are from independent, reputable international human rights organizations.\n[30] The RPD would describe the country condition articles regarding the treatment of domestic violence, and gender violence as mixed. However, on a balance of probabilities, looking at all of the documents, the RPD finds there is adequate state protection for victims of domestic violence\n[31] The RPD notes that the documentation submitted by the claimants is dated 2013 and 2014 and comes from newspaper reports, and is therefore less reliable.\n[32] The RPD acknowledges that the law criminalizes rape which is punishable by a 14-year to life imprisonment. The law criminalizes spousal rape, and there are protection orders that are provided from family court.6\n[33] The U.S. report from the Department of State on Country Reports for Human Rights Practices in 2016 states that police and courts enforce laws to protect women against rape, but many victims were reluctant to report case or press charges due to the fear of stigma, retribution or further violence.7\n[34] The same report further states: 8\nShelters, a hotline, police training, and a national protocol were all used to deal with the problem, but the lack of financial security for the victim was one of the key impediments. The maximum amount of child support that the court can award a woman is $250 XCD ($93) per month per child. Police also faced resource challenges such as a lack of transportation, which can prevent them from responding to a call in a timely manner. The Saint Lucia Crisis Center, a nongovernmental organization (NGO) receiving government assistance, maintained a facility for battered women and their children and a hotline for support. The only residential facility for victims of domestic abuse, the Women's Support Center, also received government funding. The Women's Support Center employed a full-time counselor who also counseled nonresident victims through the Department of Gender Relations.\nThe Ministry of Education, Innovation, Gender Relations, and Sustainable Development assisted victims. Authorities referred most of the cases to a counselor, and the police facilitated the issuance of court protection orders in some cases.\nThe Family Court hears cases of domestic violence and crimes against women and children. The court can issue a protection order prohibiting an abuser from entering or remaining in the residence of a specified person. The court remands perpetrators to a batterers' intervention program for rehabilitation. The court employed full-time social workers to assist victims of domestic violence.\nOccupation and tenancy orders provide certain residential rights to victims of domestic violence, including required rental payments by the respondent and protective orders.\nThe police had two vulnerable persons units to handle cases involving violence against women and children. These units worked closely with the Family Court and the Education, Innovation, Gender Relations and Sustainable Development Ministry's Department of Gender Relations and Department of Human Services and Family Affairs.\nThe Department of Gender Relations ran the Women's Support Center, which provided shelter, counseling, residential services, a 24-hour hotline, and assistance in finding employment. Various NGOs, such as the Saint Lucia Crisis Center and the National Organization of Women, also provided counseling, referral, education, and empowerment services. The crisis center assisted in cases of physical violence, incest, nonpayment of child support, alcohol and drug abuse, homelessness, custody, and visitation rights.\n[35] The principal claimant acknowledged that she had not reached out to any of these organizations. The RPD notes that she referred only to the police in vague terms and the restraining order, the date of which she was unaware, coupled with conflicting evidence in this regard as to whether she ever received a copy of this order.\n[36] The same source from the Department of State of the United States also indicates that:\nThe criminal code prohibits sexual harassment, but it remained a problem, as government enforcement was not an effective deterrent. The Department of Gender Relations continued an awareness program that provided training opportunities in workplaces and assisted establishments in creating policies and procedures on how to handle sexual harassment. As a result most cases of sexual harassment were handled in the workplace rather than prosecuted under the labor code.9\n[37] It would appear that the government, including the police, do address domestic violence and gender violence, and are striving to promote awareness in this regard.\n[38] The preponderance of objective country condition evidence indicates to the RPD that state protection is adequate for the claimant at this time if she was to return to St. Lucia. As such, the panel finds that the claimants do not have a well-founded fear if they return to St. Lucia.\n[39] With respect to the principal claimant's children, although their claims are based on the allegations contained in the principal claimant's PIF, she was asked if the agent of persecution had ever harmed them. He had not; she stated that he had visited their schools and used them against her but never touched them. She did say that her son is frightened of him, having witnessed some of the anger perpetrated by him against her, but she provided no further evidence in this regard.\nCONCLUSION\n[40] Before reaching its conclusion, the RPD must stress that it considered the lack of education, the lack of sophistication and ensured when it was aware that the principal claimant didn't understand the question, that it was rephrased to enable her to understand what was required. In a few instances, the member asked counsel to clarify some issues to ensure that no misunderstandings occurred.\n[41] Nevertheless, there are certain requirements to persuade the RPD that there is sufficient credible evidence upon which to determine a positive claim. The principal claimant has failed in the following areas:\n* Lack of a reasonable explanation with respect to her intentions upon her arrival in Canada in 2012;\n* Insufficient credible evidence to find that her daughter's bi-sexuality would pose a problem upon her return to St. Lucia;\n* Lack of corroborative evidence and no reasonable explanation for the absence of such documentation;\n* Evidence surrounding the issuance of a restraining order was contradictory;\n* No evidence that is recent to suggest that the agent of persecution is interested in harming her after 5 years.\n[42] For the foregoing reasons, the RPD finds that the claimants would not face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, and that, on a balance of probabilities, they would not personally be subjected to a risk to their lives, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture upon return to St. Lucia.\n(signed)\n\"Roslyn Ahara\"\nRoslyn Ahara\nOctober 24, 2017\nDate\n1 Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution: Update, Guideline Issued by the Chairperson Pursuant to Section 65(3) of the Immigration Act, IRB, Ottawa, November 25, 1996, as continued in effect by the Chairperson on June 28, 2002, under the authority found in section 159(1)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n2 Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression, Guidelines issued by the Chairperson pursuant to paragraph 159(1)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n3 Exhibit 17.\n4 Bhagat, Baboo Lal v.

She is of XXXX ethnicity. She is a Christian. The claimant lived with her parents and worked as a XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX at a XXXX named XXXX XXXX.\n[4] In June, 2009, the claimant was offered a job as a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in Austria. The claimant, after conferring with her mother, accepted the job and left for Austria with her employer, XXXX XXXX, in XXXX, 2012. The claimant alleges that by the end of XXXX, 2012, her employer had forced her into prostitution. The claimant alleges that, at one point, she was raped by three males that were sent by XXXX XXXX during the time she was forced to prostitute herself to re-enforce her dominance. The claimant alleges she cannot return to Nigeria as XXXX XXXX is demanding payment of 40,000 euros from her and her family. The claimant will be killed if the money is not paid to XXXX XXXX.\n[5] The claimant alleges she was assisted by a male client, named XXXX, who arranged for her to flee Austria. The claimant arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2012, and filed a refugee claim at the XXXX airport upon arrival.\nGENDER GUIDELINES\n[6] In making its determination, the panel followed the Chairperson's Guidelines for Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.2 The panel, at the onset, advised the claimant that it would not ask questions regarding the alleged sexual assault and was sensitive in asking questions regarding certain aspects of her allegations. At no time did counsel ask for any accommodations, nor object to any of the questions asked by the panel.\n[7] The panel took into consideration how the claimant would be treated, or looked upon, as a single woman with a child if she were to return to Nigeria. The panel took into consideration the claimant's ability to be employed, and her ability to support herself and the child. Country documentation states that single women are able to find employment in the South in cities such as Port Harcourt than in the north.3\nDETERMINATION\n[8] The panel finds that the claimant is not a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of the IRPA, nor is she a person in need of protection, pursuant to s. 97 of IRPA.\nANALYSIS\n[9] The issues in this hearing were:\n* Credibility\n* Subjective \/ Objective basis\n* Internal Flight Alternative\nIdentity\n[10] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant is who she says she is and that she is a citizen of Nigeria. In support of her identity, the claimant provided a copy of her Attestation of Birth4 and copy of Nigerian Driver's Licence and copy of authentication of the claimant's driver's licence by the Nigerian High Commission in Ottawa attesting to the identification of the claimant.5\nCredibility\n[11] The claimant testified in a straightforward manner. The panel finds that the claimant did not make any apparent attempt to embellish her testimony. There were some inconsistencies between the claimant's Personal Information Form (PIF) narrative6 and her oral testimony. There was also an omission from the PIF regarding how she was able to flee from XXXX XXXX and Austria, however that portion was in the Point of Entry (POE) notes. When asked why she omitted from the PIF, the claimant testified that since it was already in the officer's notes, she didn't include it in the narrative.\n[12] A major credibility concern for the panel is the claimant's account as to how she was able to flee XXXX XXXX and from Austria. The claimant testified that she met a male client, named XXXX, whom she had dealings with on three occasions between XXXX and XXXX, 2012. She testified that he treated her differently because she was young. The claimant was asked by the panel if she was ever alone when she was out on the street. The claimant testified that she was always accompanied by the other girls. However, when asked how she was able to flee, she testified that she told XXXX XXXX that she had a client to look after and left on her own. When asked about this contradictory statement, the claimant did not provide a response.\n[13] The claimant further testified that, after leaving the house, she travelled to the train station in Innsbruck where she called XXXX. The claimant, when asked where XXXX resided, testified that he resides in Vienna and upon her request he travelled to the train station to help her. Upon his arrival at the Innsbruck train station the claimant told him the entire story, XXXX then advised her to get some photos from the photo booth and they departed back to Vienna. The claimant continued to testify that XXXX then arranged for an Agent to escort her to Canada. The claimant was asked if she paid anything to XXXX for the services of the Agent, the claimant advised that XXXX paid for everything.\n[14] The panel does not find this portion of her testimony to be credible. It simply doesn't make sense that XXXX, who lives in Vienna, a distance of 476.2 kilometers from Innsbruck, would travel some 4.5 hours to obtain the services of the claimant or any other girl. Further, the panel also finds it unreasonable that XXXX would pay an Agent to obtain a passport, and escort the claimant to Canada, at his expense. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that this portion of the claimant's evidence is not believable, as it simply doesn't have a ring of truth.\n[15] The claimant fears returning to Nigeria as XXXX XXXX is looking for her to collect the 40,000 euros which she feels is owed to her by the claimant. The claimant fears that she will be killed if found by the madam as she cannot pay the money which is being demanded. The claimant further fears that the madam may have the influence she claims to have, which includes her ability to bribe the Nigerian Police Force. The panel asked why she believes that XXXX XXXX has such influence over the police; the claimant testified that is what she believes because XXXX XXXX has money and would be able to bribe the police. In considering the foregoing, the panel finds that, although the claimant may have a subjective fear of persecution, she has provided no convincing evidence to support that XXXX XXXX would have the ability or influence to carry out her threats, or the police would not be able to protect her if she sought state protection. This evidence is speculative and, in any event, the claimant provided no persuasive evidence that the police would not be able to protect her. I find, therefore, that the objective basis of her fear has not been established.\n[16] In addition to the lack of objective fear, the panel finds the claimant has a viable internal flight alternative in Nigeria, as this issue was raised with the claimant at her refugee protection claim hearing.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[17] The question of whether an internal flight alternative exists is an integral part of the Convention refugee definition.7 It arises when a claimant who otherwise meets all the elements of the Convention refugee definition in his or her home area of the country nevertheless is not a Convention refugee because the person has an internal flight alternative elsewhere in that country. The panel must then apply the two-prong test established by Thirunavukkarasu.8\n(1) The panel must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an Internal Flight Alternative exists.\n(2) Moreover, conditions in the part of the country considered to be an Internal Flight Alternative must be such that it would not be unreasonable, in all circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for him to seek refuge there.9\n[18] Once the issue of an internal flight alternative is raised, the onus is on the refugee claimant to show that the option does not exist, by establishing that either of the two Thirunavukkarasu criteria is not met. The Federal Court of Appeal in Thirunavukkarasu stated that an applicant need only show that there is a serious possibility of being persecuted in the new location. The claimant testified that she could not move to another city such as Abuja, Port Harcourt, Calabar or any other major centre as XXXX XXXX was rich and could bribe the Nigerian Police Force in locating her. The claimant further testified that she had heard from others that XXXX XXXX boasted that she could bribe any level of the Nigerian Police Force. The claimant testified to no other reason(s) why she could not live in another city or the cities which were suggested to her. Her explanation is assessed for unreasonableness in the following analysis.\n[19] The panel finds that there is a reasonable and viable internal flight alternative available to the claimant in Abuja, Port Harcourt, Calabar or any other major centre in Nigeria, away from XXXX XXXX where the claimant's family presently resides undisturbed.\n[20] The panel must be sensitive to the situation of women in assessing whether it is reasonable or unreasonable for a claimant to relocate. In the case of Syvyryn,10 the Federal Court of Canada stated that decision-makers must consider the ability of women, because of their gender, to travel safely to the IFA and to stay there without facing undue hardship, and decision-makers must take into account religious, economic and cultural factors.\n[21] The claimant has testified that she fears her former employer who is known as \"XXXX XXXX.\" In coming to this decision, with respect to the first prong, the panel has considered a number of factors. The Home Office United Kingdom Border Agency report11 states that the Nigerian constitution provides for the right to travel within Nigeria. The report also states that internal relocation to escape ill-treatment from non-state agents is almost always an option and, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, it would not be unduly harsh for any individual to internally relocate.\n[22] The claimant does not have a high profile in Nigeria, and the panel finds that she could live in any of the three cities. There is no persuasive evidence that there is a large resourceful group of people in Nigeria who would continue to search for the claimant and would seek her out in all parts of a country of over 170 million people. There is no persuasive evidence that her former employer has any position of authority in the police to allow any one of them to carry out such a widespread and continuous search. Therefore, the panel finds that the claimant could live in any of the three cities without fear or the need to hide. If the claimant does not wish to inform others of her presence in these cities, there is no reason to believe that her location would be found out. The panel notes that the cities are large and located at a substantial distance from XXXX XXXX. It would also appear that one would have great difficulty in tracing a person in such a populous country. Thus, the claimant failed to provide a reasonable explanation as to why she believes she would be discovered and\/or harmed at any of these locations, and therefore there is no reason to believe, on a balance of probabilities, that she would be harmed. There is no serious possibility of persecution of the claimant in these cities.\n[23] With respect to the second prong, the panel is not persuaded that it would be unreasonable for the claimant to move to Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt or other major urban centres. The claimant provided no persuasive evidence that she would not be familiar with cultural issues and norms in these cities. The claimant did not give any reason, or reasons, why she could not live in any of the above cities mentioned, or another city in Nigeria. The claimant testified that she could not live in any of those cities, because XXXX XXXX could bribe the police to find her. The claimant did not offer a reasonable explanation why she could not live in any of those cities, therefore, the panel is satisfied that it would be reasonable for the claimant to adapt to new surroundings in any of these cities.\n[24] The claimant testified that she continues to keep in touch with the child's father as indicated by an email12 she presented to the panel. The claimant testified that he only asks about the well-being of the child. The claimant did not give testimony whether the father of the child would provide financial assistance if asked. The claimant was asked if she could continue her profession as a XXXX XXXX, however she testified that she would have to start her XXXX XXXX. The panel asked if she could not work for another XXXX XXXX, but the claimant did not answer the question directly, but responded, again, that she would have to open her XXXX XXXX.\n[25] The Report from Finland, from the Finnish Immigration Service on Human Trafficking of Nigerian Women to Europe, states:\nVictims of human trafficking are not victims of violent persecution or killings by traffickers in Nigeria. None of the victims assisted by Rev. Ejeh and Agbogun's organization have expressed fear of reprisals from traffickers or received threats from them, and Rev. Ejeh and Agbogun have no records from the media of violent reprisals or killings of victims. On the other hand, the Danish Immigration Service considers it possible that the media in Nigeria might not record such incidents as the media has shown no particular interest in human trafficking. 13\nAccording to two women interviewed by Plambech in her study, traffickers do not need to resort to violence to collect unpaid debt from women deported from Europe as they have so many women going to Europe.14\nLocal traffickers in Nigeria do not occupy a strong position in society and they cannot do much else than recruit new victims. According to Rev. Ejeh and Agbogun (Catholic Secretariat of Nigeria\/Caritas Nigeria), local traffickers are not in a position to persecute victims. These local traffickers are not necessarily fully loyal to madams or traffickers abroad. Traffickers have no interest in being exposed and imprisoned for acts of revenge on behalf of a madam or trafficker living abroad. According to Sister Florence (COSUDOW), traffickers do not have a strong network in Nigeria and they normally keep a low profile. Consequently, they do not take the risk of being exposed in order to take revenge against their victims who testify against them.15\n[26] The documentary evidence states that the southern states of Nigeria (with the exception of Abuja which is in the north) are predominantly Christian, while both Muslims and Christians reside in large numbers in the Federal Capital Territory of Abuja. For this reason, the panel is satisfied that the claimant has sources of moral and spiritual assistance and support, available to her in Nigeria.\n[27] Given the finding above, that the claimant has an internal flight alternative in Nigeria, the panel finds that the claimant does not face a serious possibility of persecution there and also finds that her removal to Nigeria would not subject her personally to a risk to her life, or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture.\nCONCLUSION\n[28] The claimant is not a Convention refugee, nor is she a person in need of protection as defined in sections 96 and 97(1) of IRPA. Therefore, her claim is rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Luis F. Agostinho\"\nLuis F.

The claimant escaped from his imprisonment and fled Eritrea to Sudan. The claimant retained the services of a smuggler, obtained a non-genuine passport, and travelled through several countries before arriving in Canada where he made a refugee claim. The claimant fears that if he returns to Eritrea he will be imprisoned and mistreated by Eritrean officials as before, as well as due to his escape from imprisonment and illegal exit from Eritrea.\nDecision\n[3] The panel finds that the claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, or that, on a balance of probabilities, he would personally be subjected to a danger of torture or to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nANALYSIS\n[4] The determinative issue in this case is identity.\nIdentity\n[5] There is a requirement to \"take into account, with respect to the credibility of a claimant, whether the claimant possesses acceptable documentation establishing identity.\"3 The claimant has the onus to \"provide acceptable documents establishing their identity and other elements of the claim.\"4 In this instance there is cause to doubt the credibility, genuineness, or trustworthiness of the evidence provided by the claimant in support of his identity.\nBirth Certificate\n[6] A copy of the claimant's birth certificate was seized by Canadian immigration authorities when the claimant made his refugee claim in Canada.5 The claimant testified that the reason his birth certificate was issued in 2007, when the claimant was almost 30 years old, was that his father was so ill that the claimant needed to obtain a power of attorney for his father. The claimant initially testified that the birth certificate was issued to the claimant. However the claimant later testified that it was father who went and obtained the birth certificate.\n[7] After the claimant escaped from detention and fled Eritrea he travelled to Canada via Sudan, XXXX, and XXXX. In his PIF the claimant states that he used two identity documents to travel to Canada: His Eritrean birth certificate and a non-genuine passport.6 At this hearing the claimant was asked about having identity (ID) documents and how he was able to travel to Canada. The claimant indicated that he did not have any ID documents, but did obtain a passport and air tickets via a smuggler. It is not clear when or how the claimant came into possession of his birth certificate following his escape from detention in Eritrea, though it is clear that he did have it when he arrived in Canada as a copy of it is included in Exhibit 1 and it includes a stamp from Canadian immigration authorities. The claimant testified that when he was first detained by Eritrean authorities they took everything from him other than his driver's license, which they apparently missed as it was in his car. The claimant testified that authorities took everything, including his national ID card and other documents. It is not clear how or why the claimant's birth certificate was not taken by authorities upon his detention.\n[8] The claimant's birth certificate is in several respects inconsistent with examples of birth certificates identified in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Eritrea.7 The certificates in the NDP were provided to the Immigration and Refugee Board's Research Directorate by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' representative. The inconsistences between the claimant's birth certificate and the birth certificates in the NDP are described below.\n* The title, \"Certificate of Birth\", is underlined in both examples in the NDP. The claimant's birth certificate is not underlined.\n* The registration number area titled \"Registration No.\" on the claimant's birth certificate contains a period following the \"No\". Both birth certificates in the NDP do not contain a period after \"Registration No\".\n* The font of the completed information in the body of the claimant's birth certificate, including the claimant's name, place of birth, date of birth, nationality, and sex, are written in all capital letters and in a sans serif font. These elements in both of the birth certificates in the NDP are written in lower case letters, with only the initial letter of a word capitalized, and are written in a serif font.\n* The appearance of the printed letters in the claimant's name, mother's name, date of birth, nationality, etc., on his birth certificate appear very crisp and clear, particularly when compared to other elements on the birth certificate, including the document's title, the words in the leftmost column (\"Full Name\", Mother's Name\", \"Born At\", etc.), and the words at the bottom of the certificate which all have a blurry appearance. The words in the birth certificates in the NDP appear equally clear throughout those documents without any notable internal difference in clarity or sharpness.\n* The claimant's birth certificate identifies his \"Birth Time\" with four digits as \"00:00\". Both birth certificates in the NDP identify a birth time with five digits as \"0:00:00\".\n* The lower portion of the claimant's birth certificate contains two sentences: \"The Public Registration Office....\" followed by \"This Birth certificate....\". Both birth certificates in the NDP have the same sentences, but in the reverse order from that on the claimant's birth certificate.\n* The bottom sentence of the claimant's birth certificate is \"This Birth certificate...\" with a capital B in birth. Both birth certificates in the NDP do not capitalize the B in birth in that sentence.\n* The claimant's birth certificate appears to be signed by Goitom Sbhatieab, the Head of Public Registration Office. One of the birth certificates in the NDP is also signed by Goitom Sbhatieab the head of Public Registration Office, however the signature in the claimant's birth certificate is obviously and markedly different from the signature allegedly from the same person in the birth certificate in the NDP.\n[9] The claimant was asked if he has any idea why his birth certificate appears different in some respects than the ones in the NDP. The claimant testified that he doesn't know anything about that. In reviewing the available information about Eritrean birth certificates there are reports that the certificates are not fully standardized in their appearance, and that the name of the central region may have variations in spelling (Zoba Maekel or Zoba Maakel).8 However, the concerns and inconsistencies identified above are not reasonably explained by this. The Eritrean Embassy in the United States (US) indicated that \"there is a 'template' [for the Eritrean birth certificate] in the sense that the form looks somewhat alike but each region is slightly different\" [emphasis added].9 The claimant's birth certificate and the birth certificates in the NDP are all from the same region, and were issued within broadly the same time period, with one from the NDP issued before the claimant's birth certificate and one from the NDP issued after the claimant's birth certificate. All three of the certificates were issued in the same city, Asmara, and the births from all three certificates were registered in the in the same Public Registration Office, that of Zoba Maakel. While one of the potential inconsistencies identified in the NDP is the spelling of the name of the region (Zoba Maakel), that spelling is actually consistent across all three birth certificates. All three certificates appear generally similar in overall appearance. The NDP indicates that different regions may have slightly different templates, however the three birth certificates discussed above do not appear to be different templates, and they are all clearly from the same region. This is not a case where absolute perfection or 100% consistency is expected amongst these documents. However, I have not been provided with a reasonable explanation for these inconsistencies and the identified inconsistencies are varied and numerous.\n[10] I have also reviewed reports in the NDP regarding the availability and prevalence of fraudulent documents, including identity documents, in Eritrea and in Eritrean communities abroad. There are reports that fraudulent documents are in some cases sold by government and military officials on the black market, and that there is a high demand for such documents. There is also a high prevalence of fraudulent identity documents in Eritrea. There are reports of an underground market for fraudulent Eritrean identity documents in refugee communities abroad, including in Sudan where the claimant lived for several months before coming to Canada. It was also where the claimant paid $14,000 to retain a smuggler in order to obtain, among other things, a non-genuine passport. No negative inference is drawn from the claimant's use of that method to travel to safety and make a refugee claim.\n[11] The total number of unexplained inconsistencies, particularly when viewed cumulatively, along with the availability and prevalence of fraudulent Eritrean identity documents, negatively affects the reliability of the birth certificate provided by the claimant at this hearing and gives rise to concerns regarding the genuineness of the birth certificate such that I find it to be unreliable and I give it little weight as it pertains to establishing the claimant's identity.\nDriver's license\n[12] The claimant provided his Eritrean driver's license along with a translation of that license.10 The claimant initially testified that when Eritrean authorities detained him they took his identity card and other documents, and later testified that they took everything. Only when specifically asked about his driver's license did the claimant testify that it was not taken by authorities as it was in his uniform which was in his car at the time. This inconsistency, the authorities taking everything compared to them taking everything except for his driver's license, raises a concern regarding the claimant's credibility. The claimant indicated in his PIF that other than his birth certificate he did not know what other identity documents he had or could obtain.11 This is notable given the claimant's testimony that his driver's license was one of the only identity documents that was not taken by Eritrean authorities when he was detained. The claimant completed his PIF several months after he left Eritrea, and after going to significant lengths to obtain identity documents, including paying $14,000 to a smuggler to obtain a non-genuine passport. The claimant had professional counsel when he completed his PIF. It is reasonable to expect that one of the only identity documents not taken by Eritrean authorities would be readily noted by the claimant, even if he was unsure about what additional documents might be available. That the claimant did not identity that document in his PIF, which specifically asks about such documents, raises a concern regarding the claimant's credibility.12\n[13] In reviewing the driver's license I note that it lists the claimant's name, date of birth, nationality, and a picture. However, the driver's license was issued by the Department of Land Transport to indicate the approval to drive motor vehicles, and not as a document with the primary purpose of identification, such as the Eritrean national ID card, nor was the driver's license issued for use as an international travel document, as is the case with an Eritrean passport. The claimant was asked about the process to obtain his driver's license. The claimant testified that he had to complete a verbal and a road test. This is consistent with available information about the process in the NDP.13 However there is no clear indication in the claimant's testimony or the NDP documentation on the license issuance process regarding any documentation or verification of identity or nationality required to obtain such a document, such as those required to obtain a national ID card, passport, or birth certificate, which require approval from local administration and the Immigration Office, as well as birth records and information from the claimant's parents. According to information provided by an official from the Eritrean Consulate in Toronto in 2014, driving licenses are renewed each year.14 The driver's license attached to the Response to Information Request in the NDP also states that the validity of the driver's license is one year and may be renewed by one year eight times.15 The claimant's driver's license indicates that it had a validity period of two years, and was renewed for an additional two year period. The physical appearance of the claimant's driver's license reveals it has little in the way of security features other than a signature and stamps which are not entirely clear. The information in the driver's license is handwritten. The claimant's picture in the license appears to be a hand-cut photograph that is not squarely cut and it is simply pasted onto the document. For all of these reasons I give little weight to the driver's license as it pertains to establishing the claimant's identity.\nWife's ID card\n[14] The claimant provided a copy of his wife's Eritrean national ID card.16 The claimant testified that they are common-law spouses and have no registration of marriage. The claimant provided no documentary evidence regarding the birth of his two children with his common-law spouse. While they are not expected data elements on Eritrean ID cards, I note that this card does not identify the claimant in any way nor does it indicate that the woman named on the card is married\/common-law or has children. The claimant provided an envelope that appears to have been sent to the claimant by the woman named on this ID card.17 The claimant provided no documentary evidence indicating that he and his spouse have ever lived together. The claimant did not call his wife as a witness at this proceeding, nor did he provide any letter of affidavit from his wife regarding their relationship or the claimant's identity. For all of these reasons I give little weight to this third party's ID card as it pertains to establishing the identity of the claimant.\nIdentity witness\n[15] The claimant provided a \"witness statement\" regarding \"identity testimony\" that was to take about 10 minutes.18 The statement is from an Eritrean citizen living in Canada who knows the claimant from Eritrea. This information covers much of the requirements of the Division's Rules regarding the provision of witness information when a party wants to call a witness.19 However, on the day of the hearing the identity witness did not appear. The claimant testified that he had asked this person to be a witness approximately one month before this hearing, and the witness was aware of the date and location of this hearing. This hearing was scheduled to begin at 8:45am. I provided the claimant some additional time to see if the witness was possibly running a little late, however by 10:00am the witness had still not appeared. A recess was taken and the claimant was given an opportunity to contact the witness by phone. The claimant's efforts were unsuccessful as they went only to the witness' voicemail. The claimant advised me that the witness' job was such that he is not stationed in one place, but that he goes across Canada. No indication was given in advance that the claimant intended to have this witness testify by telephone, nor was any request made for a summons if the witness' work, or anything else, was an impediment to him appearing as a witness.\n[16] Despite the identity witness' unexpected absence from this hearing I have nonetheless reviewed the information he provided. The witness indicates that he was a XXXX XXXX XXXX in Eritrea and he knew the claimant as a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The letter is not entirely clear regarding how exactly the witness came to know the claimant's citizenship, given their relationship appears to have originated when the claimant saw the witness \"most weeks when there was a (XXXX) game\" and they would socialize at unspecified other times.\n[17] The identity witness provided a signature on his solemn affirmation.20 The identity witness also provided a copy of his Ontario driver's license which also contains a signature.21 In comparing these two signatures I note that they bear almost no resemblance to one another. Given all of the above mentioned concerns, along with the fact that I was unable to test the evidence from the identity witness by questioning him about the information in his affidavit, I give little weight to this document as it pertains to establishing the claimant's identity.\nPhotographs\n[18] The claimant provided four photographs titled \"Family photos\".22 Presumably, given the other evidence before me, the photographs are of the claimant's common-law spouse and their children. No specific information about the photographs was provided. The photographs do not identify who took the photographs, who is in all of the photographs, when and where they were taken, or the reason they were taken. I give little weight to these photographs as they pertain to establishing the claimant's identity.\nSchool certificate\n[19] The claimant provided a secondary school certificate indicating that in 1996 the claimant took six subjects and earned grades in two of them.23 While the certificate includes the claimant's name and photograph, it does not contain a date of birth or statement of nationality. The certificate contains little in the way of security features other than stamps and a signature from the Director, though the director's name is not printed anywhere on the document. Contrary to this Division's Rules, the claimant did not provide the original of this certificate, and this precluded a closer examination of the document itself.24 No explanation was given for the absence of the original document, and it was not named as one that was taken by authorities, nor was any explanation given for why a copy of such a document was maintained in the absence of the original. I give little weight to this school certificate as it pertains to establishing the claimant's identity.\nNon-genuine passport\n[20] The claimant alleges that he used a non-genuine passport in order to travel to Canada, and that he obtained that passport through an agent who was paid a total of approximately US$14,000. The claimant testified that he does not know the country the passport belonged to, and that he did not look at the cover or the inside of the passport. The claimant testified that the agent, who accompanied the claimant to Canada, only permitted the claimant to physically handle the passport briefly when going though immigration checkpoints. While the claimant testified that he did not look inside the passport, he testified that the passport did not contain his name or a photograph of him. The claimant further testified that he does not know what country the passport belonged to nor does he know what name was actually contained in the passport. It is not clear how the claimant knows that his name and photo are not in the passport given his testimony that he had not looked inside the passport.\n[21] The claimant alleged that he was able to exit Sudan, transit through XXXX, transit through XXXX, and gain entry to Canada, by using a non-genuine passport that he himself handed to immigration authorities. The claimant testified that at no point did he ever talk to or communicate with any immigration authorities that he dealt with on this multi-country trip to Canada. It is implausible that the claimant would be able to successfully exit Sudan, transit through XXXX, transit through XXXX, and then gain entry to Canada, using a passport which he would present to immigration authorities, without speaking or communicating with a single immigration authority in any of those countries. It is reasonable for immigration authorities to ask at least one or two basic questions when a traveller, such as the claimant, presents them with a passport and seeks entry to their country, particularly in Canada which has a well-developed customs and immigration system and set of laws and professional authorities to interact with those who seek to enter the country.\n[22] The claimant was asked at this hearing what he planned to say regarding information such as his name or nationality if he was questioned by any immigration authorities on his trip from Sudan to Canada. The claimant testified that he would tell them his true name, and not the name in the passport that he was using. The claimant further testified that immigration authorities would likely have detained him if he did so. It is inherently implausible that the claimant would not have taken even basic and cursory steps of looking inside the passport he was using or familiarizing himself with the name in the passport, or the country which issued the passport. Even if the claimant had only a very short period of time to examine the passport after being handed the document by his agent, and before giving it to immigration authorities, it does not take any significant amount of time to direct one's eyes to the cover a passport which almost always indicates a country name in one or more languages, often with symbols or images of the flag of the country, or to simply open the passport and look at the name inside the document. This is especially so given the claimant's alleged situation of paying a large amount of money for such a document in order to get out of Sudan, travel through Egypt and France, and get to Canada.\n[23] Knowing that detention could be a likely result of the claimant not knowing \"his\" name and country of citizenship based on the passport he was using, it is reasonable to expect the claimant to have made a greater effort to familiarize himself with the most basic of information necessary to answer potential questions from immigration authorities about his name and citizenship, whether those questions might have come upon exiting Sudan, or upon transiting through XXXX and XXXX, any of which would've curtailed the claimant's, and his agent's, plan of travelling to Canada. Given that the agent was travelling with the claimant it is reasonable that it would also be in the agent's interest to ensure that the claimant would be at least minimally prepared for the most basic questions that would be expected from immigration authorities when travelling through multiple countries, such as the passport's name and citizenship. The agent could also face serious and negative ramifications if the claimant, upon being caught en route using a passport that was non-genuine and\/or not properly issued to the claimant, honestly answered questions from authorities regarding the source of the passport.\n[24] It is not unexpected for a refugee claimant to obtain non-genuine documents in order to travel to a place of safety and make a refugee claim, and no negative inference is drawn from the claimant's actions in that respect. It is the claimant's implausible ignorance of basic information that was both readily available to him, and to his benefit to become with familiar with, and the implausibility of being able to travel through multiple countries without speaking to a single immigration authority, that leads me to draw a negative inference regarding the claimant's credibility and the credibility of his allegations regarding his identity documentation and his travel to Canada.\nWitnesses, letters, affidavits from family members\n[25] The claimant did not call any of his family members as witnesses at this hearing. Nor did the claimant provide any affidavits or letters from his family members at this hearing. The claimant was well aware that he had no passport and no national identity card, and was apparently aware that his identity was an issue given his attempt at calling a friend in Canada as an identity witness at this hearing. The claimant has been in contact with his family in Eritrea since he has been to Canada, and they have apparently been able to send documentation to him. The claimant also has other family outside of Eritrea, including in Saudi Arabia, where he has a family member who previously assisted him after he left Eritrea. The claimant testified that other than his ID documents which were seized by authorities in Eritrea, there were no other documents or evidence that he wanted for use at this hearing but which he was unable to obtain. Testimony or written evidence from the claimants' family members would have potentially been helpful in establishing the claimant's identity, particularly as they would be much closer to the claimant than an associate in Canada who the claimant knew for only a relatively brief time and hadn't seen in approximately a decade, and the claimant has provided no reason for the absence of such evidence from his family members. This raises concerns regarding the claimant's credibility given the lack of acceptable documentation establishing his identity.25\nSUMMARY\n[26] I have identified several concerns regarding the documentation provided by the claimant in support of his identity and there is reason to doubt the credibility, reliability, and genuineness of documents provided by the claimant. When considering together all of the evidence before me I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant has failed to establish his identity.\nCONCLUSION\n[27] Owing to concerns regarding the insufficiency of trustworthy and reliable evidence of the claimant's identity, the claimant has failed to establish on a balance of probabilities his identity. The claimant has, therefore, not satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground under section 96, or that, on a balance of probabilities, he would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or to a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\nDECISION\n[28] I conclude that the claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX, is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, and I therefore reject his claim.\n(signed)\n\"J.

The associated claimant (hereinafter referred to as the claimant) testified that she had consulted Chinese authorities and had been told that the minor claimants would have Chinese nationality if they were to return to China. The panel further notes that country document evidence indicates that \"[a]ny person born abroad whose parents are both Chinese nationals or one of whose parents is a Chines National shall have Chinese nationality.\"1\n[3] The panel notes that no claim has been made against Trinidad and Tabago on behalf of the minor claimants and as citizens they could return to Trinidad and Tabago without apparent risks pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the IRPA. They are therefore not eligible for refugee protection in Canada. The panel acknowledges, however, that the minor claimants are central to the claims of their parents, the adult claimants, as to their ability to return to China without the risks alleged in their claims.\n[4] The principal claimant was appointed the designated representative of his children, the minor claimants.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] The panel finds that the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\nALLEGATIONS\n[6] The associated claimant (hereinafter referred to as the claimant) alleged in her Personal Information Form narrative (PIF) that she and her husband, the principal claimant, violated China's family planning policy by having two children. She further alleged that if she were to return to China, one of them would be forcibly sterilized.\n[7] In XXXX 2006, they moved to Trinidad and Tabago and their two children were born in that country.\n[8] In XXXX 2012, the principal claimant's work permit expired and he was unable to extend it because his employer went bankrupt.\n[9] The claimant stated that she visited China in XXXX 2012, and she was told by a local official that her children would have Chinese nationality if they returned to China permanently. She was further told that they would be heavily fined. She was told as well that she would be required to wear an IUD and have regular IUD checkups. In addition, if she became pregnant again, either she or his husband would be forcibly sterilized.\n[10] As a result, they contacted a smuggler who helped them travel to the United States and subsequently to Canada. They arrived on November 10, 2012, and made their claims for refugee protection on November 15, 2012.\nANALYSIS\n[11] The determinative issue in these claims is the credibility of the claimant's allegations as to her risk of persecution if she were to return to China.\nIdentity\n[12] The panel is satisfied that XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX are nationals of China. They have disclosed sufficient corroborative evidence including PRC passports, the hukou registers and resident identity cards.\nCredibility\n[13] The panel notes that the claimant submitted her PIF on December 18, 2012, and made no amendment to her narrative before the 2017 hearing. The claimant responded in the hearing to the panel's statements concerning the 2016 changes to China's family planning law.\n[14] The claimant explained in the hearing that she did not want to return to China because she would not be able to have a third child. She further testified that if they returned to China, she would be sterilized and required to wear an IUD.\n[15] The panel noted the change in China's family planning policy to allow two children and as they had only two children there was no basis for fearing forced sterilization.\nIUD\n[16] The claimant responded that she would still be required to wear an IUD. The panel noted that Article 19 of the Population and Family Planning Law of the People's Republic of China indicates that the state will create conditions to ensure individual citizens knowingly choose safe, effective and appropriate contraceptive methods.2 The panel finds that this indicates that a citizen has a choice as to what contraceptive method he\/she uses. While it is clear that the IUD is the preferred method, the panel finds there is no evidence that the IUD will be the only contraceptive method used. The panel further finds that there is no legal basis in China for the state to force a woman to wear an IUD. The panel also notes in this regard that Article 30 of family planning regulations in Guangdong Province, the claimants' home province, reiterates this statement.\n[17] The panel cites the decision of the Federal Court in Zheng,3 in which the determinative issue was whether the Board erred in law in finding the forced use of an IUD does not constitute persecution because it arises from a law of general application. The Court found that this was an over-simplification of the applicable legal principles and was an error in law. The Court further found the issue concerned the means by which the state's objectives are achieved. In this regard, the Court stated that the more coercive or physically intrusive the approach the more likely the state's conduct will be seen as persecutory. The Court concluded that it is left unresolved whether there were alternative administrative options available to the applicant \"short of a direct physical assault on her reproductive integrity.\"4 The Court noted in this regard that there is country condition evidence in the record dealing with that issue but the Board did not consider it after finding the applicant's allegation that she would be forced to submit to sterilization was not credible.\n[18] The panel notes that Zheng clearly indicates that it is the forced insertion of an IUD that was found to be persecutory. In addition, Zheng notes country document evidence concerning alternative contraceptive methods that were not cited by the Board and the Court clearly implies that these might not be considered persecutory. The decision in Zheng indicates it is not the state's family planning policy that is challenged but rather the \"means by which the state's objectives are achieved.\"5\n[19] The panel finds that alternative contraceptive methods would be available to the claimants if they were to return to China, that they cannot be described as \"a direct physical assault\" on the claimant's reproductive integrity and, on a balance of probabilities, there would be no risk of being forced to wear an IUD.\nSterilization\n[20] The panel noted that whether or not the claimants had a third child is speculative at this time. The panel noted as well that the claimant has had a miscarriage while in Canada reflecting a desire for more children. The panel finds, however, that the claimants have not broken any law in China according to the two-child policy, and they are able to return to China without the risk of any family planning punishment, including sterilization.\n[21] The panel asked the claimant whether there were any other reasons she feared return to China other than her opposition to wearing an IUD and her fear of forced sterilization because she had two children. The claimant responded that they were planning to have a third child and she noted her 2012 exchange with a family planning official in Guangzhou indicating she or her husband would be at risk of sterilization.\n[22] The principal claimant testified that they did not know the policy now but they planned to have two more children.\n[23] The panel finds, as noted above, that if the claimants were to return to China with their two children, they would not be at risk of forced sterilization as they would not have broken the two-child law.\nGuangdong Province\n[24] The panel noted in the hearing that the claimants' home city was Guangzhou in Guangdong Province and further noted that Article 53 of Guangdong family planning regulations indicates that the penalty for an out of plan birth is a fine and that the fine increases for any additional out of plan births.6\n[25] The panel acknowledges that there have been forced abortions and sterilizations in Guangdong Province but notes that there is no evidence available to the panel that such practices have occurred since 2012. The panel notes in this regard a 2012 directive issued by the National Population and Planning Commission of China banning the \"enforcement of family planning policy carried out in a brutal way.\"7\n[26] The panel acknowledges that family planning policies are unevenly enforced in China and in some instances local officials forced women to have abortions and sterilizations. The panel notes, however, the wide variation in provincial practices and further notes there is no evidence that such actions occurred in Guangdong Province and in particular in Guangzhou City since 2012.\n[27] The panel cites country document evidence which indicates that historically, Guangdong authorities have taken a more relaxed approach to family planning. In 2011, the director of Guangdong's Population and family Planning Commission stated he had applied for \"approval to be the leader in the country in the relaxation of the family- planning policy.\"8\n[28] The panel notes that Guangzhou City, the claimants' home city, is the capital of Guangdong Province and the province's largest city. The panel finds, in the context of Guangdong's historical flexibility in regard to the implementation of family planning regulations, and the indication in these regulations that a fine is charged for having an out-of-plan child, that it is likely that officials in Guangzhou City would follow the 2012 directive as to the use of force in implementing family planning policy. As noted above, there is no evidence of any forced abortions or sterilizations since 2012.\n[29] The panel cites the 2015 decision of the Federal Court in Yu,9 in which the Court noted the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) recognized that although forced sterilization and forced abortion are illegal in China, such practices still occur. The Court further noted the RPD relied on evidence of conditions in the applicant's province of Guangdong and found sufficient safeguards against these forced measures. The Count noted as well that evidence shows that Chinese citizens may be required to pay a monetary fine. The Court also noted the jurisprudence of this Court which has held that such fines do not amount to persecution.\n[30] The panel further cites the decision of the Federal Court in Liang,10 in which the Court reviewed Guangdong family planning documentation and noted the regulations indicate that a fine is charged for an out-of-plan birth and the fine is multiplied by the total of out-of-plan children. The Court further noted the variation in family planning policy in China and found there was insufficient evidence to establish that the applicants would face forced sterilization in Guangdong and dismissed the appeal.\nBirth control in China and the initiation of the Two-Child policy in 2016\n[31] Counsel questioned the claimant as to whether she was willing to use any form of birth control and she said no. The claimant further testified that she was opposed to any physical examination as to whether she was pregnant. She testified as well that she was opposed to any state regulation in this regard.\n[32] Counsel stated in her submissions that whether or not the minor claimants would be registered in the family hukou was not the central issue. Rather there was no evidence to support a finding that the new two-child policy would allow the claimants to have more than two children. Counsel further stated that there was no certainty as to the enforcement of continuing constraints on child bearing and noted that coercive practices still took place in China and provinces had substantial discretion in this regard.\n[33] The panel finds that the claimants were credible as to their desire for more children and their opposition to any constraint on their ability to do so. The panel acknowledges that the claimant submitted her PIF in 2012 and therefore it could not have taken into consideration the 2016 changes in China's family planning policy.\n[34] The panel has made findings above concerning the claimants' fear of forced sterilization if they were to return to China and the claimant's opposition to wearing an IUD. The panel found in this regard that the claimant would not be required to wear an IUD and there was no risk of a forced sterilization if they were to return to China.\n[35] As to the claimant's opposition to a pregnancy examination, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that if the claimant did not wear an IUD and used another form of contraception, any pregnancy test would not be physically intrusive and therefore not persecutory.\n[36] As to the claimant's opposition to any state constraint on her ability to have more children, the panel notes its citation above of the Federal Court decision in Zheng in which the Court stated the issue concerned the means by which the state's objectives are achieved and further stated the more coercive or physically intrusive the approach the more likely the state's conduct will be seen as persecutory. In this regard, the Court noted there was country document evidence that indicated alternative administrative options might be available. The panel found they were available.\n[37] The panel notes the Zheng decision makes no negative finding as to the existence of the family planning policy in China. Rather it rejects the RPD's finding that the requirement to wear an IUD is not persecutory.\n[38] The panel finds, in the context of the Zheng decision, and as well in the context of other Federal Court decisions cited above dismissing appeals of negative decisions in regard to family planning in China, that family planning law in China is a law of general application and is not in itself, persecutory.\nTwo-Child policy\n[39] The panel cites country document evidence concerning the implementation of the two-child policy.11 This document cites a professor with the Institute of Population and Labour Economics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. According to the professor \"all children born should be registered, no matter if they are second or third or higher births, prior to or after the new regulations.\" This document further states that Guangdong Province has officially delinked fines and hukou registration for those born outside the rules, although a fine must be paid eventually.\n[40] The panel disclosed a Globe and Mail article12 titled End of China's one-child policy is slowly giving \"ghost children\" identities. The article indicates that Chinese citizens with \"ghost children\" are now being allowed to obtain legal status for their children and to do so without paying fines. The article further notes that some areas of China have registered both second and third-born children. In the city of Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, it is noted that the new era began in January 2016, ahead of school enrolment season, according to local media. It is also noted that parents are seeing signs that the once-formidable family planning regime is collapsing.\n[41] The panel finds, in the context of its analysis of Guangdong Province's family planning regulations, its practices in this regard since 2012 and its apparent practices since the implementation of the two-child policy that the claimants will not be at risk of persecution if they were to return to China with their two children. The panel further finds that if the claimants were to have an additional child after their return to China, the penalty would be a fine which Federal Court jurisprudence has found not to be persecutory.\nCONCLUSION\n[42] The panel finds that if the claimants were to return to China there is less than a mere possibility that they would be at risk of persecution and, on a balance of probabilities, they would not be in need of protection pursuant to subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\n[43] The panel therefore finds that the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. The claims are dismissed.\n(signed)\n\"Milton Israel\"\nMilton Israel\nOctober 26, 2017\nDate\n1 Exhibit 6, National Documentation Package (NDP) for China (July 20, 2017), item 3.29, section 1.5.\n2 Exhibit 6, National Documentation Package (NDP) for China (July 20, 2017), item 5.2.\n3 Zheng, Jin Xia v.

The hearing was adjourned as there was insufficient time. Counsel requested an audit of the interpretation at the hearing. An audit was carried out, and the Member who heard the claim on September 14, 2017, came to the conclusion that the interpretation had not been up to standard. A de novo hearing was then ordered.\n[4] At the de novo hearing, counsel for the claimant argued that the panel should recuse itself, as it had been tainted by hearing the testimony at the first hearing. That application was dismissed at the hearing, and oral reasons were provided at the hearing and will not be repeated here.\n[5] The panel has taken into consideration the written submissions of counsel in reaching this decision. In those submissions, counsel raised the issue of the application for recusal of the presiding member which counsel made at the resumed hearing. The panel was functus officio on the issue of whether he should recuse himself. The panel found that there was no evidence of an apprehension of bias, seen objectively from a third person's point of view, nor was there any evidence that the claimant would not receive a fair hearing.1 The application was dismissed on the record at the hearing.\nALLEGATIONS\n[6] The claimant claims she is a Falun Gong practitioner.\n[7] She started to practice in September 2013 with her friend.\n[8] In XXXX 2013, she learned from her parents that members of the neighborhood committee visited her home and told her parents that there were rumours that the claimant was practising Falun Gong. The claimant admitted this to her parents.\n[9] Her parents then found an agent who assisted the claimant to come to Canada where she made her refugee claim.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[10] The claimant's identity is established on a balance of probabilities standard by a certified true copy of her Resident ID card.2\nCredibility\n[11] The main issue in this case was credibility.\nLack of knowledge of where she has been studying English\n[12] The claimant has been in Canada since December 31st 2014, which was almost 3 years at the time of the hearing. She was asked what she has been doing here, which goes to the root of her sur place claim. She said, amongst other things, that she had been studying English. She started studying in XXXX 2015. Initially, she attended 5 days per week. Later, she only went two days a week. She was asked the name of the school where she studied. She could not remember. She said that she did not pay attention to the name of the school. All that she remembered was that it is in the East end.\n[13] The panel does not believe the claimant. She is an intelligent young woman who has been studying English up to 5 days a week at an institution which she claims she cannot remember the name of.\n[14] As a result, the panel draws a negative credibility inference. The claimant has failed to provide evidence of her study of English, which is one of the reasons she came to Canada.\nNo Proof of her journey to Canada\n[15] The claimant was asked if she had any proof of her journey to Canada, whether a passport, itinerary, ticket, or boarding pass. She had none. She claims that they were all given to the smuggler.\n[16] These missing travel documents serve a crucial purpose in this claim. They are evidence of when she came to Canada, where she came from, and they also serve a secondary identity purpose. The issue of when she left China to come to Canada is important, because if she delayed her trip after suffering persecution, this can weigh against her claim, as it negates subjective fear. The issue of where she came from is important, because she needs to show that she left the country of persecution. If this fact is missing, there is no way to know where the claimant came from. She could have been living in a 3rd country where she was not persecuted, and where she could have made a prior refugee claim. This issue of whether the claimant could have made a refugee application in a 3rd prior country is central to the refugee determination exercise. Thirdly, although she has proved her identity, these documents are proof that the claimant did in fact escape. They tie her identity to her escape, and are further evidence that she had subjective fear, and that she is who he claims to be. Proof of flight or escape is again a central question to the refugee determination process.\n[17] In Elazi,3 Mr. Justice Nadon, sitting at the time with the Federal Court, emphasized the importance of travel documents and tickets used to travel to Canada:\nI take this opportunity to add that it is entirely reasonable for the Refugee Division to attach great importance to a claimant's passport and his air ticket. In my opinion, these documents are essential to establish the claimant's identity and his journey to come to Canada. Unless it can be assumed that a refugee status claimant is actually a refugee, it seems unreasonable to me to ignore the loss of these documents without a valid explanation. In my view, it is too easy for a claimant to simply state that he has lost these documents or the facilitator has taken them. If the Refugee Division insists on these documents being produced, the facilitators may have to change their methods.\nMinimizing the importance of the passport and air ticket as documents to be produced or ignoring their non-submission for all sorts of reasons in my opinion only serves to encourage all those whose only purpose is to take advantage of a system which is intended solely to enable genuine refugees to come to Canada.4\n[18] In Kaur,5 Mr. Justice Shore interpreted Elazi as follows:\n... [Elazi] signifies that the Board is warranted in drawing a negative inference if the claimant does not present any of the travel documents which would assist in confirming the travel itinerary of the claimant.\n[19] The Federal Court has applied Elazi in numerous similar cases,6 and has upheld negative inferences drawn by members of this division from claimants' failure to provide evidence of their travel to Canada.\n[20] The Federal Court has ruled in Joseph that a non-credible account of traveling to Canada can negatively affect a person's allegations as to their presence in, and departure from, their alleged country of nationality.7\n[21] The claimant alleges that the smuggler kept the passport and she retained no evidence of this journey, such as boarding passes, an itinerary or a ticket. The panel rejects this explanation for the reasons given above. As a result, the panel draws a negative credibility inference.\nUse of fraudulent documents to obtain a visa, at a time she was not wanted by the PSB\n[22] The claimant was asked whether the smuggler provided fraudulent documents to the Canadian authorities in support of her Canadian visa application. The claimant said she did not know, as it was handled by her parents, but that she thought that all documents provided by the smuggler were fake.\n[23] The claimant was then asked how she knew that the documents were fraudulent. The claimant then said that after she landed in Toronto, the smuggler gave her the documents. She then looked at the name of her parents stated in the documents, and she could see that they were not the name of her real parents.\n[24] In her BOC, the claimant said that her parents hired a smuggler to assist her in applying for her American visa first, three times. All three times the application was rejected. She stated that \"It is my understanding that the application was based on false information.\" 8\n[25] She then stated that the same agent suggested to her parents that she go to Canada, and that the agent then helped her apply for a student visa to Canada.\n[26] The panel does not accept the claimant's story that it was not until she landed in Toronto that she knew that her Canadian student visa was based on fraudulent documents. When the application was made, the claimant was living with her parents in China. She knew that the previous three applications to the US all involved fraudulent documents. Yet she claims she did not know whether fraudulent documents were used to come to Canada.\n[27] Furthermore, she also gave inconsistent evidence. At first, she said she did not know whether fraudulent documents were used. But later, she changed her evidence and said that she did know after she arrived in Toronto. She had also indicted in her forms that the Canadian visa was not genuine, which contradicts her testimony that she did not know for sure.\n[28] The panel rejects the claimant's testimony and finds that she did know that false documents were used in China to help her obtain her Canadian student visa. But even if that is wrong, and she did not know, the panel would impute the acts and knowledge of her parents to the claimant, on the basis that she must bear the consequences of her parents' actions, unless they were in some way harming her and causing her to flee, which is not the case here.\n[29] The panel finds that the claimant applied for a Canadian visa, using fraudulent documents, at a time that she was not wanted by the PSB in China. She had no justifiable reason for using fraud to get a visa to Canada. She was not escaping from persecution or harm at the time, and there is no reason why her or her parents could not use the legitimate channels.\n[30] As a result, the panel draws a negative credibility inference.\nNo proof of Falun Gong activities in China\n[31] The claimant was asked about her practice of Falun Gong in China. She claims that a friend introduced her. She was asked whether she had any documents from the friend to back up her story, but she said that she did not. She was asked why, and she said she is now in Canada, and because Falun Gong is prohibited in China, she fears giving her friend trouble.\n[32] The panel asked the claimant whether she tried to contact her friend, and she said that she did not. She said that she did not want her to be troubled. She was then asked why she would get a letter from her parents, but not from her friend. She said that her mother had to write secretly to support her claim.\n[33] The panel does not accept the reasons given by the claimant. There was no evidence that the claimant's friend in China was in any way at risk. It makes no sense that the claimant could get a letter from her parents, but not from her friend. She did not try to get such a letter in any event. As a result, the panel draws a negative credibility inference for failure to obtain documentary proof of her claim in China.\n[34] There is a letter of April 1, 2015 from XXXX XXXX, the claimant's mother and her father, XXXX XXXX. The letter states that the writers did not know that the claimant was practising Falun Gong until XXXX 2013, when the Neighborhood Committee approached them, and when the claimant admitted she was a practitioner to her parents. As a result, the parent's knowledge of the claimant's practice is simply based on what the claimant told them. The parents had no original knowledge of the claimant's practice, other than what the claimant told them.\n[35] The parents have given no details of what the neighborhood committee said to them.\n[36] The panel finds that their letter does not advance the claimant's case that she is a genuine Falun Gong practitioner in China. Other than her testimony, there was no evidence about her practice of Falun Gong in China.\n[37] As a result, the panel finds that the claimant was not a genuine Falun Gong practitioner in China.\nSur place claim and other evidence\n[38] As to the sur place claim of the claimant, she was asked whether the authorities would know about her activities here in Canada, and she said that they would not. The claimant stated clearly in her BOC that she only practised Falun Gong privately at home. The Public Security Bureau never came after her, although she claims the Neighborhood Committee made some inquiries after her.\n[39] The claimant produced a photo or a large group photo, celebrating XXXX XXXX birthday. There is no on way to clearly identity the claimant in the photo, as the faces of the many people in the phots appear so small. She produced some photos of her at Queen's Park doing some of the exercises. There is also a photo of her at some study group. These photos are at Exhibit 4.\n[40] At Exhibit 6 and 8, are two letters from practitioners. One is dated March 20, 2015, from XXXX XXXX XXXX. It does not say anything about the claimant's practice of Falun Gong after March 20, 2015, and is therefore of little assistance.\n[41] There is also a letter dated September 8, 2017 from one XXXX XXXX XXXX. Ms. XXXX claims she met the claimant on XXXX XXXX, 2016. She claims that that have been practising together since XXXX XXXX, 2016. No photos are provided. The letter is short with few details. It does not cover the period from March 20, 2015 (the date of the first letter), to the date when M. XXXX met the claimant on XXXX XXXX, 2016, almost one year. There is no evidence of the claimant's Falun Gong activities in Canada for that year. Nor did the writer come to give evidence, despite the fact that she lives in Mississauga. There is no basis for saying that the claimant is a genuine Falun Gong practitioner in the letter. Nor is any reason given as to why the writer can assess the claimant as a true Falun Gong practitioner. As a result, the letter is given no weight.\n[42] The claimant also provided two photos of herself practising Falun Gong. The photos are not translated, and so the panel gives no weight to them. Counsel provided the photos again in his submissions. Although one photo shows the claimant carrying a sign, the sign is in Chinese and has not been translated, and so there is no way to know what activity is being depicted. Although counsel labelled the pictures in his closing submissions as having been taken in 2015, there was no evidence led as to this at the hearing. Counsel cannot provide new evidence in his submissions, but may only rely on what was said at the hearing about the photos. Looking at the pictures as a whole, they do not show the claimant engaging in Falun Gong activities after May 2015, more than two years before the hearing.\n[43] There is also photos of the claimant at Exhibit 7, showing the claimant doing Falun Gong exercises outside of City Hall. The photo does not show the claimant involved in the activities of the day. She is sitting off by herself, and it appears that the photo was snapped by a bystander, showing his shadow.\n[44] The panel has considered these two letters, and the photos. This evidence simply does not show that the claimant has been involved in the practice of Falun Gong on a sustained basis in Canada over the last 3 years. The claimant has failed to satisfy the panel, on a balance of probabilities standard, that she is a genuine Falun Gong practitioner in Canada.\n[45] As a result, the panel finds that the claimant is not a genuine Falun Gong practitioner, whether in China or in Canada. Further, there is no evidence that her activities in Canada would or have come to the attention of the authorities in China, and as a result, her sur place claim fails.\nCONCLUSION\n[46] The claimant's s. 96 claim fails because there are credibility concerns about the evidence which has been presented in this claim. When the evidence is considered as a whole, the panel finds that the claimant has not discharged the legal burden on her of showing that she would face a serious possibility of persecution if she was returned to China.\n[47] Because of the credibility concerns, which have failed the legal test required for a s. 96 claim, the panel also finds that the claimant's case fails on the higher standard of proof of a balance of probabilities required for a s. 97 claim, as a result of which it is dismissed. The panel also finds that the claimant would not be tortured if she was returned to China.\n[48] As a result, the claimant's claim is dismissed.\n[49] Because there has been evidence of fraud in applying to Canada for a visa with fraudulent documents, at a time when the claimant did not face a serious possibility of persecution, the panel also finds that the claim is a manifestly unfounded claim pursuant to s. 107.1 of the IRPA.\n(signed)\n\"J.

He seeks refugee protection against Palestine, Gaza pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nAllegations\n[2] This claim was based on the following allegations. The claimant was born in Kuwait in 1984. In 1992, the claimant's family moved to Iraq. In 1995, the claimant and his family moved to Gaza where they faced persecution caused by the Israeli conflict with Gaza. Life in Gaza included limitations on electricity, gas, and food. Unemployment was high and there was a constant threat of being affected by war or violence. In 2009, the claimant fled to Malaysia where he sought the protection of the UNHCR. In XXXX 2011, the claimant returned to Gaza. He applied for and obtained Egyptian citizenship when Egyptian law changed to allow citizenship to Palestinians with Egyptian mothers. In 2015, when travelling to the West Bank, the claimant was detained and interrogated by the Israeli army regarding rockets that had been planted near his house in Gaza. Fearing retaliation from either Israel or Hamas, the claimant fled to Egypt in late 2015. In XXXX 2015, the claimant then went to Hungary for school until XXXX 2016. The claimant then went to the United States and then arrived in Canada on April 16, 2016. The claimant signed his BOC on April 27, 2016.\n[3] The Minister served a Notice of Intent to Intervene but provided no evidence, allegations, or follow-up of any kind.\nDetermination\n[4] For the following reasons, the panel finds that the claimant is a citizen of Egypt, and Egypt is the proper country of reference for this claim. Whereas the claimant made no allegations of harm or persecution in Egypt, this claim is dismissed.\nCountry of Reference\n[5] The claimant has Egyptian citizenship. The claimant presented two documents to support this allegation. The claimant had a citizenship certificate, issued in 2015 by the government of Egypt, which confirms that the claimant obtained Egyptian citizenship in 2012.1 The claimant also produced a letter from the Egyptian consulate in Montreal dated March 10, 2017.2 This letter also confirms that the claimant acquired Egyptian nationality in 2012.\n[6] The claimant explained that his Egyptian citizenship was only nominal. He could still not obtain an Egyptian passport, nor an Egyptian national identity card, and without those documents, he could not effectively exercise his rights of nationality in Egypt. The claimant explained that he could not obtain these documents because he could not obtain a more recent copy of his Kuwaiti birth certificate, which was necessary to obtain the Egyptian national documents.\n[7] The claimant's testimony on this issue was as follows. When asked if he could go back to Egypt now, the claimant explained that he would be detained at Cairo and deported to Gaza. He explained that when he was trying to travel to Hungary, he was detained and escorted directly to the airport because his national citizenship certificate was not sufficient proof. He needed a special letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to travel to Hungary, which he did have. He explained that he has the citizenship certificate, but it does not mean full citizenship. He was still in the process of completing the application. He explained that the citizenship certificate he did receive was only like a pre-approval.\n[8] The claimant explained that his birth certificate was an old Kuwaiti birth certificate from 1984 and the Egyptian government asked him to obtain a new one. The claimant contacted an aunt in Kuwait. The Kuwaiti government required the passport for the claimant's mother, but she had passed away in 1985, so that was impossible. The claimant did not understand why Kuwait required his mother's passport. When the panel asked if the claimant went to the Kuwaiti embassy here in Canada, he replied that he did not because he stopped thinking about that application. He said the only contact he had with the Kuwaiti government was through his aunt in Kuwait.\n[9] The Egyptian embassy in Canada said they would not issue a document confirming he had no national identity card or passport. The claimant had nothing in writing from the Egyptian government to explain the complications with his status or to outline specifically the documents he still required to obtain a passport and national identity card.\n[10] When the Minister intervened, it served forms for the claimant to consent to the release of his personal information from the Egyptian and Hungarian governments. The claimant provided his consent, and those consents were provided to this panel. The Minister has not filed any further documents or taken any further step in this proceeding.\nThe Legal Issues\n[11] The Federal Court of Appeal decision in Tretsetsang v. Canada3 is, in this panel's view, the applicable legal authority. Tretsetsang addresses the situation of refugee claimants who have citizenship status as a matter of law, but may face impediments in having that status recognized, such as the claimant is alleging in the current case. Tretsetsang established the following guiding principles:\n[12] It is the claimant's onus to establish the existence of an impediment to his acquisition of citizenship.4 The impediment to citizenship must be significant.5 The claimant must demonstrate reasonable steps to overcome the impediment, and the steps taken must have ultimately been unsuccessful to acquire citizenship.6 A claimant's failure to take any steps to ascertain his status will be fatal to his refugee claim.7\nApplication to this Claim\n[13] In the present case, the panel finds that the claimant has not made reasonable attempts to secure his Egyptian identity documents. There has been no attempt to make written appeals to the government of Egypt. The claimant has not tried attending the Kuwaiti embassy here in Canada in person, which would have been at least a basic and obvious first step. Letters could have been written. The panel finds it unlikely that the Egyptian government would have any cause or reason to reject the claimant's original Kuwaiti birth certificate. The claimant could have had the original birth certificate notarized at the Kuwaiti embassy here in Canada. Had the claimant genuinely made reasonable and credible attempts, the panel finds that there would have been much greater evidence documenting those attempts. No such attempts were made. There were many reasonable and cost-effective steps that the claimant could have taken to further resolve this problem, and even after those attempts were made, resort to litigation still could have been considered. The panel disagrees that the claimant's Egyptian citizenship was a \"pre-approval\" only. The documents themselves indicate that the claimant is fully a citizen of Egypt with no qualification.\n[14] The claimant made country conditions submissions8 which provided evidence that the Egyptian regime has been revoking Egyptian citizenship from thousands of Palestinians since approximately early 2014. The revocations are intended to target perceived Hamas supporters who may have been granted citizenship under previous Egyptian governments. The panel does not find that evidence to be determinative, given that the claimant's citizenship has not been revoked. The claimant clearly has not been a Palestinian affected by this mass revocation. The Egyptian government as recently as March 2017 confirmed the claimant's citizenship.\n[15] The panel has weighed and considered the Minister's failure to take further action in this proceeding. The panel does draw a negative inference from the Minister's lack of intervention, but that is not determinative. The burden and onus is on the claimant in this proceeding, and the claimant has not established a failure of the Egyptian government to recognize his nationality there. The evidence is that the claimant has Egyptian nationality.\nConclusion\n[16] For these reasons, the panel finds that Egypt is the proper country of reference for this claim. Whereas the claimant has made no allegations against Egypt, this claim is dismissed.\n(signed)\n\"Daniel McKeown\"\nDaniel McKeown\nNovember 1, 2017\nDate\n1 Exhibit 4, page 44 and 45.\n2 Exhibit 9, page 6.\n3 2016 FCA 175.\n4 Ibid, at para. 67.\n5 Ibid, at para. 72.\n6 Ibid, at para. 72.\n7 Ibid, at para. 70.\n8 Exhibit 15\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRPD.29.1 (August 31, 2012)\nRPD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SPR : TB6-05283\n",

After the mother reported this to the Fiscalia (the prosecutor's office), she was assaulted in their home. Los Urabe\u00f1os threatened each claimant with violence and death.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] The panel finds that the claimants have not established that they are Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 nor that they are persons in need of protection under subsection 97(1). The claimants have not established that they would face a serious possibility of persecution in Colombia, nor, on a balance of probabilities, that their removal to Colombia would subject them personally to a risk to life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or to a danger of torture.\nANALYSIS\n[5] The determinative issue in these claims is an internal flight alternative (\"IFA\") to Cali. In making this assessment, the panel has considered all the evidence, including the oral testimony, documentary evidence entered as exhibits, and counsel's submissions.\nIdentity is Established\n[6] The claimants' personal identities as nationals of Colombia are established, on a balance of probabilities, by their testimony and their Colombian passports.4\nThe Claimants Were Credible\n[7] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true unless there is valid reason to doubt their veracity.5 The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants have established that they were targeted by members of Los Urabe\u00f1os and that they may be targeted in the future, should they return to their home in Bogota.\n[8] Both the daughter and the mother testified in a straightforward manner, without embellishment, and there were no inconsistencies that went to the core of their claims that were not explained. Both gave testimony that was clear, cogent, and consistent with the evidence before this panel. The panel finds that all of the testimony given at this hearing was credible as to what the claimants experienced and believed.\nThere is a Viable Internal Flight Alternative in Cali\n[9] The panel has considered the availability of an IFA and whether, on a balance of probabilities, the claimants could relocate to a different part of their home country, and live without a serious possibility of persecution or risk to their lives, or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or danger of torture.\n[10] In order to determine whether a viable IFA exists, the panel must consider a two-prong test.6 The panel must be satisfied that there is no serious possibility of the claimants being persecuted in the part of the country in which the panel finds an IFA exists. Furthermore, conditions in that proposed part of the country must be such that it would not be unreasonable, in all circumstances, including those particular to the claimants, for them to seek refuge there.\n[11] The panel proposed IFA locations of Cali and Barranquilla to the claimants. The panel finds that both prongs of the IFA test are met in the proposed IFA of Cali.\nThe Claimants' Allegations\n[12] The claimants alleged that the daughter was befriended by two men who wore the uniforms of police officers. After some time, these men told the daughter that she needed to sell narcotics for them at her school, or else they would tell people she did drugs and harm her physically. After this demand, the daughter began to see these two men outside the home she shared with her family.\n[13] The daughter told the mother what was happening and the mother sent the daughter to the home of relatives. The mother immediately went to the Fiscalia, who took the report and issued a protection order for the daughter.7 That night, the mother began to see men outside their home similar to the ones her daughter had described to her.\n[14] The next day, the mother went to the neighbourhood's police station, who told her that they had not received the protection order from the Fiscalia, but that even if they had, it would be up to her to protect the daughter because of their limited resources.\n[15] As soon as the mother returned home from the police station, the men she saw the night before approached her and forced her into her apartment. They assaulted the mother and searched the apartment for the daughter. They told the mother that she had \"made [herself] into an informant\" and that they knew she had spoken to the police. It was then that they told her that they were members of Los Urabe\u00f1os. They claimed that they had been responsible for a recent nearby murder. The men had weapons.\n[16] At that point, the men looked around the apartment and said it was \"pretty.\" They told the mother that she had to leave. They told her that she had four hours to leave or else they would kill her. They said that they knew she had two more children and that if she did not want anything to happen to her sons or her daughter, she would have to leave.\n[17] The mother gathered up some documents and her handbag and left her home. She picked up the sons from school and went to her relatives' home, where her daughter was staying.8 They did not return home at any point after that, but rather began to make the arrangements to leave the country. While staying with their relatives, they tried to stay in the home as much as possible. They did not tell their relatives why they were staying with them.\n[18] Since leaving Colombia, they have not received any new threats from anyone. No one in their family has been threatened by these men since the claimants left the country.\nThe Claimants Would Not Face a Risk in the Proposed IFA\n[19] The claimants testified about their fear of Los Urabe\u00f1os, and there is indeed extensive documentary evidence about the challenges Colombia faces from armed non-state actors. It is noted that paramilitary successor groups known as bandas criminales [criminal gangs] - BACRIM, grupos emergentes [emerging groups], or combos pursue functions of territorial, social, and economic control exerted by violent means.9 They carry out a wide variety of illegal activities, which indeed includes extortion, threats, murders, and the trafficking of narcotics10 as per the claimants' allegations. It is specifically noted that these groups recruit and involve minors.11 The national reach of Los Urabe\u00f1os is also clear, as it is noted that it had a presence in 279 municipalities in 27 departments, including both departments in which the proposed IFAs are located.12\n[20] It is very clear to the panel that the agent of persecution would have the means to trace or target these specific claimants in the proposed IFAs. However, the panel must also examine whether the agent of persecution would have the motivation to do so.\n[21] The panel turns back to the credible testimony given by the claimants. The mother gave detailed oral testimony about the attack that she experience in her home, which was consistent with a narrative provided ahead of the hearing.13 In this narrative, the mother wrote:\n...then the man said to me: I know you have two other brats and you don't want us to give them \"chumbimba\" right? He told me that the apartment could be a very good site for headquarters, he said they wanted us \"gone\" from there and never go back, that I should get lost with my brats because if they were to catch [the daughter] they were going to give her \"chumbimba\" or that maybe she could be put to work the streets so that they could get a little money out of her, he said I'd know what to do, that nothing was going to happen if I kept my mouth shut. He said: you have four hours to evacuate, old one or you all die.14\n[22] To the panel, it seemed clear that should the claimants fulfil the men's demands of leaving them the apartment, and not telling anyone about what had happened, then there would be less than a mere possibility of risk to them in the future. Essentially, the men told the claimants to leave and that they would only be at risk should they stay. There is no indication that these men would pursue the claimants once they had left Bogota, and there is no indication that they have attempted to do so once the claimants had left their apartment.\n[23] While discussing Cali, the proposed IFA, the panel asked the mother why she thought someone would be able to find her. She answered that Los Urabe\u00f1os are all over the country, that they have photographs of her daughter, and that she would not be able to put her children at risk for them to find them and kill them.\n[24] The panel then specifically asked her why these men would still be looking for her and her family. She repeated that they have photographs of her daughter, that they are everywhere, and that the children could be found easily if registered in school. The mother said that she had to make a decision and she could \"not even contemplate minimizing the risk of them killing [her] children. [She] needed to eliminate completely that risk.\"\n[25] The panel then asked why these men would still be looking for her if they had told her to leave her home or else they would kill her and she did indeed leave. The mother answered that the risk still exists, as the men had met the daughter and they wanted her to sell drugs.\n[26] The panel is very sympathetic to the mother's desire to \"eliminate completely\" any risk to her children. However, that is not the legal test for the first prong of the IFA assessment. The panel finds that as the claimants have already complied with the demands of their agent of persecution, there would be no motivation for the agent of persecution to pursue them to the proposed IFA.\n[27] In his submissions, counsel for the claimants provided a thorough argument that should the claimants be required to return to Colombia, they would essentially be internally displaced persons (\"IDPs\"). Referring to the provided country condition documents,15 counsel submitted that there is somewhere between four to six million people who have been internally displaced by Colombia's conflicts. Counsel submitted that as IDPs, the claimants would be at risk of persecution or harm, with the minor claimants at risk of being recruited by armed groups, and the daughter especially at risk because of her gender and age. It was submitted that there is not adequate state protection from these groups in the proposed IFA.\n[28] To assess what the actual risk the claimants would face should they relocate to the proposed IFA, the panel turns to the submitted objective documentation regarding IDPs in Colombia. It is noted that IDPs go from one city to another, and settle in the poorest areas.16 However, the risk most prominently identified in the submitted evidence is that IDPs can be easily tracked by their agents of persecution, a risk already discussed above.17 Although sexual violence is noted to be a \"habitual and frequent practice,\" it is also noted that this is a \"premeditated, systematic, and generalized practice.\"18 It is also noted that women and children are particularly vulnerable segments of the IDP population who endure sexual exploitation, violence, and malnutrition.19\n[29] However, the panel cannot find that the dangers faced in general by people in the proposed IFA, even those faced by women and children who are internally displaced persons, rise to the level required by the legal tests. The documentary evidence submitted by the claimants establishes that there is a higher risk of persecution or harm for IDPs, whether violence based or via recruitment, but does not establish that there is a serious possibility of persecution or a probable risk to life, or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or danger of torture in the proposed IFA. To find otherwise, based on the evidence before this panel, would be speculative.\n[30] Therefore, the panel finds that on a balance of probabilities, there is no serious possibility of persecution nor a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger of torture in the proposed IFA of Cali.\nThe Proposed IFA is Reasonable\n[31] The panel has considered both the personal circumstances of the claimants and the objective evidence with respect to the claimants' ability to relocate to Cali. As per her testimony, the mother worked extensively in positions such as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for a large company. Her work history extends back for over ten years. She is well-educated, and holds a university degree in XXXX XXXX. When the mother was asked by the panel if she could find a job in Cali, the only answer given by the mother was that they would have to live in hiding. She testified that if they returned to Colombia, \"be it Cali or any other city,\" they would have to live in hiding. She could not work, nor would the children be able to go to school. If one of the minor claimants became sick, the mother would not be able to get them medical care, and the children would not be able to go to a park. Again, as per the above analysis, it is more likely than not that the claimants would not have to live in hiding.\n[32] The claimants have submitted evidence that indicate levels of poverty and extreme poverty for IDPs.20 Counsel also argued many IDPs live in poverty, and have limited access to health care and education.21 However, considering the mother's high level of education and extensive work experience, the panel finds that it is more likely than not that the mother would be able to find employment in the proposed IFA, a city of more than 2.646 million people.22 Likewise, the evidence before the panel indicates that the limited access to healthcare and education is more prevalent in more rural settlements for IDPs, as opposed a city as big as Cali.\n[33] The panel has also specifically considered that the mother is, essentially, a single parent to three minor children. She testified that she only receives \"a minimal fee\" from their father, who lives in Bogota. However, the panel also notes that the mother was able to support her family on her own for the time they had spent previously in Colombia. The claimants have offered no corroborated evidence that she will not be able to continue to do so should they relocate to Cali. Similarly, the mother testified that she still has family in Colombia with whom she communicates regularly. There was no indication that they could not offer them any support, whether financially or emotionally, should the claimants return to Colombia. As they would not be required to go into hiding, as discussed above, the claimants have not established that they would be prevented from accessing social services such as education or health care. Furthermore, the claimants have already shown great adaptability, taking themselves out of danger and traveling to Canada. 23\n[34] The Federal Court has held that the threshold for the 'objectively unreasonable' standard is very high and requires, at a minimum, the proof of adverse conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of the claimants in relocating to a safe area, and that the claimant is required to produce actual and concrete evidence of such conditions.24 The panel finds that the claimants have not provided such evidence to meet this high threshold. Accordingly, the panel finds that it would not be unreasonable for the claimants to relocate to Cali.\nCONCLUSION\n[35] Since the panel has found that the claimants have an IFA in Cali that is safe and reasonable in their particular circumstances, the panel finds they do not face a serious possibility of persecution in Colombia. The finding of an IFA also applies to IRPA section 97(1), as on a balance of probabilities, the claimants do not face a danger of torture or risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. Consequently, the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n[36] The panel accordingly must reject each claim for refugee protection.\n(signed)\n\"S. Charow\"\nS.

She had been sent out of town to attend a training conference in Wenzhou City. After the opening reception in the evening, her manager accompanied her back to her hotel room. On the way, they purchased some fruit and items. The claimant went to the bathroom in the hotel room, and when she came out, he gave her some juice to drink. After drinking, she passed out. When she woke up, she discovered that she had been raped by the manager. She then called her mother. Her mother told her to call the police, which she did. Two policemen came and took her to the police station. She provided a statement and remained there until about 4 am or 5 am. The police said they would investigate. The claimant alleges that she was later threatened by the manager's wife, who tried to pay her off, and resolve the matter out of court, and also by the police. Even though the manager's wife threatened her by saying that they occupied a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and that they had high connections with the police, the claimant wanted to proceed with the case. The police told her not to return, or she would be charged, and that she had mental problems. She provided a statement to the Fujian Women's Federation Association. The police came to the family home of the claimant and told her mother that the claimant was to report to the police. The claimant went into hiding in Guangzhou. She fears being physically harmed, killed, or kidnapped. Following her attempt to obtain justice for the sexual assault, she has been targeted by the man who raped her, his contacts, and the authorities. She had the help of an agent in escaping from China, which she did on December 29, 2016. She made her claim at the Port of Entry.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] The panel determines that the claimant has not established that there is a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, or that, on a balance of probabilities, she would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment upon return to her country.\n[6] The panel's reasons for its determination are as follows.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[7] The claimant has proved her identity, both as a citizen of China, and her personal identity by a certified true copy of her Resident ID Card,2 on a balance of probabilities standard.\nHas the claimant suffered an act of persecution or a criminal act?\n[8] The panel assumes, in this section without deciding, that the allegations alleged have been proved to the requisite standard.\n[9] The claimant alleges that she has been raped by her manager. Clearly, rape is a heinous crime which has been condemned in the domestic legislation of many countries, and international instruments. For the treatment to likely amount to persecution, it must be a serious form of harm which detracts from the claimant's fundamental human rights.\n[10] In the assessment of what kinds of treatment are considered persecution, an objective standard is provided by the international human rights instruments which Canada has ratified.\n[11] Canada played a central role in 1947-48 in drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which provides in Article 3, that -\nEveryone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.\n[12] Article 5 of the same instrument provides that -\nNo one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\n[13] The panel finds that the claimant's right to security of person and not to be subjected to cruel or degrading treatment would have been breached, if she proves that her story is authentic.\n[14] The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women3 provides in Article 11 states that:\n1. States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women in the field of employment in order to ensure, on a basis of equality of men and women, the same rights, in particular:\n(a) The right to work as an inalienable right of all human beings;\n(b) The right to the same employment opportunities, including the application of the same criteria for selection in matters of employment;\n(c) The right to free choice of profession and employment, the right to promotion, job security and all benefits and conditions of service and the right to receive vocational training and retraining, including apprenticeships, advanced vocational training and recurrent training;\n(d) The right to equal remuneration, including benefits, and to equal treatment in respect of work of equal value, as well as equality of treatment in the evaluation of the quality of work;\n(e) The right to social security, particularly in cases of retirement, unemployment, sickness, invalidity and old age and other incapacity to work, as well as the right to paid leave;\n(f) The right to protection of health and to safety in working conditions, including the safeguarding of the function of reproduction.\n[15] Canada ratified the Convention in 1981, though it has not yet been implemented into our domestic legislation.\n[16] In this claim, the claimant alleges she was raped by her employer. This was not a random act of violence. She claims she had been working for the company for some three years and that she knew her manager well at the time the rape took place.\n[17] The panel finds that her right to employment free of discrimination would have been breached, again, assuming that her allegations are made out. The panel finds that as the alleged rape took place while the claimant was on an employment related trip, by her manager, there has been a potential breach of her right to employment including the right to safe working conditions and to her right to employment free of discrimination, since the alleged act of rape by an employer is clearly an act of employment discrimination and sexual discrimination.\n[18] The panel finds that the harm alleged is serious harm, which detracts from the fundamental human rights of the claimant.\n[19] The panel finds that the rape alleged by the claimant does amount to persecution for the purposes of this claim.\nWhether the persecution alleged was as a result of one of the Five Convention grounds.\n[20] The cases of Dezameau4 and Josile5 were claims made by Haitian women claiming a fear of persecution in the form of sexual violence. In these cases, the Federal Court cited the principle in Ward6 that \"gender\" can provide the basis for a particular social group. The Federal Court also cited jurisprudence from the Supreme Court of Canada in support of the proposition that rape and other forms of sexual assault are crimes grounded in the status of women in society.\n[21] If rape is a form of sexual assault which is grounded in the status of women in society, then prima facie it could constitute persecution on the Convention ground of Membership in a Particular Social Group, with the group being women, and the sub-group being women who are raped in the course of their employment related activities.\n[22] Clearly, the claimant has established that her claim has a nexus to a Convention ground.\nCredibility\n[23] Credibility was the major issues in this case. The question is, does the panel believe what the claimant has alleged in support of her claim. She claims that she has been the victim of a pre-mediated sexual assault, and that the police not only failed to offer her protection, but actually tried to arrest her, and that she would not be safe in China.\n[24] The claimant needs to establish the credibility of her story, on balance of probabilities standard, which is the evidentiary burden, to support her claim to be a s. 96 Convention refugee. She must also prove a subjective fear of persecution, that her fears are well founded, that there is no state protection and that there is no internal flight alternative. Each element must be proved on a balance of probabilities standard. Then, each of the five the elements of the s. 96 claim must all be weighed, and the panel must determine whether the evidence, as a whole, establishes that the claimant would face a serious probability of persecution if she were to return to China. That is the legal test for the s. 96 claim. And the assessment is forward looking, considering what would happen if the claimant were to be returned to China.\nDetention in the US\n[25] The claimant testified that she had been detained in the US, from XXXX 2011 to XXXX 2012, about XXXX year and XXXX months. She claimed that she had been detained for illegal entry into the US by the immigration bureau. She had revealed this in her interview at the border with the immigration officer. She was asked about this detention at the hearing for refugee protection.\n[26] Although the details of what happened in the US to the claimant between 2011 - 2012 are not directly relevant to the facts of her refugee claim here in Canada, they are indirectly relevant and material. They shed light on her story about leaving China due to being raped, because clearly she has made at least one other attempt to leave China. The panel needs to consider this evidence, assess what she says about it, and determine whether this was a something that happened years ago when she was younger, and is in no way connected to her present claim, or whether her motives at that time are similar to her motives in coming to Canada this time. Moreover, because it was raised at the border, the panel is entitled to ask her questions about these events from the past, to test her credibility and determine whether she provides a consistent story.\n[27] The claimant testified that she had entered the US by a pleasure boat. But she was evasive, and had to be asked the question twice. She was also asked if she had entered the US using a fraudulent document, but again she was evasive, and would not answer the question directly. Finally she revealed that she entered the US using a fraudulent Japanese passport. She claims that she was told that she could use the Japanese passport to enter the US by the smuggler and that he had cheated her.\n[28] This story is rejected by the panel. The claimant stated at the outset of the hearing that she was a citizen of China and China alone. The panel does not accept that she thought she could go to the US with a Japanese passport, when she is not nor has ever been a citizen of Japan. She refused to admit her own culpability for entering the US using a fraudulent travel document, even though she was detained for more than a year and a half. As a result, the panel draws a negative credibility inference.\nFailure to disclose prior refugee claim in the US\n[29] The claimant was asked by the panel if she had made a refugee claim in the US. She said that she had, for political asylum. She testified that it was not approved. She was asked why she made a claim for political asylum in the US, and she said that it was on the basis of being a Christian. She claims that her claim for asylum in the US was rejected because of her use of a fraudulent Japanese passport.\n[30] But the claimant was asked at the border when she entered Canada whether she had ever applied for refugee status anywhere outside of Canada. She said that Canada was the only place she had done that. She was also asked in her Schedule A whether she had made a previous application for refugee protection \"in any other countries\" and she indicated she had not.\n[31] The claimant was asked to explain the inconsistency between her evidence at the hearing that she had made a prior claim for refugee protection, and her denial of this in her documentation and at the border. The claimant said that she did not know that a claim for asylum was the same as a claim for refugee protection. The claimant said a refugee was a \"vagrant in the street,\" whereas asylum meant \"protection.\"\n[32] The panel does not accept the claimant's testimony that she did not know the difference between making an application for asylum in the US and making a claim for refugee protection in Canada. Her claim in the US was based on her allegation that as a Christian, she needed protection. In Canada, her claim is that she is a persecuted member of a particular social group in China, or women who are sexually abused by their employers. She had lawyers in both applications. The claimant was a clever young woman, experienced in the ways of refugee\/ asylum applications. As a result, the panel draws a negative credibility inference.\nNo documentation regarding her time in the US, or her asylum application\n[33] The claimant had no documents in relation to her claim for asylum in the US, nor any documentation about her detention for 20 months, nor any documents about her deportation from the US back to China. She was asked why. She said that when she returned to China, they were taken away by the Chinese authorities. When she was asked if she had any documents from her refugee claim and what effort she had made to get them for the hearing, she said that she had surrendered them to her lawyer.\n[34] The panel does not accept the claimant's story about failing to get documents. Even if she had surrendered them when she was returned to China, she could have contacted her lawyer in the US to get the documents for the refugee hearing here in Canada.\n[35] As a result of this lack of documents, the panel does not know what happened to the claimant in the US. The most serious concern is this. She claims that she was detained for XXXX months, and that she made an application for asylum as a Christian, which was rejected because she used a false passport to enter the US, namely, a fraudulent Japanese passport. The panel does not know the true reason for her detention, the true nature of her application for refugee protection in the US, nor the true reason why she was deported.\n[36] These documents are highly relevant to the Canadian refugee application because the claimant is renewing her attempt to be recognised as Convention refugee. Although the Canadian and American refugee systems are different, they do not differ on the meaning of \"Convention refugee.\" Moreover, her story of making a claim for refugee protection in the US is not consistent with her story about being detained for XXXX months. If she was truly fleeing China on the grounds of her religion, then she would not be denied protection merely on the basis that she entered the US using a fraudulent travel document.\n[37] The panel draws a negative credibility inference as a result of the claimant's failure to produce any documentation in relation to her detention, asylum application and deportation from the US. The panel also finds that she is withholding information in relation to her claim for refugee protection in the US. As a result, the panel draws a negative credibility inference and finds that the integrity of these proceedings has been compromised by the claimant's failure to provide evidence of her time in the US. The panel finds that she has withheld material information and documents.\nInconsistent evidence as to her passport used to come to Canada\n[38] The claimant was asked about whether she had a passport to come to Canada. She said that she did. She said that she got it from the snakehead, who helped her apply for a visa to Canada. When she was asked what country issued the passport she said she did not know. But later in her testimony, she said that she had applied for the passport at the passport office in China.\n[39] The claimant was asked to explain this inconsistency between saying that she did not know which country the passport was from and saying that she applied for it at an office in China. In explanation, she said she did not know she was being asked about the passport when asked what country it was from, she thought she was being asked about the visa.\n[40] Now this cannot be. Her clear testimony was that the visa was for Canada, when she was asked by the panel. If she had truly thought that she was being asked about what country the visa was from, when the panel asked her which country issued the passport, she would have said Canada. But she did not. She said she did not know. Moreover, her evidence was that she applied for the passport. If she applied for it, how could she have not known which country issued it. The answer is she is withholding evidence. The panel rejects her testimony that she did not know which country issued her passport which she used to come to Canada.\nInconsistent evidence about the visa used to come to Canada\n[41] The claimant also said in her interview at the border, that she had never applied for a visa to come to Canada. But during her hearing, she stated that she did have a visa to come to Canada, and the snakehead had assisted. When asked about the inconsistency, the claimant simply said that the snakehead gave her the passport with the Canadian visa, and said that in this way, she could come to Canada. The panel finds that she has not answered a question about the inconsistent testimony and evidence from the interview at the border. Having no explanation to assess, the panel draws a negative credibility inference.\nIncomplete information in her forms in support of her claim\n[42] The claimant was asked to fill in her Schedule A in support of her claim. It was filed in December 2016, after she arrived. She was required to provide her personal history since she was 18, or over the last 10 years, whichever is most recent. That would have been since she was 18 in 2008. But she did not provide information from 2008. She provided it from 2009. Nor did she provide any information about her addresses over the last 10 years or since she was 18. In fact, there was nothing in her forms about her work after July 2013. There was nothing in her forms about her working for XXXX XXXX XXXX, as she alleged in her BOC narrative. Yet she had counsel representing her from January 11, 2017, Ms. Christina Gural, when the BOC was filled in and submitted. She was asked why she did not provide this information. She said she provided whatever she was asked at the Port of Entry when the forms were filled in.\n[43] As a result of the failure of the claimant to provide the information requested in her Schedule A, the panel draws a negative credibility inference. In particular, the panel finds that she has not stated in her forms that she had worked for XXXX for three years as she alleged in her Amended BOC. This was highly material and at the heart of her claim that she had been raped by a colleague from XXXX.\nLack of information about her employment for XXXX or about her arrest\n[44] The claimant stated that she had signed a contract when she started to work for XXXX. She was asked if she had it, and she said no because that was three years ago. Nor did she have a name card, or any proof of being paid by XXXX. In a word, there was no documentary evidence about her work. She did provide three photos. She did not appear in one. In one, she appears with 4 other young women. They are standing in front of a wall beside a glass door. The words \"XXXX XXXX\" appear at the top of the wall, with the letter after \"n\" lopped out. The location of the photo appears to be a XXXX XXXX. All 5 women appear young. They are all wearing dark colored T-shirts and cut-off shorts with sneakers.\n[45] As a result of the failure to provide the information requested, without any valid explanation, the panel finds that the claimant is withholding information and\/or did not comply with the clear requirements in the forms. As a result, the panel draws a negative credibility inference.\n[46] The claimant alleges that she was raped\/ sexually assaulted on the first evening of a training conference in Wenzhou. Yet other than the photos mentioned above, and her testimony at the hearing, there was no evidence of her employment at all. Nor was there any sworn documentary evidence about her employment at XXXX.\n[47] She provided a registration form for the case at the local police station in Wenzhou. It has very few details and merely states: \"XXXX said that she was raped by her boss named XXXX XXXX at Room XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\" No other details are given.\n[48] The claimant alleges that she is wanted by the police in China because she reported an affair with a male to the PSB, and they claim that she has made a false allegation.\n[49] The panel asked the claimant whether a summons was issued for her arrest. She did not answer the question directly. She said that she was not at home at the time. She was then asked the question again, and she said that she was not at home, and that they wanted her to follow them to the PSB station.\nFindings on the evidence\n[50] The panel finds that the claimant has not proved that she was employed by XXXX at the material time. Her photos did not give any information about the details of her employment such as the period of employment or of her position. Nor did she have any statements from any of her colleagues as to what had happened. As to the testimony she provided to her solicitor at the hearing, set in the context of the evidence as a whole, with the above negative credibility findings, the panel does not accept her evidence as to her employment.\n[51] She was evasive when asked about whether a summons had been issued against her. The mere fact that she was not at home at the time they came is none to the point, because the PSB often leave summons with family members of the wanted person.\n[52] Looking at the evidence as a whole, the panel finds that the claimant was not a reliable or credible witness. Given the fact that she has withheld material information, and given evidence that is not credible, the panel finds that her story is not credible, and the panel finds it did not happen in the way she claims.\n[53] The panel finds that she has not proved her employment on a balance of probabilities standard, and the panel cannot determine whether her story about the rape is true. She did not report it in any detail to the police. She merely told them that she was raped. At the very least, she would need to prove that she was employed at the material time by XXXX, but there was no evidence on point, other than her testimony, which as we can see above, was not credible in many respects.\n[54] The panel also finds that her story about being wanted by the PSB is a fabrication.\n[55] The panel finds that her report to the police and letter from the Fujian Provincial Women's Federation are not genuine, as fraudulent documents in China are common,7 and due to the negative credibility findings above.\n[56] Both the ss. 96 and 97 claims are rejected for lack of credible evidence.\nWell foundedness of the fear\/ State protection\n[57] The panel would also make the following observations.\n[58] Even if the panel accepted the claimant's story that she was raped by her employer, the panel notes the following report on sexual assault in China:\nRape is a criminal offence in China, although there is no specific crime of marital rape. The Government does not publish official statistics on rape or sexual assault, making the scale of sexual violence difficult to determine. Nevertheless, it appears that rape remains a problem in China, with migrant women being particularly vulnerable. In its report to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the Government of China reported that in 2009, 26,404 cases of rape were solved by the police. However, this may represent only a fraction of the actual cases. A 2013 comprehensive UN survey reports that 22.2% of men surveyed admitted to committing rape in their lifetimes; with 8.1% admitting to have committed rape of a non-partner, and 2.2% to gang rape of a non-partner. The most common motivation given by respondents for having committed rape was sexual entitlement.\nAmendments to the Law on the Protection of Women's Rights in 2005 included provisions banning sexual harassment, making the wrongdoer subject to administrative penalties as well as civil claims. Since then, the number of complaints of sexual harassment has increased significantly, according to the US Department of State. However, the problem appears to go largely unaddressed by the courts. For example, the ILO cites a survey conducted by Women's Watch-China, showing that 23.9% of employees who responded had heard of, or seen, colleagues suffer sexual harassment, and 19.8% had been sexually harassed themselves. Although the same survey found that fewer than 20% of victims called the police or took civil action. There are no official figures on the numbers of perpetrators successfully prosecuted.8\n[59] The panel also notes the following report from the US Department of State:\nIn February 2014, the US Department of State (USDOS) reports on rape and domestic violence as follows:\nRape is illegal, and some persons convicted of rape were executed. The penalties for rape can range from three years in prison to a death sentence with a two-year reprieve and forced labor. The law does not address spousal rape. The government did not make available official statistics on rape or sexual assault, leaving the scale of sexual violence difficult to determine. Migrant female workers were particularly vulnerable to sexual violence. Violence against women remained a significant problem.9\n[60] Based on the above data from the NDP, the panel finds that the country conditions, while not idyllic, do not support the claimant's story that the police would actually arrest the claimant for reporting a rape. Nor is she a migrant worker, who face a higher risk of sexual violence. Her story is that the police in Wenzhou, where the alleged rape took place, actually passed the case over to the police in Fuzhou city, where the claimant lived. She claims that they wanted to arrest her there for filing a fraudulent case. In the view of the panel, the country conditions do not support this type of criminality in China. Further, although sexual harassment may be an issue in China in employment contexts, there is no evidence that rape in employment contexts is a serious problem.\n[61] The panel would also note that both Wenzhou, and Fuzhou are developed cities in China, where law enforcement would be more advanced than in the rural parts of China.\n[62] The claimant claimed she was also wanted by the PSB, who were seeking to arrest her. She was asked if a summons had been issued, and she avoided this question twice, and never answered it directly. The following passage deals with the issuance of criminal summons:\nThe Visiting Scholar stated that \"criminal summonses must be issued before a case is filed for investigation, to those who do not meet the conditions for pre-trial detention or arrest.\" The Visiting Scholar added that the issuance of criminal summonses must be approved by the officer in charge of a public security bureau at or above the county level. Criminal suspects or defendants can be summoned to a public security bureau in their city or county of residence, as well as to a public security bureau in the place where they live without a household registration certificate.\nThe Visiting Scholar also added that \"police officers have to show their identification and the order to the suspect or defendant, and order him to affix his signature and fingerprint thereon.\" According to the Visiting Scholar, \"suspects and defendants can choose not to sign the police order.\" The Visiting Scholar did not provide details on the consequences, if any, of refusing to sign.10\n[63] The panel finds that there is no documentary evidence that the claimant is wanted by the PSB. The claimant's evidence on this point was highly evasive. Nor is the claimant's evidence about the PSB wanting to arrest her, without any summons, supported by the Criminal Procedure Law of China.\n[64] All that remains is her testimony of what she claims happened, which has proved unreliable in instance after instance in this case. Where she has stopped engaging in falsehood is difficult to know. Whether there is some kernel of truth at the heart of her allegations cannot be known in light of the state of her evidence a whole.\n[65] The panel concludes that even if she was raped that night in Wenzhou, there is not sufficient evidence to demonstrate that state protection is inadequate, or that her fears of being a victim of the PSB for reporting the case against her boss are well founded. For these additional reasons, the panel would reject the claim under ss. 96 and 97 of the IRPA.\nCONCLUSION\n[66] As a result of the findings above that fraudulent documents were used and that the claimant withheld information, the panel finds that the claim is a manifestly unfounded claim.\n[67] As a result, this claim is dismissed.\n(signed)\n\"James W.

The female claimant was appointed as the designated representative for the minor claimants.\n[3] The panel has considered Chairperson's Guideline 9 in relation to proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) involving sexual orientation and gender identity and expression.2 Consideration for the particular challenges that bisexual individuals from Nigeria may face in presenting their case has been given.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The male claimant's allegations are set out fully in his Basis of Claim form (BOC). In summary, he is a citizen of Nigeria who fears persecution in Nigeria based on his sexual orientation, specifically as a bisexual male. The female claimant's allegations, and those of the minor claimants, are set out in her BOC.3 In summary, her life and the lives of her children are in danger in Nigeria at the hands of community members, members of the male claimant's family and the police because it has been discovered that the male claimant is bisexual. Demands have been made that she and the children undergo traditional cleansing, including circumcision for the female minor claimant and scarification for the males.\nDETERMINATION - MALE CLAIMANT\n[5] The panel finds that the male claimant has established a serious possibility of persecution in Nigeria based on his membership in a particular social group, specifically as bisexual male. Accordingly, he is a Convention refugee.\nDETERMINATION - FEMALE CLAIMANT AND MINOR CLAIMANTS\n[6] The panel finds that the female claimant and the minor claimants have not established a serious possibility of persecution in Nigeria. They have also not established, on a balance of probabilities, that they would be personally subject to a danger of torture, a risk to their life or to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment were they to return to Nigeria. Accordingly, they are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.\nIDENTITY\n[7] On a balance of probabilities, the claimants' identities as nationals of Nigeria were established through their Nigerian passports.4\nANALYSIS\nThe male claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution\n[8] The panel found the male claimant to be a credible witness. His testimony was straightforward and in keeping with the allegations set out in his BOC. There were no material inconsistencies or omissions that went to the heart of his claim, which is that he is a bisexual, the discovery of which has caused him to fear for his life back in Nigeria. The panel noted that at times the female claimant became emotional while listening to the testimony of her husband and that at one point both she and the male claimant were crying, which necessitated taking a break. While it is possible for one to shed \"crocodile tears,\" the panel did not get the sense that the emotions expressed by the adult claimants in this case were disingenuous and finds that they lend an air of credibility to the claims being advanced.\n[9] More specifically, the panel finds that the male claimant testified in a consistent manner about the realization that he had romantic feelings towards the same sex at age 14; his first sexual encounter with a male and first same-sex relationship with his best friend XXXX; a same-sex relationship he entered into with a man by the name of XXXX XXXX in XXXX2015, including how he met Mr. XXXX and how the friendship progressed to a same-sex relationship; the phone call he received from his mother while he and the other claimants were visiting the United States, informing him that Mr. XXXX had been caught in the act of having sex with another man by the Nigerian police, that he had been arrested and beaten by the authorities, and that he had confessed the male claimant's name as someone he was involved with sexually; and his decision thereafter to travel to Canada to seek protection.\n[10] The male claimant also testified in a credible and trustworthy manner with respect to his involvement within the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) community in Canada, including his attendance at The 519 organization and what he likes about the events that he attends there, and his attendance and volunteer work at the organization Africans in Partnership Against AIDS.\n[11] The male claimant's testimony is supported by documentary evidence. In reaching a decision, the panel considered several documents in evidence, including: affidavits from the male claimant's mother,5 attesting to being informed by the police that the male claimant's lover, Mr. XXXX, had been arrested and named the male claimant as his partner, which gave rise to police interest in the male claimant, and further attesting that the female claimant's family have come to the house in anger on a regular basis for what they feel the male claimant has put their daughter through, and that she herself was attacked and beaten unconscious by community members; an affidavit from a friend and neighbour, XXXX XXXX;6 photographs of the male claimant and his former same-sex partner, XXXX XXXX;7 photographs of the male claimant at LGBTQ events in Canada;8 519 membership card and welcome letter;9 a letter from the Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto,10 a church that services the LGBTQ community in Canada; and a supporting letter from the Africans in Partnership Against AIDS.11\n[12] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the male claimant is bisexual and that he has a subjective fear of persecution in Nigeria.\n[13] The panel further finds that there is a serious possibility of harm for the male claimant as a bisexual man in Nigeria, based on the objective documentary evidence. Homosexual conduct is punishable by up to 14 years in prison under Nigerian federal law.12 The documentation also notes an increase in the number of violent acts recorded on grounds of perceived and real sexual orientation and gender identity since the passage of the Same Sex Marriage (Prohibition) in 201413 and that violence can occur on the basis of perceived sexual identity.14 Human rights violations are recorded both from state and non-state actors.15 Police arrests of same-sex individuals are arbitrary and are most often based on mere suspicion or unsubstantiated allegations.16 The documentary evidence also establishes that there is extreme homophobia throughout the country and blatant discrimination, hatred and violence against LGBTQ persons.17 Homosexuality is considered highly immoral and an abomination, and LGBTQ individuals risk mob attacks, violence, arbitrary arrest and discrimination in employment, housing and healthcare.18 The claimants provided additional credible and consistent country documentation demonstrating societal attitudes and violence against LGBT persons Nigeria.19\nThere is no state protection for the male claimant\n[14] The panel finds that it would be unreasonable for the male claimant to approach the state for protection in this case. As noted, homosexuality is criminalized under Nigerian law, meaning the state would be the agent of persecution. With respect to state protection from persecution by non-state actors, the objective country documentation outlining the pervasiveness of homophobic attitudes, violence and persecution against the LGBTQ community in Nigeria demonstrates, on a balance of probabilities, that the Nigerian state is unwilling or unable to provide adequate state protection for bisexuals. The panel therefore finds an absence of adequate state protection for the male claimant in Nigeria.\nThere is no internal flight alternative for the male claimant\n[15] The panel finds that the male claimant does not have a viable internal flight alternative (IFA) in Nigeria. The objective documentary evidence outlines punishment for same-sex activities throughout the country.20 The panel therefore finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution for the male claimant throughout Nigeria.\n[16] Based on the evidence, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility of persecution for the male claimant in Nigeria, based on his sexual orientation as a bisexual male.\nThe female claimant and minor claimants have an internal flight alternative\nA note on credibility\n[17] Overall, the panel found the female claimant to be a credible witness with respect to her allegation that elders in the male claimant's family and leaders of their community are demanding that she and the minor claimants submit to traditional cleansing rituals as a means of cleansing the entire family of the perceived abomination committed by the male claimant. For the female claimant this would mean undergoing some type of cleansing process whereby she would be forced to sleep at a shrine for 30 days, with only concoctions prepared by the elders for sustenance. With respect to the minor claimants, the female would have to be circumcised and the males would have to undergo incisions on their heads and bodies. Her testimony was generally consistent with the BOC narrative in this regard and the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the female claimant and minor claimants are being sought for traditional cleansing as alleged.\n[18] The panel does have a credibility concern with respect to the female claimant's BOC allegation that the police are searching for her because she is supporting her husband in being bisexual. This concern is addressed as part of the panel's analysis of internal flight alternative, below.\nInternal flight alternative\n[19] The determinative issue with respect to the female and minor claimants related to the existence of an internal flight alternative.\n[20] IFA arises when a claimant who has a well-founded fear of persecution in her home area of the country is not a Convention refugee because she has an IFA elsewhere in that country. The test to be applied in determining whether there is an IFA is two-pronged.21 First, the panel must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country identified as an IFA. Second, conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for her to seek refuge there. Once the issue of an IFA is raised, the onus shifts to the refugee claim to demonstrate that either of the two prongs is not met.\n[21] The panel identified Port Harcourt and Lagos as potential IFAs at the outset of the hearing and now finds, having considered all the evidence, including the objective country documentation, that the female claimant and minor claimants have viable IFAs in both of these cities.\nNo serious possibility of persecution for the female claimant and minor claimants in the IFAs\n[22] According to the objective documentary evidence, Nigeria is a large country with a population exceeding 170 million and, in general, Nigerians can freely travel within the country.22 Where the threat to a person is from non-state agents, internal relocation to another part of Nigeria to escape the risk is generally viable but will depend on the particular circumstances of the claimant and the nature and origin of the threat.23 Port Harcourt is a large city with a population of 2.343 million people.24 It is situated approximately 440 kilometers from Ondo town, Ondo State, where the claimants were living before leaving Nigeria for the United States in April 2017. Lagos is very large city with a population of 13.123 million people.25 It is located approximately 240 kilometers from Ondo.\n[23] The female claimant declared in her BOC that there is no place in Nigeria that she and the minor children can relocate to and be safe26 because bisexuals are persecuted throughout the country.27 In the narrative portion of the BOC, the female claimant declared that in XXXX 2017, while vacationing in the United States, the male claimant received a telephone call from his mother, informing him that the police and community youth had come to his house with the intention of attacking and arresting him for being in a same-sex relationship with XXXX XXXX.28 She further declared that she received a phone call from her mother-in-law on XXXX XXXX 2017, informing her that the same people that had initially come to attack and arrest the male claimant - i.e. the police and community youth - had come back searching for her and the male claimant and had threatened to deal with her, based on their belief that she was supporting her husband's sexual orientation as a bisexual and that she knew where he was.29 Her mother-in-law warned her not to return to Nigeria because the community youth and the police are searching for her and leaders of the community are waiting to carry out \"jungle justice\".30\n[24] At the hearing, the panel questioned the female claimant about what she feared back in Nigeria. She testified that she fears the police and the community youth. The panel asked her why she fears the police. She responded that the police have been looking for her husband and herself and that she fears the police will torture her. The panel then asked the female claimant why the police are looking for her specifically. She stated that the police are saying that she is an accomplice to her husband. The panel asked her when the police said that. She testified that her mother-in-law called her and informed her that angry youth had come to the house with the police. When they came back the next time they said they wanted to hang the female claimant, that she is hiding the male claimant and that the police were aware of this. The panel then asked the female claimant directly whether the police are looking for her. She responded that the police are not actually looking for her, that it is her husband, the male claimant, who they are looking for. She stated that the community youth and her family are against her and that they believe she is hiding her husband.\n[25] The panel drew the female claimant's attention to a contradiction between her testimony that the police are not looking for her and her BOC declarations,31 and the affidavit of her mother-in-law,32 that they are. The latter document relays that the police came looking to arrest the female claimant as an accomplice of the male claimant who needed to face the extent of the law. The panel asked the female claimant to explain the contradiction. In reply, she denied having testified that the police are not looking for her. She stated that her testimony had been that the police will interrogate her to get to the male claimant. The panel then read the noted question and answer exchange back to the female claimant. She responded that the police were not looking for her for the purpose of killing her, that it was her husband they were looking for the first time they came to the house, and that it was because they could not capture him that they came looking for her because they believe that she is keeping her husband from them and that arresting her would force her to divulge the whereabouts of her husband.\n[26] The panel rejects the female claimant's explanation of the contradiction as unreasonable and not credible. The panel finds that her testimony with respect to whether the police are pursuing her waivered and ultimately contradicted the allegations set out in her BOC. When the panel asked her whether the police were looking for her, she quite clearly testified that they were not actually looking for her. When confronted with the contradiction between her BOC narrative and her testimony, she denied having told the panel that the police were not looking for her and substituted a different answer. This is not a credible explanation. On a balance of probabilities, based on the contradiction, the panel finds that the police are not pursuing the female claimant and that she would not be at risk from the police were she to relocate to Port Harcourt or Lagos.\n[27] The panel further questioned the female claimant with respect to the demands that she and the minor claimants undergo ritual cleansing. She testified that it was her husband's family that was making the demands, and specifically the male claimant's uncle, XXXX XXXX, who is the XXXX male in the village of Oulu Ila, situated on the outskirts of Ondo town. She described Oulu Ila as the community where the male claimant's family originates from, where they have a community setting, and where they do rituals. When asked by the panel about her personal dealings with the male claimant's uncle, the female claimant informed the panel that she last met him at her marriage to the male claimant (XXXX 200733) and that the minor claimants have never met him.\n[28] The panel next asked the female claimant if she had any idea as to how the male claimant's uncle, or community members on his behalf, would be able to locate her and the minor claimants in Port Harcourt or Lagos. She testified in response that her husband has a large family, with children everywhere, and that they have their informants, so that there is nowhere she and the minor claimants could go that they could not been seen. She added that the male claimant's uncle is an XXXX and manipulates things. The panel asked the female claimant if she knew for certain that the male claimant has family members residing in Port Harcourt or Lagos. She stated that she is not certain, but that they are everywhere.\n[29] The panel finds that the female claimant's testimony with respect to the ability or means of her alleged persecutors to locate her and the minor claimants in either of the propose IFAs was vague and amounts to speculation. The truth is that she does not know whether her husband's family has a presence in Port Harcourt or Lagos. The panel finds that even were it to accept that the male claimant has family members in the proposed IFAs, there is no persuasive evidence that they have the means to locate the female claimant or the minor claimants in such large urban centres.\n[30] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel finds that the female claimant and the minor claimants have not met their burden of demonstrating the ability of their persecutors to locate them in Port Harcourt or Lagos. As such, the panel finds that there would be no serious possibility of persecution for these claimants were they to relocate to either of these cities.\nIt would not be unreasonable for the female claimant and minor claimants to relocate\n[31] The Federal Court of Appeal has set a very high threshold for the \"unreasonable test,\" requiring nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant in travelling or temporarily relocating to a safe area. There must also be \"actual and concrete\" evidence of such conditions.34\n[32] Having found that the male claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution in Nigeria, the panel has undertaken its \"reasonableness\" analysis from a perspective that sees the female claimant and minor claimants relocating to either of the proposed IFAs on their own, without the presence of the male claimant.\n[33] At the hearing, the panel asked the female claimant whether there are any reasons that she and the children could not live in Port Harcourt or Lagos. She replied that she had worked in Ondo and that the children attended school in Ondo. She stated that they would end up on the street if they had to relocate, that information spreads everywhere in Nigeria and that people would refer to them as children of an outcast. The panel asked the female claimant whether, given her education and employment experience, she would be able to find work in the XXXX industry in Lagos or Port Harcourt. She replied that she is a native of Ondo and has worked her entire life in Ondo, and that if she were to try and get a job elsewhere she would be discriminated against.\n[34] The panel finds the female claimant's explanations of why she and the minor children could not relocate to Port Harcourt or Lagos to be unreasonable. The objective documentary evidence indicates that Lagos and Port Harcourt are major, multi-ethnic urban centres located in the southern regions of Nigeria.35 While ethnicity is noted to be a factor in obtaining employment in the south, it is said to be less of a factor than in the northern regions of the country, where it is considered to play a large part.36 With respect to the testimony that the minor children would be referred to as children of an outcast, the panel considers this to be speculative and dependent on people knowing why she and the minor children were living in either of the IFAs, which she would be under no obligation to disclose.\n[35] The panel notes that both the female claimant and her husband are educated, the former highly so. The female claimant has 17 years of education to her credit and holds a Master's degree in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.37 She has over 10 years of professional employment experience in Nigeria, all within the XXXX industry.38 The objective documentary evidence indicates that just 9% of women aged 15-49 in Nigeria have attended an education institution past the secondary level,39 meaning the female claimant's achievement in education is the exception to the norm in her country.\n[36] In light of their status as large, multi-ethnic urban centres located in the southern part of the country, and the wealth of education and professional employment experience possessed by the female claimant, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that she would be able to pursue her career in XXXX, or another field, in either of the proposed IFAs.\n[37] The panel further notes that the objective documentary evidence indicates that half of the population of Nigeria is Christian and that Christians and Muslims live in equal numbers in central and southwestern Nigeria, including Lagos.40 In the southeastern region of the country, where Port Harcourt is situated, Christians are said to make up the majority of the population.41 The panel notes that the female claimant declared in her BOC42 and testified at the hearing that she is Christian. She declared the same on behalf of the minor claimants.43\n[38] The panel also considered whether it would be objectively reasonable for the female claimant to relocate to Port Harcourt or Lagos as a mother of three children in the absence of her husband. The objective documentary evidence indicates that, in general, women living without male or family support face a number of social and economic challenges in Nigeria, including discrimination in finding employment and housing. However, the objective evidence also indicates that for women who are educated it is easier to manage running a household without male or family support and that women who live without male support are better off living in the southern part of Nigeria than in large northern cities.44 This can be distinguished from the objective evidence relative to Abuja, which indicates, at least in terms of obtaining employment, that regardless of marital status, level of education, ethnicity and social class, women in Abuja face significant challenges in spheres that are seen to be roles reserved for men.45\n[39] The panel has considered a psychological report in evidence,46 prepared by registered psychotherapist XXXX XXXX, but finds that the conclusions reached therein would not render the relocation of the female claimant and minor claimants to Port Harcourt or Lagos unreasonable. Ms. XXXX clinical impression is that the female claimant is exhibiting symptoms consistent with post-traumatic stress, generalized anxiety and depression and that her symptoms will worsen should she be forced to return to Nigeria. The trauma, anxiety and depressive symptoms that the female claimant is believed to be experiencing are also said to be harmful to the minor claimants. Ms. XXXX concludes that a plan of medical and therapeutic care could be implemented for the female claimant. However, there is no evidence before the panel to suggest that such treatment could not be carried out in Nigeria.\n[40] For these reasons, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that it would not be unreasonable for the female claimant and minor claimants to relocate and live Port Harcourt or Lagos.\nCONCLUSION\n[41] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel determines that there is a serious possibility that the male claimant would be persecuted in Nigeria were he to return there, based on his membership in a particular social group, specifically as a bisexual male. Accordingly, the panel accepts his claim.\n[42] Having considered all of the evidence with respect to the female claimant and minor claimants, the panel determines that there is not a serious possibility that they would be persecuted in Nigeria, or that, on a balance of probabilities, they would be personally subjected to a danger of torture, a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment were they to return to Nigeria. Accordingly, the panel rejects their claims.\n(signed)\nK. MacLennan\nK.

Based on consent, the Federal Court returned the claim to the Board for a redetermination, since the minister had failed to disclose all of the documents it had in its possession to the claimant in the last hearings before the Board.\n[2] In summary, regarding a previous decision by this member, the Court ordered,\n(38) This matter must be returned to the RPD member to determine whether the duty of candor was breached; whether this amounted to an abuse of process; and, if so, the appropriate remedy. The Crown must be given a clear opportunity to provide an explanation for its failure to disclose relevant and exculpatory evidence. This will likely require the involvement of counsel who did not participate in decisions respecting disclosure that were made during the first hearing before the RPD.\n(39) The RPD must then consider the adequacy of the Crown's explanation. If no explanation is forthcoming, then the RPD may draw an adverse inference and must state clearly what that inference is. If the evidence establishes, or in inferences drawn, that the Crown's withholding of relevant and exculpatory documents was deliberate, then this will amount to a breach of the duty of candor and the RPD must consider whether it also constitutes an abuse of process. If the answer is yes, then the RPD must fashion an appropriate remedy, bearing in mind that a stay of proceedings or equivalent remedy will be justified only in the \"clearest of cases.\"1\n[3] On August 4, 2017, I ruled the minister was given a clear opportunity to provide an explanation for their failure to disclose relevant and exculpatory evidence over a period of approximately eight months, but failed to do so. The minister failed to demonstrate that they have made sufficient efforts to produce Ms. XXXX as a witness, therefore, negating the necessity of Ms. XXXX's testimony (the minister's preferred witness), since Ms. XXXX's testimony was needed. Since no explanation from the minister is forthcoming, the Court invites me to draw an adverse inference and state clearly what that inference is.\n[4] In my previous decision, I drew an adverse inference that without a credible or reasonable explanation, the minister did not make sufficient efforts to produce Ms. XXXX as a witness. This is despite two specific orders from the Board that the minister produce Ms. XXXX as a witness. The minister's explanation for Ms. XXXX not appearing as a witness was at worst contradictory and at best inadequate. The Board's clear instruction to the minister on the state of Ms. XXXX's employment and medical condition was ignored without a reasonable explanation. As I ruled in my previous decision, the minister's attempt to provide contradictory information on Ms. XXXX's health (for example, when in XXXX 2016, the minister informed the panel that she had suffered a XXXX, only for a medical letter dated several months later to have stated that she had just reported a medical complaint), lack of diligence and unreasonable explanation, in and of itself, do not render the minister's other witness, Ms. XXXX, a necessary witness.\n[5] The minister's lack of diligence and conduct, and their efforts since October 2016 to not call a witness who could provide an explanation for the withholding of relevant and exculpatory evidence, has led me to make an adverse inference on the minister being in breach of their duty of candour. This also constitutes an abuse of process. Since I was left by the Court to fashion an appropriate remedy, bearing in mind that a stay of proceedings or equivalent remedy will be justified only in the \"clearest of cases,\" or that the Minster should be prevented from intervening in Mr. XXXX's claim for refugee status, I invited the parties to either re-iterate earlier submissions on this particular point or to produce other remedies not yet considered within 30 days of receipt of the decision.\n[6] On September 29, 2017, I received submissions from both parties.2 Subsequently, I received an unsolicited response from Mr. XXXX's counsel critiquing the minister's submissions. After that, I received a request from the minister asking for seven days to respond to counsel's submissions. I denied this request and stated that reasons would be given in my written decision. The reason for the denial of the minister's response is that I do not accept counsel's unsolicited response to the minister's submissions. As a Board member, I am quite capable of assessing the merits of the submissions on my own and I do not have need of a running commentary made by both sides of this claim, as has been done so frequently in the past. The purpose of the submissions was to discuss remedy, which I will now attend to.\n[7] The minister does not agree with my conclusions in my August 4, 2017 decision and spent considerable effort to air that disagreement. This is not necessarily the forum to express this opinion, but I will consider it in light of the Minster's proposed remedies. The minister submits that before considering a remedy, that it is important to examine each document as materiality is so crucial to the analysis on remedy and suggests that the member's available remedy is directly linked to the seriousness of the alleged violation. The minister then devotes most of his submissions to make the point that what Mr. XXXX alleged, that the information that has held out to be exculpatory, cannot be viewed as such since the documents referred to have false witness statements, there are incomplete documents and there are other documents unrelated to the issue before the panel. Furthermore, the minister submits that many of the documents alleged to have been withheld were already in disclosure.\n[8] In my view, the minister has missed the point entirely regarding the nature of the previous decision in which I requested remedies, since I had determined that the minister's lack of diligence and conduct to not call a witness who could provide an explanation for withholding of relevant and exculpatory evidence, has led me to make an adverse inference on the minister being in breach of their duty of candour, constituting an abuse of process. Instead, the minister, in my view, is attempting to lead this Board to matters not germane to the issues at hand. The Minster raised arguments about specific documents in relation to the Minster's case regarding whether Mr. XXXX should be excluded from refugee protection, in what appears as to be trying to make the case for exclusion in his submissions, rather than proposing a remedy as was asked for in the first place. The minister neglected entirely to mention the two most contentious documents that were not disclosed at Mr. XXXX's first hearing:\ni. The letter from Mr. XXXX's sister which alleges she changed her earlier testimony to the Public Security Bureau (PSB) after \"being educated\" (which Mr. XXXX alleges is evidence of torture, but this is still to be determined in the full context of a hearing on the merits of the claim and the minister's intervention) and,\nii. The section 38 letter that deals with the possible inadmissibility of a key witness of the minister (a member of the PSB) at the previous hearing.\n[9] The minister submits that he has acted in good faith. While I understand that this is the minister's position, ultimately, it is the panel's duty to reach that conclusion based on the preponderance of the evidence. Contrary to the minister's position, I have already found that the minister's breach of duty of candor, which continued throughout their treatment of my request to either make Ms. XXXX available or to provide a reasonable explanation for not doing it, amounted to an abuse of process. Rather than dealing with an unfavourable decision and responding to my request for remedies, the minister has chosen to spend unnecessary time arguing their disagreement with the merits of my previous decision; raising issues not germane to the request for submissions and for trying to make the case for Mr. XXXX's exclusion, which is the improper avenue for presenting these arguments at this interlocutory stage.\n[10] The minister does make a valid point, generally speaking, about the nature of disclosures made by the Minster in the past as a result of a change in the associated case law that evolved (mostly) after Mr. XXXX's original hearing.3 Rather, the minister stated they did not withhold exculpatory evidence, even though in the two instances mentioned above, this was found to clearly not be the case. Despite the clarification in case law regarding the minister's practice of disclosure, it is clear that at no time should the minister not disclose material that is exculpatory.\n[11] For a remedy, the minister submits that no further action from the panel is required. This proposed remedy has no merit, since I have previously found that the minister is in a breach of the duty of process, therefore, a remedy is required.\n[12] In the alternative, the minister suggests that the panel could order a full hearing de novo in which all exhibits and testimony are removed from the record, and the proceeding begins anew, possibly with a new decision maker from a different IRB jurisdiction and\/or a three member panel (The Chairperson of the IRB appoints three member panels for reasons outside of the scope of the minister's suggestion and is therefore outside of my jurisdiction).\n[13] Counsel for Mr. XXXX provided an alternative remedy as well, which will be discussed below, which has some similarities to the minister's alternative remedy. I will address the alternative remedies after making some remarks about Mr. XXXX's counsel's submissions.\n[14] Counsel for Mr. XXXX submits his original remedy; that the minister's intervention in the claimant's refugee hearing be stayed, that all of the evidence and submissions adduced in the previous hearings be struck from the record and that the Minster be excluded from the hearing into the claim for refugee protection.\n[15] Counsel for Mr. XXXX submits a number of examples regarding how the non-disclosure of evidence was an abuse of process and how he was negatively impacted, and concludes that the case before the tribunal is a significantly more egregious case than the cases on delay (which counsel cited in his submissions). Counsel submits that the serial breaches of the duty of candour and having failed repeatedly to provide proper explanations - is so serious and so undermines the administration of justice and the integrity of this tribunal's process that it calls for a stay of the exclusion proceedings and the minister's participation in the hearing. Counsel submits that the minister intentionally and deliberately withheld exculpatory material from the first tribunal hearing of the claimant's refugee claim. I have not made the same conclusions as counsel in any of my previous decisions. Rather, I have concluded that the minister's lack of diligence and conduct to provide an explanation for withholding of relevant and exculpatory evidence was the reason for me to draw adverse inference on the minister being in breach of their duty of candour, thus amounting to an abuse of process. Admittedly, the minister has been intransigent throughout these proceedings and as counsel submits by inference, in the Federal Court proceedings, but these are not necessarily aggravating factors to constitute the most serious of cases. Indeed, while the section 38 document should have been disclosed earlier (even at the previous hearing) the minister admitted to the oversight and sought to remedy the situation at the earliest opportunity after the discovery of the documents. This mitigates, to a degree, the minister's lack of disclosure previously, but on the other hand, does not lessen the impact this may have had on Mr. XXXX in the previous proceedings.\n[16] Counsel submits that the minister's actions were deliberate with an intention to undermine\nMr. XXXX's opportunity to make full answer and defence and this is serious enough to warrant a stay of the minister's intervention - this from Justice Fothergill's decision which brought this matter back before me. However, the case before me has morphed beyond what I believe Justice Fothergill would have anticipated when he wrote his decision. The Justice could not have been aware that the preferred witness, Ms. XXXX, would be XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The minister has always insisted that Ms. XXXX was the preferred witness and was the most suitable person to provide evidence regarding the reasons for previous nondisclosure and whether or not those documents were considered exculpatory. For reasons of perceived apprehension of bias, if I would hear testimony from a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the decision was made to call her only if it was demonstrated that she became a necessary witness. The minister's failure in this instance was the minister's lack of diligence and conduct and their efforts since October 2016 to not call a witness (Ms. XXXX) who could provide an explanation for withholding of relevant and exculpatory evidence. Therefore, putting the panel in a situation of \"fait accompli,\" without a reasonable explanation, did not turn Ms. XXXX into a necessary witness. As a result, the focus of my finding against the minister relates more to lack of diligence and conduct on the part of the Minster rather than Justice Fothergill's characterization of deliberateness, which took this case outside of the type of remedy reserved for the \"clearest of cases\" of abuse of process; i.e., stay of proceeding.\n[17] Removing the minister as a party in an exclusion case amounts to a stay of proceedings, and this power can be exercised only in the \"clearest of cases.\" While I have already found that the minister's conduct has amounted to an abuse of process, I also find that their misconduct did not reach to the level of being subversive of the entire exclusion process. Their conduct certainly affected the integrity of how some of the minister's evidence was generated and provided to the claimant. This Board's remedy is rectifying this misconduct without resorting to the most extreme remedy reserved for the most vexatious and oppressive behaviour guided by the most improper motivation.\n[18] Now, going back to the point made earlier regarding some similarities between the alternative remedies made by both counsel and minister, I agree that some information must be excluded from any future hearing of Mr. XXXX's claim for refugee protection and the minister's intervention in this case. Since the minister has been found to have breached the duty of candour, some past evidence has become tainted. Therefore, for the sake of natural justice and to ensure that the administration of justice is not brought into disrepute regarding this Tribunal, I order a full hearing de novo in which all exhibits and testimony are removed from the record and the proceeding begins anew before a differently constituted panel. The reasons for this, is that the exhibits have simply become too voluminous and unwieldly, therefore, to scour through the evidence to try to pick out the tainted evidence would be overly cumbersome. Furthermore, there have been consequences against Mr. XXXX resulting from the previous hearing, for which the minister must bear responsibility. To ensure that these consequences against\nMr. XXXX are not propagated in the future, since all evidence and testimony will be removed from the record, in the future hearing, I specifically order the following:\ni. The transcript from the previous hearings will be excluded. As demonstrated, some evidence arising out of the first hearings is tainted and it would not be helpful to the hearing process for the future member to be exposed to tainted evidence. Furthermore, the claimant testified without the benefit of knowledge of all of the relevant and exculpatory evidence, which should have been before him.\nii. Particularly, the evidence arising from the witnesses Officer XXXX and Ms. XXXX is to be excluded. Since the transcript of the original hearing will not be before the future member, and since the Minster has indicated he will not be recalling Officer XXXX, there would be no opportunity for the Mr. XXXX's counsel to cross-examine the evidence relating to these witnesses. In addition, there is still the matter of the section 38 letter, which seems to me, has not been fully resolved, but it is likely to be important information, which should have been before Mr. XXXX at the previous hearings.\niii. The minister will not adduce any further evidence from the PSB directly related to this case, because the evidence emanating from the previous XXXX XXXX must now be considered tainted, a taint which might possibly remain if further evidence is disclosed. As indicated in the minister's submissions, there is other evidence which the minister is able to rely on to make his case involving this intervention in this claim.\n[19] Mr. XXXX's counsel submits that evidence emanating from China should be excluded. This criteria is too broad. There is evidence pertaining to both parties that needs to be brought forward for a full and proper hearing of the case. However, I will make some specific observations and a finding regarding the audit to which Ms. XXXX, the XXXX XXXX, refers to in her previous testimony. Her conclusion, referring to the audit, which both parties made reference to in the previous hearings,4 is that the audit is not reliable at all because, in her opinion, only approximately 20 percent of the audit was disclosed to the Board. Additionally, the Board does not have a letter of engagement which would specify the questions to be answered by the audit, making the audit virtually useless, because she does not know the questions which were asked, which prompted the audit. Furthermore, the Board does not have the appendices referred to in the audit. Ms. XXXX agrees with the assertion that there is no reasonable basis for reliance on the audit report, which she indicates was the opinion of the minister's expert in the last hearings. Therefore, I order that unless the conditions are met in Ms. XXXX's conclusions regarding the audit, that neither party disclose the audit to the future member in future proceedings.\n[20] Finally, I am recusing myself from hearing the merits of this claim since in the interests of natural justice, the claim made by Mr. XXXX and the minister's intervention must be heard by someone with a clear perspective who has not reviewed the tainted evidence and by one who has not had to mitigate an extremely acrimonious relationship between the parties. Both sides to this claim have made a full onslaught against the other in this case, to the extent that there are now 73 exhibits and sub-exhibits amounting to in excess of 10,000 pages of evidence. This is simply unwieldy and untenable for a proper assessment of the evidence which must be considered by a single member in order to conclude this claim. Therefore, taking note of what I have previously ruled, both parties will present evidence to the Board in adherence to the conditions noted earlier. The previously disclosed documents will be boxed and will not be made available to the future member. The consolidated list of documents will start over from the beginning. Finally, the member who has heard these proceedings has recused himself in order that all of the evidence can be presented anew before another member, who will start these proceedings anew. Although it may not be my place, it is my advice that the minister bring new counsel before the next proceedings for the same reasons I have recused myself.\nCONCLUSION\n[21] For the foregoing reasons, this claim will be heard by a differently constituted panel and the hearing will be held de novo with the conditions relating to the exclusion of past evidence and the inclusion of evidence in the future.\n(signed)\nDouglas Cryer\nDouglas Cryer\nOctober 31, 2017\nDate\n1 Shen, Shiyuan v.

You are going to receive a transcript of this decision in the mail and it will have reference to the documentary evidence.\nI am very sorry; the decision I have reached is not a positive one and I do not accept your claim. I know you will be very disappointed with this decision. It is important that you understand the reasons for it, which I am going to give to you now.\nThe principal claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and her husband, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, claim to be citizens of El Salvador. They claim refugee protection, pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \"Act\").1 These are their allegations.\nThe principal claimant is a XXXX-year-old woman born in San Francisco Men\u00e9ndez. In 2007, she took on responsibility of her siblings when her mother left her alcoholic father and went to the U.S (United States).\nIn XXXX 2009, the neighbourhood gang approached her youngest brother for recruitment and he felt pressured into joining. As part of his initiation, he was required to kill someone. The principal claimant found the weapon he was supposed to use and confronted him. Her brother advised that if he did not go through with it, the gang would kill or harm their entire family. The principal claimant made him return the weapon, but he did not come home after several hours. She went out looking for him and found him brutally beaten.\nIn XXXX 2009, this brother fled to the United States. The principal claimant was pressured by the gang to reveal his whereabouts and was accused of hiding him. They threatened to kill her. In XXXX 2010, the principal claimant fled to the U.S. and lived there illegally. She and her husband married this year.\nThe associated claimant is a XXXX-year-old man, also from San Francisco Men\u00e9ndez. He suffered under the mistreatment and negligence of his aunt, who took care of him while his parents were in the U.S.\nIn 2008, the associated claimant was aggressively confronted by gang members who wanted him to join them. In 2009, the claimant moved to another neighbourhood. In 2010, gang members demanded extortion money and that he join them. The gang members began calling and threatening the claimant's family for failing to comply. In XXXX 2012, the associated claimant fled to the U.S.\nOut of fear of deportation, the claimants left the United States and came to Canada this year. They fear that if they return to El Salvador, they will be harmed or killed by gangs.\nI find that the claimants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. These are my reasons.\nThe claimants' identities as nationals of El Salvador are established by their testimony and passports in evidence.2 I am satisfied of their identities by these documents.\nIn terms of credibility, at the hearing, the claimants both testified in a direct, concise and earnest manner that was compelling. They did not exaggerate their allegations and gave testimony that was consistent with the other evidence before me. They submitted corroborative statements from witnesses who verified their circumstances in El Salvador. Based on the presumption of truthfulness, the claimants' consistent testimony and the corroborative evidence, I find them to be credible.\nI have compassion for the claimants. They endured a great deal of hardship in El Salvador and were robbed of childhood and opportunity. They are both bright, articulate and deserving. Having said that, in order for their claims to be accepted, they must demonstrate that they face a serious possibility of persecution based on their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. Alternatively, they must prove that they face a personalized risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment that is not faced, generally, by other Salvadorans. There was insufficient evidence before me to demonstrate that this is the case today.\nIn the case of the principal claimant, her brother left El Salvador in XXXX 2009. Despite the threats against her, she remained in the country until XXXX 2010 without coming to harm.\nI acknowledge that she had to curb her activities and remain indoors a lot. Her brother was deported to El Salvador ten months ago and has not been harmed, though he has been moving around to stay safe. After the principal claimant's 2010 departure, her father and other brother remained in the country and still live in the same place. Her father works in XXXX and her brother XXXX XXXX. They have not been harmed in the last eight years, despite the threats against the entire family. There is insufficient evidence that they suffered treatment that amounts to persecution or section 97 risks that would indicate a prospect of serious, sustained or systematic violations of the principal claimant's human rights based on a Convention ground. Likewise, there is insufficient evidence to indicate that this would be personalized and unlike one that other Salvadorans face, generally, due to the general security problems there.\nGiven the lengthy passage of time - seven years since she left the country - and the absence of any evidence of an enduring threat, I am unable to find that she faces a serious possibility of persecution for a Convention reason or a likely personalized risk, even when giving regard to the Gender Guidelines.3\nI find that the analysis for the associated claimant is similar. He continued to live in El Salvador for several years after he was first approached for recruitment. He did not come to harm, though I considered that he also had to curb his activity. He is not sure whether his mother paid some extortion, but knows that the gang demanded a sum of money that the family could not afford. After he left the country in 2012, there is no evidence that his mother, brother and sisters, who remained in the country for a couple of years, faced harm, including gender-based violence.\nThe associated claimant has been gone for over five years now and there is insufficient evidence before me of an active threat. Though the associated claimant is still young, he has matured beyond the age that gang members in Central America target for recruitment. I find insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the associated claimant would be targeted for one of the Convention grounds or that his risk is one that is something other than what Salvadorans generally face.\nThe claimants' fear today is one based in criminality, which is not a Convention reason. Neither of the claimants have anything in their profile that would suggest that the past threats against them would carry on because of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or a political opinion or a personalized risk, so many years later.\nI accept that the claimants are very fearful. I acknowledge that gangsters in El Salvador are brutal and vindictive. I also considered that El Salvador has the highest homicide rate in the world, outside of countries at war. In terms of their profiles, the principal claimant is a woman who encouraged her brother to resist recruitment, and the associate claimant avoided recruitment and his mother did not pay extortion. While these are considered slights to a gang, I have insufficient evidence that the claimants' actions would keep the threats against them active after many years, and would indicate a serious, sustained or systematic violation of human rights based on a Convention ground, or a risk that is not generalized, today.\nHaving considered all of the evidence, I find that there is no serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a risk of other personalized harm, if the claimants returned to El Salvador, and I do not accept their claims under sections 96 or 97 of the Act.\nThis matter is concluded.\nWhen written reasons are issued, the written form is edited for syntax and grammar, and reference to the applicable case law and documentary evidence will also be added.\n--- PROCEEDINGS CONCLUDED\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibit 1.\n3 Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson's Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution, Ottawa, Canada, March 1993, updated November 1996.\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nVB7-04497\/04505\nXXXXX XXXXX XXXXX\nXXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX\nVB7-04497\/04505\nXXXXX XXXXX XXXXX\nXXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX\n",

The claimant's partner's narrative indicates that he and the claimant are a male gay couple who have become targets of Croatian society due to intolerance toward homosexuals. The former associated claimant described mistreatment in the town where both of them lived in Belisce in Croatia, where they had met and fallen in love in July 2012. The two men visited the partner's brother's gravesite, and were chased by a group of people who recognized them. The partner was attacked, but the claimant fled for home. The couple did not go to police and thought they should seek a more permanent solution to their problems. They fled Croatia on XXXX XXXX, 2012, and claimed protection in Canada.\n[3] After the associated claimants made a refugee claim together, the claimant who is before me applied to have the claims separated, in December 2014, based on the relationship having ended and no longer being amicable. Prior to the hearing of this claim, on August 28, 2017, the claimant submitted an updated narrative which provides more information about the claimant's\nown allegations about his life in Croatia, and about circumstances subsequent to the filing of the refugee claim.3 Those allegations are briefly summarized as follows:\n[4] The claimant grew up in a home with his father after his parents split up when he was 10 or 11 years old. School children physically and verbally abused and bullied him. The claimant often spent time with his grandfather. When the claimant was around 16 he began to explore his interest in boys, and began a relationship with another boy named XXXX that lasted about two or three years. The claimant continued to experience harassment and physical attacks. In April\/May, 2011, one of his tormenters put a stick in the spokes of his motor scooter, causing him to have an accident, injuring his leg. The claimant believes his father heard rumours about XXXX and the claimant, because the father, without explanation, took him to his mother's home to live. The claimant was open with his mother about his sexual orientation. The claimant met XXXX (his former associated claimant) in 2012. He fell in love. He was new to XXXX town of Belisce, but XXXX already had a reputation there. People would harass them and throw things at them. After one incident of harassment, the couple called the police, but the police did nothing. The incident when they decided to leave was when people recognized them and attacked XXXX, while the claimant escaped and ran home, as described in XXXX narrative. The couple came to Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2012 and claimed protection. They lived together for about two years, but one day XXXX moved out without giving information to the claimant. The claimant since learned that XXXX has married a woman in Canada and the claimant believes it is for immigration purposes. He himself has not pursued any new relationships in Canada.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] I find that the claimant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\n[6] The claimant's identity as a citizen of Croatia is established by his testimony and the supporting documentation filed, namely his passport.4\n[7] With respect to the claimant's identity as a gay person, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has established his sexual orientation. I recognize, as pointed out by the Minister's representative in submissions, that there were a number of inconsistencies and omissions in the evidence. These discrepancies relate to a variety of matters, including evidence about the claimant's alleged initial sexual experiences as a teenager in Croatia, and the information he provided to his colleagues in Canada about his sexual orientation. I have balanced the concerns regarding the claimant's inconsistencies in testimony against the claimant's frank oral testimony about his reasons for his failure to establish any relationships in Canada since the break-up of the relationship with XXXX, the man with whom he originally claimed refugee protection, and the claimant's expressed challenges with recounting dates and sequential information. Although I agree with the Minister's Representative that the inconsistencies noted demonstrate a lack of credibility with respect to some particular incidents that allegedly occurred, I also observe that when it came to the claimant's portrayal of his personal expression of his sexual orientation, his evidence was generally consistent. I also note that the two witnesses-while clearly not aware of all the details of the claimant's personal circumstances-do appear to genuinely believe, based on their daily interactions and conversations with the claimant over the course of an extended time period of working together, that the claimant is gay.\n[8] Credibility is established on a balance of probabilities. In this case, my weighing of the evidence, specifically relating the claimant's identity as a gay man, leads me to conclude that the claimant is more likely than not credible in stating that he is gay.\n[9] My finding of fact with respect to the claimant's sexual orientation does not transpose to a finding that the claimant is necessarily credible in all of the details outlined in his narrative. However, as outlined in my analysis below, the determinative issue in the claim is the availability of an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) for the claimant. The claimant has not lived in Croatia for five years due to the delay in hearing his refugee claim, and his case does not depend on establishing personal targeting from any individual or party who knew him from before and might track him to a new location; rather, he bases his claim on whether he would be able to safely live as a gay person in his country. Given my central finding in the case-that the claimant is a gay man-and the fact that I have assessed the claimant's forward-looking risk with respect to his relocating to an IFA of Zagreb, the credibility of particular events in the claimant's past does not impact the analysis of his ability to live safely in Zagreb at this time. Additionally, for the purposes of analyzing the claimant's alternative claim that compelling reasons may apply to his case, as indicated below, even if I accept the claimant's description of the bullying he experienced in school as a young person, I have not found that these circumstances constitute compelling reasons to accept his claim. I will therefore not engage in an extensive review of all discrepancies present in the evidence and raised by the Minister in submissions because in this case those matters do not impact the analysis with respect to the determinative issues.\n[10] I have taken into account the Chairperson's Guideline on Proceedings Before the Immigration and Board of Canada Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression (\"The SOGIE Guidelines\")5 in connection with this claim.\n[11] The determinative issue in the claim is the availability of an IFA for the claimant. The claimant was put on notice at the hearing that the IFA was a relevant consideration in his claim. In this case I find that the claimant has a viable IFA in the city of Zagreb, Croatia.\n[12] The IFA test has two prongs,6 namely the panel must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that (1) there is no serious possibility7 of the claimant being persecuted or, on the balance of probabilities, in danger of torture or subjected to a risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the IFA; and (2) that conditions in that part of the country are such that it would not be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for him to seek refuge there. These are my reasons for finding that a viable IFA exists for the claimant.\n[13] The first question is whether the claimant would find safety in the city of Zagreb. The claimant has never lived in a big city in Croatia. He lived most of his life in the town of Bizovac, either with his father or his grandfather. More recently, in July 2012, when he was 21 years old, he moved to his mother's town of Belisce, and lived with her, as well as with his partner XXXX, until November 2012, when he moved to Canada. Both Bizovac and Belisce are small towns in the same general area of Croatia.\n[14] Whether or not the specifics of the claimant's allegations about his sexual experiences with XXXX are accurate, I accept that the claimant experienced harassment and taunting in his school years growing up in Croatia, based on his classmates' perception of the claimant as being gay. Such societal treatment, particularly in a small town, would be consistent with country condition documents which describe discriminatory attitudes toward LGBTIQ persons in Croatia. In consideration of the delay in the hearing of the refugee claim, counsel provided country condition documents that spanned the time period when the claimant left his country in 2012. The 2012 review of treatment of sexual minorities in Croatia noted that \"several sources state that sexual minorities are not socially accepted,\" and that the 2010 United States Department of State (DOS) Report had indicated that \"'societal discrimination against LGBT persons was frequently manifested by insults, stereotypical jokes, and societal prejudices.'\"8 The claimant's description of mistreatment based on sexual orientation, while living in towns that are in the eastern section of Croatia, is also consistent with information that-in the 2012 report-\"sexual minorities are more accepted in northern Croatia, particularly in Zagreb County, as well as in western Croatia, more particularly in Istria, Primorje and the city of Rijeka. The representative [of the Center for LBGT Equality] stated that other regions of the country are 'hostile' towards sexual minorities.\"9\n[15] The claimant would have been living in an area of the country that was less accepting of sexual minorities. This means that even at the time the claimant left Croatia, it would make sense that an IFA of Zagreb would have likely been explored as an option for his attempt to seek safety.\n[16] In assessing the claimant's forward-looking risk, I note that in general country conditions for LGBTIQ persons in Croatia have improved over the past several years, although there are still problems. I have considered the evidence before me about the situation for gay people in the country in general and in Zagreb in particular, and conclude that attitudes in Zagreb are such that the claimant could safely live his life openly as a gay person as he desires to. Although homophobic attitudes persist, in particular among certain extremist groups, if the claimant did encounter discriminatory or violent treatment in Zagreb, legislation and enforcement is present such that I conclude that effective state protection is available to the claimant. I will provide a review of the country evidence that leads me to these conclusions.\n[17] Within Croatia, documents point to a situation of fairly progressive legislation in a context of generally discriminatory public opinion. Over the course of the time period that the\nclaimant was growing up in his country, it is apparent from the historical documents provided by counsel that there was a growing body of legislation addressing a range of protections for LGBTIQ persons. For example, in 2003, sexual orientation was explicitly identified in articles prohibiting discrimination, and, in 2006, the Criminal Code was amended to include a definition of hate crimes as an aggravating circumstance in the commission of crimes.10 In 2008 the Anti-Discrimination Act widened the institutional framework for protection from discrimination, and gave greater powers to the ombudsman responsible for elimination of discrimination.11 The right of assembly is illustrated in the fact that Zagreb Pride has held an event annually since 2002, although not without instances of counter-protests and attacks on LGBT people in other parts of Zagreb on the day of the event.12 More recently, in 2014, parliament passed a law allowing same-sex civil unions, affording same-sex couples equal rights in several areas, except for the ability to adopt children.13 As the Minister's representative pointed out, in 2017 Rainbow Europe gave Croatia a score of 60% on the range of respect for human rights and equality, in a similar zone of protections as countries such as Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden.14 These specific examples support the overall description, in the 2016 Freedom House report, that \"(r)espect for minority rights has improved over the past decade.\"15\n[18] Counsel argued in submissions that that progress in legislation was made under pressure from the European Union and to support Croatia's inclusion in the EU. She also noted that the legislation exists in the face of significant homophobia in the country, and that the legislation has not significantly addressed prejudices in society. With respect to the incentives to implementation of legislation as a result of being in the EU, I do not find that this is a negative factor. In fact, being in the EU allows for ongoing monitoring of implementation of legislation and for an appeal process for victims of discriminatory treatment. I will address the question of the effectiveness of the state protection processes below.\n[19] With respect to prejudice in Croatia, as referenced by counsel, it is acknowledged that societal attitudes in Croatia lag the advancements made in legislation. As counsel pointed out in submissions, the chart comparing the situation of LGBTI persons in Europe, in which Croatia appears to have a relatively strong ranking, relates to legal and policy rights, and does not directly address societal attitudes. Meanwhile, various documents describe a troubling rate of acceptance for integration of LGBTIQ persons in Croatian society in general, including negative attitudes about public display of affection among same-sex couples, beliefs that LGBTIQ persons have negative impact on society,16 and an overall situation in which the \"general population still has strong prejudices towards LGBT persons,\" with some sources describing homophobia as \"'deeply' embedded in Croatian society.\"17 As indicated in the ILGA-Europe Annual Review 2017, \"In spite of the existence of well-developed equality and hate crime\/speech legislation, public attitudes to same-sex couples do not seem to have evolved in a similar manner.\"18 At the same time, there is some improvement, as a representative of Zagreb Pride describes attitudes as \"still rather reserved, but acceptance is growing.\"19 A representative of the Centre for Peace Studies in Croatia, while pointing to ongoing concerns for violence from \"radical groups who hide behind civil society,\" also stated that the \"situation is much better today than 15 years ago,\" and that \"Croatia has made significant progress.\"20\n[20] Having reviewed this evidence, I conclude that there has been significant improvement in legislation in Croatia protecting the rights of LGBTIQ persons, but that progress in societal attitudes has been slower, and the general attitude of the public remains of significant concern. In light of this situation, I have considered the particular situation of Zagreb. As highlighted above, even years ago Zagreb was perceived to be among the locations in Croatia where there was a higher level of acceptance of sexual minorities. Documents note that at the current time the Zagreb Pride festival hosts 10,000 persons each year, and the organizer of the event says \"Zagreb is a place where people feel comfortable.\"21 In 2013, the Coordinator of Zagreb Pride, while noting concerns with societal attitudes, also stated that \"acceptance of LBGT people in Zagreb has grown within the past couple of years and that LBGT people have become 'generally more visible.'\"22 In 2017, a journalist from the Croatian LGBT New portal Crol.hr stated that Zagreb \"also has an LGBT centre, with gay clubs and bars.\"23 I conclude that, given the differences outlined and the presence of various outlets for public expression of sexual orientation, including both the annual event of the Pride parade, as well as on-going availability of gay-friendly social venues, it is reasonable to assume that societal attitudes in Zagreb are-while not perfect-better than those present in the rest of the country and better than those that existed at the time when the claimant left Croatia. While societal attitudes in a large centre such as Zagreb may at times be discriminatory, I do not find - based on the country evidence before me - that the claimant has demonstrated that the existence of some negative attitudes and stereotypes that are likely present to some degree in Zagreb are sufficient to, on their own, constitute persecution, including on a cumulative basis.\n[21] This review of the situation in Zagreb leads me to conclude that the claimant does not face a serious possibility of persecution on the ground of his sexual orientation in Zagreb. However, if I am wrong and if the claimant is ever persecuted in Zagreb, he has a duty to seek state protection. I find that the claimant has not provided clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption that state protection is available to him in the proposed IFA location. My review of documentary evidence leads me to conclude that there is a demonstrated improvement in the protection of sexual minorities in Croatia, that the government is making serious efforts to protect its citizens, and that these efforts demonstrate operational effectiveness, particularly when considering the range of recourse available to citizens. The Minister's representative highlighted the fact that Croatia has a generally strong score in Freedom House's 2016 overview\nof democratic rights.24 Specifically with respect to legislation regarding the protection of citizens based on sexual orientation, as noted above, sources agree that Croatia has implemented progressive legislation. With respect to awareness of the legislation, Zagreb Pride stated in 2015 that the police \"regularly\" participate in LBGT sensitization training sessions.25 More recent information indicates that \"NGO Zagreb Pride conducted trainings on a range of issues, including LBGTIQ terminology, human rights, hate crime and support for victims. 142 police offices, 29 state attorneys; criminal and magistrate judges, and 15 victim\/witness support staff were trained throughout the year.\"26 A representative of Zagreb Pride has indicated that the attitude of the Croatian authorities has improved between 2011 and 2015.27\n[22] I realize that it is important to examine the degree of actual implementation and effectiveness of laws and programs protecting sexual minorities.28 With respect to police and state authorities' response to hate crimes, incidents of violence, or discriminatory treatment of LBGTIQ persons, particularly in Zagreb, documents note that although there was inconsistency in the handling of cases, \"police (in Croatia) were responsive to reported violations against LGBTI persons.\"29 A representative of Zagreb Pride describe police protection from hate crimes in Zagreb as \"satisfactory.\"30 Specific examples of the response of authorities include the quick arrival of police to an instance of a homophobic attack at a nightclub in 2017,31 followed by strong condemnation and promises for a rapid investigation.32 Although in 2009, the police were criticized for doing nothing to prevent violence in the Pride event,33 in 2012 Amnesty International described the Zagreb Pride event as \"well protected by police.\"34 In 2016 \"Authorities opened 20 investigations of public incitement to violence and hatred in response to the online bullying and harassment of LGBTI persons in the first three months of the year.\"35 In 2015, in the Response to Information Request (RIR) research, there were several comments made by LGBTIQ victims of harassment or discrimination in which the victims did not advance a complaint due to a perception that there was no point in complaining since they believed the response would be inadequate anyway. However, there are also example of specific responses to crimes, of categorization of some crimes as \"hate crimes,\" of access to an Ombudsman, and of government officials taking a public stance in favour of protection of LGBT people.36 Examples such as these lead me to find, on a balance of probabilities, that the state protection available to the claimant in Zagreb goes beyond mere lip service and authorities' good intentions in legislation and demonstrates operational effectiveness.\n[23] Specifically with respect to employment discrimination, which is also relevant to the second prong of the IFA analysis regarding whether it is reasonable for the claimant to locate in the proposed city of Zagreb, I acknowledge that the information in the most recent United States DOS report, as pointed out by counsel, describes a lack of regulations for state or private employers regarding discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and that LGBTI persons refrained from publicly expressing their sexual orientation because of vulnerability to termination of employment. At the same time, the general description of the enforcement of anti-discrimination legislation, including on the basis of sexual orientation, states that the government generally enforced these laws, and that \"penalties for violations of employment discrimination law included fines up to 40,000 kunas ($6,100) and were generally sufficient to deter violations.\"37 In these circumstances, I find that the documents demonstrate that there are options for complaint in cases of employment discrimination, and that there are actual cases in which laws are enforced. Meanwhile, if the laws are successful in providing for a general deterrence against discriminatory treatment, as described in the most recent DOS Report, then this is evidence that there is at least some degree of effectiveness in the implementation of the legislation. In addition, in connection with discrimination issues, on February 23, 2016, the European Court of Human Rights upheld the complaint of a same sex couple to be reunited through a residence permit in Croatia, after initial refusals at the levels of local police, interior ministry, and local Courts.38 This demonstrates that there is a layered system of access to state protection, in a case of discriminatory treatment, including through appeals that may rely on overview by the EU.\n[24] As summarized by LGBT activists recently, due to a number of factors, including changing government support, a background of lack of strong leadership, and rooted homophobia in society, instances of violence do occur in Croatia, in spite of significant progress and a much better situation than existed fifteen years ago.39 However, in those cases where LGBT persons are victimized by hate crimes or by discrimination, a strong framework of legislation provides access to state protection for those who are willing to complain. If there is a breakdown in initial support, an analysis of the evidence leads me to conclude that there is adequate and effective state protection through appeals to further levels of complaint, and ultimately through EU mechanisms, to which-through its membership-Croatia has assented to be subject. This is particularly the case in the city of Zagreb, where the police have been proactive in training and where the level of acceptance of LGBTIQ persons is stronger than throughout the rest of the country. With respect to counsel's argument in submissions that the claimant faces cumulative discrimination amounting to persecution, I also find that there is adequate state protection, with multiple examples of effective resolution in the cases of discriminatory treatment of LGBT persons in Croatia. In addition, although there are significant concerns for protection of rights and safety for transgender people,40 this particular area of concern would not apply to the claimant in his circumstances as a gay man.\n[25]\nThe onus is on the claimant to demonstrate that he cannot safely live in a proposed IFA location. In this case, the claimant did not demonstrate that-if he encountered problems in Zagreb--state protection would not be reasonably available to him there. I do not find that the examples of local failures in certain instances or of a subjective reluctance on the part of some victims to access state protection is sufficient to demonstrate that the IFA of Zagreb is not safe for the claimant. I therefore conclude that if the claimant were to return to his country he could live safely, with access to adequate and effective state protection, in the city of Zagreb.\n[26] I have also considered, under the second prong of the IFA analysis, whether it is reasonable, in all of the claimant's particular circumstances, for him to relocate to the city of Zagreb. The claimant alleges that he would have difficulty finding a job or housing in Zagreb due to his sexual orientation. I note that when the claimant lived in Croatia, he only lived in a small town. Since coming to Canada, on the other hand, he has demonstrated resourcefulness by adapting to life in the large cities of Toronto, Mississauga, and Ottawa, where he has managed to secure jobs in construction and general labour, in spite of the hurdles of using his limited English. Even in Canada, the claimant did not disclose his sexual orientation to his work colleagues or other people he met until well after he had developed long-term good relationships with them. However, if the claimant becomes more open in general about his sexual orientation than he has been in Canada, which is his right in a proposed IFA location,41 and if he encountered instances of discrimination in securing housing or employment on the grounds of his sexual orientation, then in the consideration of legislation and implementation of anti-discrimination laws in Croatia as noted above, he has the option of pursuing such a complaint. As noted above, although there is some uneven implementation and enforcement of laws, the legislation protecting from discrimination is generally enforced. Furthermore, in consideration of uneven implementation, it makes sense that in Zagreb, where societal attitudes are most tolerant of sexual minorities, the claimant would have the strongest protection based on legislation. I therefore find that it is likely that the claimant could secure employment and housing in Zagreb, as he has done in Canada, and that if he encountered problems, he has access to protective legislation to correct the situation.\n[27] With respect to social experiences, again, in Canada, the claimant has generally not tried to find any new romantic partners since his break-up with his former partner, and he has been reticent in sharing personal information about his sexual orientation. However, considering the availability of gay clubs and LGBT support groups in Zagreb, I find that if the claimant wished to access more of a social scene or to meet other gay men, such options would be available to him in Zagreb. The claimant currently talks regularly to his mother, who is accepting of him, on the telephone, but has minimal contact with his father in Croatia. It does not appear likely that his father, who is not accepting of the claimant's sexual orientation, would even come to know that the claimant had returned to his country. I therefore find that the proximity of family members does not appear to be a significant factor in the claimant's personal circumstances.\n[28] In consideration of the claimant's personal circumstances, I therefore find that it is reasonable for the claimant to relocate to Zagreb upon his return to Croatia.\n[29] The availability of a viable IFA applies to a person's claim pursuant to both sections 96 and 97 of the Act. The claim therefore fails with respect to both sections.\n[30] Counsel also advanced an argument for compelling reasons, in consideration of the possibility that changed country conditions in Croatia would impact the assessment of the claim. As indicated in s. 108 (4) of the Act, when the reasons for which a person sought refugee protection have ceased to exist, the claim is not rejected if the person \"establishes that there are compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution, torture, treatment or punishment for refusing to avail themselves of the protection of the country which they left, or outside of which they remained, due to such previous persecution, torture, treatment or punishment.\" The claimant made his claim for refugee protection in 2012. Since the time his claim was made, his own circumstances have changed, and the man with whom he was in a relationship has left the claimant. In addition, the situation in Croatia has improved over the past five years, as evidenced in the above discussion.\n[31] In this case, the first issue with respect to compelling reasons is that the claimant would have to establish that he was a refugee at a previous time, such as when he arrived in Canada in 2012. As indicated above, if the claim had been assessed at the time the claimant first left Croatia, Zagreb would clearly have been considered as a potential IFA for the claimant, including an assessment of state protection at that time. Although it is possible that the conclusions would have been the same as in the current case, despite conditions that were not as good in Croatia as they are today, I will not engage in a complete analysis of the claim as of 2012. This is because, even if it were accepted that the claimant would have been a refugee at some point in the past, I do not find that there was previous persecution, torture, treatment or punishment that was so severe as to raise the application of compelling reasons to the claimant's case.\n[32] The Federal Court case of Moya42 reviews the case law dealing with compelling reasons and differing streams of jurisprudence regarding the circumstances in which the Board may or must engage in an analysis of compelling reasons. As summarized by this case, compelling reasons are engaged in some cases when there is \"prima facie evidence of past persecution that is so exceptional in its severity as to rise to the level of 'appalling' or 'atrocious.'\" In addition, by a different line of cases, \"the requirements of subsection 108(4) may be met when past persecution is not demonstrated to be appalling or atrocious, but ... these situations must be 'truly exceptional or extraordinary' relative to other cases.\" Moya also reviews other matters that I find are relevant to the consideration before me. It notes the principle that \"the compelling reasons exception is directed at a special and limited category,\" and notes the \"duty to consider the level of atrocity, as well as the impact on the applicant's physical and mental state to determine whether an experience constituted compelling reasons.\" Moya indicates that the broader interpretation of the compelling reasons exception goes beyond appalling and atrocious and may include \"consideration of the trauma caused by repatriation as a compelling reason.\"43 Both lines of reasoning require an exceptional or extraordinary level of past persecution, which I have not found in this case.\n[33] Counsel argues that the repeated bullying the claimant endured in school as a child growing up constitute such compelling reasons. I do not agree. Although such problems are reprehensible and are clearly difficult for a young person to endure, they do not constitute exceptional or extraordinary conditions relative to other cases of persecution presented in refugee claims. The claimant described one incident in which he had to seek medical attention following bullying behavior, namely when someone caused his motor scooter to crash by putting in a stick in the spokes while the claimant was riding. Although this fall resulted in an injury to the claimant's head and left a scar and bruises on the claimant's leg,44 these injuries are not consistent with the kind of appalling or atrocious harm that may be present in those refugee claimants who have, for example, endured such horrible mistreatment as sustained or repeated state-sponsored torture or FGM for female claimants. Meanwhile, the claimant has not submitted current psychiatric or medical evidence regarding long-term psychological or physical consequences of the taunting he endured in school or the discrimination he faced in Croatia as a gay person which would impact potential trauma of repatriation. I therefore do not find that the case for compelling reasons has been made.\nCONCLUSION\n[34] For the foregoing reasons, I conclude that XXXX XXXX is not a Convention refugee and not a person in need of protection and I therefore reject his claim.\n(signed)\n\"Lucinda Bruin\"\nLucinda Bruin\nOctober 17, 2017\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibit 2.\n3 Exhibit 7, pp. 1-24.\n4 Exhibit 1.\n5 Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson's Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression Effective date: May 1, 2017.\n6 Rasaratnam v.

The claimants are now all adults.\n[3] This decision pertains to the de novo hearing of the claim pursuant to the Federal Court order of Justice Russell dated June 15, 2012 which set aside the earlier decision of this Board.1\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The claimants allege that they are targeted by members of the XXXX clan in Albania after the principal claimant's uncle (\"XXXX XXXX\", from now referred to as the uncle) killed XXXX XXXX by mistake in 1999 in connection with an unrelated blood feud. The claimants allege that by around XXXX 1999, they became aware that the uncle was arrested for murder and that the XXXX clan has formally announced the commencement of a blood feud with the XXXX clan. The claimant allege that they attempted to obtain police protection at that the time but that protection was not forthcoming. The claimants allege that they separately left Albania by 2000, first to the U.S. where they unsuccessfully claimed asylum and then fled to Canada by 2009 once their U.S. appeals were exhausted. The claimants allege that there are no longer any male members of the XXXX clan left in Albania with the exception of the uncle who is still in jail and therefore out of reach from the XXXX clan. The principal claimant and male claimant fear being targeted for revenge killing under the XXXX as XXXX males. The female claimant fears that the XXXX clan would hurt her despite being female or that she may be victimized collaterally. The claimants allege that the passage of time since the blood feud started, now approaching 18 years, has not reduced the XXXX clan's desire for revenge.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] I find that the claimants are not Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, nor are they persons in need of protection, pursuant to section 97(1) of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\n[6] The determinative issue in this case were whether the claimants successfully rebutted the presumption of state protection.\nIdentity\n[7] The claimants' identities as nationals of Albania are established on the basis of their testimonies and their passports.2\nNexus\n[8] Counsel submitted that this case does not have a nexus to the Convention. I agree. Accordingly, this case was assessed under section 97(1) of IRPA.\nCredibility and reliability\n[9] In his reasons granting judicial review of the prior decision of this Board, Justice Russell made the following observations concerning the Board's prior treatment of the principal claimant's testimony:\n\u00b657 The RPD had reason to be suspicious of the Principal Applicant's narrative. He seemed confused and inconsistent as to how he was notified of the blood feud. The same problem occurred when he was asked when his family went into self-confinement...\n...\n\u00b673 This is a difficult Decision to review because it seems to me that the RPD had reason to doubt and question the Principal Applicant's credibility... I am not saying that the Principal Applicant is a reliable witness. However, as it stands, I do not think that his claim has yet been reasonably assessed.3\n[10] The principal claimant's testimony in the de novo hearing before me was similarly concerning. For example, his testimony with respect to the date of the uncle's arrest (late XXXX or early XXXX 1999) was inconsistent with the Fier Court decision which indicates that the uncle was arrested on XXXX XXXX, 1999.4 The principal claimant explained that the Court decision is wrong. I do not accept this explanation as reasonable because the Albanian Court decision appears genuine on its face and there is no suggestion that it is fake. Foreign state issued documents are presumptively authoritative. The decision itself is quite detailed and contemporaneous with old events. I prefer the Fier Court decision over the testimony of the principal claimant.\n[11] The principal claimant was also inconsistent about how he learned that his uncle had killed someone. In his testimony de novo, he stated that he first learned of the murder by his uncle told him (and a number of other household members) personally. This is inconsistent with what the principal claimant told the Board in the hearing before Member Berry where he said that he only learned that his uncle murdered someone when the police arrested his uncle. The principal claimant explained that he was nervous at the hearing before Member Berry. I find this explanation also not reasonable because he was represented by counsel at the time and he affirmed that he would tell the Board the truth.\n[12] Notwithstanding the lack of reasonable explanations for these inconsistencies, I find that I accept counsel's submission to the effect that these are minor inconsistencies and that some leeway should be granted in the context of memories of events that occurred 18 years ago. I agree with counsel that the principal claimant and his co-claimants are generally truthful witnesses. I do not doubt their honesty. However, I find that these inconsistencies and the lengthy passage of time has affected the reliability of the principal claimant's testimony and that of the other claimants. I find there is insufficient reliable evidence to establish exactly when the claimants learned that the uncle murdered someone and when he was arrested. However, I find that these are not material problems because there is sufficient documentary evidence on the record to otherwise establish that the uncle was arrested in late 1999 and that the blood feud was declared by the XXXX clan sometime in late 1999 as well. While inexact, these factual findings are sufficient to establish the claimant's allegations in basic form. I find that there is sufficient evidence that the claimants are targeted as alleged by the XXXX clan.\n[13] While I find that the claimants are credible, I find that the reliability of their testimony has been adversely affected. Their lack of reliability, mainly due to the staleness of their personal knowledge about conditions in Albania, affects the sufficiency of their evidence in the analysis of state protection.\nThe claimants have failed to rebut the presumption of state protection\n[14] The claimants have not rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence which is sufficient to dismiss these claims.\n[15] There is a presumption that the state is capable of protecting its citizens except in situations where the state is in complete breakdown.5 Claimants who allege that the state protection is inadequate must persuade the Board that the evidence establishes that the state protection is inadequate.6 The evidence that state protection is inadequate must not only be reliable and probative, it must also satisfy the Board, on a balance of probabilities, that the state protection is inadequate.7\n[16] Claimants can rebut the presumption by providing clear and convincing evidence of the state's inability to protect.8 The onus is on the claimants to approach the state for protection in situations where state protection might reasonably be forthcoming.9\n[17] No government can be expected to guarantee perfect protection of all of its citizens at all times, and the fact that a state is not always successful in protecting its citizens is not enough to justify a claim. This is particularly true when a state is in effective control of its territory and has military, police, and civil authorities in place and is making serious attempts to protect its citizens.10\n[18] The burden of proving an absence of state protection is directly proportional to the level of democracy that exists in the state.11 The documentary evidence before me indicates that Albania is a functioning democracy.12 Albania is in control of its territory and has functioning security forces, both military and police, in place. There is no evidence of a total breakdown of state authority in Albania.\n[19] Furthermore, the claimants cannot rebut the presumption of state protection in a functioning democracy by asserting only a subjective reluctance to engage the state.13\n[20] For the reasons provided, I find that the claimants have not provided sufficient evidence that is clear and convincing demonstrating state protection is inadequate at the operational level and relevant to the claimants' circumstances in Albania on a forward looking basis.\n[21] The claimants' evidence with respect to seeking police protection consists of two separate attendances by the female claimant at the Shkodr police stations in the years 1999 and 2000. The first time she went to the police was at the behest of the principal claimant to report the existence of the blood feud and the fear form the XXXX clan because the principal claimant was in self-confinement (the male claimant would have been seven years old at the time). The second time would have occurred later after the female claimant's third and last visit to the uncle in jail when she was threatened by men from the XXXX clan who wanted to know where her XXXX men lived.\n[22] The claimants do not have any documentation from the police concerning these two reports. Nevertheless, I accept the female claimant's account that she went to the police twice, once XXXX XXXX 1999 and once in XXXX 2000. I accept that the police basically told her on both occasions that they could not undertake to protect everyone that is threatened due to blood feud and they can only try to catch the murderers after the fact. The claimants were understandably dissatisfied with the police response.\n[23] The inherent problem with the claimants' testimony is that it consists of knowledge and experiences from 18 years ago which I find is quite dated and stale and ultimately not representative of the current evidence with respect to police protection in Albania. State protection is a forward looking assessments especially in cases such as these. I find that the current evidence indicates that on a balance of probabilities, Albania police can and will provide the claimants with adequate and effective state protection against any criminal offense committed against them as a result of the blood feud with the XXXX clan.\n[24] The country documentation indicates that by 2011 the government has instituted a number of reforms to strengthen the protection of blood victims and to investigate the criminal who perpetrate such crimes, including:\n(i) establishing special structures for the fight against blood feud, especially in areas when this phenomenon is widely spread like in the districts of Shkodra, Lezha, Kukes, Diber, etc.;\n(ii) selecting the staff and their continuous training on specific issues related to prevention and reveal of murders in general and those of blood avenge or vengeance in particular;\n(iii) strengthening the co-operation with prosecution office for investigating quickly these penal offences and bring the offenders before law court;\n(iv) undertaking actions for the seizure of criminal offenders in general and those for blood avenge in particular as a very important means for prevention of blood feud;\n(v) arrangement of activities for the seizure of wanted persons convicted of commitment of murders for the motive of blood avenge, and these have led to reduce evidently blood feud murders;\n(vi) strengthening and institutionalizing co-operation between local government organs and NGOs for settling conflicts by reconciliation;\n(vii) strengthening co-operation between educational directorates and schools for education of the young generation with the spirit of tolerance and prevention of crimes;\n(viii) supporting and cooperating with commission of blood feud reconciliation, always in compliance with law, for the purpose of intermediating the solution by conciliation of conflicts of blood feuds.14\n[25] More recently in 2013, Albania has reformed its criminal laws to lengthen sentencing for blood feud related murders and to criminalize incitement or intimidation to blood feud by up to three years in jail.15 The Board's own research indicates that Albanian police have set up a database to keep track of potential victims:\nAccording to the UN Special Rapporteur, in June 2012, the Albanian State Police launched a countrywide database which lists all individuals identified as involved in a blood feud; this includes cases submitted to court and those \"not followed up through official channels\" (UN 23 Apr. 2013, para. 19). The same source indicates that the database is updated regularly and may be accessed by the State Police, the Prosecutor General's Office, representatives of the court, and the People's Advocate [Ombudsman].16\n[Emphasis added]\n[26] The personal evidence of the claimants indicates that historically (namely in the case of the uncle) Albanian police has prosecuted (through multiple appeals) blood feud murders and when possible convicted and sentenced the accused for lengthy periods of incarceration. The new country condition evidence submitted by counsel consistently shows that police prosecutes blood feud murders.17 The Board's research supports my assessment that Albania consistently prosecutes blood feud murders and imprisons the murders.18\n[27] The country condition evidence indicates that these operational steps have been effective in Albania over the years during the claimants' absence, leading to the reduction in the incidence of blood feud murders.19 Indeed, recent crime statistics indicate a decrease in numerous violent crime categories for Albania.20\n[28] One of the articles Counsel disclosed quotes a police chief in Shkoder stating that the incidence of blood feud has fallen dramatically with only \"208 reported since 1991\".21 I recognize that this article effectively argues that the problem of blood feud is underreported and that the state of Albania is underlying the issue. I accept that other entities, notably non-governmental organizations state that the incidence of blood feud is higher. I also note that the Ombudsman is quoted in the U.S. Department of State Report that the police protection for blood feud victims is insufficient. However, I find that these concerns relate more to whether state protection in Albania is perfect. I find that the balance of the evidence indicates that state protection is adequate in Albania. While \"adequacy\" may not be \"sufficient\" for everyone, including the ombudsman, I find that such arguably subjective statements are not clear and convincing when reviewing the country condition documents.\n[29] I find that I assign high evidentiary weight to the most recent documentary evidence, dated June 29, 2017 and researched by the Office of the Commissioner General for Refugees and Stateless Persons which states as follows:\n... All the consulted experts agreed that the police forces nowadays try to intervene in blood feud situations and that police interventions can be of various kinds (identification, monitoring, prevention, arrest, etc.)(cfr. infra 5. Protection). A representative at the Shkod\u00ebr Regional Police Directorate declared that his police officers try to supervise the confined families in his district, \"by regularly contacting them, by patrolling in the proximity of their houses. Local police officers are tasked to stay near the affected families and to stay in contact with them.\" With regard to the affected families in his area who are not living in confinement he declared: \"we are trying to communicate, mitigate, mediate, negotiate and soothe down.\" This source declared that \"all the affected families know neighbourhood police officers. They have their phone numbers and general emergency numbers.\"\nMentor Kikia confirmed that police officers have visited many families in order to identify those who are still affected by blood feud. He also confirmed that many affected families have been provided with the necessary contact details in case they felt an immediate danger. Besides he stated that a lot of people have been arrested after the amendments in the penal code. Police units may also intervene in other ways. In Fush\u00eb-Arr\u00ebz for example, the police was called in order to provide security for two men who had come from abroad to attend the funeral of their father, who was the last person in the village to be in a blood feud.\nIn some cases affected families may have been visited by police officers of the Prosecutor's Office who encouraged families to denounce their situation. On this occasion they were asked to formally indicate by whom they were threatened so that a court case could be started (cfr. infra 3.8 Latency). In the years 2013-2014, officers of the prosecutor have gone to \"every house where there was a claim linked with blood feud\" in order to obtain \"enough evidence to start a case\". The representative from the Prosecutor's Office explained that 200 families in Shkod\u00ebr have been approached \"which are in conflict because of a murder case since the 1990s.\"22\n[Emphasis added]\n[30] The personalized service of Albanian police and their apparent reach as described above appears consistent with other evidence in the national documentation package which state that \"police have a visible presence throughout Tirana and other larger cities\".23 The U.K. Embassy in Albania similarly stated after a 2014 field mission concerning blood feuds that local authorities are active, police and criminal justice system representatives monitor, record, and provide a degree of protection to affected families and that authorities also prosecute perpetrators.24\n[31] The above lengthy excerpt is from an analysis conducted by a European Union institution committed to providing information for asylum determination. This is a similar entity to the Board's own research directorate. I find that this is a highly reliable source of information. I find that this report reliably indicates that in 2017 Albania, including the Shkoder area from where the claimants came, police protection from blood feud would include operational steps such as regular patrols in the potential victims' neighbourhood, relevant police officers personally becoming acquainted with potential victims, and personal visits by prosecutors and police for the purpose gathering evidence for prosecution of threats. Furthermore, I note that the police appears to be willing to be provide personal protection on occasion when called upon for special occasions. I find that this evidence indicates a fairly high level of police protection in Albania for blood feud victims who feel threatened by people who seek to commit a vengeance murder. I find that this is evidence indicates that there is adequate state protection in Albania.\n[32] Counsel for the claimant relied in submission on a 2008 issue paper by the Board on blood feud which I have read recently, which suggests that there is no adequate state protection in Albania. While the issue paper may have been correct in its observations in 2008, I find that I assign this paper and the other reports and evidence from that time period low evidentiary weight because they have become considerably stale. I find that these observations do not reflect the current level of state protection in Albania. I prefer the more recent evidence, especially the report from the Office of the Commissioner General for Refugees and Stateless Persons from 2017 excerpted above.\n[33] The claimants were asked if there was a difference in their mind between police protection in 1999-2000 and in current Albania of 2017. The testified that they do not think that there will be any difference. The claimant believe that they will receive the same non-satisfactory reaction. The claimant also stated that it will be impossible for the police to go and arrest others who can seek revenge and kill the male claimants because it is not clear who from the XXXX clan would kill.\n[34] I find the claimants' testimony is insufficient because the country condition documentary evidence clearly indicates that state protection in Albania has changed considerably since 1999-2000. The claimants' personal documentation, such as letters from reconciliation institutions, friends and family, speak only generally to the question of state protection. For example, the letter from the reconciliation institute dated January 25, 2011 states that \"the government and the police do not possess the necessary means to protect the families which are involved in blood feud phenomenon\".25 The lack of specificity in this letter adversely affects its reliability and evidentiary weight that can be assigned to when assessing the sufficiency of evidence on the questions state protection adequacy.\n[35] While those documents set out to explain the danger in Albania to the claimant family, I find that the reliability of those conclusion in so far as state protection can mitigate those threats, to be also adversely affected by the fact that these documents are stale due to being authored before the first hearing of this claim in 2011. As set out further in these reasons, state protection has changed in Albania over the years and the most recent evidence sets out a number operational steps in response to blood feud that I find indicates adequacy.\n[36] The claimants' recent disclosure, including a letter about the uncle being questioned in jail in 2013 about the claimants' immigration file, is too vague to assist the claimants in rebutting the presumption of state protection.26 The claimants' refugee claim was judicially reviewed at the Federal Court. That decision is public record and searchable on multiple internet platforms. It is plausible that one of the uncle's jailers could have located the claimants Federal Court decision through internet search. However, there is insufficient evidence to establish the motivations of the jail guard who questioned the uncle about the claimants. While the claimants would invite me to speculate that the jailer's inquiry indicates the reach of the XXXX clan, I find that there would be any number of legitimate reasons for the uncle's questioning such as the jail administration conducting a risk assessment for the safety of the uncle who continues to be under their custody.\n[37] I find that the claimants effectively ask for perfect state protection in Albania. While I sympathize with their feelings, the test is whether the claimants have rebutted the presumption of adequate state protection. Perfection is not required or expected as part of the Board's inquiry into state protection. Neither does the Board expect that Albanian state protection could guarantee the claimants' safety for each of the 24 hours of each day in perpetuity. What the claimants ask for is far in excess of adequacy.\n[38] In assessing the adequacy of state protection in Albania to the claimants from blood feud threats and revenge killings, I have considered the incidence of state corruption in the police, judiciary, and prosecution services. The current U.S. Department of State Report makes the following general statement on corruption in Albania:\nThe most significant human rights problems were pervasive corruption in all branches of government, particularly in the judicial and health-care systems, and domestic violence and discrimination against women.27\n...\nPolice did not always enforce the law equitably. Personal associations, political or criminal connections, poor infrastructure, lack of equipment, or inadequate supervision often influenced law enforcement. Low salaries, poor motivation and leadership, and a lack of diversity in the workforce contributed to continued corruption and unprofessional behavior...28\n[39] I find that while there are valid concerns about corruption in Albania, there is insufficient personalized evidence to link to concerns to the claimants' particular circumstances. The claimants have not made any specific allegations about the profile of the XXXX clan. No documentary evidence was presented to me about any political, criminal, or other personal associations possessed by the XXXX clan that would render state protection inadequate. In testimony, the claimants concerns about the reach of the XXXX clan was that this is a large clan that is composed of many members. I find that the claimants' personalized evidence is not sufficient to rebut the presumption of state protection based on the incidence of corruption because it is too vague. I note that there is evidence that male claimant had a policeman friend, which indicates that he may be in a potentially better position than other Albanians who are denied such a personal association.\n[40] At any rate, there is insufficient evidence that the general corruption has affected the adequacy of state protection in relation to blood feuds. The documentary evidence links corruption with organized crime, not necessarily with revenge killings which may include blood feud.29 There are no allegations or evidence that the particular blood feud the claimants are afraid of is connected to organized crime.\n[41] The matter of corruption appears to have led to a historic perception that that the potentially corruptible judiciary \"tends to impose lighter sentences on perpetrators of blood feud-related homicides\".30 However, those perceptions appear in the documentary evidence date to 2012 and 2013. I find that that the recent documentary evidence indicates that significant changes have recently occurred in Albania which have resulted in criminal proceedings being initiated against a diverse array of corrupt officials:\nSince the lifting of immunity for judges and high officials in 2012, prosecutors have investigated at least 23 high-level officials, including 14 locally elected officials, four judges, one court clerk, three prosecutors, and one police officer. Jurisdiction over judicial corruption and high-level corruption was transferred to the Serious Crimes Court in March 2014. Prosecutions led by the related Serious Crimes Prosecution Office have resulted in the convictions of two judges, one prosecutor, and one locally elected mayor on corruption charges. Two other judges and one prosecutor charged with corruption await trial.31\n[42] On a forward looking basis, I find that the increase in police salaries which occurred in 2014 will on a balance of probabilities further reduce the incentive of police officers to accept corrupt benefits.32 I note that the claimants' own documentary evidence from 2016 refers to \"unofficial reports\" that a little over $6,000 will secure a year's reduction in a judicial court sentence for blood feud murder.33 However, I assign this evidence low evidentiary weight because it is based on a fairly vague reference to \"unofficial reports\", which makes it impossible for me to assess the reliability of such reports or their source. I find that these references are on a balance of probabilities repetitions of the same perceptions of injustice and pervasive corruption which, according to the documentary evidence, do not directly affect the adequacy of state protection on the question of blood feud and revenge (in the absence of other aggravating factors such as the presence of organized crime).\n[43] While there is no guarantee that the claimants may one day cross paths with a corrupt official in Albania, I assess the risk to the claimants of not receiving adequate state protection due to corruption to be speculative, close to the mere possibility, not the balance of probabilities.\n[44] I find that the claimants in this case have failed to demonstrate the inadequacy of state protection at the operational level in their specific personal circumstances with clear and convincing evidence. I find that if the claimants were to return to Albania and approach the police and state authorities that they will receive the protection that they need.\nCONCLUSION\n[45] After considering the evidence and counsel submissions and based on the above analysis, the panel finds the claimants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection due to their failure to rebut the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence.\n[46] Accordingly, I find that the claimants would not face a serious possibility of persecution in Albania or, on a balance of probabilities, that they would be subjected personally to a risk to their life, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture. Their claims are therefore rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Yonatan Rozenszajn\"\nYonatan Rozenszajn\nNovember 27, 2017\nDate\nXXXXXX v. Canada (MCI), 2012 FC 762.\n2 Exhibit 1.\n3 Mernacaj v.

She seeks refugee protection in Canada pursuant to section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nPreliminary matters\n[2] Counsel for the claimant requested to give written submissions. Submissions were due on September 29, 2017. Counsel requested one week extension, which was granted. As of October 29, 2017, no submissions have been received by the Board.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] I find that the claimant is not a Convention refugee as she does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in St. Lucia. I also find that the claimant is not a person in need of protection in that her removal to St. Lucia would not subject her personally to a risk to her life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, and in that there are no substantial grounds to believe that her removal to St. Lucia will subject her personally to a danger of torture.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] Details of the claimant's allegations are found in the Personal Information Form (PIF) narrative.2\n[5] The claimant alleges the following:\n[6] The claimant fears that she will be killed by her ex-boyfriend XXXX. He has abused her for many years. She also fears that she will be killed by her girlfriend's ex-husband who is accusing her of forcing his wife into a lesbian relationship.\n[7] She also fears XXXX, a man with whom she had her first serious relationship in 1988. XXXX began abusing her after the birth of their second son in 1995. He also stopped giving any money and buying food for the house. One day he beat her up, punched and kicked her. She reported the incident to police, but they just talked to XXXX, advising him to behave himself. XXXX continued to beat her. She reported the abuse to the police two more times, but they just said that it was a family matter.\n[8] In 2004 she moved to her father's house with her children. In April of 2004 she traveled to Canada for a vacation. She stayed in Canada for seven months. Upon return to St. Lucia she learned that she was pregnant. She started working and was able to provide for her children. She heard that XXXX was no longer in the country and had stopped bothering her.\n[9] In 2007, she met XXXX. After living with him for a year he began abusing her. The claimant reported him to the police, but they did not help. She went back to live with her father but XXXX forced her to come back to live with him.\n[10] In 2009, she was so desperate to get away from XXXX that she travelled to Canada under the name XXXX XXXX. She was refused entry into Canada and was sent back to St Lucia. Upon her return she had no choice but to move back in with XXXX. XXXX continued to abuse her.\n[11] A few months after her return she met XXXX, who was also being abused by her husband. They became lovers. That year she and XXXX spent Christmas together in St Marten, because XXXX husband was out of town. She did not tell XXXX where she was going, and upon her return he beat her up badly. He did not believe that she had gone to St. Marten with XXXX.\n[12] About 6 months later, XXXX husband XXXX came home early and discovered the claimant and XXXX having sex. He beat both of them. The claimant ran home, but XXXX had already informed XXXX about them. XXXX beat her up and continued to beat her daily.\n[13] The news spread about the sexual encounter and people started threatening to kill her wherever she went. Her children were teased and made fun of at school.\n[14] One day, XXXX pulled a knife and threatened to stab her when she refused to have sex with him. He threatened to kill her if she ever refused him or left him or went to the police.\n[15] Her family bought her a ticket to Canada. She arrived in Canada on August 18, 2011, on a one month visa. The next month she was informed by her children, sister and father that XXXX is still looking for her. She decided to stay in Canada even though her visa had expired.\n[16] Eventually she was referred to a lawyer who told her about the refugee process. XXXX, XXXX and even members of the community are threatening to kill her.\nANALYSIS\n[17] In deciding the claim, I have considered and taken into account the Chairperson's Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution3 and Chairperson's Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression.4 Given the sensitive nature of the allegations of abuse and sexual orientation, questions were asked in a sensitive respectful manner.\n[18] The determinative issues are sexual identity as a bisexual woman and credibility.\nIdentity\n[19] The claimant has established her identity as a citizen of St. Lucia, primarily based on her passport5 she used to travel to Canada.\n[20] I find that the claimant has not established her sexual identity as a bisexual.\nCREDIBILITY\n[21] As per Maldonado,6 the sworn evidence of a claimant is presumed to be true, unless there are sufficient reasons to believe otherwise.\n[22] In this case, I find that the claimant was not a credible witness in regards to central aspects of her claim. I find that the claimant has not provided sufficient reliable and trustworthy evidence to support her fear of returning to Saint Lucia. I find that the claimant has not established her identity as a bisexual. I also find that the claimant has not provided sufficient credible evidence of her abuse by XXXX and XXXX and the other members of the community.\nFailure to claim and delay in claiming\n[23] The claimant came to Canada three times. I find that the claimant's failure to claim when in Canada the first two times, her reavailment to St. Lucia, and the delay in claiming the third time negatively affect her credibility.\n[24] The claimant testified that she came to Canada in 2004 for a vacation and overstayed. She testified that her reason for coming to Canada was to escape the abuse by XXXX and to relax her mind. She left her two children in St. Lucia. The claimant did not make a refugee claim. Instead she returned to St. Lucia after 7 months. Her PIF is not clear about what happened upon her return to St. Lucia. In the PIF narrative, she indicates that when she returned to St Lucia, she discovered she was pregnant. She got a job and supported her children, and that XXXX did not bother her as he left the country. However, at the hearing the claimant testified that XXXX is the father of all three children. She testified that after she returned to St Lucia she lived with XXXX and that her third son was born as a result of rape by XXXX, and that XXXX denied paternity of this child and then disappeared. There was no explanation for the apparent discrepancy between the PIF and her testimony.\n[25] The claimant attempted to come to Canada again, in 2009, but was refused entry at the Canadian border. She was told that she was refused entry because she had overstayed previously and also because she had falsified in her passport the date when she first came to Canada. I find that her attempt to deceive Canadian border officials negatively affects the claimant's general credibility. Secondly, since she alleges that she came to Canada because she was desperate to get away from XXXX abuse, it would be expected that she would tell border officials why she was coming to Canada and make a refugee claim. I do not accept that the claimant was unaware of how to make a refugee claim, as she was in Canada previously for seven months and in my specialized knowledge in hearing dozens of refugee claims from St. Lucia, I know that there is a general awareness of the refugee process in the St. Lucian community.\n[26] The third time the claimant came to Canada was on August 18, 2011. She testified that she came to Canada for protection. She had a one month visa but overstayed. She delayed in making a claim until March of 2012, a period of about seven months. She testified that she did not know about the refugee process until a friend referred her to a lawyer. As noted above, I do not find it credible that she did not know about the availability of refugee protection in Canada.\n[27] In sum, though not determinative, I find that the claimant's failure to claim two times, and her delay in claiming, indicates a lack of subjective fear and negatively affects her credibility.\nIdentity as a bisexual\n[28] I realize that it is difficult to establish one's sexual identity. However, I find that the claimant has not provided sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence that she is a bisexual.\n[29] The claimant testified that she had only one sexual relationship with a woman in St. Lucia. In fact, until she met XXXX, she was not attracted to women. She testified that she met XXXX in 2010, and that the relationship became sexual after one year, in XXXX of 2011, just before she came to Canada in August of 2011. The claimant had indicated in her PIF that she went to St Marten with XXXX for the Christmas holidays in XXXX of 2010. She testified that they went there to express their feelings for each other and that they had sex there. To explain the discrepancy as to when they first had sex, the claimant testified that that in St Marten they made love but that real sex did not happen until 2011. She explained that making love to her means touching and kissing, but that sex is having their private parts together. I do note that the claimant at first said that they had sex in St. Marten, and then denied it only when faced with the discrepancy. In addition, she indicated in her PIF that before they went to St Marten they had made love passionately and had become lovers\n[30] The claimant has no evidence from her former lover XXXX, because XXXX allegedly disappeared from the claimant's life.\n[31] The claimant testified that the only other woman she has had a sexual relationship with is XXXX, who lives in Canada. She knew her in St. Lucia but they were not friends. She testified that it was XXXX who referred her to a lawyer. According to the claimant, XXXX is a permanent resident who was granted refugee protection based on being a bisexual.\n[32] The claimant testified that she has never lived with XXXX because XXXX has her XXXX-year old son living with her. They have sex at the claimant's house because the claimant lives alone. They see each other every day since they live across the street from each other. The claimant goes to her house for dinner, and they go to church together and shopping.\n[33] It is expected that the claimant would produce the best evidence possible to establish her identity as a bisexual. XXXX did not come as a witness, although she and the claimant live across the street from each other and see each other often. The claimant has counsel who presumably would have told the claimant of the importance of having XXXX as a witness so that she could be examined at the hearing. The claimant testified that XXXX could not get the time off work because she is a janitor at a school.\n[34] I find that he claimant did not make sufficient efforts to have XXXX appear as a witness. She could have served a subpoena so that XXXX would be able to show it to her school employer.\n[35] The claimant submitted a letter of support from XXXX7 on the day of the hearing. There was no explanation for the lateness, and the letter was not dated. I give this letter little weight because of the lateness and also because the letter has little detail of their relationship, and also because XXXX could have been a witness at the hearing.\n[36] The claimant submitted a letter from 519 indicating that she was an active member of the 519 Church Street community Centre's Among Friends LGBT Refugee Support Group from XXXX 2012 to XXXX 2014.8 The claimant no longer attends this group because of work. I find that the claimant was not very interested in 519 per se as she did not even know that it serves the wider community and not just the LGBT community. I find that she attended this group primarily to help support her refugee claim.\n[37] I find that the supporting photographs of the claimant with a woman9 do not necessarily indicate that the claimant is bisexual. The photographs just show two women posing for the camera, and do not confirm any kind of intimate relationship.\n[38] In sum, I find that the claimant has not provided sufficient reliable and trustworthy evidence that she is a bisexual.\nAbuse by XXXX, XXXX and XXXX and community\n[39] The claimant indicated that she reported XXXX abuse and XXXX abuse to the police but that they basically did nothing. The claimant has no reliable corroborative evidence that she ever reported the abuse and threats to the police, or that her father or sister did. She does have affidavits from father,10 sister,11 son,12 and a friend.13 I give these affidavits little weight as they contain information that I find not credible, and the affiants' evidence cannot be tested in the hearing room. She also has a support letter from a friend in Canada, but all the information this author has was derived directly from the claimant and is therefore not reliable.\n[40] When asked at the hearing whom she fears in St. Lucia, the claimant testified that she fears XXXX, XXXXand the community. She omitted any mention of XXXX. Since her youngest son lives with XXXX, I do not believe she would have forgotten to mention XXXX since she speaks with her son often. In addition, her sister's affidavit, signed August 28, 2017,14 refers to the claimant's fear of XXXX and XXXX and is silent in regard to the claimant's alleged fear of XXXX. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant does not fear abuse by XXXX.\n[41] Most of the worst allegations as to the domestic abuse by XXXX and threats against her life by XXXX are intertwined with her allegations that XXXX abused her after the discovery of her affair with XXXX. Since I find that, on a balance of probabilities, the affair with XXXX did not occur, I therefore cannot give any credence to her allegations of abuse by XXXX and XXXX.\nSUMMARY\n[42] After a review of the evidence, including the claimant's testimony and the documentary evidence, I find that the claimant has not provided sufficient credible evidence that she is a bisexual. She also has not provided sufficient reliable and trustworthy evidence that she was abused by XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, or anyone else in St. Lucia.\nCONCLUSION\n[43] I determine that the claimant is not a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of IRPA nor a person in need of protection pursuant to section 97(1) of IRPA. The Refugee Protection Division therefore rejects her claim.\n(signed)\n\"Rose Andrachuk\"\nRose Andrachuk\nNovember 3, 2017\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n2 Exhibit 2, Personal Information Form (PIF).\n3 Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution: Update, Guideline Issued by the Chairperson Pursuant to Section 65(3) of the Immigration Act, IRB, Ottawa, November 25, 1996, as continued in effect by the Chairperson on June 28, 2002, under the authority found in section 159(1)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n4 Chairperson's Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression, Guidelines issued by the Chairperson pursuant to paragraph 159(1)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, Effective date: May 1, 2017.\n5 Exhibit 1, Package of information from the referring CBSA.\n6 Maldonado, Pedro Enrique Juarez v.

They state they were unable to repay the debt because the principal claimant's late husband became too ill to work.\n[3] The claimants also allege that as persons of Roma ethnicity they should be granted Convention refugee status due to \"the systemic violence, persecution and discrimination that they have faced as Roma in Hungary\"4\nThe Evidence\n[4] In her affidavit, and in her oral testimony, the principal claimant described the family's living conditions and the circumstances under which the debt was incurred. She testified that due to her late husband's health, his ability to work was affected. The family borrowed money from a Hungarian who, having married a Roma woman, lived in their neighbourhood. When they failed to repay the initial loan, the amount outstanding was increased. Inevitably, the claimants fell into a debt spiral where the repayment amount had ballooned beyond their ability to repay.\n[5] It was the principal claimant's evidence that she and her husband were forced to borrow more money to pay off loans that they could never pay off. It was also her evidence that the loan shark, and\/or his henchmen, forced the family to turn over their bankcard to them so that they could force the claimants' to withdraw their monthly social assistance payments and hand their money over to them. The loan shark and his henchmen kept a close eye on the family; they watched and threatened them constantly. When their actions failed to bring about the desired effect, they would raid the claimants' home from time-to-time looking for items of value.\n[6] Eventually, the claimants with the assistance of relatives in Canada who provided them with their airline tickets, sold their furniture and escaping in the dead of night, made their way to the airport, where they boarded an airplane bound for Canada. Once in Canada, they made their claims for refugee protection.\nDETERMINATION\n[7] The panel determines that the claimants are not Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of IRPA. The claimants are also not persons in need of protection pursuant to section 97(1) of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\n[8] The issues in this claim are,\ni. the claimant's identities both as citizens of Hungary and as ethnic Roma;\nii. Credibility;\niii. Criminality; and\niv. State Protections\nIdentity\n[9] The claimants' personal identities as citizens of Hungary are satisfactorily established by their oral testimony, the copies of their Hungarian identity cards and the certified true copies of their Hungarian passports that are included in the documents received from the Canada Border Services Agency, (CBSA).5\nThe Claimants' Identities as Ethnic Roma\n[10] On the basis of the principal claimant's testimony and the documents provided to support their claims that they are ethnic Roma, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants are ethnically Roma.\nCredibility\n[11] At the hearing, the panel heard testimony from the principal claimant. She testified about the conditions in which her family lived before they came to Canada, her husband's failing health, and the reasons why he and she and her husband turned to a loan shark for money. She also testified to the reign of terror the loan shark subjected the family to when the initial loan was not repaid.\n[12] The panel asked the principal claimant questions about the amount of the loan, the arrangements that were made for the family to leave Hungary; and the actual departure from Hungary. As set out below, the panel found significant aspects of her testimony not to be credible.\nThe Loan\n[13] The principal claimant testified that she and her husband borrowed 10,000 Hungarian Florins on a promise to repay the loan at the end of the same month in which they borrowed the money. At the end of the month they would have had to repay not 10,000 but 15k. They were prevented from repaying the loan because her late husband became ill and was hospitalised. Due to his illness, they borrowed more money, and as already stated they fell on the treadmill of borrowing and not being able to repay their debt while at the same time the outstanding sums ballooned. The principal claimant testified that as the loan shark's demands became more and more onerous, and his actions more and more abusive and invasive, she and her husband did make an attempt to get help from the police. However, they were prevented from filing a report by the concierge who told them that they were the ones who put themselves in the situation. The debt then stood at around 50,000 Florins. The claimants made no further attempts to obtain assistance from the police. They also did not ask their relatives in Canada for financial assistance to pay off the loan. At the time they left Hungary, the outstanding amount was around $400.00 Canadian dollars.\n[14] When asked why she simply did not ask her relatives for the money to pay off the loan, the principal claimant responded that they would still have to borrow money. In the panel's view, this was not a plausible response, as it is not in keeping with what a reasonable person might expect in the circumstances. Stripped to its essentials the claimants are stating, \"We owe money that we cannot repay. Therefore, we will ask our relatives to spend more than eleven times what we owe so that we can come to Canada in order to escape the people to whom we owe this money.\" In the panel's view, in all the circumstances of the case, this is not a reasonable position.\n[15] The panel accepts that the claimants may have become indebted to their local loan shark. However, the panel finds that it is not plausible that the claimants' response to their inability to repay the debt would be to board a flight to Canada at considerable expense to their relatives in Canada, when it would have been far less expensive for the relatives to send them the money to repay the loan. When she was asked, the principal claimant testified that the original loan was approximately $50.00 Canadian dollars. It ballooned to $400.00. Her relatives in Canada spent $4,700.00 for the airline tickets for the principal claimant's family. The object of them coming to Canada was to avoid the loan shark and his henchmen. To date the loan has not been repaid.\nThe Claimant's Departure from Hungary\n[16] The panel also asked the principal claimant how she and all five family members, including her sick husband, were able to leave their home and come to Canada without the loan shark being aware that they were leaving. She testified that on the day prior to their departure she sold their remaining furniture to a neighbour, who likely thought that she was selling her furniture because she needed money on which to live. The following evening, the five family members left the home carrying only two bags among them. The principal claimant testified that it was after 11:00 at night when they left home and that the group walked until they reached a taxi, which took them to the airport.\n[17] Even accepting that this was how the principal claimant and her family left the heir home, the panel is not persuaded that they could have made the arrangements she claimed that they did without arousing the attention of the persons she said were watching the family constantly.\n[18] The panel finds that, if they were being watched as the principal claimant testified, selling their furniture would have alerted the loan sharks to the possibility that they did have money they (the loan sharks) could commandeer. As well, the family leaving at eleven at night carrying bags would have aroused suspicion of those watching them. Furthermore, given the ages of their children in 2012, the panel finds that it is more likely than not that the claimant's left their home at a reasonable hour and did not steal away as the principal claimant claims they did.\n[19] Taken the above into consideration, the panel finds that there is valid reason to doubt and to reject the principal claimants claim that they left Hungary because they were being harassed by a loan shark to whom they owed money.\nCriminality and Nexus to a Convention Ground\n[20] The claimants' primary claim is that they are victims of criminality. Criminality in and of itself provides no nexus to a Convention ground and would not allow the panel to find that the claimants are Convention refugees. However, the claimants allege that they were specifically targeted by the loan shark. Having found that there was valid reason to doubt and to reject the evidence of harassment by the loan shark, the panel is not persuaded that what the claimants fear amounts to persecution or to a risk to life, or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or to a danger of torture.\nDiscrimination based on the Claimants' Roma Ethnicity\n[21] The claimants' Roma ethnicity provided the second basis of their claim for refugee protection. In their PIF, the claimants state that throughout their lives they have been subjected to discrimination and harassment for no other reason than that they are Roma. The relevant portion of the principal claimant's affidavit setting out the claim provides: -\n\"Our claim is based on the systemic violence persecution and discrimination that we have faced as Roma in Hungary. We have been harassed and threatened. It has become impossible to maintain a livelihood there. It is impossible for our children to get a proper education. This violence, harassment and persecution have caused my husband, children and I to live in constant fear for our lives and safety. My children have also faced discrimination in their educational pursuits, especially my son, XXXX XXXX XXXX., who was constantly harassed, bullied and tormented at school for being a Roma with especially dark skin. He has been so traumatised by his experiences that when we first came to Canada, he hardly spoke.\"6\n[22] The principal claimant goes on to describe the family's living conditions in Hungary, the difficulties she and her family experienced in the education system, in employment and in receiving health care. She argued that there was systemic discrimination against Roma, including her family, in Hungary.\n[23] In submissions, her counsel took the position that the systemic discrimination experienced by Roma in Hungary amounted to persecution such that the claimants should be regarded as Convention refugees. Citing various extracts from the documentary evidence on Hungary, Counsel for the claimants suggested that the documentary evidence pointed to a general decline of democracy in Hungary which was reflected by the state's unwillingness or inability to protect Roma. She also argued that this was a situation pervasive throughout Hungary. Relying on Katinszki v. Canada 2012 FC 1326, counsel for the claimants argued that they were under no obligation to seek state protection as the documentary evidence suggests that none would be forthcoming.7\n[24] In the panel's view, the arguments of the claimant's counsel was not persuasive because it speaks more to a generalised condition and less to the specific experiences of the claimants. By counsel's own admission the claimant's, while discriminated against, had not been the victims of racist attacks.\n[25] In the recent case of Poczkodi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)8 Kane, J., clarified that even where it is found that the discrimination and harassment experienced by a claimant for refugee protection amounts to persecution, the claimant is still obligated to rebut the presumption of state protection. Part of rebutting that presumption appears to be doing more than simply stating, that even if one went to the police nothing would come of it. The panel finds support for this statement in Ruszo v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)9 where the Federal Court asserted that a claimant could not simply rely on their own belief that state protection would not be forthcoming without first testing it.\n[26] On the basis of the documentary evidence, the panel accepts that Roma generally face discrimination in Hungary in all public spheres and in housing. However, the panel is not persuaded that what the XXXX family faced amounted to persecution. The family's circumstances appear to have been affected primarily by the health of the principal claimant's late husband. It was his ill-health that resulted in his inability to work and it was his ill-health that ultimately reduced the claimants to penury. The panel finds that the family's financial situation was not attributable solely to the systemic discrimination that the family faced as individuals of Roma ethnicity in Hungary.\n[27] The only agent of persecution alleged was a person from whom the claimants borrowed money. While the principal claimant alleged that the family had tried to make a complaint against this person, and had been turned away by the concierge at the police station, the panel finds that this is not a situation where the questions of state protection and an internal flight alternative properly arise, as ultimately the claimants took no further steps and did not make a complaint to the police.\nCONCLUSION\n[28] The claimants allege that if returned to Hungary, they would be persecuted by a person from whom they borrowed money, either by himself or through his agents. They also allege that they will suffer persecution due to the \"systemic violence, persecution and discrimination that they have faced as Roma in Hungary\"10 For all of the above reasons, the panel finds that the claimants. XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX., XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX are not Convention refugees and are not persons in need of protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the IRPA.\n(signed)\n\"Hazelyn Ross\"\nH.

He was hospitalized following the incident.\n[6] The claimants' mother aided them in obtaining visas for the United States. The arrived in New York in XXXX 2015. After their arrival, the claimants found out that their brother XXXX was killed when their father sent more military officers to forcibly recruit him.\n[7] The claimants made their way to Canada and have claimed refugee protection as they fear they will be forced to join the army or harmed by their father if they refuse.\nANALYSIS\n[8] The determinative issue in this case is credibility.\nCredibility\n[9] The panel had concerns regarding the credibility of the claimants.\nSignificant discrepancies between the allegations of the claimants, their documentary evidence, and the witness\n[10] The panel noted numerous inconsistencies between the testimony of the associated claimant and the allegations contained in the claimants' Basis of Claim forms3 (BOC), and the Medical report from The Canadian Centre for Refugee and Immigrant Health Care (CCRIHC) dated April 20, 2017,4 and the testimony of the doctor who authored the report, Dr. XXXX XXXX, who was a witness at the hearing.\n[11] The most significant of these inconsistences relates to the death of their brother, which in their BOCs, the claimants allege happened after they were already in Canada, whereas in the medical report, the doctor indicates the associated claimant told him he witnessed the death prior to coming to Canada. In addition, the CCRIHC report indicates the associated claimant stated that their father tracked them down and threatened them in the United States, which is not alleged in the BOC. Other inconsistencies include their father's job title and work location, and the circumstances of their mother's return to the DRC from the United States, as well as her current whereabouts.\n[12] The panel asked both claimants questions regarding why their testimony and BOCs were very different from the CCRIHC report and testimony of the witness. The associated claimant testified that his brother XXXX was killed after they had left the Congo, and he speculated about a language barrier being the reason for the discrepancy. He testified that his father never threatened them in the United States, and that honestly, he speaks, but does not know what happened in his head. With respect to the inconsistency with the whereabouts of his mother, the associated claimant testified that he talked to the doctor but does not always know what he is saying. The principal claimant testified that his brother, the associated claimant, does not always remember what he says, he just talks to talk. The principal claimant wanted to be present for all the interviews with doctors, but given that they are private and confidential, he could not be there.\n[13] Given that both claimants are alleging the CCRIHC report and the testimony of the doctor is not correct, and that they are significantly different from the allegations of the claimants as contained in their BOCs, the panel finds that neither the CCRIHC report nor the testimony of the doctor can be given any weight in corroborating the allegations of the claimants.\n[14] The panel further finds that by their own testimony, the associated claimant is not a credible witness overall, as he cannot be relied upon to speak the truth or to even remember what he said and when he said it.\n[15] Other than the CCRIHC report, the claimants submitted two other medical reports from medical professionals in Canada relating to the associated claimant. One of the reports is an ambulatory consult which indicates that the associated claimant suffers from neurocognitive difficulties, which the associated claimant alleges are the result of the assault in 2014, and which the report indicates are symptoms of a persistent concussion.5 The other report is from psychologist XXXX and pre-dates the CCRIHC report.6 This report diagnoses the associated claimant with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. The panel notes that in both of these reports, other than the narrative, the reports are based on information as told to the medical professionals by the associated claimant. Given the associated claimant's admission that he just \"talks to talk\" the panel finds the information and allegations as told to the medical professionals underlying both reports is not reliable, and therefore cannot place any weight on the reports to corroborate the allegations of the claimants.\n[16] The panel is cognizant of the ambulatory consult report as indicating the associated claimant has persistent concussive symptoms, however, the panel finds that while this may explain why the associated claimant has neurocognitive difficulties, and even why he may have issues with his memory, it does not indicate which of his allegations are true and which are not. Rather, it corroborates the panel's findings that the associated claimant's assertions cannot be relied upon to be true and correct.\nDiscrepancies between the allegations of the principal claimant and the Port-of-Entry Notes\n[17] The claimants were interviewed at the Port of Entry (POE) upon their arrival to Canada.\n[18] The principal claimant indicated at the POE that his father was arrested after attending an anti-government march, and now he is wanted as well.7 However, based on their allegations and testimony, the father of the claimants is in fact their agent of persecution. When asked about this, the principal claimant testified that they were afraid of the police and since they considered the border agents to be police officers and their father was a XXXX XXXX, they thought the border agents would tell their father. While the panel is mindful of the problems numerous claimants have with authority figures, the panel also has to consider that the claimants have also presented a different, in fact third version of events to someone in Canada, who was not a police officer.\nFailure to claim in the United States\n[19] The claimants arrived in New York on XXXX XXXX, 2015. They remained in the United States until they came to Canada on December 4, 2015, to make their claim for refugee protection.\n[20] When asked why they did not make an asylum claim in the United States, the principal claimant testified that while they initially had intended to claim asylum, there were isolated where they were staying, the woman they were staying with was not feeding them enough, they did not speak the language and did not know anyone who could help them take the necessary steps. He testified that they had an aunt in Canada, which is a bilingual country, so they decided to come here instead. The associated claimant testified that the woman they were staying with chased them out of the house, and given that they did not know the language, they decided to come to Canada. The panel asked the associated claimant why they did not make a claim for asylum prior to being chased out of the house. The associated claimant testified that they did not know they could get help and also they were taking steps to find their aunt in Canada.\n[21] The panel finds the explanations of the claimants for why they did not make an asylum claim in Canada to be not reasonable. The claimants testified that they left the DRC because of the events that happened and because their lives were in danger. In addition, the principal claimant has presented himself as a sophisticated individual who was in University studying XXXX at the time that he left the DRC. The associated claimant was also allegedly in University studying XXXX. When the claimants arrived in the United States, they were accompanied by their mother. In that context, it is not reasonable that the claimants would not make efforts to obtain help once they were actually outside of the DRC. Accordingly, the panel draws a negative inference with respect to the credibility of the claimants and their allegations that they were in danger in the DRC.\nSupporting documents\n[22] The panel had concerns regarding many of the documents submitted by the claimants in support of their claim.\n[23] The claimants submitted two warrants in support of their claim.8 Both warrants are dated September 22, 2015, and state the claimants are wanted for the following reason: \" manque d'ob\u00e9issance et refus d'exercer des devoirs civiques en date du 20 septembre 2015 \". The panel noted some differences between the two documents, the most significant of which is that they have different telephone numbers in the footer of the document, despite being issued by the same source on the same day. In addition, when looking at the originals presented at the hearing, the stamp at the bottom of the letter is clearly from an inkjet printer, rather than a real stamp, and there is discoloration around the stamp, as it has a different non-white background from the rest of the document. In fact, this discoloration around the stamp can even be seen on the photocopies on file. For these reasons, the panel finds that on the face of the documents, the two warrants submitted by the claimants are not genuine documents. The panel further finds that these false documents were submitted to bolster their claims.\n[24] The claimants presented a death certificate for their brother XXXX XXXX.9 The death certificate is dated XXXX XXXX, 2015, and has a different spelling of XXXX than does the BOC, which has no \"t\".10 Moreover, the information contained within the death certificate is not consistent with what you would expect a death certificate to have, as there is no cause of death. When asked about this at the hearing, neither claimant had a comment. The panel finds this reason to doubt the reliability of the document and places no weight on it in support of the claimants' allegations that their father was responsible for the death of their brother, due to his attempts to forcibly recruit his sons into the armed forces.\n[25] The claimants submitted a medical report dated XXXX XXXX, 2014, related to the associated claimant.11 It indicates that he was treated at their facility until XXXX XXXX, 2014. The associated claimant in his narrative indicated that he was hospitalized until XXXX XXXX, 2014. When asked about this discrepancy in the dates, the associated claimant testified that he was technically released on the XXXX, but since his mother could not pay, he stayed in the hospital until the XXXX. The panel finds this explanation to be not reasonable, as it does not make sense that the hospital would allow a discharged patient to stay an extra day just because they cannot pay their bill. The panel also noted that the information contained within the medical report is not consistent with what you would expect a medical report to have, as the medical report does not indicate what treatment the associated claimant received. When asked, the associated claimant could not recall what treatment he received, and he did not know why that information was not contained in the medical report. For these reasons, the panel gives no weight to the medical report to support the allegations of the claimants that the associated claimant was assaulted by men sent by their father during an attempt to forcibly recruit him.\n[26] The claimants provided an Individual record of civil status (fiche individuelle de l'\u00e9tat-civil) for each claimant which indicates that their father is XXXX XXXX XXXX.12 The claimants submitted a copy of Ordonnance XXXX XXXX XXXX from December 2013 which indicates that XXXX XXXX XXXX is the XXXX XXXX XXXX.13 The panel notes that this simply establishes that their father is a XXXX XXXX, and not that he wants to forcibly recruit them to the armed forces.\n[27] The medical certificate for the claimants' mother, which was issued by a medical institution in XXXX, Congo, on XXXX XXXX, 2015, indicates that she was examined from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX, 2015, following a stroke on XXXX XXXX, 2015.14 The panel notes that this document contradicts the POE statement15 and the CCRIHC medical report from XXXX 201716 where the associated claimant alleges that he does not know where his mother is. Moreover, the panel notes that this document does not establish that the father of the claimants is attempting to forcibly recruit them, nor that they face a risk upon their return to the DRC.\nSummary\n[28] The panel found the associated claimant was not a credible witness. Given that the principal claimant was not in Kinshasa when the associated claimant was allegedly attacked, and given the testimony of both claimants that sometimes the associated claimant just talks to talk, and having given no weight to the medical document purporting to relate to the attack, the panel finds that there is no credible and trustworthy evidence to establish the associated claimant's allegations of his attack.\n[29] In light of this, and given the credibility concerns outlined in this decision, and the findings that the warrants submitted were not genuine documents, the panel finds that the claimants have not established on a balance of probabilities that their father has tried or is trying to forcibly recruit them to the armed forces in the DRC, or that the authorities in the DRC are looking for them because of their father. Therefore, the panel finds that the claimants have not established that they face a risk of harm on a forward looking basis, that is, more than a mere possibility of persecution in regard to s. 96 of the IRPA, or, a likelihood of the harm that is set out in s. 97(1) of the IRPA.\nCONCLUSION\n[30] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel finds that there is not a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground should the claimants return to DRC, or that, on a balance of probabilities, they would be personally subjected to a danger of torture, or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\n[31] The panel concludes that the claimants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. Therefore, their claims are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Catherine Smith\"\nCatherine Smith\nSeptember 19, 2017\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C.

They have seven children, the minor claimants. Minor claimants 2 and 3 are the children of the principal claimant from a different biological father; and minor claimants 1 and 4 are the biological children of XXXX XXXX and were adopted by the principal claimant, but have a different biological mother. Minor claimants 5, 6, and 7 are the biological children of both the principal claimant and XXXX XXXX.\n[5] The principal claimant alleges problems in the DRC due to her father, an XXXX for the city of XXXX who was affiliated with the opposition party Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) and who uncovered corrupt practices of certain officials. Her father was allegedly arrested by the police on XXXX XXXX, 2015, on his way to a protest and never seen again.\n[6] The principal claimant herself participated in the protest, and was allegedly arrested, detained, and severely mistreated by the ANR (National Intelligence Agency - Agence nationale de renseignements) because she was related to her father and for having protested against the President. Her husband paid a bribe for her release. Following her release, agents from the ANR continued to extort the principal claimant's husband.\n[7] The principal claimant alleges that she was arrested and detained a second time later that same year; and that the ANR continued to extort her husband until XXXX 2016. In XXXX 2017, military officers came to their home and arrested the principal claimant and her husband, accusing her husband of being a spy. The principal claimant was released after her aunt paid a bribe to the ANR. The whereabouts of the principal claimant's husband are unknown.\n[8] The principal claimant came to Canada with her children, the minor claimants, with the help of an agent. They have claimed refugee protection as they fear for their lives in the DRC. Since their arrival in Canada, the principal claimant alleges that their guard XXXX has disappeared and her uncle and cousin who let the claimants hide at their home have been killed.\nANALYSIS\n[9] The determinative issues in this case are identity and credibility.\nIdentity\n[10] The panel finds that the claimants have not established their identities on a balance of probabilities.\n[11] It is established that the issue of identity is tied to the issue of credibility. In assessing the credibility of a claimant and his actions, the panel is entitled to rely on its rationality and common sense. The panel is aware that the sworn testimony of a claimant is presumed to be true unless there are valid reasons to doubt it. The panel finds that the claimants' evidence is not credible with regard to their identities.\n[12] Section 106 of the IRPA states:2\nThe Refugee Protection Division must take into account, with respect to the credibility of a claimant, whether the claimant possesses acceptable documentation establishing identity, and if not, whether they have provided a reasonable explanation for the lack of documentation or have taken reasonable steps to obtain the documentation.\n[13] Similarly, Section 11 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules (the Rules) requires that:3\nThe claimant must provide acceptable documents establishing identity and other elements of the claim. A claimant who does not provide acceptable documents must explain why they were not provided and what steps were taken to provide them.\n[14] As noted by the Federal Court in Su, \"[t]he onus is on the claimant to produce acceptable documentation establishing his or her identity.\"4 Furthermore, the Federal Court in Duale noted that \"it is up to the claimant to establish his identity and he must make a genuine, substantive effort to do so.\"5\n[15] The burden therefore rests on the claimants to establish, with credible and trustworthy evidence, on a balance of probabilities, that they are who they say they are, and that they are nationals of DRC.\nThe principal claimant's DRC duplicata electoral card\n[16] The principal claimant presented a DRC electoral card, marked \"duplicata\", to Canadian immigration officials when she made her claim for refugee protection.6\n[17] The panel asked the principal claimant questions regarding how she obtained this card and what documents were presented. The principal claimant testified that she is not sure when she received the original, but she thinks it was around 2013. She testified that the ANR took her original card while she was detained in 2015. She testified that her cousin XXXX got her the card marked \"duplicata\". She testified that XXXX went with a letter stating that she gave him permission to get a copy of this document for her. She testified that he did this in 2015.\n[18] The panel notes that the card itself indicates that it was issued on XXXX XXXX, 2014, which is not consistent with the principal claimant's testimony. Given that the duplicata electoral card is not consistent with her own testimony regarding when it was issued, the panel finds there is reason to doubt the reliability of the document.\n[19] The panel also notes that when compared to the example of an electoral card contained in the documentary evidence,7 the font is different for the word \"sexe\" as well as the portion \"Origine: Secteur ou Chefferie ou Commune\/Territoire ou Ville\/Province\". The panel finds this to be additional reason to doubt the authenticity of the electoral card.\n[20] The panel also notes that the picture of the principal claimant on the duplicata electoral card is the same as the picture on several of her other documents, namely her state diploma (dipl\u00f4me d'\u00c9tat), issued in 1999 and which for the reasons given below the panel finds to be not genuine, and her driver's licence, issued in 2013, also discussed below. When asked about this, the principal claimant testified that her family used the same picture to procure all the documents for her while she was detained. The panel finds this explanation to be not credible as it makes no sense. The electoral card was issued in 2014, the driver's licence in 2013, and the state diploma in 1999. The principal claimant alleges that she was first detained in January 2015. According to her testimony, the principal claimant's family used this photo while she was detained to obtain documents for her. Given that all three documents with the photo allegedly used sometime after January 2015 to procure documents, are all dated prior to January 2015, the panel finds this explanation to be not reasonable as it just does not make sense chronologically. Consequently, the panel draws a negative inference with respect to the principal claimant's credibility.\nAffidavit submitted post-hearing\n[21] At the end of the hearing, Counsel asked to be able to provide further submissions on identity in writing, and the panel granted his request. Along with those submissions, Counsel provided several post hearing documents, including an affidavit from the principal claimant regarding the testimony she gave at the hearing,8 without a proper application. These documents were nevertheless accepted as evidence.\n[22] In her affidavit, the principal claimant stated that she was stressed and confused when she testified at her hearing, as she had not been sleeping well. She stated that her testimony that her cousin XXXX got her duplicata electoral card because the police had taken her original was incorrect. She stated that the police took her passport, but her electoral card was in one of her bags, and XXXX found the card in one of her bags. The principal claimant stated that the reason the card is a duplicata is because she lost the original. She also stated that her testimony that she received her first card in 2013 was incorrect, and she thinks she mixed up the date with when she received her driver's licence on XXXX XXXX, 2013. She then stated that she gave the authorities copies of the same photo for both cards. The principal claimant made other corrections to her testimony in her affidavit which will be discussed later in this decision.\n[23] The panel finds the attestations of the principal claimant in her affidavit with respect to her electoral card to be of little probative value. The panel notes that the attestations in the affidavit seemingly correct her testimony to address inconsistencies that were put to her during the hearing, which she was not able to provide reasonable explanations for at that time. As such, the panel finds the assertions of the principal claimant in her affidavit to be of little probative value.\n[24] In light of the above, the panel finds that the electoral card is not a reliable document and places no weight on it in support of the principal claimant's identity.\nThe principal claimant's driver's licence\n[25] The principal claimant presented a DRC driver's licence to Canadian immigration officials when she made her claim for refugee protection.9\n[26] When looking at the card, the panel notes that the signature box contains the principal claimant's last name XXXX printed in block letters, which is not consistent with the cursive signature on her Basis of Claim Form (BOC)10 or on her intake forms11 where her name XXXX is clearly legible. When asked about this, the principal claimant testified that at the time that her driver's licence was issued, she did not have a \"defined\" signature, and that she used to sign with her left hand, which she cannot do anymore since her detentions.\n[27] The panel finds this explanation to be not reasonable. The \"signature\" on the driver's licence isn't a signature, rather it is her surname printed in block letters, and the panel finds it unlikely that in 2013, when the principal claimant would have been 35, she allegedly did not have a \"defined\" signature, but that now, 4 years later at the age of 39, she does. Further to this, the panel finds it unlikely that the principal claimant's non-defined signature would appear more rudimentary, despite using the hand she had allegedly always signed with, than a signature she just developed using her other hand. The panel does not find this explanation credible, and draws a negative inference with respect to the principal claimant's credibility. The panel further finds that it is not the principal claimant's signature on her driver's licence, which undermines the reliability and authenticity of the document.\n[28] The panel notes that the picture on the driver's licence is the same as the picture on her duplicata electoral card, as discussed above and which indicates it was issued in 2014, and her state diploma issued in 1999. As discussed above, when asked about this, the principal claimant testified that her family used the same picture to procure all the documents for her while she was detained, and the panel found this explanation to be not reasonable as it chronologically could not be true.\n[29] For these reasons, the panel finds that the driver's licence submitted by the principal claimant is not a reliable document, and places no weight on it to support her identity.\nThe principal claimant's state diploma (dipl\u00f4me d'\u00c9tat)\n[30] The principal claimant submitted a copy of her state diploma (dipl\u00f4me d'\u00c9tat) in support of her identity.12 The panel finds, on the face of the document, that it is not a genuine document for the following reasons.\n[31] The original of this document which was presented at the hearing was clearly a photocopy purporting to be an original. The panel finds this reason on the face of the document to doubt the authenticity of the document.\n[32] When asked about how this document was obtained, the principal claimant testified that she got it when she finished secondary school and passed her state exam in 1996, but that she did not pick up the document right away, rather, her father went and got it later. It was in his possession as it was at her parents' home, and that was why she was able to provide it in support of her claim.\n[33] The panel notes that the picture on the state diploma is the same as the picture on her driver's licence, issued in 2013, and her duplicate electoral card issued in 2014, both of which as discussed above, the panel found to be not reliable documents. When asked about why the picture on the state diploma is the same as the electoral card and driver's licence, the principal claimant testified that her family used the same picture to procure all the documents for her while she was detained.\n[34] The panel finds that this explanation is not credible and finds the principal claimant's testimony regarding her state diploma to be not credible. The panel notes that the document itself indicates that it was issued on XXXX XXXX, 1999, which is not consistent with the testimony of the principal claimant that her father obtained documents for her using that photo while she was detained. The document itself says that no duplicate will be delivered, which suggests that this is the original diploma. As such, the picture on the diploma should date to when it was issued in 1999, which based on the principal claimant's testimony, is not the case, given her testimony that her family procured documents for her while she was detained using that picture, and her first allegation of detention dates to XXXX 2015. As such, the panel finds the principal claimant's testimony regarding when her diploma was issued is not credible, nor is her explanation that the picture on the three documents is the same because her family used it to procure documents while she was allegedly detained.\nAffidavit submitted post-hearing\n[35] As noted above, the principal claimant submitted an affidavit post hearing regarding the testimony she gave at the hearing. In her affidavit, with respect to her diploma, the principal claimant confirmed her testimony that she did not obtain her diploma, that her family obtained it for her, and that they gave the authorities a recent photo of the principal claimant. She stated that she did not sign the document, as she was in prison when her family obtained it. The panel finds that the affidavit does not provide reasonable explanations for why it is clearly a photocopy, nor for why the document indicates that it was issued in 1999, contrary to the testimony and assertions of the principal claimant. The panel finds that giving another conflicting answer after the hearing with no good explanation as to why her live testimony was wrong, just further undermines her credibility, rather than bolstering it.\n[36] For these reasons, the panel finds that the state diploma is not a genuine document on its face.\nBirth certificates for the minor claimants\n[37] The claimants provided birth certificates for all seven of the minor claimants.13 The panel finds that these documents are not genuine for the following reasons.\n[38] The panel notes the following with respect to the birth certificates: all seven are signed by the same person, XXXX XXXX XXXX, Bourgmestre, Commune de Lemba; all seven birth certificates indicate that the principal claimant appeared before the Bourgmestre; all seven birth certificates indicate that they were issued following judgement RCE XXXX from XXXX XXXX, 2016 (jugement suppletif RCE XXXX); and all seven list the father as XXXX XXXX, born in Pretoria and who has South African nationality.\n[39] The panel finds that the birth certificates are not genuine documents, on their face.\n[40] The panel notes that there are some oddities relating to the documents themselves. Firstly, the birth certificates for all seven minor claimants indicate that they were issued following judgement RCE XXXX from XXXX XXXX, 2016. However, when looking at the copy of judgement RCE XXXX provided, this judgement pertains only to minor claimants 1 and 4.14 Moreover, the judgement RCE XXXX does not mention claimants 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7. When asked about this, the principal claimant testified that she asked for all the birth certificates together at the same time. The panel finds this explanation not reasonable. Asking for the documents at the same time does not explain how five of the seven birth certificates were issued following a court judgement that not only does not pertain to the subjects in question, but does not even include their names. In addition, the panel notes that not all the birth certificates have the same date. The birth certificates for minor claimants 1 and 4 are dated XXXX XXXX, 2017; whereas the birth certificates for minor claimants 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 are dated XXXX XXXX, 2017. Given that all seven of the birth certificates were issued by the same person and all on the basis of that judgement, but not at the same time, the panel finds this reason to doubt the reliability of the seven birth certificates.\n[41] The principal claimant alleges in her amended BOC narrative and her testimony that her cousin XXXX is the one who got the birth certificates for her since she was at the hospital with her youngest son. She testified that they were all issued on the same day. The panel noted that the birth certificates themselves indicate that the principal claimant appeared, not that her cousin appeared. When asked about this, the principal claimant testified that she sent her cousin XXXX in her stead, as she was in the hospital with her youngest son. When the panel pointed out that two of the birth certificates are dated XXXX XXXX, and five are dated XXXX XXXX, the principal claimant testified that she asked for them all at the same time. The panel finds that the principal claimant has not provided a reasonable explanation for why her testimony and allegations are not consistent with the information on the seven birth certificates. As such, the panel draws a negative inference with respect to the principal claimant's credibility and finds this further reason to doubt the reliability of the documents.\n[42] The panel noted that all seven birth certificates list the father as XXXX XXXX, born in Pretoria and who has South African nationality; whereas the principal claimant alleged and previously testified that her husband, XXXX XXXX, while born in Pretoria, had Congolese citizenship. When asked about this inconsistency, the principal claimant testified that she did not know why the documents said that. The panel finds that the principal claimant has not provided a reasonable explanation for why her testimony and allegations are not consistent with the information on the seven birth certificates, as it pertains to the citizenship of the father of the minor claimants. As such, the panel draws a negative inference with respect to the principal claimant's credibility and finds this further reason to doubt the reliability of the documents.\nAffidavit submitted post-hearing\n[43] As noted above, the principal claimant submitted an affidavit post hearing regarding the testimony she gave at the hearing. In her affidavit, with respect to the birth certificates of the minor claimants, the principal claimant confirmed her testimony that it was her cousin XXXX who obtained the birth certificates, after having requested them during the adoption process. She stated in the affidavit that she thinks the reason all seven documents indicate that they were issued following judgement RCE XXXX is that they were issued after that judgement, because they had coincidentally asked for them during the adoption process. The panel finds that the affidavit does not provide reasonable explanations for the issues already outlined by the panel with respect to the birth certificates.\n[44] Given that all seven birth certificates for the minor claimants indicate that they are based on a court judgement that only applies to two of the minor claimants, given the testimony of the principal claimant that is inconsistent with what is written on the documents, and given that the principal claimant has not provided a reasonable explanation for these inconsistencies, the panel finds that the birth certificates for the minor claimants are not reliable on their face. Accordingly, the panel places no weight on these birth certificates in support of the identities of the minor claimants.\n[45] Furthermore, these birth certificates were issued by the authority of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and as discussed later in this decision, another document issued by this same individual was clearly altered and also contains information that is not consistent with the testimony and allegations of the principal claimant. In light of this and the inconsistencies on the birth certificates, which have not been reasonably explained, the panel finds that these documents have been manufactured in order to establish the identities of the minor claimants.\nCourt judgements relating to minor claimants 1 and 4\n[46] The claimants also provided judgement RCE XXXX and the adoption judgement RCE XXXX, which pertain to minor claimants 1 and 4.15 The panel notes that the judgement RCE XXXX and the adoption judgement RCE XXXX indicate that the principal claimant appeared in person at the public hearing.\n[47] When asked if she went in person to obtain judgement RCE XXXX, the principal claimant testified that she did not, as she was detained at the time, rather her husband went. When the panel noted that according to the document itself, she had appeared in person, the principal claimant testified that she had not understood the question, and that she was not there in person, as her baby, minor claimant 7, was sick, so she was not there when the judgement was rendered. With respect to the adoption judgement RCE XXXX, the principal claimant testified that she wrote a letter and her husband testified.\n[48] In the post-hearing affidavit submitted by the principal claimant, she stated that she did appear in court on XXXX XXXX, 2016, however, after answering questions from the prosecutor (Minist\u00e8re Public) she had a panic attack and was not there for long. She stated that she was rattled because it was a Congolese man in authority who was asking her questions, which reminded her of her detention. She also stated that during the hearing before the Board, she did not want to be emotional, and so she was trying to supress her emotions, which negatively impacted her testimony and her ability to connect questions to her personal experience. The panel is sympathetic to the difficulties and stresses faced by claimants in the hearing room setting, and the panel is cognizant of the psychiatrist report which diagnoses the principal claimant with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder.16 However, the panel notes that based on her own testimony at the hearing, the principal claimant and her husband had been asking to adopt the minor claimants 1 and 4 since 2005, and each request prior to 2016 was denied. The panel further notes that the principal claimant is alleging in her affidavit that the adopting hearing was triggering and caused a panic attack. In this context, the panel finds that the adoption hearing would be quite memorable and therefore the panel finds the explanations given in the affidavit to be of little probative value.\n[49] Given that the principal claimant's testimony is not consistent with judgements RCE XXXX and RCE XXXX, both of which indicate that she appeared in person, the panel finds the judgements are not reliable documents to establish he identities of the principal claimant and her children, minor claimants 1 and 4.\nBaptism cards for the minor claimants\n[50] The claimants submitted baptism cards for all seven of the minor claimants.17 The panel notes that the original documents presented at the hearing were photocopies with a stamp from the church and a signature of some unknown person. The documents do not have anything such as a picture or biometric data to attach them to the minor claimants. As such, the panel finds they have no probative value in establishing the identities or nationalities of the minor claimants.\nSchool documents for minor claimants 1 through 4\n[51] The claimants submitted education documents relating to minor claimants 1, 2, 3, and 4.18 The panel notes that the originals presented at the hearing are photocopies and have nothing, such as a picture or biometric data, to attach them to the four older minor claimants. As such, the panel finds they have no probative value in establishing the identities or nationalities of the four older minor claimants.\nCertificate of family composition (Attestation de composition familiale)\n[52] The principal claimant submitted a certificate of family composition,19 which indicates that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is married to the principal claimant, and has seven children, the minor claimants. The principal claimant testified that this document was established by the Bourgmestre, XXXX XXXX XXXX, because he knew her family and did it for her.\n[53] The panel noted that the document indicates that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has South African nationality. When asked about this, the principal claimant testified that she did not know why the documents said that, she assumes it is because the township was not aware that her husband had changed nationality, and that they must have assumed he was still South African because he was white. The panel finds this explanation to be not reasonable, as it is contradictory to her testimony that the Bourgmestre knew her family and established the document accordingly. The panel finds that if the Bourgmestre knew her family, he would have indicated that her husband was a Congolese citizen, as she has alleged. Consequently, the panel finds this reason to doubt the reliability of the document.\n[54] The panel also noted that there are two changes made to the document in black pen. When asked about this, the principal claimant testified that she does not know about that; that was how the document was given to her. Upon further questioning by her counsel, she speculated that the changes were made by the person who issued the document.\n[55] The panel finds this document to be not reliable on its face. It has clearly been altered, and according to the testimony of the principal claimant she is not sure who altered it or when. In addition, the information on the document is not consistent with the testimony or allegations of the principal claimant regarding her husband's nationality. Finally, the document is issued by the authority of XXXX XXXX XXXX, and the panel found that other documents issued by the same person were not authentic.\n[56] In her post-hearing affidavit, the principal claimant stated that she confirms her testimony that her cousin XXXX obtained the certificate of family composition on XXXX XXXX, 2017, that the document is authentic, that the Bourgmestre indicated in error that her husband was a national of South Africa, and that it was the Bourgmestre who made the changes to the document by hand, which is common practice in the DRC. As previously stated, the panel finds the affidavit to be of little probative value.\n[57] For all these reasons, the panel places no weight on the certificate of family composition in support of the identities of the claimants.\nDocuments submitted by the principal claimant after the hearing\n[58] As stated above, at the end of the hearing, Counsel asked to be able to provide further submissions on identity in writing, and the panel granted his request. Along with those submissions, Counsel provided several post hearing documents, including an affidavit from the principal claimant regarding the testimony she gave at the hearing, without making a proper application for their acceptance as evidence. Nevertheless, the panel accepted them as evidence, but finds these documents have little probative value for the following reasons.\n[59] The principal claimant provided a document entitled Individual record of civil status (fiche individuelle de l'\u00e9tat-civil).20 It is dated XXXX XXXX, 2017, which is eight days after the hearing, and indicates that the principal claimant is Congolese. The document is signed by XXXX XXXX XXXX, Bourgmestre, Commune de Lemba, the same person who signed the birth certificates for the minor claimants and the certificate of family composition, which are discussed above. The principal claimant also submitted as post hearing evidence a certified true copy of a marriage certificate.21 The panel notes that the certified true copy of the marriage certificate does not include the signatures of the spouses or their witnesses, was issued XXXX XXXX, 2017, 13 days after the hearing, and is signed by XXXX XXXX XXXX, Bourgmestre, Commune de Lemba.\n[60] Given the panel's concerns regarding the other documents signed by this individual and the finding that the birth certificates are not genuine, as well as the fact that the individual record of civil status and the marriage certificate are signed by the same individual, the panel finds that these documents are not reliable. The panel therefore places no weight on them to establish the identity of the principal claimant.\n[61] Among the documents submitted post hearing were a driver's licence and electoral card for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX,22 which were submitted to establish that the principal claimant's husband is a national of the Congo and not South Africa. Even if these two cards are authentic, the panel finds that the cards themselves do not explain why the birth certificates for the minor claimants and the certificate of family composition state that XXXX XXXX is a national of South Africa. The panel finds that these documents rather reinforce the panel's findings that the birth certificates and the certificate of family composition are not reliable documents.\n[62] The principal claimant submitted two handwritten letters, one from her cousin XXXX and one from her neighbour, in support of her identity as post hearing evidence.23 Both letters are dated after the hearing. While both are accompanied by identity documents, neither letter contains security features, nor is either letter a sworn affidavit or otherwise notarized letter. The panel notes that the identity document of the neighbour was issued after the hearing. Moreover, the panel notes that XXXX supposedly obtained the documents which the panel found to be unreliable, and as such, does not find him to be a reliable source. For these reasons, as well as the panel's previous findings that the claimants submitted false documents to support their identities, the panel finds that these two handwritten letters are not sufficient to establish the personal and national identities of the claimants.\n[63] Finally, the principal claimant submitted an additional education document for minor claimants 1 through 5.24 The original documents are colour printouts, with a handwritten number and signature at the bottom. All five documents were issued in Kinshasa on XXXX XXXX, 2017, all five documents have the same look, colouring, and format; however, they are not all signed by the same person or stamped as being from the same school. When compared to the other school document on file,25 the panel notes that the post hearing school document for minor claimant 1 is inconsistent in the spelling of his first name, and that neither document spells his first name the way his BOC does. In addition, the post hearing document is missing the last number on his registration number, and the signatures from the school official, which are allegedly from the same person, are not consistent. In the post hearing document for minor claimant 2, the author attests to having given minor claimant 2 her report card on XXXX XXXX, 2017; however, the report card itself is only dated XXXX XXXX, 2017. In addition, the report card is signed by XXXX XXXX whereas the post hearing document is signed by XXXX XXXX, and their signatures are not consistent. Similarly, the post hearing education document for minor claimants 3 and 4, which are allegedly issued by the same school and signed by the same individual XXXX XXXX also have errors in the first names. However, when the document for minor claimant 3 is compared to his report card,26 the name of the signatory is the same, but that makes it inconsistent with the report card for minor claimant 1. The panel finds it unlikely that the same individual would print their own name on the report card two different ways. Considering the inconsistencies in the spellings and between the post hearing and previously disclosed education documents, all allegedly from one source, the panel finds these documents are not reliable, and are more likely than not, fraudulent. With respect to the post hearing document for minor claimant 5, the panel notes that the stamp for the school is different between the post hearing document and previously submitted documents,27 which undermines the reliability of the documents.\n[64] Given these inconsistencies on the face of the documents themselves, the panel finds that the documents are at best not reliable, and at worst, fraudulent. As such, the panel places no weight on any of the education documents to establish the identities of the minor claimants.\nReport from the Canadian Centre for Victims of Torture (CCVT)\n[65] The principal claimant submitted a report from a psychiatrist at the CCVT, which indicates a diagnosis of PTSD and major depression for the principal claimant.28 The panel notes however that the psychological state of the principal claimant does not explain the issues outlined above with respect to the documents themselves, many of which were clearly fraudulent on their face.\nSummary\n[66] In light of the above, the panel finds that the claimants have not met the burden of, on a balance of probabilities, establishing their personal identities or nationalities.\nManifestly Unfounded Claim\n[67] Section 107.1 of the IRPA states: \"If the Refugee Protection Division rejects a claim for refugee protection, it must state in its reasons for the decision that the claim is manifestly unfounded if it is of the opinion that the claim is clearly fraudulent.\"29\n[68] The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Position on Manifestly Unfounded Applications for Asylum has provided the following guidance on this topic:\nThe Office has stated that the notion of \"clearly fraudulent\" could reasonably cover situations where the applicant deliberately attempts to deceive the authorities determining refugee status. The mere fact of having made false statements to the authorities does not, however, necessarily exclude a well-founded fear of persecution and vitiate the need for asylum, thus making the claim \"clearly fraudulent\". Only if the applicant makes what appear to be false allegations of a material or substantive nature relevant for the determination of his or her status could the claim be considered \"clearly fraudulent\".30 [emphasis added]\n[69] The panel finds that the principal claimant deliberately attempted to deceive the panel by submitting fraudulent identity documents in order to establish the identities of herself and her children. The principal claimant submitted an electoral card, driver's licence, and diploma in support of her identity, all of which used the same photograph despite having been issued on three different dates. The panel found the diploma to be clearly fraudulent on its face, and also found that both the electoral card and the driver's licence had inconsistencies that undermined their authenticity. The panel found that the seven birth certificates submitted by the principal claimant with respect to the identities of her seven children were not authentic, as they all were issued based on a court judgement, itself found to be not reliable, pertaining to only two of the children and all incorrectly state that their father has South African nationality. Moreover, these seven documents were issued by the same individual as other problematic documents, issued prior to and after the hearing, including the family composition certificate which had clearly been altered, and itself contained inconsistencies. Finally, the two sets of school documents submitted, one set prior to the hearing and one set after the hearing, contain inconsistencies amongst and between themselves, which led to the panel's finding that they were at best not reliable and at worst fraudulent.\n[70] The panel also notes that when confronted at the hearing with the inconsistencies in the documents, the principal claimant's testimony was not credible and she was not able to provide a reasonable testimony for these inconsistencies. Moreover, the principal claimant provided an affidavit post hearing in an attempt to explain why some of her testimony at the hearing was incorrect. The panel found that giving another conflicting answer after the hearing with no good explanation as to why her live testimony was wrong, just further undermined the credibility of the principal claimant.\n[71] The panel finds that the claimants have provided false documents both before and after the hearing, and that those provided after the hearing were an attempt to corroborate those provided before. Moreover, the panel finds that documents relating to the minor claimants have been manufactured in an attempt to establish their identities.\n[72] Given the deliberate attempt to deceive the panel by providing false documents in an attempt to establish their identities and the attempt to mislead the panel with the testimony regarding these documents, the panel finds that the claimants' claims are manifestly unfounded.\nCONCLUSION\n[73] Having considered the evidence before it, the panel finds that the claimants have not met the burden of, on a balance of probabilities, establishing their personal identities or nationalities. The panel further finds the claimants attempted to mislead the panel with respect to their identities.\n[74] Accordingly, their claims for refugee protection are rejected and the panel finds that the claims are manifestly unfounded.\n(signed)\n\"Catherine Smith\"\nCatherine Smith\nSeptember 25, 2017\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C.

He claims he is a citizen of China, and seeks refugee protection pursuant to the provisions of ss. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n[2] The panel has considered counsel's oral submissions, which were made at the conclusion of the hearing in reaching this decision.\n[3] The Refugee Protection Division appointed a designated representative, Ms. XXXX XXXX XXXX in light of the fact that the claimant is a minor. He will be 18 next June.\n[4] The panel has also kept in mind the Chairperson Guideline 3: Child Refugee Claimants: Procedural and Evidentiary Issues.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] The panel finds that the claimant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection pursuant to the requirements of s. 97(1) of the IRPA.\n[6] The panel's reasons are as follows. The panel has considered the evidence as a whole, and the panel finds that there were many credibility concerns which cast doubt on the veracity of the claim.\nALLEGATIONS\n[7] The detailed allegations are set out in the Basis of Claim and will not be repeated here in detail.\n[8] The claimant was a student in China and was accepted into the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of Guangzhou City in XXXX 2015. Prior to that, he completed XXXX XXXX in Guangzhou City, and obtained his diploma. He is currently studying in Toronto.\n[9] He claims he felt stress at school. He then took up Falun Gong as a remedy.\n[10] On XXXX XXXX, 2017, his Falun Gong group was raided by the Public Security Bureau (PSB).\n[11] He then went into hiding at his aunt's home.\n[12] A smuggler was found to help him come to Canada. He left China on July 21, 2017.\n[13] On XXXX XXXX, 2017, the PSB came looking for him with a summons.\n[14] The claimant found a practice group in Canada and continues to practice Falun Gong.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[15] The claimant`s identity was established by his original passport, and a certified true copy of his Resident ID Card.1\n[16] The panel finds that he has proved his identity on a balance of probabilities standard.\nCredibility\nVery limited knowledge of Falun Gong\n[17] The claimant`s knowledge of Falun Gong was very limited.\n[18] In decision RAD TB6-13182 from the Refugee Appeal Division, it was held that:\nThe RAD is aware of Federal Court jurisprudence which cautions against determining religious identity on the basis of a refugee Appellant's religious knowledge, or lack thereof. However, it is also important for the RAD to consider the nature of the religion or practice. It may be that some religions place little value on knowledge, and it would thus be an error to expect their adherents to value knowledge, which their belief system does not see as important. However, objective evidence establishes that knowledge is an important component of Falun Gong (also referred to as Falun Dafa):\nAs the foundation of Falun Gong is a body of fundamental knowledge, essential for the task of undertaking proper cultivation, it would be rather difficult for a purported Falun Gong practitioner to have little of this fundamental knowledge. In the RAD's view, the Appellant who claims to adhere to a knowledge-based practice may well be different than the expectations of someone who claims to follow a faith-based belief system. While this does not justify a microscopic analysis of an Appellant's evidence, it does create the expectation that the refugee Appellant who purports to be a Falun Gong practitioner be able to testify to that essential fundamental knowledge.\n[19] The claimant could not recite any of the verses which accompany the five exercises. He could not name the third exercise. He missed one character out of the name for the fifth exercise. He was asked to perform the third exercise. He started in the wrong position. As a male, when doing movement 3-1 of exercise 3 (Danshou Chingguan), he was to start with the left hand in the air, but he started with the right hand in the air.\n[20] The claimant is young and has excellent education for his age. His memory at this age should be at his peak. There was no medical evidence before the Board that he had any medical issues which would affect his memory. He testified with confidence and was able to answer all questions put to him. The panel also takes judicial notice of the fact that education in modern China for youth involves a great deal of memorization.\n[21] His counsel asked him whether he needed to know the verses when practising, and he confirmed that he did.\n[22] These five exercises are not complex. They can be learned quickly, though learning them to a high standard may take time. The claimant alleged that he practiced Falun Gong from January 2017, and did so uninterrupted until July 2017. He also claims that he has been practising in Toronto since he arrived in July 2017.\n[23] The claimant was also asked the three basic principles of Falun Gong, and he misstated them when asked. He cited three classes of persons who should not practice Falun Gong instead.\n[24] His counsel then asked a second time, and he was then able to say Truth, Compassion and Forbearance.\n[25] In light of the fact that the claimant had so little knowledge of Falun Gong, the panel finds that he is not a genuine Falun Gong practitioner as alleged.\nInconsistent Evidence on the PSB looking for him\n[26] The claimant was asked who told him that the PSB had come to his home looking for him, and he said in his testimony, his parents did. He said they told him that the PSB came to his home looking for him. But in his BOC, he said that after arriving in the US, he called his aunt and learned from her that the PSB had come to his home with a summons.\n[27] He was asked to explain the contradiction. He then said that in the beginning, his aunt told him, but later, it was his parents who told him.\n[28] The panel does not accept this explanation to this simple question. It was obvious from the context of the question that the claimant was being asked about how he first came to know the PSB had been looking for him, and his evidence was plainly inconsistent. As a result, the panel draws a negative credibility inference.\n[29] The claimant was then asked how many times had the PSB come looking for him. He said three times, XXXX XXXX, 2017, XXXX XXXX, 2017, and XXXX XXXX, 2017.\n[30] In his BOC, he did not mention the two later alleged visits. He was asked why he did not mention this. He said that at the time he wrote his story, he did not know about the two later visits. The claim was not filed until XXXX XXXX, 2017. On that same day, the entire content of the BOC was interpreted to him and all the questions in the forms, in Cantonese.2 Further, his BOC was dated XXXX XXXX, 2017, which was one day after the alleged PSB second visit. In any event, there is no documentary evidence of when the claimant entered Canada, as he did so on foot, illegally.\n[31] He also contradicted himself in his evidence. At first, he said that such information about being wanted by the PSB was important. Later, he said that he did not think that this information was important.\n[32] The duty is on the claimant to provide up to date information to support his claim. This was not trivial information. This was information which went to the core of his claim that he was wanted by the PSB. He met with his solicitor and designated representative on November 9, 2017. He also provided a statutory declaration that same day in support of his claim, and he amended his BOC the same day.\n[33] As a result, the panel finds that the claimant has omitted highly critical evidence from his BOC, without a rational explanation, and given inconsistent evidence about how he came to know the PSB were looking for him.\n[34] As a result, the panel draws a negative credibility inference.\nFraudulent summons\n[35] The claimant produced a summons in support of his claim.3\n[36] Contrary to the submission of his solicitor, it was irregular on its face, and there is no duty on the panel to bring matters in the NDP to the attention of the claimant.\n[37] The panel would refer to CHN104188.E at Exhibit 3. Summonses and subpoenas are commonly issued in China. That Response to Information Request refers to subpoenas, and it says that they are served by Courts to all parties to criminal proceedings to appear in Court. It also notes that fewer than 10 percent of subpoenaed witnesses appear in Court, and it also notes that Chinese Courts have subpoena powers, but no legal penalty has been set for not complying with a Court subpoena.\n[38] So, it is clear that these subpoenas are issued, but they are not often adhered to, and they are not often enforced, and they are often just disregarded in China.\n[39] So, the panel has to consider the subpoena within the preponderance of the evidence as a whole. And the panel finds that even if it shows that the claimant was wanted for questioning, in relation to practising Falun Gong, so would anybody else that was being investigated in that particular case, and that it is not unique to him. They are issued to all parties in criminal proceedings.\n[40] It also is noteworthy that it was not followed by a coercive summons. Although the claimant alleges that the PSB continued to look for him after he came to Canada in July 2017, never did they follow up with a coercive summons.\n[41] So, the panel finds it does not really advance his claim one way or another, particularly in light of the other findings, and the negative credibility findings which have been made in relation to his claim that he was wanted by the PSB.\n[42] The subpoena is stamped at the left hand margin. This is irregular. According to the sample subpoena, the copy retained by the issuing court would not be stamped.\n[43] So, the panel would also note that fraudulent documents are common in China. (See XXXX XXXX XXXX, Item 3.22 of the NDP at Exhibit 3).\n[44] The panel finds, considering the above facts, and the preponderance of the evidence as a whole, that the subpoena is a fraud.\n[45] The panel finds that the claimant was not subpoenaed for participation in an illegal practice group. The panel also finds, by extension of inference, that the raid did not take place, since the subpoena is fraudulent and since the claimant was not a genuine Falun Gong practitioner. As a result, the panel draws a negative credibility inference.\nPhotos and practitioner's letter4\n[46] The claimant provided two photos of himself doing Falun Gong exercises in a park with others. He also produced a letter from one XXXX XXXX XXXX, who states that the claimant is a sincere practitioner and that they practice until today. The letter is dated November 2, 2017. There is no basis for the comment in the letter that the claimant is a genuine Falun Gong practitioner.\n[47] Moreover, the claimant`s knowledge of Falun Gong proved very limited. These photos and letter are not labelled, nor do they demonstrate that the claimant has been practising Falun Gong on a sustained basis since arriving in Canada as he alleges. As a result, the letters are given no weight.\nSur place claim\n[48] The claimant alleges that the PSB came looking for him in XXXX, XXXX and XXXX2017.\n[49] Clearly, if the PSB are looking for him in China, then they do not know he is here. In any event, there is no evidence that he is wanted at all, as noted above. Thus, there is no risk that his activities here in Canada would come to the attention of the authorities in China, or that his activities here put him as risk in any way.\nCONCLUSION\n[50] The s. 96 and 97(1) claims, including the torture claim, are dismissed for lack of credibility.\n[51] The sur place claim is dismissed for the reasons given above.\n[52] The claim has been advanced with the use of a fraudulent summons, and as a result, the panel finds that the claim is manifestly unfounded pursuant to s. 107.1 of the IRPA.\n(signed)\n\"J.

Counsel stated that the panel must consider the claimant's sur place claim. He stated:\nCounsel advised that a sur place claim could arise if the panel determined that the claimant was a genuine Falun Gong practitioner, even if the panel concluded that this was the case on the basis of considering the claimant's practice in Canada. Counsel suggested that the panel ought to approach this analysis by looking at the most recent evidence in regard to the claimant's Falun Gong identity and then stepping back until the threshold of genuineness was reached. If the threshold is reached before considering evidence related to the claimant's practice in China then it is open to the panel, on the basis of that evidence alone, to determine the claimant is a genuine practitioner. Counsel further argued that where the panel finds the claimant is a genuine practitioner, then such finding triggers the question whether the claimant's fear is well founded.\n[4] The claimant did not make any allegations that she was a Falun Gong practitioner.\n[5] Her claim was based on her belief in Christianity (Shouters).\n[6] The claims are fundamentally different. Because counsel based his legal arguments on a fundamentally different factual scenario, his submissions are of limited utility.\n[7] In the same written submission, counsel alleges the panel should recuse itself. The basis appears to be that the panel sought to clarify the correct meaning of a sur place claim, and stated this with clarity at the hearing. All panels must be directed on the correct law in order to decide a claim. This is not basis for the panel to recuse itself, and the panel so finds.\nDETERMINATION\n[8] The panel finds that the claimant is not a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection pursuant to the requirements of s. 97 of the IRPA.\n[9] The panel's reasons are as follows. The panel has considered the evidence as a whole, and the panel finds that there were many credibility concerns which cast doubt on the veracity of the claim.\nALLEGATIONS\n[10] The claimant claims she is a Shouter, Christian.\n[11] In December 2014, her friend preached the gospel to her.\n[12] She went to her friend's house church in December 2014.\n[13] The church was raided on July 12, 2015. The claimant went to hide at her aunt's home. Her parents called her aunt to say that the PSB had come looking for her. One week later, they came looking for her again. Later, the claimant alleged that the PSB went to her home again to look for her.\n[14] With the help of a smuggler, the claimant came to Canada to make her refugee claim.\nThe Law\n[15] During the time for counsel's submissions, several comments were made about this tribunal and how evidence is to be handled. As a result, the panel takes this opportunity to re-state some of the basic principles.\n[16] Counsel stated that \"where the panel does not question on a matter, it waives the right to make negative credibility inferences on these matters.\" In Sheikh v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1990] 3 F.C.238 (C.A.) at 244: \"...even without disbelieving every word a claimant has uttered, a panel may reasonably find him so lacking in credibility that it concludes there is no credible evidence relevant to his claim... In other words, a general finding of a lack of credibility on the part of the claimant may conceivably extend to all relevant evidence emanating from his testimony.\" Further, not every inconsistency or omission has to be put to the claimant, especially if there are many of them: Ngongo, Ndjadi Denis v. M.C.I. (F.C.T.D., no. IMM-6717-98). Where the witness has been caught in one lie, in itself, may be sufficient to discredit all of their evidence: Guney, Seyit Ozan v. M.C.I. (F.C., no. IMM-1424-08). Where numerous credibility problems have been identified, the Division may make a general (global) finding of lack of credibility based on their cumulative effect.\n[17] The question of failed refugee applications in foreign jurisdictions also arose. The Refugee Protection Division cannot base its decision on an asylum rejection in a foreign jurisdiction, but it can evaluate the claimant's testimony in light of the evidence given by the claimant in support of that asylum claim.\n[18] Counsel also commented on the meaning of a sur place claim at the hearing and in his written submissions, which were dealt with above. The correct principles are as follows, as established by the Federal Court:\n27 A refugee sur place is defined in the literature: The Convention refugee definition does not distinguish between persons who flee their country in order to avoid the prospect of persecution and those who, while already abroad, determine that they cannot or will not return by reason of the risk of persecution in their state of nationality or origin...\nIn addition to claims grounded in either new circumstances or a dramatic intensification of pre-existing conditions in the country of origin, a sur place claim to refugee status may also be based on the activities of the refugee claimant since leaving her country. International law recognizes that if while abroad an individual expresses views or engages in activities which jeopardize the possibility of safe return to her state, she may be considered a Convention refugee. The key issues are whether the activities abroad are likely to have come to the attention of the authorities in the claimant's country of origin.... (The Law of Refugee Status, James Hathaway, Butterworths, 1991.)\n28 The standard to be applied by the Board in assessing sur place claims has been stated by the Federal Court, in Ejtehadian v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2007 FC 158, [2007] F.C.J. No. 214 (QL). Justice Edmond Blanchard held: [11] The IRB's articulation of the test in a sur-place claim is incorrect. In a refugee sur-place claim, credible evidence of a claimant's activities while in Canada that are likely to substantiate any potential harm upon return must be expressly considered by the IRB even if the motivation behind the activities is non-genuine.\n[19] The sur place claim is part of the claim and must be set out in the Basis of Claim. The claimant should state the facts which support his allegation that he is a refugee sur place, though the panel should consider it in any event.\n[20] Counsel alleged that credibility concerns about other matters do not affect the question of whether the claimant is a genuine Christian. This is not correct. Whether the claimant is a genuine Christian is one aspect of the claimant's identity. But there may be non-credible evidence which impugns other aspects of the claim, such as identity, objective or subjective fear of persecution, state protection and internal flight alternative. Each element of the claim must be established. In assessing the evidence which relates to the question of whether the claimant is a genuine Christian, the panel must consider that evidence in the context of the evidence as a whole.\n[21] Counsel alleged that in cases where the claim is a Port of Entry claim, and where the claimant claimed refugee status after stepping of the plane, or after crossing the border into Canada, there is no need to consider the evidence about entry. This is also not correct. The claimant may have entered the country on a false passport, avoided detection, and then disposed of the passport before making his claim. In this case, there may not be any evidence of how the claimant came to Canada because it has been destroyed. In cases such as this, the panel is obliged to consider the evidence on exit from China and entry into Canada.\n[22] Counsel also stated that if the panel does not ask about the departure of the claimant from his home country, it cannot then draw any negative inferences about any contradictions. But the panel may not have had to ask, because it was dealt with in the sworn evidence, or as a part of the claimant's testimony and replies to other questions put to the claimant. The correct principle is that there is no legal requirement to draw the claimant's attention to inconsistencies, between the claimant's statements and country condition documents that form a part of the evidence: Osei v. M.C.I. (F.C.T.D. no. T-2992-92), Reed November 17, 1993.\n[23] Finally, counsel stated that the panel must not apply the Jurisprudential Guide, RAD Decision TB6-11632,1 the applicable Jurisprudential Guide identified by the Chair on July 18, 2017 pursuant to section 159(1)(h) of the IRPA, which provides a detailed, clear, and sound analysis of Chinese exit control procedures and the ability for those being sought by the authorities to exit China via an airport using a genuine passport. It thoroughly analyzes the efficacy of the Chinese national computer network known as the Golden Shield Project, as well as the efficacy of other procedures in controlling exits from airports in China. The analysis at paragraphs 12-22 and 25-34 forms the basis of this Jurisprudential Guide and is relevant when considering a claimant's allegations regarding their ability to exit China from an airport using a genuine passport.\n[24] Counsel cited Huang v. Canada (MCI), 2017 FC 762 as a challenge to the Jurisprudential Guide.2 In that case, counsel for the applicant in the Federal Court, Mr. Michel Korman, argued that the RAD erred by only citing jurisprudence which supported his case, and by failing to mention the Federal Court cases in which it was held that it is plausible to escape from China on one's own passport. In Huang,3 Justice Russel made the following findings:\n1) He was an adherent to the approach of Justice Brown in Yan v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 146 cited above herein;\n2) Applying Yang v Canada (MCI), 2016 FC 543,4 it was held that before a panel could find that it would be implausible for a claimant to depart from China with his own passport, he would need to address the evidence in the case supporting such a claim, and in particular, any evidence of corruption or of the authorities having been bribed. The Board must not say that corruption is possible and then ignore this when assessing the claimant's explanation of how he left China with the assistance of a smuggler who bribed the official;\n3) The Board must not engage in unwarranted speculation in surmising that there were systems in place to prevent the compromise of the system by one individual;\n4) The Board must not ignore the warnings in Ren5 and Zhang,6 to the effect that \"one official with access to the computer system would be sufficient.\" In Huang, there was evidence that led to the effect that one official had deleted the claimant's name from the system;\n5) The Board must assess the evidence that the claimant was able to escape, as in Huang, where the claimant had testified that the smuggler helped her to clear customs by giving her a badge and telling her to go to a particular checkpoint.7\n[25] Applying these warnings here, the panel finds as follows:\n1) The facts here are very similar to those in Yan.8 There was no evidence of bribery here. All that the claimant said was that the smuggler arranged everything for her. This would not be enough. He would also need connections himself with the airlines. He would need objective evidence that the method he used to escape has an objective evidential base - whereas there was none of that here.\n2) In this case, the findings of the panel are supported by case law and the evidence. There is no unwarranted speculation here;\n3) As for Ren9 and Zhang,10 these cases do not apply as there was no evidence in the present case that a single official had facilitated the removal of the claimant's name from the computer system.\n4) Looking at the evidence in this case, and having considered the jurisprudence on escape from China which supports the claimant's case and that which does not, the panel finds that the country documentation on the difficulty of escape from China with one's passport when being wanted by the PSB, coupled with the Jurisprudential Guide and the decision of Yan,11 render it not be possible for the panel to accept the claimant's evidence on her escape from China. She testified that she cleared customs and went through a security check in Hong Kong upon entry.\n[26] As a result, the panel finds that there is no basis to distinguish the Jurisprudential Guide.\n[27] With those legal principles before us, the panel's decision is as follows.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[28] The claimant's identity was proved on a balance of probabilities standard by a certified true copy of her Resident ID card. She also produced her household booklet and her marriage certificate as proof of her identity.12\nCredibility\n[29] The main issue in the case was credibility.\n(i) Use of another name\n[30] The claimant was asked whether she had used any other name at the hearing. She said she had not. Later, it surfaced in her testimony that she had used another name on a false passport. The claimant was asked to explain. She said that \"because that passport was fraudulent, so she did not know that she needed to say that, that one is my other name I use.\"\n[31] The panel does not accept this explanation. Clearly the claimant had used another name to go to the US, but did not disclose it. As a result, the panel draws a negative credibility inference.\n(ii) Inconsistent evidence on going into hiding\n[32] The claimant was asked where she lived before she came to Canada. She said it was XXXX XXXX XXXX Road, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX District, XXXX City, Fujian Province. That was the same address as on her Resident ID card. She said that was her home, and that she left her home to come to Canada. This evidence was then repeated to the claimant. She was then asked, as per her BOC, whether she left from her aunt's home to come to Canada (i.e. as stated in her BOC) or from her home to come to Canada (as she testified to twice in the hearing). She then said, contrary to her earlier testimony, that \"before she had been living at her house, after I lived at my aunt's house to go to XXXX XXXX (i.e. and then on to Canada).\" So there was a contradiction between saying she lived at home, and that she lived at her aunt's, before she came to Canada.\n[33] The claimant then reverted to the facts set out in her BOC that she was hiding at her aunt's home in XXXX City, before she came to Canada. She said that her aunt helped her to get a smuggler, and that the smuggler made arrangements for her to come to Canada. She said that she left her aunt's home in XXXX City and arrived in Shenzhen by car with the smuggler. She then left Shenzhen by bus and went through customs into Hong Kong. She said that she also went through a security check. She flew from Hong Kong to XXXX (where she stayed for 3 days), then by plane to XXXX, and then by plane to XXXX, Canada.\n[34] She was asked how long she had been staying at her aunt's house, and she said until she left for Canada, that she stayed there from July 12, 2015 to September 15, 2015. But it was pointed out to the claimant that in her Schedule A document, filed in support of her refugee claim, she said that she stayed at an unknown hotel from July 2015 -September 2015.\n[35] The claimant was asked to explain the obvious inconsistency. The claimant then explained that when she was in hiding at her aunt's house, her aunt was afraid that the PSB would find her, so she arranged for her to stay in an underground hotel, near her aunt's home.\n[36] But her Schedule 12 stated that the unknown hotel where she stayed from July to September 2015 was in Shenzhen City, Guangdong Province, not near her aunt's home in XXXX City. Now Shenzhen City, where the claimant stated in her Schedule 12 that she was hiding in an underground hotel, is some 850 km from XXXX City, where the claimant testified in her initial testimony that she was staying with her aunt.\n[37] She then explained that that was what she said at immigration. She said that she left from her aunt's home early, but not from the underground hotel, so some mistake had been made.\n[38] This chain of evidence involved to less than 4 inconsistences: whether she stayed at her home prior to coming to Canada or with her aunt; whether she stayed at an unknown hotel or with her aunt; whether the unknown hotel was in XXXX near her aunt, or in Shenzhen as per her Schedule 12. She then reverted to the aunt story, having already testified that she stayed at an unknown hotel near her aunt's home.\n[39] The panel draws a strong negative credibility inference here.\n[40] The panel finds that the claimant was never in hiding whether at her aunt's home, or at an unknown hotel in either XXXX or Shenzhen. If she was never in hiding, the panel also finds that she did not flee to her aunt's home, as alleged. The panel finds that it is more likely than not that she left her own home at XXXX XXXX XXXX Road, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX District, XXXX City, Fujian Province, to come to Canada.\n(iii) Inconsistent evidence on how many times the PSB came looking for her\n[41] The claimant testified at the hearing that the PSB came looking for her twice in relation to her belonging to the underground church. She said that they came two days after the incident, by which she meant the alleged raid of July 12, 2015. But in her BOC, she said that they came two days after the incident, then a second time which was one week later, and then \"recently, she called her aunt and learned that the PSB still went to look for her.\" That makes at least three, possibly more. She was asked to explain. She said that her aunt would not tell her, because they were afraid for her.\n[42] This explanation not only does not make sense, it also contradicts her testimony and her statement in the BOC where she said clearly how many times they came looking for her.\n[43] As a result, the panel draws a negative credibility inference, and the panel finds that the claimant was not wanted by the PSB.\n(iv) Subpoena not genuine\n[44] Now, the claimant produced a subpoena which is at Exhibit 9. The panel would refer to CHN104188.E at Exhibit 3. Summonses and subpoenas are commonly issued in China. That Response to Information Request refers to subpoenas, and it says that they are served by Courts to all parties to criminal proceedings to appear in Court. It all notes that fewer than 10 percent of subpoenaed witnesses appear in Court, and it also notes that Chinese Courts have subpoena powers, but no legal penalty has been set for not complying with a Court subpoena.\n[45] So, it is clear that these subpoenas are issued, but they are not often adhered to, and they are not often enforced, and they are often just disregarded in China.\n[46] So, the panel has to consider the subpoena within the preponderance of the evidence as a whole. And the panel finds that even if it shows that the claimant was wanted for questioning, in relation to belonging to underground church, so would anybody else that was being investigated in that particular case, and that it is not unique to her. They are issued to all parties in criminal proceedings.\n[47] It also is noteworthy that it was not followed by a coercive summons. Although the claimant alleges that the PSB continued to look for her, after she came to Canada in XXXX 2015, never did they follow up with a coercive summons.\n[48] So, the panel finds it does not really advance her claim one way or another, particularly in light of the other findings, and the negative credibility findings which have been made in relation to her claim that her home church was raided.\n[49] The subpoena is stamped at the left hand margin. This is irregular. According to the sample subpoena, the copy retained by the issuing court would not be stamped. Further, the summons must be signed by both a judge and the court registrar, but that did not happen in this case.\n[50] So, the panel would also note that fraudulent documents are common in China, and the panel will provide a reference for that in the written reasons (See CHN104579.E, Item 3.22 of the NDP).\n[51] The panel finds, considering the above facts, and the preponderance of the evidence as a whole, that the subpoena is a fraud.\n[52] The panel finds that the raid did not take place, and that the claimant was not subpoenaed for participation in an illegal church. The panel also finds, by extension of inference, that the raid did not take place, since the subpoena is fraudulent and since the claimant neither went into hiding nor was she sought out for arrest by the PSB. As a result, the panel draws a negative credibility inference.\n[53] The panel also finds that the claimant was not a genuine Christian in the Shouter church as she alleged.\n(v) No documents of trip to Canada\n[54] The claimant was asked if she had any proof of her journey to Canada, whether a passport, itinerary, ticket, or boarding pass. She had none. She claims that they were all given to the smuggler and that she did not know she needed to keep them.\n[55] Moreover, in her Schedule 12 form, she did not mention either XXXX or XXXX as countries she passed through, and referred to them as \"unknown countries\" in that form. She was asked why she did not know the countries when she filled out the form, but knows the countries today. She said that in the beginning, she arrived at night, and she did not know she had to provide the details.\n[56] The panel rejects this explanation. She gave the other information on where she had travelled from, but left out this information. The panel draws a negative credibility inference.\n[57] These missing travel documents serve a crucial purpose in this claim. They are evidence of when she came to Canada, where she came from, and they also serve a secondary identity purpose. The issue of when she left China to come to Canada is important, because if she delayed her trip after suffering persecution, this can weigh against her claim, as it negates subjective fear. The issue of where she came from is important, because she needs to show that she left the country of persecution. If this fact is missing, there is no way to know where the claimant came from. She could have been living in a 3rd country where she was not persecuted, and where she could have made a prior refugee claim. This issue of whether the claimant could have made a refugee application in a 3rd prior country is central to the refugee determination exercise. Thirdly, although she has proved her identity, these documents are proof that the claimant did in fact escape. They tie her identity to her escape, and are further evidence that she had subjective fear, and that she is who he claims to be. Proof of flight or escape is again a central question to the refugee determination process.\n[58] In Elazi,13 Mr. Justice Nadon, sitting at the time with the Federal Court, emphasized the importance of travel documents and tickets used to travel to Canada:\nI take this opportunity to add that it is entirely reasonable for the Refugee Division to attach great importance to a claimant's passport and his air ticket. In my opinion, these documents are essential to establish the claimant's identity and his journey to come to Canada. Unless it can be assumed that a refugee status claimant is actually a refugee, it seems unreasonable to me to ignore the loss of these documents without a valid explanation. In my view, it is too easy for a claimant to simply state that he has lost these documents or the facilitator has taken them. If the Refugee Division insists on these documents being produced, the facilitators may have to change their methods.\nMinimizing the importance of the passport and air ticket as documents to be produced or ignoring their non-submission for all sorts of reasons in my opinion only serves to encourage all those whose only purpose is to take advantage of a system which is intended solely to enable genuine refugees to come to Canada.14\n[59] In Kaur,15 Mr. Justice Shore interpreted Elazi as follows:\n... [Elazi] signifies that the Board is warranted in drawing a negative inference if the claimant does not present any of the travel documents which would assist in confirming the travel itinerary of the claimant.\n[60] The Federal Court has applied Elazi in numerous similar cases,16 and has upheld negative inferences drawn by members of this division from claimants' failure to provide evidence of their travel to Canada.\n[61] The Federal Court has ruled in Joseph that a non-credible account of traveling to Canada can negatively affect a person's allegations as to their presence in, and departure from, their alleged country of nationality.17\n[62] The claimant alleges that the smuggler kept the passport and she retained no evidence of this journey, such as boarding passes, an itinerary or a ticket. The panel rejects this explanation for the reasons given above. As a result, the panel draws a negative credibility inference.\n(vi) Inconsistent evidence on use of fraudulent documents\n[63] The claimant was asked whether she used fraudulent documents to go to the US in 2006. She did not reply directly. She said that the smuggler helped her. The question was repeated. She then said the passport she used to go to Mexico was fraudulent. But then, when asked for confirmation that the passport used to go to Mexico was fraudulent, she then said \"that one was genuine.\" She then said the one used to go from Mexico to the US was fraudulent.\n[64] She was asked about the contradiction between saying that the passport to Mexico was fraudulent, and then saying it was genuine. She said, in explanation, the passport was genuine, but the visa was not.\n[65] She was then asked which country the passport from Mexico to US purported to be from. She then said she did not use a passport to go to the US. She claims she hid in a bus, and then they asked her to go through. The claimant was then asked whether by hiding in a bus, she did not need to use the fraudulent passport with the visa, and she said \"correct,\" she did not.\n[66] She was then asked about the contradiction between saying that the passport used to go to the US from Mexico was fraudulent. But then saying that it was not used at all because she just hid in a truck and passed over the border.\n[67] She then testified, \"from China to Mexico, she used a true passport. From Mexico to the US, she had a fake passport, but at that time, she did not show it, it was the smuggler who gathered all the passports together to show (the authorities).\"\n[68] This reply was but a further contradiction, because she had just testified that she did not use a passport to enter the US.\n[69] The question was then put squarely to her again, whether she used a fraudulent document to enter the US. She did not reply directly. She said: \"in Mexico, I did not take passport but I knew it was fraudulent.\"\n[70] In her Schedule A form, the claimant stated \"she went to the US on fraudulent documents... she was detained by US immigration and then returned to China in 2007.\"\n[71] This also contradicts her testimony that she used a genuine passport to go to Mexico.\n[72] The panel draws a negative inference.\n[73] The panel asked her what was the basis for her refugee claim in the US. She said that she suffered persecution in China and escaped. She said at that time she was a teenager, below 20, and her family arranged a marriage for her to marry a guy. She said they were going to arrest and catch her. She said it was the guy who was trying to arrest\/catch her.\n[74] Her story was not believed by the US immigration authorities and it is not believed by this panel. She produced no documents to verify this story of a previous refugee claim, nor did she make an effort to do so other than thinking about it.\n[75] The panel concludes that the claimant was not a reliable witness, and the rest of her story is rejected.\n(vii) Sur place claim\n[76] The claimant's story about being a Shouter Christian in China was already rejected.\n[77] The panel would also note that Christianity, per se, is not banned in China. Nor is belonging to a registered home church. Nor is shouting to God. Nor is owning a book by Witness Lee.18 Truly \"Shouter\" house groups are banned, but the distinction can be a hard one to draw. For example, Exhibit 4 pgs. 33 - 35 sets out an erudite defence of a man accused of being a Shouter in China by his counsel. That article demonstrates that whether or not a Christian organisation is considered a \"Shouter cult\" involves many different considerations. Similarly, whether an underground Christian church is \"Shouter\" involves many considerations, such as whether they place Witness Lee above Christ; whether they form gospel teams of 2 -3 sending people out to preach; whether they deny the Bible; whether they deny the Bible as the highest authority; whether they deny the trinity; whether they deny the doctrine of salvation; whether they accept the truth of the cross; whether they deny heaven; and whether they deny church history.\n[78] The Shouters19 were a splinter group from the \"Local Church\" which in turn was founded by Watchmen Nee or Ni Tuo Sheng (1903 - 1972). Nee established his church in 1922. He was imprisoned in 1952 by the Communist Party. Nee's disciple, Li Changshou, who differed from Ni on tactics and doctrine, organised the splinter \"Shouter\" movement. It dates back to the 1930's and congregants added external vocalisations such as \"Oh Lord\" in prayer. It was developed in Taiwan after being banned in China. The Restored Version of the Bible, brought by the claimant to the hearing, was edited by Witness Lee. Witness Lee wrote other books, and provided a new translation of the New Testament. The main conflict between the Shouters and the State Patriotic Christian Church in China is that the Shouters believe in the second coming of Christ whereas this doctrine is antithetical to the Chinese Communist Party's belief in its permanence.\n[79] Given the totality of the evidence, even if the panel had accepted the claimant's evidence about her Shouter activities in China, which it has not, it would still find she was not a genuine Shouter in China based on the above criteria which were not satisfied in this claim.\n[80] Other than having the Restored Bible, and her claim that she shouts prayers to God, the panel finds there is insufficient evidence to link her to the true Shouters in China, based on the criterion set out above. She named Watchmen Nee as the founder of her church, not Witness Lee as for the true Shouters. There was no evidence that she spread the gospel in China, nor did she possess a huge quantity of illegal books by Lee.\n[81] Having found she was not a genuine shouter in China, as alleged, this of course affects her claim to be a genuine Shouter in Canada.\n[82] But in any event, the panel has considered her alleged activities here in Canada, such as gathering together with others for church, baptism, shouting the name God, communion, sharing testimonies and reading the Bible. These activities are not restricted per se in China.\n[83] Given the general finding that she was not a credible witness, the panel rejects her sur place claim, and finds that she has produced a letter from a church in Canada together with photos of her baptism here to support a fraudulent claim. The panel concludes that she is not a genuine Shouter Christian here in Canada. The church letter20 provided by the claimant makes it clear beyond doubt, that the Toronto church she attends is not associated with the Shouters in China.\n[84] There is no evidence that her activities here would put her at risk in China, nor was there any evidence that her activities here would come to the attention of the authorities back in China.\n(viii) Jurisprudential Guide\n[85] The panel also finds that her story about leaving China at a time she was wanted multiple times by the PSB, would also fail on the basis of the Jurisprudential Guide RAD Decision TB6-11632, cited above at para.17. The claimant testified that she cleared customs when passing into Hong Kong, and also cleared the security check. She was also able to leave Hong Kong on a genuine passport, without detection.\n[86] According to the Guide, this was not possible, nor has the claimant produced any evidence to refute the strong basis to reject such stories as set out in the Jurisprudential Guide. Further, and in any event, there is no basis to distinguish the facts of this case, as alleged by counsel for the reasons provided above herein at paras. 18 and 19.\nCONCLUSION\n[87] All grounds of the claim, under s. 96, 97(1) and the sur place claim are rejected due to a lack of credibility.\n[88] The claimant was caught in many different lies through the hearing.\n[89] The claim is manifestly unfounded pursuant to ss. 107.1 of the IRPA.\n(signed)\n\"J.

My reasons follow.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The Claimant's complete allegations can be found in her Basis of Claim (\"BOC\") form, as well as in her narrative.3 Here is a summary.\n[5] The Claimant alleges that in 1999, several unknown men attacked her in a violent manner while she was returning from work in XXXX XXXX, El Salvador. She testified that they did not try to rob her. Although she denied having been sexually assaulted, she testified that the men wanted her to go with them. When she refused, they started beating her. She testified that they were pulling her hair and kicking her, trying to bring her along with them.\n[6] Some bystanders were able to assist her and took her to an emergency clinic where she was treated for a number of injuries for a week. The Claimant alleges that the attack has had a traumatic and lasting impact on her.\n[7] At the hearing, the Claimant also testified that her father was killed in 1980 by criminal gang members because he was extorted and could not pay the entire amount. She testified that her father as well as his family received many threats. She testified that her father could have left the country, but that since the criminal gangs were also threatening his family, including the Claimant, he chose to stay and protect them.\n[8] The Claimant testified that she found out that her father was being extorted when a bomb was thrown to their house. She testified that she was inside with the rest of her family. She testified that when they saw the flash, they ran away and luckily, only her brother was slightly injured. She testified that her house was almost completely destroyed, and that they had to move out. She testified that two days later, her father was shot, but did not die. Therefore, his killers went to the hospital and finished him.\n[9] The Claimant left El Salvador on XXXX XXXX, 2001 and entered the US on XXXX XXXX, 2001.\n[10] The Claimant lived in the US initially on a work permit. However, this permit was cancelled 10 years ago, and therefore she no longer had legal status in the US. At the time, the Claimant believed that the American government would introduce and implement immigration reform, and that she would be able to remain legally in the U.S. in the future. However, given the anti-immigrant rhetoric and positions of the current administration in the US, she no longer believes this will happen.\n[11] She feared that the US government would deport her to El Salvador so she entered Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2017 and made a refugee claim on that date.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[12] The Claimant's identity as a citizen of El Salvador has been established by her testimony and the documentation on file, including her passport (biodata page), and birth certificate.4\nCredibility\n[13] The Federal Court of Appeal in Maldonado stated that when a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true unless there is a reason to doubt their truthfulness.5\n[14] In this case, I have found the claimant to be a credible witness and therefore believe what she has alleged in support of her claim. She testified in a straightforward manner and, there were no material inconsistencies or contradictions between her testimony and the other evidence before me that were not satisfactorily explained.\n[15] Further, the Claimant never tried to embellish or exaggerate her evidence, despite having the opportunity. For example, she testified that her assault was not sexual and that during her stay in the country afterwards, she was not persecuted and nor did she face a personal risk of harm.\nWell-founded fear of persecution\n[16] I find that there is insufficient evidence that the perpetrators would remember the Claimant, pursue her, and harm her once more if she were to return to El Salvador. Therefore, I find that the assault she experienced in 1999 was an act of random criminality, one that can be experienced by the population generally.\n[17] However, the Federal Court of Appeal in Salibian held that the definition of Convention refugee is forward looking, that is the inquiry concerns what might happen to a claimant if he or she were to return to their country of origin.6 It is therefore my duty to assess whether the Claimant, on her return to El Salvador, faces a serious possibility7 of persecution on a Convention ground or a personal risk of harm. On the forward looking risk assessment of the evidence before me, I find that the Claimant, as a woman of significant and particular vulnerabilities, would face a serious possibility of persecution should she return to El Salvador.\n[18] I find that the Claimant's profile makes her particularly vulnerable. She is a single woman, with no education, returning to her country after many years, with little family support. In addition, she suffers from serious and lasting trauma, which makes her resilience and resourcefulness limited.\n[19] The Claimant, who is now 55 years old, testified that she did not graduate from high school and that she is not married. She testified that before she left El Salvador, she was living\nwith her mother and two other sisters. The Claimant testified that her mother and one of her sisters now live in Canada.\n[20] She testified that while in the United States, she was living with one of her brothers. It appears that the Claimant has never lived on her own.\n[21] She testified that following the murder of her father, most of her family members fled the country. One of her sisters came to Canada and her claim for refugee protection was accepted.\nOnly one of her sisters still remain in El Salvador. As they have not seen each other for over 15 years, we cannot expect that the Claimant would be able to live with that sister and her family.\n[22] In addition, having been out of the country for so long, her return after a long absence would draw immediate attention to her.\n[23] Finally, based on the evidence before me, including the expert report,8 I find that the physical attack the Claimant experienced in 1999 as well as the death of her father have had lasting and traumatic impacts on her, has impacted her ability to cope and be resilient. All these, have turned her into a particularly vulnerable woman.\n[24] She testified that she did not want her mother and sister to come to her hearing, because she did not want them to go through the pain again. She did not want them to hear again the story of the bomb and her father's death, and of her attack. She testified that they all carry the pain, and they would all be crying together if they had come.\n[25] The Claimant testified that she had been attending group sessions to help with her mental challenges. When asked if she was talking about what happened to her in El Salvador during these group sessions, she testified that she did not. She testified that she did not like to talk about it a lot.\n[26] When asked to imagine herself going back to El Salvador, the Claimant first said she could not. She testified that just the idea of going back to El Salvador made her anxious and that she felt highly panicked. She testified that she could never live a normal life in El Salvador.\n[27] A psychologist report was provided to the Board.9 The psychologist is of the view that the Claimant shows symptoms consistent with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. She stated that the Claimant shows signs of XXXX XXXX XXXX,\nand feels overwhelmed by painful memories which she systematically tries to avoid. The psychologist further opined that the Claimant presents XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX due to traumatic experience.\n[28] The country documentation provides the objective basis for the claim and indicates that El Salvador is one of the most dangerous countries in the world for women.\n[29] Item 2.1 of the National Documentation Package (NDP) indicates that :\nThe principal human rights problems stemmed from widespread extortion and other crime in poor communities throughout the country. They included widespread corruption; weak rule of law, which contributed to high levels of impunity and government abuse, including unlawful killings by security forces, discrimination, and delay and lack of compliance with court rulings; and violence against women and girls (including by gangs), gender discrimination, and commercial sexual exploitation of women and children.10\n[30] Item 2.1 of the NDP, at page 21-22 confirms that sexual crimes and violence against women is widespread:\nRape and other sexual crimes against women were widespread. On February 26, the PDDH criticized the Ministry of Justice and Public Security's UTE general director Mauricio Rodriquez, for failing to provide adequate security to seven female witnesses and victims of sex trafficking, one of whom was sexually assaulted by a security guard in a shelter supervised by the UTE. Although the victim filed a complaint, the security guard was not sanctioned or removed.\nViolence against women, including domestic violence, was a widespread and serious problem. A large portion of the population considered domestic violence socially acceptable; as with rape, its incidence was underreported. The law prohibits domestic violence and generally provides for sentences ranging from one to three years in prison, although some forms of domestic violence carry higher penalties. The law also permits restraining orders against offenders. Laws against domestic violence were not well enforced, and cases were not effectively prosecuted. The law prohibits mediation in domestic violence disputes.\nBetween January and July 2016, ISDEMU reported 21 cases of femicide, 458 cases of physical abuse, 385 cases of sexual violence, and 2,259 cases of psychological abuse. ISDEMU reported 3,070 cases of domestic violence against women during the same period. In June ISDEMU issued its 2015 annual report on violence against women and reported that 230 died due to violence in the first six months of 2015, compared with 294 during the same period in 2014 and 217 in 2013.11\n[31] Item 5.1 of the NDP states:\nFreedom House states that violence against women in El Salvador is a 'serious problem' (Freedom House 2013). Similarly, Reuters reports that violence against women is 'widespread' (Reuters 13 Nov. 2014). According to Al Jazeera, El Salvador is 'one of the most dangerous countries in the world' for women because of the '[e]ndemic levels of sexual abuse and gender based violence' (Al Jazeera 7 June 2013).\n[32] At page 2, of item 5.1 of the NDP, it is said:\nInSight Crime, a foundation that provides research and analysis on organized crime in Latin America and the Caribbean (InSight Crime n.d.), reports that members of gangs such as Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and Barrio 18 (M-18) 'use rape to terrorize local communities' (ibid. 7 Nov. 2014). The same source cites an Associated Press (AP) investigation as stating that members of the two gangs 'typically subject their girlfriends to gang rape and even killings' (ibid.). In a 2013 article, the BBC indicated that, according to the Minister of Justice and Public Security of El Salvador, the rise in femicide rates [translation] 'in the past few years' coincided with the increasing entry of women into gangs (BBC 8 Mar. 2013). AP states that women and girls who are '[r]aped, battered and sometimes cut to pieces ... attest to the sadistic abuse committed by members of street gangs' (AP 6 Nov. 2014). In a 2014 interview with AP, a criminologist who digs up clandestine graves for the Office of the Attorney General (Fiscal\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica, FGR) stated that 'more than half of the 90 sites he has excavated in the last 12 years have contained the remains of murdered women and girls' (ibid.).\nA report by the Advocates for Human Rights, a US-based NGO dedicated to the promotion and protection of 'international human rights standards and the rule of law' through monitoring, legal representation and publications, among other means, similarly indicates that : '[n]umerous women told [t]he Advocates of gang members using sexual assault and physical violence against women and girls as a means to extort money and silence political opposition.12\n[33]\n\"How Violence Affects Women in El Salvador\" an article from the Latin American Working Group dated February 22, 2016 states that:\n[t]he violence gripping El Salvador affects women in a different way than men. Within the current security crisis, gang and security force violence has exacerbated a broader, long-standing acceptance of violence against women. More than half of all Salvadoran women say they have suffered some form of violence in their lives. Over a quarter of these women were victims of sexual or physical violence.\nWhile men are far more likely to be murdered, women are significantly more likely to experience intrafamilial, sexual, or economic violence. To make matters worse, women receive little to no guarantees of protection from the state. Due to ineffective governmental institutions, corruption, and social acceptance, impunity reigns in nearly all cases of violence against women.\nThe prevalence of sexual violence against women in El Salvador is also staggering. Between January and August 2015, the National Civilian Police (PNC) registered an average of nearly five cases per day of sexual violence against women, including rape and sexual assault. And victims are often the most vulnerable-more than half of these assaults were carried out against girls, adolescents, and the disabled, as seen in the graph below.\nOn top of the everyday violence already faced by women, ongoing gang conflict has led to an increase in some of the most heinous acts of violence against women. In the past, sexual violence was primarily committed in the home by a family member. Now however, rape and sexual assault are increasingly committed by gangs and security forces.\nThe targeted killing of women based on their gender, known as femicide, is also on the rise. An estimated 2,521 women have been murdered in El Salvador since 2009; this represents an average of 420 femicides each year. And according to the Observatory of Violence Against Women, the numbers are escalating. In the first ten months of 2015, 475 women were murdered - an average of one femicide every 16 hours, as seen in the graph below.13\n[34] In the circumstances, given the Claimant's vulnerable profile, and given the country conditions, I find that she has established that she has a well-founded fear of persecution should she return to El Salvador.\nState protection\n[35] I find that the Claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection.\n[36] There is clear and convincing evidence before me that the State would be unable or unwilling to protect her.14\n[37] The documentary evidence indicates that the security forces is corrupted and unable to offer protection to citizens against the criminal groups.\n[38] Item 2.1 of the NDP indicates that:\nInadequate training, lack of enforcement of the administrative police career law, arbitrary promotions, insufficient government funding, failure to enforce evidentiary rules effectively, and instances of corruption and criminality limited the PNC's effectiveness. The PDDH has the authority to investigate (but not prosecute) human rights abuses and refers all cases it deems to involve human rights abuse to the Attorney General's Office. 15\n[39] Item 2.1 of the NDP, at page 21 indicates:\nIncidents of rape continued to be underreported for several reasons, including societal and cultural pressures on victims, fear of reprisal, ineffective and unsupportive responses by authorities to victims, fear of publicity, and a perception among victims that cases were unlikely to be prosecuted. Laws against rape were not effectively enforced.16\n[40] Item 5.1 of the NDP, at page 5, indicates:\nSources indicate that crimes against women are underreported (AI Sept. 2014, 15; Reuters 13 Nov. 2014) because 'fear prevents more women from coming forward' (ibid.). A study published by the University Institute of Public Opinion (Instituto Universitario de Opini\u00f3n Publica, IUDOP) of the Central American University \"Jos\u00e9 Sime\u00f3n Ca\u00f1as\" on the situation of security and justice in El Salvador between 2009 and 2014 similarly states that [translation] 'many crimes' against women, including sexual abuse, are not reported by victims because of shame, fear of reprisal, the connection of the victims to their aggressors or due to the nature of El Salvador's patriarchal society (IUDOP Sept. 2014, 26). According to AI, the 'societal stigma' associated with violence against women and the 'widespread belief that the criminal law system will not deliver justice to survivors,' prevent women from reporting violence to the authorities (AI Sept. 2014, 15). Country Reports 2014 states that, in 2014, women did not report incidents of rape for reasons including 'ineffective and unsupportive responses by authorities toward victims, fear of publicity, and a perception among victims that cases were unlikely to be prosecuted' (US 25 June 2015, 15).17\n[41] Exhibit 5 at page 3 also indicates that:\n[f]or many reasons, women often don't report violence. Vanda Pignato, El Salvador's Secretary of Social Inclusion, told La Prensa Gr\u00e1fica that women stay silent because of 'fear, shame, terror, and above all, because they do not trust the judicial system. The judicial system in El Salvador leaves much to be desired on this issue. There is widespread impunity for aggressors and that isn't a good message for young people and the female victims of violence.'\nEven officials within government institutions sometimes commit violence against those they are charged to protect. Patterns of impunity validate this 'masculinity' within the institutions, which leads to further violence, says a program coordinator for ORMUSA. In 12 percent of the cases of violence against women reported to ORMUSA, the alleged perpetrators were judges, prosecutors, lawyers, and police officers. In one case, a woman brought charges against her husband, a PNC officer, for firing his weapon and injuring her. The victim later withdrew her\ntestimony, clearing the officer, even though neighbors and other police officers on the scene heard the attack and witnessed her husband dragging her across the floor.18\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[42] On the issue of internal flight alternative, on the evidence before me I find that the Claimant would face a serious possibility of being persecuted throughout El Salvador.\n[43] Therefore, I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative available to the Claimant anywhere in El Salvador.\nCONCLUSION\n[44] For the foregoing reasons, I find that the Claimant is a Convention refugee, and I therefore accept her claim.\n(signed)\n\"M\u00e9lanie Chartier\"\nM\u00e9lanie Chartier\nNovember 27, 2017\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson's Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution, November 1996.\n3 Exhibits 2.1-2.3.\n4 Exhibit 1.\n5 Maldonado v.

She alleges that she participated in political protests and demonstrations, and was often harassed by the authorities because of her political activities.\n[10] The Principal Claimant alleges that around February or March 2005, when she was about 18 years old, she was sexually assaulted by a Zanu PF official. She alleges that she reported the case to the police, but that they told her they could not do anything for her. She alleges that one of the MDC officials advised her to leave the country. According to him, since she had reported the case to the police, her life was now in danger. She alleges that he helped her leave the country that same day, and she made her way illegally to South Africa.\n[11]\nShe alleges that once in South Africa, a man associated with the MDC helped her get false identification. She alleges he took her to the Department of Home Affairs, where she was issued an identity card under a false name, XXXX XXXX XXXX. She lived in South Africa until she left for Canada in 2017 under that false identity.\nAssociated Claimant - Zimbabwe\n[12] The Associated Claimant alleges that he and his family were also active members of the MDC since 2000. He alleges that one of his aunts, XXXX XXXX, was a well-known MDC activist and an MDC Member of Parliament.\n[13] The Associated Claimant alleges that he decided to move to South Africa in November of 2004 after he found out that the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) was investigating him because of his involvement with the MDC. He applied and obtained his permanent residency in South Africa in 2012.\n[14] The Associated Claimant returned to Zimbabwe on a regular basis for work. He also lived there for a few months in 2012 while he was separated from the Principal Claimant.\nAlleged Fear - South Africa\n[15] The Principal Claimant and the Associated Claimant met in in 2005, shortly after the Principal Claimant arrived in South Africa. They got married in February 2006 in Zimbabwe, but they were not present at the traditional ceremony.\n[16] They allege that for many years, they were helping people who had fled Zimbabwe, often MDC supporters, to settle in South Africa.\n[17] The claimants allege that they were assaulted on December 17, 2016. They allege that three armed men forced them into their house, told them to lie on the floor and to sing Zanu-PF slogans. They allege that the men left after a neighbor came to the door.\n[18] The Principal Claimant alleges that due to the stress of the assault, she delivered her son early, on XXXX XXXX, 2016.\n[19] The claimants decided to leave South Africa and to come to Canada to seek protection. The claimants left South Africa on XXXX XXXX, 2017 and traveled to the USA. They arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2017 and claimed refugee protection.\n[20] They allege that they could not leave earlier because they had to save money and sell furniture to pay for the US visas and their flight tickets.\nANALYSIS\n[21] Since the facts and issues to be determined for the Principal Claimant, the Associated Claimant, and the minor claimants are different, I have assessed their claims separately.\nPRINCIPAL CLAIMANT\nCredibility\n[22] I find that the Principal Claimant was credible and I therefore believe what she has alleged in support of her claim. She testified in a direct and straightforward manner, and there were no material inconsistencies or contradictions between her testimony and the rest of the evidence before me that were not satisfactorily explained.\nIdentity as a national of Zimbabwe\n[23] After considering the totality of the evidence before me, and taking into account the submissions by counsel for the Minister and counsel for the claimants, I find that the Principal Claimant has established on a balance of probabilities her identity as a national of Zimbabwe by her testimony, and the documentation filed, including her birth certificate and school documents.5\n[24] Counsel for the Minister submitted that the South African passport on file was prima facie evidence that the Principal Claimant was a national of South Africa and therefore she had not established her identity as a national of Zimbabwe. He submitted that there was no objective independent evidence to support that the Principal Claimant was a national of Zimbabwe, in particular that she had not provided any identification documents with a photo. Further, he submitted that the spelling of her name was inconsistent - XXXX vs XXXX - and that some of the documents provided by the Principal Claimant, in particular the death certificates of family members, raised credibility concerns and could not be used to establish her identity.\n[25] With respect to the South African passport, the Principal Claimant testified that she had falsely obtained it, with the help of a man, when she first arrived in South Africa. Documentary evidence indicates that ID documents may sometime be obtained through fraud, which corroborates the Principal Claimant's testimony.6 I therefore find that the Principal Claimant has established on a balance of probabilities that the passport she used to travel to Canada was fraudulent.\n[26] With respect to the lack of photo ID from Zimbabwe, the Claimant testified that when she left Zimbabwe, she was only 18 years old, and that at that time, she had never had any passport or driver's licence, thus the lack of photo ID. I find her explanation reasonable.\n[27] With respect to the different spelling of her name, the Claimant spontaneously explained that she and other family members have used both spellings, but that in real life, she pronounces her name with an \"h\", even though her real name is written without an \"h\". I find her explanation reasonable and I do not draw a negative inference from the two different spellings.\n[28] The Claimant provided her birth certificate and I have no reason to doubt its authenticity. I note that counsel for the Minister did not raise any credibility concern with respect to the birth certificate, other than those concerns regarding the use of the \"h\" which I have already addressed.\n[29] Finally, the Principal Claimant provided many credible details about her family, and her life in Zimbabwe. She was also able to provide details about her schooling in Zimbabwe, her activities with the MDC, the country's geography and political situation.\n[30] I note that counsel for the Minister raised some credibility concerns, which I share, with respect to the death certificates of her parents and sister. However, taking into consideration the totality of the evidence before me, I find that these credibility concerns are not sufficient for me to make a negative finding with respect to the Principal Claimant's identity. I am therefore satisfied that the Principal Claimant is a national of Zimbabwe.\nThe Claimant has no legal status in South Africa\n[31] After considering the totality of the evidence before me and given that I have found that the South African passport used by the Principal Claimant to travel to Canada was fraudulent, I find that the Principal Claimant is not a citizen of South Africa, and that she has never had any legal status in South Africa. I find that she has established on a balance of probabilities that she lived in South Africa for over 10 years under a false identity.\n[32] Since I have found that the Associated Claimant has permanent resident status in South Africa, as further explained below, I have also assessed whether the Principal Claimant could obtain permanent resident status in South Africa through her marriage with the Associated Claimant. According to the documentary evidence, it is sometimes possible to obtain permanent resident status through marriage to another permanent resident.7 However, given that there is no evidence before me that the Principal Claimant has applied for permanent resident status in South Africa under her real identity, it would be speculative for me to find that such application\nwould be accepted since the granting of permanent resident status is at the discretion of the authorities. In addition, given that the Claimant lived under a false identity in South Africa for many years, using documents obtained by fraud, I find it unlikely that the South African authorities would agree to grant her permanent resident status. I have therefore assessed her claim against Zimbabwe only.\nThe Principal Claimant Has a Well-Founded Fear of Persecution in Zimbabwe\n[33] I find that the Principal Claimant has established that she has a well-founded fear of persecution based on her political opinion and membership with the MDC.\n[34] I find that the Principal Claimant has established that since 2002, she was and still is a member of the MDC, and that she was sexually assaulted by a Zanu-PF official in February or March of 2005.\n[35] The Principal Claimant testified that all of her family members were MDC supporters. She testified that when her mother and one of her sisters became sick, they were refused treatment at the hospital because of their political affiliation, and that they both eventually passed away.\n[36] The Principal Claimant testified that she herself became involved with the MDC because of her older sister who was a very active member of the MDC and encouraged her to join as well. Her sister eventually had to flee Zimbabwe because of fear of persecution by the Zimbabwean authorities and was accepted as a Convention refugee in Canada. The Principal Claimant was also very upset because of what the Zanu-PF party had done to her mother and sister, and wanted revenge. She testified that at the time, she was about 16 years old and did not really understand what she was doing. She testified that she participated in rallies and volunteered regularly within the MDC.\n[37] The Principal Claimant testified that in 2005, she was sexually assaulted by an older Zanu-PF man. She testified that he was very aggressive and asked her why she never attended Zanu-PF rallies. He told her he knew that she was supporting the MDC, that he would teach her how to be a good girl, and then sexually assaulted her.\n[38] The Principal Claimant told her sister, reported the assault to the police, and then fled that same night to South Africa.\n[39] When asked if she still considers herself a member of the MDC and whether she thinks she would still be at risk in Zimbabwe, the Principal Claimant testified that she will always be a MDC supporter. She also testified that she still fears that the Zanu-PF people who have harassed and sexually assaulted, and that she would be at risk as a MDC supporter.\n[40] I find that the Principal Claimant has established a subjective fear despite not claiming refugee protection in South Africa, and despite returning a couple of times in Zimbabwe in 2013 and 2015.\n[41] When asked why she did not claim refugee protection in South Africa, the Principal Claimant testified that when she left Zimbabwe, she was only 18 years old, and did not know anything about refugee protection. She testified that the person who helped her gave her a new identity, and that she was therefore able to stay and live in South Africa, so there was no need to claim refugee protection. I find her explanation to be reasonable.\n[42] When asked why she returned to Zimbabwe in 2013 and in 2015, the Principal Claimant testified that twice she went because her brother needed food for his family, and the other time, she accompanied her husband to a cultural ceremony. She testified that because many years had passed since she had left the country, and because she was traveling under a different name, with a South African passport and because she was now a mother, she thought she could not be recognized, and therefore felt safe to go back for short periods of time. I find her explanation to be reasonable.\n[43] The documentary evidence confirms that the Zimbabwean authorities and Zanu-PF supporters continue to target members of non-ZANU-PF parties and civil society activists for abduction, arrest, torture, abuse, and harassment. MDC members as well as their family members were particularly targeted.8\n[44] The Human Rights Watch World Report indicates that:\nDuring 2016, the government of President Robert Mugabe intensified repression against thousands of people who peacefully protested human rights violations and the deteriorating economic situation. It disregarded the rights provisions in the country's 2013 constitution, and implemented no meaningful human rights reforms.\nPolice abuse increased, and there was excessive use of force to crush dissent. Human rights defenders, civil society activists, journalists, and government opponents, were harassed, threatened or faced arbitrary arrest by police. Widespread impunity continues for abuses by police and state security agents.9\n[45] President Mugabe was recently replaced by his former vice-president, Emmerson Mnangagwa. Documentary evidence suggests that Mnangagwa could be an even more repressive leader than Mugabe.10 Given the recent change in presidency, and the fact that the new president is also from the Zanu-PF party, I find that this change of presidency does not affect, at least for the time being, my finding that the authorities in Zimbabwe target political opponents, including MDC supporters and their family.\n[46] Therefore, I find that the Principal Claimant has established a well-founded fear of persecution in Zimbabwe based on her political opinion.\nState Protection in Zimbabwe\n[47] There is a presumption that the states are able to protect their citizens.11 However, I find that the Principal Claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection.\n[48] As the state is the agent of persecution in this case, it is clear that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming. Further, the documentary evidence indicates that: \"The government generally failed to investigate or prosecute state security or ZANU-PF supporters responsible for violence.\"12 It also indicates that: \"Police units sometimes organized or participated in political violence. Security sector impunity stemming from politically motivated abuses remained a problem.\"13\n[49] Therefore, I find that the Claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection.\nInternal Flight Alternative in Zimbabwe\n[50] I find that there is no viable internal flight alternative for the Principal Claimant.\n[51] Since the state authorities are the agents of persecution and are in complete control of their territory, I am satisfied that the Principal Claimant faces a serious possibility14 of persecution for her political opinion everywhere in Zimbabwe. She therefore has no viable internal flight alternative anywhere in the country.\nASSOCIATED CLAIMANT\n[52] The determinative issue for the Associated Claimant is Exclusion 1E.\nIdentity\n[53] The identity of the Associated Claimant as a citizen of Zimbabwe is established by his testimony and the supporting documentation filed, namely his passport.15\nCredibility\n[54] When a claimant swears to the truthfulness of certain facts, this creates a presumption that what he or she says is true, unless there is a reason to doubt it.16\n[55] In this case, I find that the Associated Claimant was credible and I therefore believe what he has alleged in support of his claim.\nThe Claimant is Excluded Pursuant to Article 1E of the Convention\n[56] I find that Article 1E of the Convention and section 98 of the Act apply to the Claimant, and that he is therefore excluded.\nLegal Framework\n[57] Article 1E of UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees states:\nThis Convention shall not apply to a person who is recognized by the competent authorities of the country in which he has taken residence as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of nationality of that country.17\n[58] Section 98 of the Act states: \"A person referred to in section E or F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\"\nFactors to Be Considered\n[59] The Federal Court of Appeal in Zeng reformulated the test that must be applied by the Board to determine whether or not a claimant is excluded under Article 1E of the Convention. At paragraph 28, the Court stated:\nConsidering all relevant factors to the date of the hearing, does the claimant have status, substantially similar to that of its nationals, in the third country? If the answer is yes, the claimant is excluded. If the answer is no, the next question is whether the claimant previously had such status and lost it, or had access to such status and failed to acquire it. If the answer is no, the claimant is not excluded under Article 1E. If the answer is yes, the RPD must consider and balance various factors. These include, but are not limited to, the reason for the loss of status (voluntary or involuntary), whether the claimant could return to the third country, the risk the claimant would face in the home country, Canada's international obligations, and any other relevant facts.18\n[60] Therefore, in order to determine if the Claimant is excluded pursuant to Article 1E of the Convention, I need to determine the following issues:\nA. Whether the Claimant had the rights of nationals in South Africa;\nB. Whether the Claimant still has, at the date of the hearing, status in South Africa, and if not, whether he previously had status and lost it; and\nC. Whether the Claimant can live safely in South Africa.\nA. The Associated Claimant had most of the rights enjoyed by nationals of South Africa\n[61] As a permanent resident, I find that the Claimant had most of the same rights enjoyed by nationals of South Africa.\n[62] According to the jurisprudence, there are four main rights associated with nationality: the right to return to and reside in the country of residence; the right to work freely without restrictions; the right to study; and access to social services in the country of residence.\n[63] The Claimant testified that he obtained his permanent residency status in 2012. According to section 28 of South Africa's No. 13 of 2002: Immigration Act, 2002, a permanent resident in South Africa has the right to work, study and have access to social services.19 The Claimant did in fact testify that he had the right to work, to study and that he had access to most social services.\n[64] As a permanent resident, the Associated Claimant was also able to leave and return to South Africa. According to his passport,20 the Claimant traveled outside of South Africa numerous times, including to Zimbabwe, and returned to South Africa.\nB. The Associated Claimant continues to be a permanent resident of South Africa\n[65] I find that as of the day of the hearing, the Associated Claimant is still a permanent resident of South Africa.\n[66] Pursuant to Section 28 of the South African Immigration Act, \"the Department may withdraw a permanent residence permit if its holder has been absent from the Republic for more than three years.\" 21\n[67] In this case, the Associated Claimant left South Africa in XXXX 2017, so he has been outside of the country for less than one year. When asked if his permanent residency status was still valid, the Associated Claimant did confirm that it was and that he could still return to South Africa.\nC. The Associated Claimant can live safely in South Africa\n[68] I have also considered whether the Associated Claimant will be reasonably safe in South Africa. I find that the Associated Claimant had the right to access state protection, that he did not rebut the presumption of state protection, and that he can live reasonably safely in South Africa.\n[69] The Associated Claimant testified that he feared the Zimbabwean authorities because of his political activities with the MDC in South Africa. He testified that two men broke into their house on December 17, 2016, and asked them to sing Zanu-PF slogans. He testified that neighbors heard noises and came to their house. When they arrived, the two men left. Police was called and came to the house. Since nothing was stolen, the police did not open a docket. When asked if he had told the police that the men were armed, he testified that he did, but that nothing was done. When asked if he later returned to the police station to follow up on his report, or whether he had complained to the Civilian Oversight Committee, the Associated Claimant testified that he did not.\n[70] The Associated Claimant testified that once Zimbabwean authorities know where you stay, they can come to South Africa and kidnap you. He testified that it is not difficult for them to find someone in South Africa, even in big cities, because they have networks. However, I note that after the incident, the Principal Claimant and the minor claimants moved to a friend's house, but that the Associated Claimant continued to stay in the family house until he left South Africa in XXXX 2017. He testified that nothing else happened, and that he did not receive any other threats.\n[71] Based on the evidence before me, including the testimony of the claimants, I find that the Associated Claimant did not establish on a balance of probabilities that he could not live safely in South Africa, and did not rebut the presumption of state protection in South Africa.\n[72] Therefore, I find that the Associated Claimant is excluded pursuant to Article 1E of the Convention.\nClaim in Zimbabwe\n[73] Since I have found that the Associated Claimant is excluded, the claim against Zimbabwe needs not be considered. However, should my conclusion on exclusion 1E be found to be incorrect, I still find that the Associated Claimant did not establish that he is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\n[74] I find that the Associated Claimant is not a Convention refugee in that he has not established that he has a well-founded fear of persecution in Zimbabwe. The Associated Claimant testified that he does not think that the authorities in Zimbabwe are looking for him, or that he is at risk to go back to Zimbabwe. In fact, over the years, the Associated Claimant returned to Zimbabwe numerous times, and has not had any issues with the authorities. He even lived there on a permanent basis for a few months while in a relationship with another woman. He has also been able to renew his passport at least twice, in 2011 and in 2017, as well as his Zimbabwean identity card.\n[75] Based on his own acts and behavior, including the fact that he traveled to Zimbabwe numerous times, and even lived permanently in Zimbabwe for a little while in 2012, I also find that the Associated Claimant did not establish on a balance of probabilities that his removal to Zimbabwe would subject him personally to a risk to his life, to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or to a danger of torture.\nMINOR CLAIMANTS\nIdentity\n[76] The identity of the minor claimants as citizens of South Africa is established by testimony of the Principal Claimant and the Associated Claimant, and by the supporting documentation filed, including their passports.22\nThe Minor Claimants Are Not Convention Refugees or Persons In Need Of Protection\n[77] The adult claimants testified that they believe the minor claimants are at risk in South Africa because they were born to a mother with a false identity, and because the Principal Claimant had fled Zimbabwe, and because she was a MDC supporter. The adult claimants fear that the minor claimants could be kidnapped by the Zimbabwean authorities. I note that after the incident of December 2016, the female minor claimant continued to attend school, and that no threats were received.\n[78] I find that the minor claimants did not rebut the presumption of state protection as there is no clear and convincing evidence before me that the claimants have exhausted all courses of action open to them.\n[79] First, the analysis of the availability of state protection under the Associated Claimant equally applies to the minor claimants. The fact that the claimants called the police only once, and that they never followed up is not sufficient to rebut the presumption. In addition, the Principal Claimant also testified that she did not seek state protection for her children because she believes the police in South Africa cannot do anything to protect against Zanu-PF supporters. I note that no documentary evidence was filed to support this belief. I therefore find that this does not constitute clear and convincing evidence of inadequate state protection.\n[80] Since the minor claimants did not rebut the presumption of state protection, I find that they are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.\nCONCLUSION\n[81] For the foregoing reasons, I find that the Principal Claimant is a Convention refugee and I therefore accept her claim. I find that the Associated Claimant is excluded pursuant to Article 1E of the Convention, and in the alternative, that he is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection and I therefore reject his claim. Finally, I find that the minor claimants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection and I therefore reject their claims.\n(signed)\n\"M\u00e9lanie Chartier\"\nM\u00e9lanie Chartier\nDecember 21, 2017\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) Chairperson's Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution, November 1996.\n3 1E.

(the minor claimants of the brother), citizens of Hungary, seek refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act1 (the IRPA) .1\n[2] The claims were heard jointly pursuant to Rule 55 of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) Rules.2 In addition, the IRPA requires the designation of a representative for all claimants less than 18 years of age.3 For the purposes of the claim for refugee protection, in accordance with subsection 167(2) of the IRPA, the RPD appointed the claimant to be the Designated Representative for his three children and the RPD appointed the brother's wife to the Designated Representative for her three children. At the beginning of the hearing the claimant and the brother's wife each affirmed their willingness to be the Designated Representative for their respective children.\nALLEGATIONS\nThe claimant\n[3] The specifics of the claimant's claim are set out in his Personal Information Form (PIF);4 the following is a summary of his allegations.\n[4] The claimant was born on XXXX XXXX XXXX 1988 in XXXX, Hungary. The claimant is of Roma ethnicity. He entered into a common-law relationship with the wife in 2005. Their relationship produced three children, the minor claimants.\n[5] The claimant travelled by bus to his place of work. Many times he was picked on by skinheads at the bus stop.\n[6] On the night of XXXX XXXX XXXX 2011, the claimant was working. The wife called him to tell him that she was frightened because someone threw things at one of the windows in their home. The minor claimants were also frightened. The claimant and the wife reported the matter to the police. The police made a report and indicated that they would patrol more frequently in the claimant's neighbourhood.\n[7] On the night of XXXX XXXX, 2012, the claimant travelled to work by bus. Three men on the bus were making disparaging remarks about Roma, saying that every Roma should be killed. The claimant was too frightened to get off the bus. When he exited the bus at his place of work, he was followed by the three men who had been on the bus. The claimant fell down when he was kicked by the men. The men advised the claimant that he and his family would have to move from their home or things would get worse. The claimant made his way to the home of the brother where he called the wife and advised her to bring herself and the minor claimants. On XXXX XXXX, 2012, the claimant attended the hospital. The doctor advised the claimant to contact the police. When the claimant reported the incident to the police, the officers accused the claimant of not wanting to go to work after he fell.\n[8] The claimant, the wife and the minor claimants arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2012 and made claims for refugee protection on May 4, 2012.\nThe brother\n[9] The specifics of the brother's claim are set out in his Personal Information Form (PIF);5 the following is a summary of his allegations.\n[10] The brother was born on XXXX XXXX, 1983 in XXXX, Hungary. The brother is of Roma ethnicity. He entered into a common-law relationship with his wife in 2000. Their relationship produced three children, the minor claimants of the brother.\n[11] In the summer of 2007, while making his way home from work, the brother was attacked by four men with shaved heads. They made derogatory remarks about his ethnicity and then told him he should get out of the country. A young couple passing by called the police. The brother and the four men were taken to the police station and interviewed. The police advised the brother that it was better not to make a report against the men because they were Guardists.\n[12] Later in 2007, the brother's wife accompanied her son, XXXX, to school. She was attacked by four men dressed in black. When she fell to the ground she lost a tooth and injured her face. The men ran away. The brother's wife sought medical attention. The child has required psychiatric treatment since that time. The brother and his wife reported the attack to the police but there have been no results.\n[13] On XXXX XXXX, 2011 the brother, his wife, and XXXX, the youngest child, received racists slurs from men with shaved heads and wearing black clothing. The men kicked the brother about his head and slapped his wife. When sirens approached, the men ran away. The brother and his wife sought medical attention at a hospital. The attending doctor made a report of the attack to the police. When the brother was released from hospital, he made a report to the police as he was instructed to do.\n[14] The brother arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2012 and made a claim for refugee protection, on March 15, 2012. The brother's wife and the minor claimants of the brother arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2012 and made claims for refugee protection on April 7, 2012.\nDETERMINATION\n[15] I find that the claimants are not Convention refugees pursuant to s. 96 of the IRPA, nor are they persons in need of protection, pursuant to s. 97(1) of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\nThe issues in this hearing were:\n* Identity\n* Credibility\n* State Protection\nIdentity\n[16] The claimants' personal identities and country of citizenship have been established, on a balance of probabilities, as per certified true copies of their passports.6\n[17] The claimants' ethnic identities have been established on a balance of probabilities. I base this finding on the testimonies of the claimant and the brother and documents issued by the XXXX Roma Minority Self-Government.7\nCredibility\nThe claimant\n[18] In assessing the credibility of the evidence presented by the claimant, I kept in mind the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Maldonado8 wherein the Court stated, in part, that \"when a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there be reason to doubt their truthfulness.\" However, I find that the claimant failed to advance his claim with evidence that is credible. I am aware that none of the credibility concerns raised here may be sufficient, each on its own, to negate his claim. However, the cumulative effect of all of them is that I do not have sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence upon which to base a determination that the claimant is a Convention refugee. As the court of appeal in Sheikh,9 MacGuigan, J.A. held:\n... even without disbelieving every word [a claimant] has uttered, a ... panel may reasonably find him so lacking in credibility that it concludes that there is no credible evidence relevant to his claim ... In other words, a general finding of a lack of credibility on the part of the applicant may conceivably extend to all relevant information emanating from his testimony.\nThe attack of XXXX XXXX, 2012\n[19] For the following reasons, I am not persuaded that the claimant was attacked while on his way to work on the evening of XXXX XXXX, 2012.\n[20] During the hearing, the claimant testified that on the evening of XXXX XXXX, 2012 he was travelling by bus from his home in XXXX to work in XXXX. He testified that it was a distance of 13 kilometres. When asked, he testified that he had worked in a warehouse for XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX for one to one and a half years up to the time he was attacked on XXXX XXXX, 2012. He also testified that he moved with his wife and three children from XXXX to XXXX in 2008 and then they returned to live in XXXX after the attack on XXXX 2012. I referred the claimant to information he provided at the Port of Entry (POE) and in his PIF regarding his places of residence and his places of employment. At the POE and in his PIF, the claimant stated that he lived in XXXX from XXXX 2008 until XXXX 2011 and then in Budapest from XXXX 2011 until XXXX 2012. He also stated that he worked at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX from XXXX 2005 until XXXX 2011 and he then worked in Budapest at various part-time jobs from XXXX 2011 until XXXX 2012. I asked the claimant to explain the discrepancies between information he provided at the POE and in his PIF as compared to his oral testimony. He testified that what had been written was a mistake. I do not find the claimant's explanation for the discrepancies satisfactory. The places and dates of residences and of work are quite specific. It is reasonable to believe that the claimant had spoken spontaneously and truthfully at the POE and when providing information to a translator when completing his PIF about straightforward matters such as his places of residence and employment. A person's first account of events is usually more reliable and must be considered more trustworthy.10 As a result of this testimony, the claimant's credibility is seriously undermined. I, therefore, find that on a balance of probabilities the claimant was not working or living in the area at the time of the alleged incident of XXXX XXXX, 2012.\n[21] In addition, the claimant was asked what attempts he had made to obtain evidence of his employment at XXXX XXXX XXXX. He testified that he had not got in touch with them. I take a negative inference from the lack of documentary evidence to support the claimant's allegations that he was working in XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX 2012. I am guided by the jurisprudence for the proposition that the RPD is entitled to draw a negative inference from a claimant's failure to provide corroborating evidence when there are inconsistencies in the claimant's testimony.11\n[22] The claimant testified that as a result of the injuries he sustained from the attack by skinheads on XXXX XXXX, 2012, he attended a hospital for medical attention. Upon being asked, the claimant testified that he told the doctor he had been kicked on his side during an attack. He testified that the doctor told him that he, the doctor, called the police because he was responsible to do so in such cases. The claimant testified that the police interviewed him at the hospital. He testified that he told the police the same story that he had related to the doctor. He testified that the police accused him of using the excuse of an injury from a fall to not report for work. I asked the claimant if the police spoke to the doctor; he testified that he did not know. The claimant provided medical documentation issued by the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX County and Teaching Hospital in XXXX on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2012.12 The doctor reports that the claimant suffered \"contusion of the thorax\", and reports that the claimant told him that he, the claimant, fell the previous day and injured the right side of his thorax.13 During the hearing, I referred the claimant to this particular information in the medical report. I then asked him to explain the contradiction between the doctor's report regarding the cause of the claimant's injury and the claimant's oral testimony in this regard. The claimant testified that it was his opinion that it had something to do with the police who had interviewed him. I asked the claimant if he knew that the police influenced the doctor's report. He repeated his testimony that it was his opinion. I find that the claimant did not provide a satisfactory explanation for the discrepancy. I appreciate that the documentary evidence available at the time the claimant made his claim indicates that there was discrimination in Hungary against Roma in education, housing, employment, and access to social services.14 However, in this case, according to the medical report, the doctor provided care for the claimant by examining him and requesting that the claimant be x-rayed. If, as the claimant alleges, the doctor accepted his information regarding an attack such that the doctor contacted the police, I find it highly unlikely that the doctor, a highly trained professional, would be influenced by the police such as to cause him to provide false information on a medical report and then sign it. As a result of this testimony, I find the claimant's credibility diminished.\nIncident of XXXX XXXX, 2012\n[23] An important indicator of credibility is whether a witness can consistently tell his particular story.15 I found that the claimant could not keep his story straight regarding the response of the police on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2012 to vandalism at his home.\n[24] In his PIF, the claimant states that his wife called the police after a window was broken in their home and that he also called the police as he returned home from work in XXXX to support his wife. The claimant alleges in his PIF that the police put his testimony and that of his wife in the police reports. However, during the hearing the claimant testified that he spoke with the police but the police did not make a report. I asked the claimant to explain the discrepancy between this testimony and what he had written in this regard in his narrative. The claimant chose not to answer the question but instead repeated his testimony that the police made no report. He testified further that the police did not write a report in front of him and his wife. I find that the claimant provided no satisfactory explanation for the discrepancy. The narrative clearly indicates that a report, which included the claimant and the wife's testimony, was made by the police. I find that the claimant embellished his testimony by alleging that the police did not make a report. As a result of this testimony, I find the claimant's credibility further diminished.\n[25] During the hearing, I asked the claimant if he had attempted to obtain evidence of the police visit to his home on XXXX XXXX, 2012. The claimant responded in the negative. When I asked the claimant why he had not done so during the five years he had been in Canada, he testified that he knew the police had not made a proper report because they had not asked their full names or their birth dates. For the following reasons, I do not find the claimant's explanation satisfactory. When asked, the wife testified that she had made the call to the police. I asked the wife if she had provided her name and address to the police. She responded in the affirmative. I, therefore, believe that the police had sufficient information regarding the wife's identity to make a record of the incident which allegedly called them to the claimant's home. I find that the claimant's testimony was an attempt to explain why he had not offered a police report as evidence of this alleged event. In addition, the claimant testified that the police did not make any inquiries after he had made a report to them. Given that the claimant made no requests for a report or follow up with the police, his testimony is mere speculation at best. As a result of the claimant's testimony in this regard, I take a negative inference and find the claimant's credibility compromised.\n[26] I find that the claimant embellished his claim when he testified that the police did not follow up on the report he made to the police on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2012. During the hearing, the claimant testified that the police told him and his wife that they would patrol the claimant's area more often. He testified further that they did not do so. I asked the claimant how he knew this. He testified that when he looked out the window of his home, he never saw a patrol car. I suggested to the claimant that he could not always have been looking to see if the police were patrolling and, therefore, might have missed seeing them. The claimant testified that it was possible. I, thus, find that the claimant did not provide persuasive evidence that the police did not patrol more often as he alleges they asserted they would do.\n[27] For the following reasons, I am not persuaded that the claimant spoke to the police on XXXX XXXX, 2012 after a window was allegedly broken in his home. As indicated above, the claimant provided unsatisfactory explanations as to the discrepancy between his oral testimony and information contained in his PIF and the POE notes, with regards to where he was living and working in 2011 and 2012. At the POE and in his PIF, he indicated that he was living and working in Budapest during the time of the alleged incident. I, thus, logically infer that the claimant could not have come home from work in XXXX to support his wife in the alleged matter of a broken window. I, thus, take a further negative inference.\nHousing\n[28] The claimant testified that the former XXXX home of the claimants has been demolished and he would, therefore, have no home to which he and his family might return. He testified that their home had been destroyed because they are Roma. To support this allegation, the claimant provided documentary evidence in the form of a tenancy agreement and a termination of the agreement.16 For the following reasons, I find the claimant embellished his claim with this testimony and I give little evidentiary weight to the documents related to the tenancy agreement.\n[29] A Residential Tenancy Agreement (RTA), undated, indicates that the lease of apartment XXXX at XXXX XXXX Street, Main Floor, was extended to the claimant's mother and father who are named as the tenant and co-tenant, respectively.17 The agreement also indicates that the claimant, the brother and four other siblings, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, were moving into the apartment. The agreement states that the apartment was rented to the tenant and co-tenant for a limited time, until XXXX XXXX XXXX 2016.18 A certificate from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX County Government Offices, dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2016, indicates that the claimant, his mother and father, his brother, and three other of his siblings, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, were registered at the address in 1999.19 A letter from the Property Management of XXXX (XXXX), dated XXXX XXXX, 2016, indicates that the lease against the apartment in question was to be terminated as of XXXX XXXX XXXX 2016, and that claimant's mother had no outstanding balances against the rental costs.20 A letter from the XXXX, addressed to the claimant's mother and dated XXXX XXXX, 2016, advises the mother that the management did not wish to extend the tenancy contract and that she was required to vacate the apartment and remove all possessions by 9 a.m., XXXX XXXX, 2016.21 According to the claimant's testimony, his parents, the brother, and the claimant's sister, XXXX, arrived in Canada before he and his immediate family; his sister XXXX, resides in Hungary. The claimant's amended PIF indicates that his brothers, XXXX and XXXX, arrived in Canada a number of years ago.22 The claimant's amended PIF also indicates that his father died in 2016.23 It appears that the tenant and co-tenant had not resided in the XXXX apartment since they arrived in Canada more than five years ago. Except for the claimant's sister, XXXX, all of the remaining family members who resided in the apartment in XXXX have also not lived there for at least five years. There is nothing in the documents that indicates that the apartment was to be demolished. The documents indicate that the lease agreement was a fixed term contract. I appreciate that a 2015 report, contained in the independent documentary evidence, indicates that beginning in the summer of 2014 the local XXXX government issued eviction orders to numerous families in the \"Numbered Streets\" area, and used several methods to essentially end contracts with predominantly Roma tenants of social housing, followed by the demolition of housing.24 A Response to Information Request (RIR) indicates that approximately 100 families were affected by the evictions and that some residences have been demolished as part of the XXXX Football Stadium re-development program.25 The claimant did not allege nor did he provide evidence that the apartment in which the family resided in XXXX was located in the \"Numbered Streets\" area. The evidence on file establishes no nexus that might link the objective documentary evidence to the claimant's specific circumstances. As a result of the claimant's testimony, I find that his credibility is further diminished.\n[30] The claimant provided two letters, dated October 25, 2017, from his sister, XXXX, who resides in Hungary.26 XXXX makes no mention in her letters that the apartment which she shared with the claimants has been demolished. I draw a negative inference from the absence of such critical information and find this impugns the claimant's credibility. I refer to the Mohideen Osman decision27 where the Court, regarding the failure of the corroborating letters, held that:\nIn my view, where there is no reasonable explanation for material omissions, they can be the basis of an adverseinference and impugn an applicant's credibility.28\nEmployment\n[31] For the following reasons, I find that the claimant embellished his claim with testimony regarding his employment.\n[32] During the hearing, I asked the claimant to state the extent of his formal education in Hungary. He testified that he had 11 years of education and had graduated in 2005 from a vocational school. He testified that he had been granted a trade certificate as a butcher within a meat factory. When asked if he worked in that field, the claimant responded in the negative. He testified that when he tried to obtain a job as a butcher, as soon as he went for an interview and the employer saw he was Roma, he was not spoken to. I asked the claimant why he had omitted this information from his written narrative. The claimant testified that he did not know. I find the claimant's explanation unsatisfactory. The inability to obtain employment as a result of discrimination against the claimant based on his ethnic identity is a critical element of his claim. As a result of this testimony, I find the claimant's credibility impugned.\n[33] I wish to note that according to the claimant's PIF he obtained employment at XXXX XXXX XXXX immediately after he graduated from vocational school and was employed there for six years.29 As found above, the claimant could not provide a satisfactory explanation for the contradiction between his testimony regarding his minimal employment in Hungary and the information contained in his PIF. As also found above, a person's first account of events (in this case the claimant's employment history) is usually more reliable and must be considered more trustworthy.30 As a result of the claimant's testimony regarding his employment in Hungary, I find the claimant's credibility further impugned.\nThe brother\n[34] I found that the brother's testimony appeared to have been rehearsed in that he did not stray from his eight paragraph written narrative. His testimony lacked the spontaneity and details one reasonably anticipates when a person is recounting events in their life. As a result, I draw a negative inference.\nEmployment\n[35] I found that the brother embellished his claim when he provided testimony regarding his employment. Upon being asked, the brother testified that he worked as a forklift driver from 2005 until 2011. When I asked the brother why this employment came to an end, he testified that when new management took over in 2011, they laid off all of the Roma employees. I then asked the brother why he had omitted this information from his written narrative. He testified that he did not want to write this information. When I asked why this was the case, the brother testified that he did not know. I find the brother's explanations unsatisfactory. The alleged loss of employment due to the brother's ethnicity is a significant element of his claim. As a result of this testimony, I find the brother's credibility diminished.\nMedical Report regarding injuries sustained on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2011\n[36] The brother provided two medical reports31 regarding injuries sustained on XXXX XXXX, 2011 as a result of being kicked by three unknown individuals. I, therefore, find on a balance of probabilities, that the brother was physically injured as the result of an attack and that he sought medical help for the injuries. However, these documents provide no evidence that a report of the attack was made to the police either by the brother or by either of the two doctors who attended to the brother.\nAbsence of police reports and medical reports\n[37] For the following reasons, I give little evidentiary weight to two letters from the brother's sister, XXXX, regarding her failed attempts to obtain police or medical reports.32\n[38] The brother testified that a report was made to the police in 2007 when his wife and child were attacked. The brother also testified that he and a doctor both reported to the police after he was attacked on XXXX XXXX, 2011. The brother provided no police reports to support these allegations. Upon being asked, the brother testified that the police did not give him a report regarding the attack in 2011 because he was told the doctor had already provided information. I asked the brother what efforts he had made since he arrived in Canada to obtain police reports. The brother testified that his sister, XXXX, in Hungary has obtained a notary's letter to provide to the police in order to obtain reports. He testified further that XXXX told him that she had attended the police station many times but had had no luck. When asked, the brother testified that his mother here in Canada arranged for XXXX to have a notary's letter. The brother testified that he did not recall when this had been done. I asked the brother why a copy of the notary letter had not provided as evidence for his claim. The brother testified that he did not know where it was. I find this explanation unsatisfactory. I reasonably assume that the letter had been in the hands of his sister and could without any serious difficulties have been included with her hand written letters. In addition, given that the brother's mother resided in Toronto, I believe it would have been a straightforward matter to obtain evidence from the mother of her arrangement to have a notary's letter issued.\n[39] Given that the evidence from the brother's sister was provided only three days before the hearing, I referred the brother to instructions provided in the PIF which advises the claimant to attach copies of documents such as medical reports and police reports to support the claim. Counsel for the claimants objected and submitted that we were all aware what had happened to Legacy cases and that once a hearing date was set she worked backwards with the claimants to obtain documents. I am not persuaded by this submission. I appreciate that claimants of Legacy cases that is, cases in which claimants made their claims before January 1, 2013, and have had to wait over five years before their hearings were scheduled. As I have indicated, information contained in the PIF instructed the brother to attach to his PIF documents to support his claim. The fact that the brother waited over five years to have his hearing does not preclude him from obtaining evidence or, at least, attempting to obtain evidence prior to the setting of the hearing date. In fact, he has had an extraordinary amount of time to obtain evidence. During the hearing, I reminded the brother that his PIF had been completed over five years ago. I indicated to him that according to the RPD rules, documentary evidence is to be provided at least ten days in advance of the hearing. I then asked him why the two letters from his sister had been provided three days before the hearing. The brother testified that he did not have the evidence. I find the brother's explanation unsatisfactory. I take a negative inference as a result of the late documents when no satisfactory explanation was provided by the brother.\n[40] As indicated above, when the brother's wife was attacked in 2007 she sought medical attention at a hospital and their son required psychiatric care. Medical documents to support these allegation were not provided. During the hearing, the brother was asked if a medical report had been provided to him or his wife at the time his wife received medical attention. He testified that he did not recall. I asked the brother what attempts he had made since arriving in Canada to obtain medical documents regarding the medical care of his wife and of his son. The brother testified that he had tried. When asked to explain what efforts he had made, the brother referred to a letter33 provided by his sister in this regard. The brother testified further that his sister was not successful in obtain medical documents because she had been informed that there were files more than five years old and, therefore, no longer available. I indicated to the brother that the independent documentary evidence did not support this information. In particular, I referred the brother to an RIR34 which states that medical records are kept by hospital and clinics for at least 30 years. The brother testified that this may be the information on paper but when they try to obtain medical documentation, authorities do not want to deal with Roma. I appreciate the discrimination that Roma in Hungary may face with respect to health care. However, for the following reasons, I am not persuaded that the brother's sister made any effort to obtain documents.\n[41] The RIR referred to in the previous paragraph indicates that an individual may give written authorization to another person granting authority to that person to act on their behalf to obtain medical records.35 I have, above, given my findings regarding the absence of any letter of authority given to the sister and also for the lack of effort on the part of the brother in obtaining evidence resulting in the late submission of the letters from his sister. I draw a further negative inference as a result of the absence of medical documentation or at least an effort to obtain evidence in a timely manner.\nConclusion regarding credibility\n[42] I am aware, as stated at the outset, that none of the credibility concerns raised above may be sufficient on their own to negate this claim. However, the cumulative effect of these is that I do not have sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence upon which to base a determination that the claimant and the brother are Convention refugees.\nDiscrimination versus Persecution\nEducation\n[43] The claimants did not allege nor did they provide evidence that there were discriminated against in regards to access to education. The claimant, as indicated above, obtained a trade school certificate after having completed 11 years of formal education.36 The brother completed 13 years of formal education and received a certificate from a vocational school and a second certificate in trade training.37 The claimant testified he received a certificate in light machine operation and a second certificate in tire installation.\n[44] I, thus, conclude that neither the claimant nor the brother were discriminated against in accessing education.\nMedical care\n[45] The claimants did not allege nor did they provide evidence that there were discriminated against in regards to accessing medical care. Various medical documents provided as evidence indicate that care was provided when requested.38\n[46] I, thus, conclude that neither the claimant nor the brother were discriminated against in accessing medical care.\nEmployment\n[47] Above, I found that the claimant embellished his claim when he testified that he was discriminated against as a Roma when he first tried to find employment as a butcher. Also stated above, the claimant stated at the POE and in his PIF that he was employed from XXXX 2005 until XXXX 2011 as a general labourer at XXXX XXXX XXXX and found part-time work in Budapest until he left Hungary in XXXX 2012.39 I find, therefore, on a balance of probabilities that the information the claimant provided at the POE and in his PIF is correct with regards to his employment history.\n[48] Above, I found that the brother embellished his claim when he testified that he was discriminated against as a Roma when new management fired all Roma from his place of work in 2011. I note that the brother was employed in various positions including that of a bricklayer for two years and a forklift driver for two years in XXXX.40\n[49] I, thus, conclude that neither the claimant nor the brother were discriminated against in accessing employment.\nHousing\n[50] Above I found that the apartment in XXXX that the claimants resided in with the parents and siblings of claimant and his brother had a fixed term of rental agreement. The rental contract was terminated approximately five years after the claimants and all but one member of their family arrived in Canada. The claimant and his brother provided no persuasive evidence that they were evicted from this premises or that the premises was demolished. The claimant and the brother testified that they would be unable to obtain housing if and when they returned to Hungary. Other than their testimony, they provided no persuasive evidence in this regard. I note that the claimant testified that he found a new place of residence for him and his wife and three children in XXXX in 2008 where they remained until 2012. The claimant made no allegations nor did he provide evidence that he was discriminated against when he sought a residence in XXXX.\n[51] The claimant and the brother both testified that their in-laws, with whom they have lost contact, remain in Hungary. When asked why contact had been lost, neither the claimant nor the brother had an explanation. In any case, neither alleged nor provided evidence that they could not depend upon their in-laws for at least temporary accommodation if and when they first arrive back in Hungary.\n[52] I, thus, conclude that neither the claimant nor the brother were discriminated against in accessing accommodation nor would it be the case when they return.\nConclusion regarding discrimination versus persecution\n[53] Given that I have found that neither the claimant nor the brother were discriminated against in terms of accessing education, medical care, employment and housing, it reasonably follows that they were not persecuted in this regard.\nThe claim of XXXX XXXX\n[54] The claimants provided the decision made by the RPD regarding the claim for refugee protection made by XXXX XXXX, the younger brother of the claimant and the brother, as well as XXXX wife, and two children.41 In oral submissions, counsel submitted that I should consider that the claims of XXXX XXXX and his family were accepted by the RPD on July 17, 2015. I am not persuaded that the decision of XXXX XXXX and his family should influence the claims of the claimant and the brother. Each case is dependent upon the particular facts of the case. The RPD found in the case of XXXX XXXX that Mr. XXXX, a man with limited education, was a credible witness. In the case at hand, as noted above, the claimant and the brother obtained 11 and 13 years of formal education respectively. I do not consider either the claimant or the brother has limited education. The allegations of the claimant and the brother differ considerably from those of XXXX XXXX. More importantly, I have serious credibility concerns regarding the claimant and the brother.\nState Protection\n[55] In the alternative, I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant and the brother have not established that state protection is unavailable for the claimants in Hungary. There is a presumption that a state is capable of protecting its citizens. A claimant may rebut this presumption by providing \"clear and convincing\" proof of lack of state protection in their country of origin. A claimant must approach his or her state for protection, providing state protection might be reasonably forthcoming.42\n[56] Evidence that protection being offered is not necessarily perfect43 is not clear and convincing proof of the state's inability to protect its citizens, as no government can guarantee the protection of all its citizens at all times. However, where a state is in effective control of its territory, has military, police and civil authority in place and makes serious efforts to protects its citizens, the mere fact it is not always successful at doing so will not be enough to justify a claim that the victims are unable to avail themselves of protection.44 The onus is on the claimant to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that state protection is inadequate.45\n[57] No government can be expected to guarantee perfect protection of all of its citizens at all times, and the fact that a state is not always successful in protecting its citizens is not enough to justify a claim. This is particularly true when a state is in effective control of its territory and has military, police and civil authorities in place and is making serious attempts to protect its citizens.46\n[58] The burden of proving an absence of state protection is directly proportional to the level of democracy that exists in the state.47 The documentary evidence before me indicates that Hungary is a functioning democracy.48 It has functioning political and judicial systems in place and an official apparatus sufficient to provide a measure of protection to its citizens. Hungary is in control of its territory and has functioning security forces, both military and police, in place. There is no evidence of a total breakdown of state authority in Hungary.\n[59] Therefore, a claimant must do more than approach one police officer unsuccessfully before deciding that state protection would not be forthcoming. There is an onus on the claimant to exhaust all courses of action reasonably available to him.49\n[60] The Country Reports on Human Rights Practices states the following:\nThe National Police Headquarters (ORFK), under the direction of the Ministry of Interior, is responsible for maintaining order nationwide. The country's 19 county police departments and the Budapest police headquarters are directly subordinate to the ORFK. City police have local jurisdiction but are subordinate to the county police. Two other units are directly subordinate to the minister of interior: the Counterterrorism Center (commonly known by its Hungarian acronym \"TEK\") and the National Protective Service (NPS). ...The NPS is responsible for preventing and detecting internal corruption in law enforcement agencies, government administrative agencies, and civilian secret services. Both the TEK and the NPS are empowered to gather intelligence and conduct undercover policing, in certain cases without prior judicial authorization.50\nTherefore, I find that Hungary has a functioning police force.\n[61] In reviewing and assessing the totality of the documentary evidence on the record, I acknowledge that the evidence with regards to the situation for Roma in Hungary is mixed. I recognize that the Roma minority population experience discrimination in many aspects of their daily lives and sometimes experience violence and abuse at the hands of some racist residents of the country, including some rogue police officers. I also acknowledge the anti-Roma sentiment throughout Hungary and a corresponding popularity of the Jobbik, right-wing, political party. I, however, also finds that the ongoing programs of the Hungarian government, to resolve problems that Roma face, are producing positive results at both legislative and operational levels. I have examined the evidence with regards to the actions of the police and the government's actions with regards to improving the quality of life for Roma, including programs to enhance education, employment, healthcare and housing, especially by launching key legal, policy and institutional tactical measures.51\n[62] I also considered the issue of \"corruption\" and acknowledges it as a problem in the country. However, the documentary evidence also shows that there are steps being taken to prosecute officials and individuals when such abuse occurs.52\n[63] The Hungarian authorities have also taken action against extremist organizations, successfully banning the Hungarian Guard Association, a paramilitary wing of the Jobbik Party, and initiating processes for banning the Civil Guard Association on the grounds that their anti-Roma activities threaten public order.53\n[64] The Athena Institute, a Budapest-based independent research organization that focuses on domestic extremism and terrorism, notes that most of the actions of the Hungarian National Guard are \"followed-up by national police intervention.\"54\n[65] I note that Roma victims often face discriminatory treatment by the police. The documentation, however, is mixed in this regard; it is noted that police do intervene to protect the Roma community.55 For example, in August 2013 four men charged with the racially-motivated murder of six Roma in 2008-2009 were found guilty. Three of the four received life sentences and the fourth received 13 years imprisonment. The fourth individual had cooperated with police and was charged as an accomplice. Apparently, the defendants appealed the verdict and the case was pending at the end of 2014.56 However, according to the latest 2017 Department of State (DOS) report,57 on January 12, 2015 the Curia convicted the three individuals charged with the racially motivated murders of the six Roma in 2008 and 2009. The Curia upheld a lower court's sentence of life imprisonment with no possibility of parole in the case of premeditated murder and other charges. In May 2015 the Budapest Metropolitan Court of Appeals sentenced the fourth defendant, who had cooperated with police during the investigation, to 13 years' imprisonment as an accomplice to the murders.\n[66] I have examined the state protection principles as set out by the Courts. The onus is on the claimant to rebut the presumption of state protection with \"clear and convincing\" evidence of the state's inability to protect its citizens.58 The claimant must satisfy the Board that the state protection is, in fact, inadequate, on a balance of probabilities.59 \"...[A] refugee claimant does not rebut the presumption of state protection in a functioning democracy by asserting only a 'subjective reluctance to engage the state'.\"60 Doubting the effectiveness of the protection offered by the state when one has not really tested it does not rebut the existence of a presumption of state protection.61 The onus is on the refugee claimant to approach the state for protection in situations where state protection might be reasonably forthcoming.62\n[67] In Camacho,63 the court found that:\n... in the absence of a compelling explanation, a failure to pursue state protection opportunities in one's own country will usually be fatal to a refugee claim, at least where the state is a functioning democracy with a willingness and the apparatus necessary to provide adequate protection to its citizens.\n[68] In Kadenko,64 Justice D\u00e9cary found that:\nThe burden of proof that rests on the claimant is directly proportional to the level of democracy of the state in question. And the more democratic is the state in question the more the claimant must have done to exhaust all courses of action open to him or her.\n[69] As the Honourable Mr. Justice Russell observed in Molnar,65 \"the Hungarian situation is very difficult to gauge. Much will depend upon the facts and evidence adduced in each case...\"\n[70] In this particular case, I find that the claimants have not provided clear and convincing evidence, on a balance of probabilities, that state protection for them in Hungary is inadequate. The claimant and the brother allege that they made reports to the police, and the police did not help them. Above, I have found that the claimant and the brother did not, on a balance of probabilities, report to the police. If, indeed, they did report to the police and the police refused to follow up on their reports, which I do not accept, I find it reasonable to expect the claimants to have sought protection at another police station in their locale, which they testified they did not do. I also find that the claimants could have sought redress, by reporting the alleged inaction by the police, to the appropriate security organizations that are mandated to look into corruption or unjustified inaction by the police, especially if the claimants believed that they were denied state protection.\n[71] Based on the documentary evidence, I find that if the claimants were to return to Hungary and encounter problems, I am not persuaded that the authorities would not investigate their complaint(s). I am also not persuaded that, if a criminal act was attempted\/committed against the claimants in Hungary, the perpetrators would not be charged, arrested and prosecuted if there was sufficient evidence. Further, I find that if the claimants were to be dissatisfied with the response of the authorities to their complaints, the documentary evidence indicates that recourse to seek redress would be available to them.\n[72] In oral submissions, counsel referred to the various items from the National Documentation Package and pointed to sections in those reports which include the reported incidents of discrimination, harassment and physical abuse against Roma in Hungary. I too note the same or similar incidents and finds that these reports show societal discrimination and exclusion of the Roma and presence of anti-Semitism in the Hungarian society.66 However, I note that the documents in evidence also show that the government prosecutes and punishes officials who commit abuses, whether in the security services or elsewhere in the government.67\nIn a resolution adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe regarding the implementation of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities for Hungary, it is noted that the Hungarian \"authorities have made efforts to curtail abuse by the police by increasing the recruitment of Roma police officers, providing training in human rights and setting up, in 2008, the Independent Police Complaint Committee (IPCC) responsible for receiving complaints against misbehaviour of the police.\"\nPrograms for Roma police\nThe Ombudsman for minority rights indicated that the National Police Headquarters from \"time to time passes action plans on better co-operation with the Roma community\" (Hungary 19 Sept. 2011). The initiatives include providing grants, numbering from ten to fifteen, for \"talented Roma pupils,\" as well as \"a set of county co-operation contracts with local communities, Roma self-governments,\" and \"children and school programs\" which, for example, organize public days for informing the public and Roma about law enforcement (ibid.).\nThe HHC is of the opinion that when it comes to programs for Roma to become involved with the Police, \"the number of [a]ffected Roma people is extremely low, [and] the intensity and effectiveness of the programs are questionable\" (HHC 15 Sept. 2011).\nHowever, the HHC also indicated that, based on their research on Roma-police relations, one of the main goals of the police is to recruit Roma youth into the police force (ibid.). One way for the police to do this was to issue a \"call for proposals\" for Roma high school students, with the program allowing for selected Roma students to receive a monthly scholarship that varies between 11 and 22 US dollars, based on \"their achievement at school\" (ibid.).\nIn its Third Report submitted to the Council of Europe in 2009 concerning the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, the government of Hungary noted that a scholarship program for \"talented Roma secondary school students\" pursuing police careers has been active since 2000, sponsored by the Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Justice, and the ORFK (Hungary 4 June 2009).\nThe Vice President of the Phralipe Independent Roma Association indicated that to her knowledge, scholarship programs for police schools cover only half the year, and then it becomes a \"question [of] who is able to remain in the police school\" (15 Sept. 2011).\nThe Ministry of the Interior reported that on 28 March 2011 \"the Budapest Police Headquarters (BRFK) held an open day for the Roma-Gypsy under-privileged youth, who are interested in police career,\" which included presentations by employees from the BRFK's Department for Crime Prevention and representatives of secondary vocational schools for Police (Hungary 28 Mar. 2011). This day was organized with the help of Budapest's Gypsy Self-government, whose Chair \"underlined the importance of the cooperation with the police\" (ibid.). Corroborating this information, the Ombudsman indicated that on 28 March 2011 the Capital Police Station, along with the Crime Prevention Department and the Capital Roma self-government, organized \"a public day for pupils to present the operation of law enforcement\" (Hungary 19 Sept. 2011). The Ministry of the Interior also announced in March 2011 that there would be a police \"preparatory camp\" for Roma applicants in July 2011 (Hungary 28 Mar. 2011).\nThe HHC report notes that annual summer camps are often organized by regional police for young children coming from a \"poor\" environment (15 Sept. 2011). There is also an annual summer camp for Roma high school students lasting for five days in which they learn about law enforcement and requirements to enter the Police College (HHC 15 Sept. 2011). Forty students attended the camp in 2011 (HHC 15 Sept. 2011).\n[73] I find that the authorities have had some success in curtailing abuse by the police by increasing the recruitment of Roma police officers, providing training in human rights, and in 2008 by setting up the IPCC which is responsible for receiving complaints against misbehaviour of the police.68\n[74] The country documentary evidence69 further indicates that:\nSubmitting a complaint against a police officer\nThe Parliamentary Commissioner for the Rights of National and Ethnic Minorities, also referred to as the Minorities Ombudsman, noted in correspondence with the Research Directorate that the Police Act of 1994 allows for a complaint against the \"unlawful action\" of a police officer to be submitted to the local captain of the police, with a higher ranking captain having the option to appeal the decision (Hungary 19 Sept. 2011). The resulting decision can be reviewed by the court (ibid.). In correspondence with the Research Directorate, the HHC similarly noted that the Police Act allows for any individual who has his or her \"fundamental\" rights violated by the police to \"file a complaint with the police unit responsible\" for the violation (15 Sept. 2011).\nThe HHC further informed the Research Directorate that\ncomplaints shall be submitted within 30 days of the alleged violation by the concerned person or his\/her representative. (Complaints may also be represented by human rights NGOs or foundations, minority self-governments or certain law professors.) The complaint is decided on in an administrative procedure by the head of the respective police unit within 30 days after receiving the complaint.\" (HHC 15 Sept. 2011)\nThe HHC noted that this \"first instance decision\" can be appealed \"on any ground\" to the \"superior of the concerned police unit\" (ibid.). The appeal must be filed within 15 days after the delivery of the first instance decision, which shall forward the appeal and all the documents concerning the case to the superior unit within eight days after the appeal deadline, unless the unit which decided on the complaint withdraws the decision, refuses it without in-merit examination, or amends, corrects or supplements it in accordance with the appeal. If the appeal is forwarded to it, the superior body shall deliver a reasoned decision, affirming, modifying or annulling the first instance decision. (ibid.)\nThe subsequent \"second instance decision may be challenged before the court by the complainant\" (ibid.). However, the court \"may not change the decision: it may only send the case back to the police and order a new procedure (however, the police are obliged to follow the guidelines set by the court in the new procedure)\" (ibid.)....\n...\nAccording to Hungary's UN submission, the Complaints Body is \"independent\" of the government to ensure that the rights of citizens are protected (ibid. 16 Feb. 2011, para. 70). The HHC also notes that the Complaints Body is \"functionally external to the police authorities, and [that] its budget is included into the budget line of the Office of the Hungarian Parliament\" (HHC 15 Sept. 2011). The five members of the Complaints Body are lawyers chosen by Parliament to serve a six-year term (Hungary 16 Feb. 2011, para. 70). According to the HHC, the members cannot be re-elected, and they must all be \"lawyers with outstanding experience in the field of fundamental rights protection\" (HHC 15 Sept. 2011).\nThe HHC stated that to file a complaint with the Complaints Body, it has to be\nfiled within eight days of the alleged violation by the concerned person, who may also be represented by human rights NGOs or foundations, minority self-governments or certain law professors. Anonymous complaints or complaints arriving from someone acting on behalf of the victim without a proper authorization are rejected automatically. (ibid.)\nAccording to Hungary's report to the UN, the National Police Commissioner (also translated as the National Chief of Police and Chief Police Captain) is required to submit monthly reports to the Complaints Body about \"complaints submitted to the Police\" (Hungary 16 Feb. 2011, para. 70). If the Complaints Body finds that a citizen's \"fundamental rights\" have been seriously violated, it sends its decision to the Police Commissioner (ibid.; HHC 15 Sept. 2011), \"who shall deliver a resolution within 30 days\" (Hungary 16 Feb. 2011, para. 70). Although the Police Commissioner \"delivers the decision on the individual complaint,\" he can only deviate from the Complaint Body's recommendation on \"the basis of detailed argumentation\" (HHC 15 Sept. 2011). The Police Commissioner's decision can be submitted to court for judicial review (ibid.; Hungary 16 Feb. 2011, para. 70; ibid. 19 Sept. 2011), as can decisions made by the Complaints Body (ibid.). The Minorities Ombudsman said that although the Police Commissioner can accept or refuse a decision from the Complaints Body, \"[i]n practice,\" he \"neglect[s]\" 90 percent of the Complaints Body's decisions (ibid.).\nIf the Complaints Body determines either that there has been no violation of fundamental rights or that the violation was not \"substantial,\" the complaint is forwarded to the police unit of the officer who committed the violation, unless the complainant does not allow it, in which case the case is \"terminated\" (HHC 15 Sept. 2011). If the complaint does not fall under the mandate of the Complaints Body, it is forwarded to the appropriate authority (ibid.). The Complaints Body will \"[r]eject the complaint if the competent authority may not be established, or the complaint is filed after the deadline\" (ibid.).\nIn a March 2011 ERRC report on anti-Roma violence in Hungary, which looked at 22 cases of violence against Roma, the organization noted that\n\"[p]olice misconduct and procedural errors were documented during the investigation of one of the violent crimes against Roma, as raised by NGOs and later confirmed by the Independent Police Complaint [Body] and by the Head of Police. Misconduct by the National Security Service was also revealed.\" (ERRC Mar. 2011, 19)\nThe HHC indicates that in 2009 the Complaints Body issued 457 decisions on 737 complaints and that, of those 457 decisions, 59 were considered \"severe\" violations of fundamental rights and sent to the National Police Commissioner for adjudication (HHC 15 Sept. 2011). The Police Commissioner fully agreed with the Complaints Body in 11 of the 59 cases and partly agreed in 26 (ibid.). In 2010, the Complaints Body received 531 complaints and delivered 428 decisions, out of which 166 cases were considered \"severe\" violations of fundamental rights (ibid.). These cases were also sent to the Police Commissioner, who fully agreed with 14 of the Complaint Body's decisions and partly agreed with 4 others (ibid.).\nComplaint mechanisms\nThe Minorities Ombudsman indicated that there is a general lack of information about appropriate forums through which victims of human rights violations can submit their complaints (Hungary 19 Sept. 2011). He further stated that the main mechanisms for submitting human rights violations are only located in Budapest (ibid.). For many settlements, the only available mechanism is something called a \"minor-offence authority,\" which can be local municipal clerks, the police, or the tax office (ibid.). These authorities deal with minor \"unlawful behaviour,\" such as the refusal to provide service or the delivery of poor service in retail outlets, and their decisions can be contested in court (ibid.).\nIn addition, the Minorities Ombudsman pointed out that the majority of the Roma live in poor towns and small villages in rural areas of Hungary, making it difficult for them to find legal aid, whether from legal experts or NGOs that are working in cities. (Ibid) He noted that although the country has no specific complaints mechanisms for Roma whose human rights are violated, their anti-discrimination legal network was \"integrated into the free legal aid system inside county\/capital governmental administration offices in 2010\" (ibid).\n[75] Hungary has put in place independent authorities specifically entrusted with the fight against racism. For example:70\nThe Minorities Ombudsman indicated that the Equal Treatment Authority (ETA), operating under the Ministry of Justice and Public Administration, is located in Budapest (19 Sept. 2011). The ETA receives complaints of discrimination based on race, religion, nationality, and health conditions, and it has the authority to impose fines (Hungary 19 Sept. 2011). Similarly, the Hungarian government's report to the UN further details that the ETA was established in 2005 as an \"independent administrative body\" that \"protect[s], enforce[s], and promote[s] equality and the right to equal treatment\" (ibid. 16 Feb. 2011, para. 13). The ETA deals with \"direct\/indirect discrimination, segregation, harassment, [and] victimization\" based on\ngender; racial origin; colour; nationality; national or ethnic origin; mother tongue; disability; state of health; religious or ideological conviction; political or other opinion; family status; maternity or paternity; sexual orientation; sexual identity; age; social origin; financial status; part-time, temporary and other types of employment contract; the membership of an organization representing employees' interests and any other status, attribute or characteristic. (ibid., para. 14)\nAlthough the ETA is directed by the Minister of Public Administration and Justice, the government cannot \"instruct the Authority when it performs its duty under the Equal Treatment Act\" (ibid., para. 13). According to the Hungary report to the UN, the ETA \"can initiate proceedings upon individual complaints\" (ibid., para. 14); that is, it conducts \"independent investigations based on individual complaints\" (HHC 15 Sept. 2011). Its authority \"extends to all actions and omissions of all public actors and a limited circle of private persons (e.g., employers and persons offering goods and services to the public)\" (ibid.). Thus, it can also initiate an \"actio popularis submitted by NGOs and other stakeholders or ex officio\" (Hungary 16 Feb. 2011, para. 14) with \"a view to protecting the rights of persons and groups whose rights have been violated\" (EU Nov. 2010, 86).\nIf the \"right to equal treatment\" is \"violated\" (Hungary 16 Feb. 2011, para. 14), the ETA can impose sanctions (EU Nov. 2010, 85; HHC 15 Sept. 2011). For example, it \"may order the elimination of the situation concerned, prohibit further continuation of the conduct concerned; publish its decision or impose a fine\" (Hungary 16 Feb. 2011, para. 14). The Hungarian government's UN report describes the ETA's decisions as \"legally binding and enforceable,\" saying they \"cannot be altered or set aside by the Government or public authorities\" (ibid., para. 13). However, in a November 2010 report discussing anti-discrimination laws in the European Union, the European Commission notes that the ETA provides a \"usually non-binding opinion\" on complaints it receives from \"victims of discrimination\" (EU Nov. 2010, 85).\nThe ETA performs \"most of its duties in co-operation with a six-member Advisory Committee, whose members have extensive experience in the protection of human rights and in enforcing the principle of equal treatment\" (HHC 15 Sept. 2011). The ETA authority excludes Parliament, the President, the Constitutional Court, the State Audit Office, the ombudsmen, the courts, and public prosecutors (ibid.). According to the HHC, the ETA has to deliver a decision within 75 days of receiving a complaint unless the complaint concerns a minor or was submitted by an Ombudsman, in which case it has 45 days (ibid.).\n[76] I find that the government has enacted legislation, and put in place many tactical initiatives across several departments and they are producing results on the ground. I find that the documentary evidence as noted above demonstrates that Hungary continues to provide protection for all its citizens, including Roma and other ethnic minorities. Although not perfect, I find that the evidence demonstrates that Hungary's progressively evolving measures\/actions to provide protection for its citizens, including Roma, are actually having an impact operationally on the ground. The evidence also demonstrates that police do investigate crimes against Roma and that perpetrators are being held responsible when there is sufficient evidence.\n[77] In Dinok,71 the Court stated that the RPD reflected in its analysis laws against abuses by the police, but went on to look at the evidence of how many disciplinary charges were prosecuted against members of the police force. As it was acknowledged in Hercegi,72 in Konya73 Madam Justice Snider explained the flaw with this argument:\nEach case will be decided on the basis of the facts and arguments before the Court. In the course of analysis, a judge may express views of what the documentary evidence tends to show. However, these judicial comments cannot be elevated to factual findings. Only the Board is able to make such findings.\n[78] In Mudrak,74 the Court states:\n...[I]t is also incorrect to, in effect, reverse the presumption of adequate state protection in a democratic society when a country enacts legislation, or when there is evidence of increasing acts of violence, thereby requiring the Board to demonstrate the operational adequacy of measures taken to prevent incidents of persecution in its reasons.\n...Nor should the fact that a democratic government enacting legislation and putting other measures in place to combat persecution, somehow be seen as an admission of a failure of state protection. ...[E]xtensive and substantial legislation and other measures being undertaken should be treated as evidence supporting the democratic foundations of the country, thereby enhancing the presumption of adequate state protection as opposed to requiring the Board to demonstrate operational adequacy.\n[79] Based on the foregoing analysis, I find that state protection measures put in place by the authorities in Hungary are demonstrative of the availability of recourse to obtain state protection. I find that the claimants, in their particular situation and circumstances, would receive, although not perfect, adequate state protection upon return.\n[80] Despite the above, I acknowledge that the quality of existence for the Roma is not what it should be, but the evidence nonetheless shows that their existence is not threatened by the state. It is noted that the progress in combating racism is not as rapid, and there have been set-backs and obstacles, but I find that the commitment of the state to continue the battle is not in question. I find it unreasonable to expect that state measures should have prevented or eliminated all racism or acts of physical violence related to race.\n[81] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that Hungary is not only making serious efforts to turn around the endemic racism that has historically been present in Hungarian society, including in the police force, but rather it has enacted legislation, has infrastructure and a functioning police force in place, allocates funding, and operates programs on the ground. The documentary evidence demonstrates that it is reasonable to expect authorities to take action when complaints are made, and that there are organizations in place to ensure that the police are held accountable. Therefore, I find, acknowledging the situation is not perfect, that adequate state protection would be reasonably forthcoming to the claimants if they were to need it and diligently seek it upon return to Hungary.\n[82] I conclude that the claimant and the brother have not rebutted the presumption of state protection in Hungary. I find that adequate state protection would be reasonably forthcoming to them, in their particular situation and circumstances, if they were to need it and were to seek it upon return to Hungary.\nCONCLUSION\n[83] I find that, in the circumstances particular to this case, the claimant and the brother have not established a serious possibility of persecution, or that they would, on a balance of probabilities, be personally subjected to a risk to life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or to a danger of torture upon return to Hungary.\n[84] I, therefore, find that the claimant and the brother are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection, pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the IRPA.\n[85] The claims of the wife and the claimant's children as well as the claims of the brother's wife and the brother's children are dependent upon the claims of the claimant and the brother. I, therefore, find that the wife, the claimant's children, the brother's wife and the brother's children are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection, pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the IRPA.\n(signed)\n\"Lesley Mason\"\nLesley Mason\nDecember 14, 2017\nDate\n1Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, sections 96, 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b).\n2 Can.

Further, the panel finds that she is not a person in need of protection as her removal to Nigeria would not subject her personally to a risk to life, to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or to a danger of torture.\nIDENTITY\n[4] The panel finds the claimant has established her identity as a national of Nigeria based on photocopies of various national identity documents presented at this hearing.\nALLEGATIONS\n[5] The claimant has set out the basis of her claim in the narrative portion of his Personal Information Form (PIF)3. Briefly, the claimant fears XXXX XXXX, a long-time family friend who stepped in after the claimant's father died and acted as a surrogate father to her. He paid for the claimant's education and she began a sexual relationship with him in 2010. The claimant said he was a Chief, which is what she called him in her narrative. Still unmarried, the claimant moved into Chief's house. Unknown to the Chief, the claimant was communicating via text messaging with another young man whom she knew from school. Chief discovered the texts one evening when the couple were in bed and he hit the claimant. The claimant reminded him that they were not married, so he decided they would get married in XXXX 2010. Although this marriage never took place, the claimant continued to live with Chief, who became controlling and violent and he also monitored her movements. Chief took the claimant with him on an international business trip to XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX in XXXX 2012 but he continued to beat the claimant on that trip too.\n[6] In preparing to marry the claimant, Chief asked the claimant's family in 2012 whether the claimant was circumcised; the claimant said she was not but that he should have known this since they were having sexual relations. Chief told the claimant's mother that, although he and the claimant had lived together for two years, now that he was marrying a woman, she must be circumcised because he is a chief. The uncles took dowry from the man and they agreed to the circumcision rites. The claimant was able to make travel arrangements without Chief's knowledge and she left Nigeria on XXXX XXXX, 2012.\n[7] The claimant provided the Board with a new Addendum4, received only 8 days before this hearing. Chief has been harassing her siblings in Nigeria and he still claims ownership of the claimant because he paid a dowry for her despite attempts by the claimant's family to return the dowry he paid. The man has hired thugs to harass the claimant's family and he harassed the claimant's mother in XXXX 2017.\n[8] The claimant also presented the panel with a new 'Update to Narrative' to her Personal Information Form just eight days before the hearing, stating that since arriving in Canada, feelings for women were awakened in her after meeting a bisexual woman in 2014. After two relationships with bisexual women, the claimant declared her bisexuality in 2015.\nCREDIBILITY\n[9] The determinative issue in this claim is credibility. The panel finds the claimant not to be a credible witness. The claimant has not met her burden of establishing the subjective component of a well-founded fear because the panel finds her not to be credible in a material aspect of her claim, which was added to her PIF a mere eight days before her refugee hearing; namely, a fear of returning to Nigeria based on her sexual orientation as a bisexual woman.\n[10] Claimants must establish that they have a subjective fear of persecution and also that the fear is well-founded. Claimants must establish the factual elements of their case on a balance of probabilities, but they do not have to prove that persecution would be more likely than not. The evidence must show only that there are \"good grounds\" for fearing persecution. The test, which has become known as the Adjei5 test, was set out as: \"Is there a reasonable chance that persecution would take place were the applicant returned to his country of origin?\" Set against the assessment of credibility, the panel has identified significant issues with material aspects of the claimant's story. Considered cumulatively, these issues undermine the claimant's overall credibility, which became the determinative issue of this claim. The panel recounts these concerns below.\nBisexuality - late disclosure of this allegation\n[11] The claimant's original narrative alleges a fear of domestic abuse if she returns to Nigeria. In addition to that fear, the claimant has added that she is bisexual and she fears being persecuted based on her sexual orientation. The panel finds the claimant's addition of a new and previously unnamed reason for fearing persecution to her claim only eight days before her hearing to raise several credibility issues. The panel's concerns with the claimant's credibility go to the heart of her claim. First, the panel expressed its concern that the claimant has presented new materials and it asked for an explanation from her for doing so. Specifically, the 'Update to Narrative' discloses entirely new information by adding an additional element to her refugee claim: fear of persecution based on her alleged bisexuality. Additional new evidence was included in this late disclosure of information as well. While the panel is cognizant of the importance of enforcing the Board's disclosure rules, and claimants are required to submit all of their materials at least ten days before the hearing date unless there are good reasons not to do so, this is a Legacy claim and the panel chose to remain flexible with late disclosure items as it does in other Legacy cases. That being said, the panel is required to assess the reasons proffered by claimants for submitting materials so late, which the panel did in this case, and especially since these materials go to the heart of the claimant's refugee claim. The panel finds the claimant's reason below not to be a satisfactory and persuasive reason for filing these materials just eight days before her hearing.\n[12] Second, the panel notes that the claimant has been present in Canada for more than five years. For the past three-and-a-half years of her time here, she has been living in Toronto, allegedly as a bisexual woman. During this lengthy period of time, the claimant never attempted to contact the Board to update her information with this important amendment as to a materially new aspect of her claim. The panel asked the claimant why she failed to notify the Board of this previously unmentioned element before this late disclosure date. The claimant blamed her failure to notify the Board over the past three-and-a-half years on her previous counsel, who allegedly advised the claimant to wait and instead reveal this information at the hearing. The panel does not believe the claimant in this regard. The panel has adjudicated thousands of refugee claimants and it has never heard any claimant allege that their Canadian lawyer or legal representative counselled them to withhold material information from the Board until the day of their refugee hearing. The panel finds it implausible that the claimant failed to notify the Board for the reason given, and the panel is entitled to make findings on the plausibility of certain behaviors as they relate to a claimant's story and reasons for doing or not doing certain things. The panel finds the claimant to be well-organized and intelligent based on her file, her submitted materials and on her oral testimony. The panel assigns little weight to her explanation that she simply took a previous lawyer's advice not to share important information with the Board until the hearing date or, in her case, eight days before this hearing. The panel makes an adverse credibility finding against the claimant in this regard.\n[13] Third, for undisclosed reasons, the claimant retained a new counsel on November 3, 2017. In the intervening period between that date and the hearing date of November 30 - a period of less than three weeks - the claimant was able to create a two-page narrative attesting to her bisexuality; obtain documentation from the XXXX XXXX XXXX (XXXX) attesting to her bisexuality; obtain a psychotherapist report nine days before her hearing attesting to, among other things, the claimant's bisexuality; present original and photocopied pictures of herself in the company of women and XXXX church officials as well as attending Toronto Pride events; and include a statement from someone purporting to be her girlfriend. The panel does not find the claimant's reason for failing to present this information to the Board, well in advance of her refugee claim, to be persuasive evidence that establishes her alleged bisexuality for the following reason.\n[14] The claimant has been aware (by way of formal notice from the Board) of her scheduled hearing date for some months. Changing her counsel 27 days before her scheduled hearing has resulted in the claimant adding an additional reason for seeking protection that the panel determined had to be tested. The panel finds that blaming a previous counsel for her failure to report this material change to her narrative to be an unsatisfactory reason for the claimant's late disclosure of documents as stated. The claimant and her current counsel did not reveal to the Board (nor were they obligated to do so) the reason for the claimant's decision to change counsels in the same month as her scheduled hearing. What is more, other than pictures of her attending some Pride events and standing in the company of known people in Toronto's gay community, the panel observed that all of the claimant's documents as referenced in paragraph 13 above are dated in the last few weeks before her refugee hearing and only after she retained a new counsel. For the reasons set out in paragraphs 11 through 14, the panel finds the claimant's explanation for the material addition to her narrative eight days before her hearing to be unsatisfactory and the information provided cannot persuasively establish that she is bisexual.\nClaimant's use of the term 'bisexual'\n[15] Given its concerns with the claimant's addition of new information and setting out new reasons for her fear to return to Nigeria, the panel then assessed the validity of these items in the context of the claimant's oral testimony as well as the general veracity of her statement about her sexual orientation. The panel finds the claimant's allegation that she is bisexual not to be credible. Bisexuality is commonly defined as romantic attraction, sexual attraction or sexual behavior toward both males and females. This definition can also extend broadly to one who possesses a romantic or sexual attraction to people of any sex or gender identity. In the particular circumstances of this claim, however, the female claimant has expressed her attraction to, and preference for females only. The claimant slept with men in Nigeria and possibly in Canada (see paragraph 17) but she suddenly developed a preference for women only after settling in Canada.\n[16] Therefore, the panel repeatedly pointed out to the claimant that it had concerns with her use of the term 'bisexual' and her statement that she is 'bisexual' given that she is attracted only to women and she has been dating and having sexual relations with women. For women who engage in same-sex relations and who attracted solely to women as this claimant alleges, the term for their sexual orientation is lesbianism. Specifically, a lesbian is a homosexual woman who is romantically or sexually attracted to other women; something the claimant alleges. The claimant responded that she is bisexual because she slept with men before but now she prefers women. The panel pointed out to the claimant that she might have slept with men before but she claims no attraction to men; rather, she is attracted to women, she sleeps with women and she does not engage in sexual relations with men. Therefore, based on the general and widely-accepted terms used, the claimant is a lesbian. The panel asked why she did not use this term to describe her sexual awakening. The panel again put the specific differences between these two terms 'bisexual' and 'lesbian' to the claimant. Once more, she responded: \"I thought lesbian is strictly for women. I enjoy being with female first than being with a man.\" Accordingly, based solely on the common and widely-accepted objective definition of these terms, the claimant must be a lesbian as she only sleeps with and is attracted to women. However, the claimant's error in the use of these terms, including her confusion and inability to distinguish between the terms as a means to correctly identify her alleged sexuality, undermines her credibility that she has an alternative sexual orientation - a material aspect of her claim.\n[17] The panel finds other elements of the claimant' oral and written testimony not to be credible related to her alleged bisexuality. As stated, the claimant said she slept with men previously, which means she is bisexual. The panel again asked to claimant to explain if she was sleeping with men in Canada. The claimant's counsel referenced a statement in her 'Update to Narrative' that possibly indicated maintaining relations with both men and women in Canada: \"With XXXX I was very afraid to accept myself as bisexual even though I enjoyed my intercourse with XXXX more than intercourse with men...\" The claimant repeated that she slept with men previously in Canada but never more than three months and she found them not as desirable as sleeping with women so she is bisexual. The only explicit reference the claimant gave to sleeping with men was her heterosexual relationship with Chief in Nigeria. The panel pointed out to the claimant and her counsel that this does not establish the claimant is sleeping with men in Canada; only that she had stated a preference for intercourse with women over intercourse with men.\" By extension, the claimant both wrote and testified that she was only engaged in sexual relations with women since 2014 and she has only named three female partners. At no time did she allege that she had carried on relations with men, nor did she name any male partners.\n[18] Even if the panel gives the claimant the benefit of the doubt and accepts she slept with men upon arriving in Canada in 2012, this goes against - and entirely undermines - the content of the psychotherapist report filed on her behalf, which the panel will discuss later in these reasons. If the claimant were (and allegedly continues to be) so traumatized, stressed and profoundly affected by the allegedly abusive relationship with Chief, it makes no sense that she would resume heterosexual relations with men upon arrival in Canada until she turned to lesbian relationships. Her story is based on a newly-found sexual orientation. The problem is that she has incorrectly labeled herself as bisexual when, even if the panel were to believe her, the correct term for her sexual preference is lesbianism. Given the confusion that the claimant's oral testimony and narrative creates, which ultimately serves to undermine her credibility, the panel is not persuaded the claimant is bisexual or lesbian.\n[19] This is a material mistake on the claimant's part that undermines her overall credibility. This terminology - gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender - is referenced globally and transcends many cultures. The claimant's counsel's closing submission is that the claimant's cultural proclivities are such that she simply uses a term she knows to describe alternative sexual orientation. The panel assigns little weight to this submission as supportive of the claimant's inability to identify herself, which requires the panel to make its adverse finding against her credibility. The claimant's alleged exposure to, and engagement in, sexual relations with women was developed beginning in 2014 and has only occurred while living in Toronto. Life in the gay community, in which the claimant alleges she participates, and for which she alleges significant exposure, fundamentally would require no need for an adjudicative panel to clarify with her the correct terminology nearly three years after alleging her new sexual orientation. The panel has adjudicated significant numbers of refugee claims based on sexual orientation. For those who genuinely and persuasively establish their sexual identity, there is simply no practical requirement for an adjudicative panel to explore terminology used by a claimant let alone correct a truly gay, lesbian or bisexual claimant living openly in Toronto on the proper use of these terms, all of which are known and which have precise meanings. This claimant has alleged having sexual relations with a number of women in Canada; growing into her sexuality; being a volunteer as a cleaner at a prominent gay church in the City; and participating in significant, gay-themed cultural events and celebrations within this large community and exposed to various members of this broad community. Yet, with such exposure to the community as part of her particular circumstances in Canada, the panel cannot overlook or set aside the claimant's inability to even identify herself and her sexuality correctly; nor can the panel excuse this fundamental error as merely someone from another country who uses her own terms to describe herself. The panel assigns little weight to the counsel's submission and it finds that the claimant has not established persuasively her alleged sexual identity.\n[20] In her 'Update to Narrative', the claimant wrote: \"...I recent [sic] met and connected with XXXX XXXX on November 5, 2017, my new 'boy (girl) friend.'\" The panel asked the claimant why she would call this person her new 'boy (girl) friend.'6 The claimant smirked when the panel asked her this question and she began to laugh quietly. The panel asked the claimant why she thought this question was humorous. The claimant did not respond to the question. The panel finds this behavior to be indicative of the claimant's discomfort with the story she has proffered to the panel and her own lack of knowledge of homosexual nomenclature or the intimate and discreet details of lesbian sexuality. Moreover, the claimant was visibly embarrassed when, in referencing her girlfriend in response to the panel's request for some evidence that she is bisexual, she answered: \"we are intimate.\" Once again, she smirked when she said this. Based on its adjudication of scores of claims based on alternative sexual orientation, gay claimants do not offer such dual terms to identify their friends and partners and rarely do they display the lack of knowledge and discomfort that this claimant has demonstrated. To finish her oral testimony on this point, the claimant also said she thinks she is the man, referencing her girlfriend. The panel finds this statement to further demonstrate the claimant's disconnection from her alleged sexuality as well as to undermine, considering all of these concerns, her overall credibility on a material aspect of her claim.\n[21] The panel cannot rely on this woman's statement to establish the claimant's alleged sexual identity whether considered individually or cumulatively with the other documents. The claimant said her girlfriend dropped her off for her hearing because she had to go to work. The panel was not persuaded that the claimant has established her alleged sexual orientation based on this person's statement. Given that the person was not a witness in this hearing and the claimant did not bring her alleged girlfriend to the hearing to permit the panel to explore this aspect of the claimant's alleged relationship, the statement is assigned little weight as it has no probative value and it does not establish the claimant's alleged bisexuality.\n[22] The panel has stated all of its credibility concerns on the record. The panel asked the claimant again to provide some type of corroborating testimony and evidence that might enable it to accept as persuasive the claimant's alleged sexual identity. She gave three oral responses: \"My friend has hair on her body\"; \"we go to the club XXXX XXXX on XXXX Road\" and \"we are intimate.\" These responses do not establish the claimant's sexuality as a lesbian let alone as a bisexual person. A description of physical attributes of a friend's body and a statement that they are intimate does not persuasively establish one's sexuality as a lesbian let alone as a bisexual person. Second, XXXX XXXX is an African restaurant and entertainment spot focusing on the Nigerian community and is not an exclusively gay establishment. The pictures taken of the claimant standing next to gay church officials do not establish that she is either bisexual or a lesbian. Taking pictures at an annual gay-themed parade that can draw upwards of a million attendees also does not establish one's alternative sexuality. Further, the MCC does not require people to be gay, lesbian or bisexual in order to be part of its congregation as the church welcomes gay and straight people to worship, play and volunteer together. In this regard, the panel assigns little weight to the church's letter, which simply restates what the claimant has allegedly told them in asking for a letter a few weeks ago to support her claim; that she is bisexual and that she volunteered at the church in 2016. The panel finds none of the claimant's oral responses or these documents to establish her alleged sexuality in any meaningful, credible or persuasive way.\nPsychologist Report and Affidavit of XXXX XXXX\n[23] The panel turned to two other documents that undermine the claimant's credibility. First, the claimant submitted a psychotherapist report dated XXXX XXXX, 2017 that recounts everything the claimant wrote in both her narrative and in her 'Update to Narrative.' Most of the report findings are based on the impact of the alleged domestic abuse on the claimant as well as her having to wait for more than five years to have her claim adjudicated. Of note are statements about the claimant's behavior and presentation:\nThe interview was stressful for Ms. XXXX as she experienced vulnerability, painful thoughts, and memories, causing her to suffer from aversive physiological arousal...and it is evident that damaging psychological and emotional after-effects persist.7\n[24] On page 268, the report presents an exhaustive list of examples of how the claimant's experiences in Nigeria have profoundly impacted her psychological and emotional functioning. The report then makes the following statements regarding people who have been exposed to trauma and high levels of stress:\nThe pressure that is inherent to the high-stakes context of immigration proceedings can easily exacerbate or amplify this stress causing a person to have difficulty understanding questions, retrieving specific details of the past or formulating a coherent response. The person may request for questions to be repeated or rephrased, and these stress-related cognitive problems can lead to difficulties in providing clear and consistent testimony. Should such problems arise, it will be important to understand that the person is likely responding to the disorganizing effects of traumatic stress rather than being dishonest or evasive.8\n[25] The panel finds the claimant to display none of the behaviors that the report provides. The panel has also read the same statements in the same template form for other claimants providing reports from this source. In the context of this particular claim, the panel was mindful of the impact of domestic abuse on claimants and Chairperson Guideline 49 was considered carefully in assessing the impacts of such abuse on the claimant. This claimant displayed none of the report's conclusions and findings. Specifically, the claimant was bright, alert and entirely in control of her responses, her comportment and her behavior throughout the hearing process. The claimant was able to answer questions asked differently by the panel. The panel noted the claimant's confidence level, which was high and entirely inconsistent with the affected behavior of claimants alleging years of ongoing domestic abuse and a fear of accepting a newly-found sexuality or fear of returning to a country of alleged persecution. The panel put its observation directly to the claimant regarding the dramatic statements contained in the psychotherapist report - written only nine days before the hearing event - and the claimant's behavior at the hearing. The panel finds the claimant's behavior not only to be inconsistent with someone impacted and ravaged by severe domestic abuse as alleged, but to entirely belie the stressed, anxious and depressed portrayal of her presented in the psychotherapist report. Had the claimant presented such a report from three, four or five years ago, during which such findings related to the impact of abuse on claimants have a sense of immediacy and are directly related to the abuse experienced, the findings in respect of her circumstances might have been helpful evidence in order to support the claimant's story. Instead, this report sets out incredibly impactful findings for a person who exhibited none of these symptoms during the entirety of the hearing process. Yet, this report was written years after the claimant had left Nigeria and it alleges the claimant has been affected deeply by her experiences. Only nine days after the report was written here in Toronto, the claimant has manifested none of the observations that the report set out. The panel assigns no weight to this report for three reasons: the basis of the report is a story the claimant has told the author, and on many aspects, the panel finds not to be credible as analyzed and referenced; elements of this report contain templated material furnished by this same author for other claimants alleging domestic abuse; and the claimant's behavior and comportment at the hearing do not match the profoundly affected and distressed person referenced in the report.\n[26] Additionally, the panel must make one further reference to the aforementioned affidavit of XXXX XXXX. This person's statement does two things: it impacts adversely the veracity of statements and findings contained in the psychotherapist report that describe the claimant as a weak and traumatized victim; and it supports the panel's finding that the claimant does not comport herself as someone who has experienced allegations of abuse or someone who fears persecution based on her newly-discovered sexuality. For example, where the report depicts the claimant as liable for re-traumatization and having thoughts of self-harm, the friend's affidavit paints an entirely different picture of the claimant and describes her as \"confident\", \"domineering\" and \"protective.\" \"She's someone that cannot be pushed around, she seems like someone who knows what she wants and goes after it and those qualities of hers are what really attracted me to her.\" The affidavit was signed on 15 November 2017; six days before the psychotherapist report was authored on 21 November 2017. If a friend (and an alleged new girlfriend) opines that the claimant is confident and self-assured, which is what the panel observed at the hearing, the panel is entitled to find the psychotherapist report not only to be of little probative value, but it is entirely unreflective of the claimant appearing at this hearing. Thus, the panel finds this person's affidavit valuable for two reasons only: it confirms the panel's observation of the claimant as confident and determined individual who comports herself in a manner entirely inconsistent with a person who claims to be abused or to fear persecution if she returns to Nigeria; and it establishes that the report should be given very little weight. The panel finds both documents to undermine the claimant's subjective fear as alleged.\n[27] There is no specific test to ascertain or determine with complete accuracy one's sexual identity. The assessment must be made on the totality of the evidence proffered and the panel must assess the overall credibility of a claimant in such cases. In this claim, however, there are serious reasons for the panel to doubt both the evidence and oral testimony of this claimant. On something as fundamental as her sexual preference, the panel finds the claimant not to be credible and it finds that she has contrived this allegation to bolster her claim to refugee status. The panel finds her documents to be self-serving materials that do not reconcile her fundamental inability to identify herself correctly using the term bisexual, as analyzed above.\nTwo material implausibilities related to the relationship with Chief\n[28] A full reading of Chairperson Guideline 4 in the context of this claimant's story limits the application of this important tool to assess women fearing domestic abuse given the panel's concerns with her credibility. What is more, given all of the aforementioned credibility issues, the panel assessed the claimant's allegations of domestic abuse as the second component of her claim. On this point, the panel elected to focus on what it determined to be two significant aspects of the claimant's story that required an explanation from her. First, the claimant wrote that she and Chief fell in love and began having sexual relations when the claimant was studying at university in 2010. The claimant moved into Chief's home. The claimant wrote that everything was fine until sometime that year, Chief discovered that the claimant was texting a high school friend. The message began 'My love'. The couple remained unmarried despite living together. That same year, one evening as Chief and the claimant were 'on the bed' as she wrote, the claimant received a text from a boy she had been texting regularly. Chief discovered the message, which also used the words 'my love'. Chief then went through all of the texts and saw that once again, the claimant was being unfaithful to him by communicating with another man. As the claimant recounted in her original narrative:\nI tried to explain to chief that it was nothing but he was very furious. He took my phone and went through all the texts and then began to hit me. In the process of hitting me I told him that we were not married after all and that I want to get out of his house. I did not know that he took that statement seriously, he then decided to go to my family and then they settled that the marriage ceremony would take place in XXXX 2010.10\n[29] The panel asked the claimant why Chief would want to marry her if she was being unfaithful to him. The claimant said it was because he spent so much money on her education and he sees her as his property. The claimant's counsel submitted that we cannot know what reasons the man might have for wanting to marry the claimant despite her infidelity and we cannot make an adverse finding against the claimant's credibility for not knowing his pattern of thinking. The panel finds this submission to be an appropriate one but given the panel's serious credibility concerns with the claimant as an unreliable witness in all of the aforementioned examples and throughout the hearing - all of which relate to a highly significant and material aspect of her claim - the panel is entitled to make findings on the plausibility of certain other events and actions of her claim in assessing credibility. In this regard, the panel finds it is implausible that someone who has learned that his girlfriend is unfaithful by texting other men would be even more determined to marry that person and to meet with her family to plan the marriage and take steps to set a date for the event. The panel does not accept as persuasive her explanation for Chief wanting to marry her after she had demonstrated her infidelity to him on at least two occasions.\n[30] The second aspect that undermines the claimant's credibility is one the claimant herself referenced by describing how Chief went to the claimant's family in 2012 to ask whether the claimant was circumcised. By this time, the man had been having intimate sexual relations with the claimant for nearly two years. It is unfathomable that the man would not know whether the claimant - his live-in girlfriend with whom he shared a bed and engaged in continual sexual relations - was circumcised or not. This statement by the claimant stretches the skein of reasoning and is testimony unbelieved by the panel. The claimant wrote that her mother asked Chief how he could be asking such a question when he had been having sex with her daughter for nearly two years. The claimant's written response makes no sense to the panel: \"...he told me that it is now that he is marrying me and that before he could marry any woman, the woman had to be circumcised since he is a chief.\" This statement does not explain why the man would be asking the claimant's family whether she was circumcised when the claimant lived with him and he had already been intimate with the claimant frequently for nearly two years. Even the claimant treated the man's question with skepticism at the hearing. When considered in the context of her entire narrative and the numerous credibility issues identified at the hearing, the panel finds the story and the allegation to be implausible and to make no sense. These implausibilities have been considered in the context of all of the panel's adverse credibility findings on material aspects of this claim. As the panel finds the claimant to be wholly not credible on the material question of her sexuality, and its exploration of the central aspect of her claim of abuse has yielded these two further implausibilities related to alleged domestic abuse, the panel finds that taken together, these examples undermine the claimant's overall credibility on a cumulative basis. The panel does not believe her story of domestic abuse or her new story based on sexual orientation.\n[31] The panel acknowledges two distinct aspects of this claimant's reasons for seeking international protection: domestic abuse in Nigeria and alternative sexual orientation that puts her at risk in Nigeria. The story elements are different to be sure, but the claimant's credibility is the lynchpin that ties the two stories together as a basis for seeking protection. Unfortunately, the claimant's credibility is fundamentally undermined on many elements of material inconsistencies, contradictions and implausibilities as referenced herein such that the panel cannot rely on any of the statements and stories the claimant has presented at this hearing.\n[32] It is on the core aspects of this claim - items determined to be sufficiently material to this claim as identified - that the claim fails and the claimant is determined not to be credible.\n[33] The panel is entitled to draw adverse inferences in respect of the claimant's credibility for the reasons stated. Accordingly, the panel does not believe the claimant's allegations - and credibility is the determining issue in this claim. Having considered the totality of the evidence, and having noted significant credibility concerns with her testimony, the panel finds the claimant's testimony was unhelpful to establish the claimant's allegation that she is bisexual.\nCONCLUSION\n[34] Having considered all the evidence, the panel determines that there is not a serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted in Nigeria or that, on a balance of probabilities, she would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment and punishment in Nigeria.\n[35] The panel finds that the claimant, XXXX XXXX, is neither a Convention Refugee nor a person in need of protection. The panel rejects her claim.\n(signed)\n\"Reid Rossi\"\nR.

They claim refugee protection pursuant sections 96 and 97 of The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act1.\n[2] The principal claimant was appointed the designated representative of her three minor children.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The principal claimant alleges that after the death of her husband, a friend introduced her to Falun Gong in June, 2011. The principal claimant stated that she started to practice Falun Gong and eventually started to practice with a group which met in secret. On October 8, 2012, the principal claimant alleges that her Falun Gong practice group was raided by the Public Security Bureau. The principal claimant alleges that she managed to escape and went into hiding. The principal claimant alleges that a friend helped her to make arrangements to leave the country and was able to obtain false Hong Kong passports for herself and her children. The claimants arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2012 and filed for refugee protection on or about December 11, 2012. The principal claimant indicated that the Public Security Bureau attended at her parents' home to arrest her.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] I find that the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. I am cognizant of the difficulties faced by the principal claimant in establishing her claim and the claims of her children, including cultural factors, the milieu of the hearing room and the stress inherent in responding to oral questions. I have taken these considerations into account in arriving at negative credibility findings.\nANALYSIS\n[5] The determinative issues in these claims are identity as citizens of the People's Republic of China and credibility of the principal claimant's identity as a Falun Gong practitioner and the alleged raid by the Public Security Bureau and her pursuit by the Public Security Bureau.\nIdentity\n[6] In assessing the authenticity of the claimants' documents, I am guided by the Federal Court decision in Sertkaya2which states that it is open to the Board to consider the authenticity of documentary evidence, and the ability of the claimants to obtain and use fraudulent documents.\n[7] I am further guided by the Federal Court decision in Kazadi3which states that if there are significant irregularities on the face of the claimants' key documents, the Board is not obliged to seek an expert assessment of those documents before determining their probative value. I also note the Federal Court decision in Rasheed4which maintains that the basic rule of Canadian law is that foreign documents (whether to establish the identity or not of a claimant) purporting to be issued by a competent foreign public official should be accepted as evidence of their contents unless the Board has some valid reason to doubt their authenticity.\n[8] In order to establish their identity as citizens of the People's Republic of China, the claimants tendered a Hukou, three birth certificates of the minor claimants and a death certificate of the principal claimant's husband5. It should be noted that none of the identity documents proffered to establish the claimants' identities had photos.\n[9] In the analysis of the issue of the claimants' identities, I am guided by section 106 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act which states:\nThe Refugee Protection Division must take into account, with respect to\nthe credibility of a claimant, whether the claimant possesses acceptable\ndocumentation establish identity, and if not, whether they have provided a\nreasonable explanation for the lack of documentation or have taken reasonable\nsteps to obtain the documentation.\n[10] Furthermore, Rule 11 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules states:\nThe claimant must provide acceptable documents establishing identity\nand other elements of the claim. A claimant who does not provide\nacceptable documents must explain why they were not provided\nand what steps were taken to obtain them.\n[11] The claimants were represented by a competent and experienced counsel in Chinese claims. I find that it is reasonable that the principal claimant would have been advised at the time that providing documents to prove her and her children's citizenship in the People's Republic of China at the material time to be an important issue. However, the principal claimant only provided a Hukou, three birth certificates of the minor claimants and the death certificate of her late husband.\n[12] In light of the foregoing, it is reasonable to expect that the principal claimant would have made some serious efforts to obtain other documents to verify her and her children's citizenship in the People's Republic of China. At the commencement of the hearing, the principal claimant was asked by the panel member what efforts were made to obtain any other identity documents. The principal claimant indicated that she tried to obtain her Resident Identity Card. The principal claimant did not indicate that she tried to obtain any other identity documents. The principal claimant was asked if she tried to bring her driver's licence. She replied that her parents could not find it and when asked again, indicated that she never thought to bring it. She was asked if she tried to bring her marriage licence. She replied that she did not go back home, which fails to answer the question being asked. The principal claimant was asked if she asked her parents for any of the aforementioned documents, to which she replied in the affirmative. However, the panel member indicated that she had been asked earlier as to what identity documents did she try to obtain and that she had only indicated her Resident Identity Card to which the principal claimant stated that she did not ask her parents to send her marriage certificate. I reject this explanation as it fails to answer the question being asked. Therefore, the principal claimant has failed to provide any reasonable explanation as to why the aforementioned documents (marriage certificate, driver's licence) were not provided to the Board.\nThe absence of a Resident Identity Card\n[13] The most important document to establish the principal claimant's identity as a national of the People's Republic of China is the Resident Identity Card, as every Chinese citizen over the age of 16 must have one.6 The Resident Identity Card contains a number of security features, some of which are visible to the naked eye, some of which can be seen under ultraviolet light and some which can be tested forensically.\n[14] The principal claimant did not have an original or a photocopy of her Resident Identity Card (RIC). When asked as to why she did not have her RIC, the principal claimant indicated that the snakehead (smuggler) had it. The principal claimant stated that the smuggler provided her and her sons fake Hong Kong passports as well as accompanying her and her children to Canada. The principal claimant indicated that before leaving the People's Republic of China, she paid half of the money (XXXX XXXX XXXX RMB) required by the smuggler. Upon their arrival in Canada, the principal claimant indicated that the snakehead told his partner to attend at the principal claimant's parents' home to obtain the other half of the money (XXXX XXXX XXXX RMB) and to hand over the principal claimant's RIC. The principal claimant stated that her parents would know the partner as he had been the photographer who had taken the photos of the minor claimants. The principal claimant indicated that her parents paid the smuggler's partner the rest of the money owing but forgot to get her RIC.\n[15] The principal claimant stated that when she made a phone call to her parents to have them send her RIC to her in Canada, the parents then realized that they had forgotten to obtain her RIC. The principal claimant indicated that her parents as well as a friend tried to contact the smuggler but could not contact him by phone as his number was no longer valid and they could no longer contact him. When it was pointed out to the principal claimant that the sole purpose of the meeting between the parents and the partner of the smuggler was the exchange of money for her RIC and how could her parents possibly forget to obtain her RIC, the principal claimant stated that her parents were nervous and old. When asked as to the age of her parents, the principal claimant said 65. I reject these explanations as neither credible nor plausible since the sole purpose of the meeting was for the parents to pay the partner of the smuggler the rest of the money in assisting the principal claimant and her children to get to Canada and to obtain the principal claimant's RIC. Furthermore, for the parents to have forgotten to obtain the RIC and only realize that they had forgotten it when the principal claimant called them on the telephone to ask for her RIC is also neither credible nor plausible. The explanations provided are not reasonable: the parents had met the smugglers' partner previously when he had taken the photos of the minor claimants and thus knew him and thus should not have been nervous and to say that they forgot because were old at 65 (without any explanation as to their mental health) is also not reasonable. The burden is on the principal claimant to establish her identity and that of her sons. I draw a negative inference with respect of the lack of reasonable steps taken by the principal claimant to satisfy this burden as well as her failure to provide a reasonable explanation for this failure.\nIdentity Documents Proffered\n[16] I question the authenticity of the documents, being three birth certificates, a Hukou and a death certificate based on the availability of fraudulent documents throughout the People's Republic of China.7 Furthermore, the principal claimant indicated that she and her three sons travelled to Canada illegally using fraudulent Hong Kong passports, demonstrating that she has the means and the ability to acquire and a willingness to use fraudulent documents.\n[17] It should be noted that none of the identity documents proffered have photos on them and when asked, the principal claimant indicated that all the documents were genuine. Furthermore, all documents proffered were in pristine condition, indicating lack of use.\n[18] The panel member pointed out to the principal claimant that the birth certificate of the youngest son, issued in 2006, without having forensic testing, was fraudulent, as it failed to have the bar code embedded on it as required.8 When confronted with this information, the principal claimant indicated that all the birth certificates were genuine and provided by the hospital. I reject this explanation as the birth certificate of the youngest son is fraudulent. Therefore, I draw a severe negative inference as to the authenticity of the other birth certificates of the two older sons, as well as the Hukou and death certificate. The use of fraudulent Hukou documents remains common in China. Fake Hukou booklets and other identity documents can be purchased on the black market, and even semi-open market.9 There are no security features on the Hukou or the death certificate. Therefore, I find that the documents tendered by the principal claimant are not genuine documents and that the tendering of the known fraudulent birth certificate of the youngest son undermines the principal claimant's general credibility.\n[19] I note that the Federal Court has said that the Board is under no obligation to send a claimant's identity documents for forensic analysis.10 As a result, I give no weight to the identity documents proffered as one, none of the documents contain a photo of the principal claimant nor her children, two, the documents have little probative value since they lack all of the safety and standard features of a second generation RIC and third, at least one document, the youngest son's birth certificate could be determined to be fraudulent without any forensic analysis.\n[20] In summary, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant has failed to provide sufficient reliable documents and credible evidence to establish her identity or the identities of her three sons (the minor claimants) as nationals and citizens of the People's Republic of China as required under section 106 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and Rule 11 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules. The burden of establishing identity must be satisfied before a panel member goes on to consider the merits of the claim and whether the claimants, in this case face a serious possibility of being persecuted or are persons in need of protection. I therefore find, on a balance of probabilities, and on the basis of the totality of documentary evidence disclosed, and as well on the basis of findings and negative inferences noted, that the claimants are not citizens of the People's Republic of China.\nCONCLUSION\n[21] Since I cannot determine that the claimants are citizens of the People's Republic of China, I find that under sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, that there is no serious possibility that the claimants would be persecuted in the People's Republic of China, nor that they would be subjected, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, and there are no substantial grounds to believe that their removal would subject them personally to a danger of torture. I therefore determine that the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. The Refugee Protection Division therefore rejects their claims.\n(signed)\n\"Diane L.

The claimant is a citizen of Cuba and is claiming refugee protection pursuant to ss. 96 and 97 (1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] The panel finds the claimant is not a Convention refugee nor is she a person in need of protection. The determinative issue in this case is credibility.\nAllegations\n[3] Regarding the allegations these are noted in the claimant basis of claim form (BOC).1 The following is a summary.\n[4] The claimant is a 26 year old woman from XXXX XXXX, Cuba. In 2012 the claimant decided to travel to Ecuador with the intention of reaching Canada in order to live with her aunt and look for work. When the claimant travelled to Mexico she was detained and deported back to Cuba. When back in Cuba the harm and threats started. The claimant was told it would take her two years to get a new passport and 60 days to get a new ID card. The claimant felt she was punished for having been deported back to Cuba.\n[5] The claimant was not allowed to continue her studies at University. The authorities would terrorize the claimant with threats of further restrictions. This caused problems with her neighbors not speaking to her. The claimant suffered and was treated for depression.\n[6] In 2014 the claimant got her passport back and tried to get a visitor's visa for Canada but this was rejected. Her permission to travel request was denied. The claimant travelled to Ecuador trying again to come to Canada. The claimant was able to enter the United States and ended up living with her partner in Texas. Eventually the claimant became pregnant and longed for family support. As well the claimant feared being deported from the U.S. to Cuba. Eventually the claimant came to Canada and made a claim for protection.\n[7] In an amendment the claimant describes having her daughter born in Canada and that her partner, the baby's father was in Canada visiting from the U.S. for about 5 months. The claimant states she has broken up with her daughter's father and she thinks he is in jail now in Texas.\nIdentity\n[8] Regarding identity the claimant's identity was established by her testimony and by supporting documents filed such as her Birth Certificate.2 Upon entering Canada the claimant provided her U.S. employment authorization card and her Texas limited term identification card.3\nCredibility\n[9] The claimant entered the U.S. in XXXX 2014. As noted in the U.S. response the claimant was paroled in the U.S. under the Cuban Adjustment Act and was able to able apply for permanent residence in XXXX 2015.4 On XXXX XXXX, 2015 the claimant entered Canada and made a claim for protection. When asked why she would give up protection in the U.S. and take a chance that she might not be allowed to stay in Canada the claimant said she wanted to be near family as she was expecting a baby. Her partner was not physically fit to help her with a baby. The panel does not accept this explanation as reasonable. The claimant explained that she had met up with her partner before she left Cuba. She met up with him again in Texas and lived with her partner until she came to Canada and made a claim for protection. The claimant was not alone in the U.S. she had the support of her partner. Even if her partner was disabled, it is not reasonable in the panel's view that the claimant would give up protection in the U.S. and take the chance of coming to Canada and being removed back to Cuba. These actions are not consistent with a well-founded fear. These actions are not consistent with the prospect of returning to Cuba and facing serious harm. As such, the panel is drawing a negative inference regarding the claimant's credibility.\n[10] The claimant states that she was intimidated by Cuban authorities and they came to her house unexpectedly terrorized and threatened her. When asked the last time the authorities came to her house the claimant said it was in August 2014. However no dates regarding visits from the authorities are mentioned in the claimant's BOC. In response the claimant said she did mention dates. In the panel's view if the claimant was terrorized by Cuban authorities it is reasonable to expect that she would be able to provide the dates in her BOC such as when the threats and intimidation started. The BOC asks specifically for dates. The claimant is represented by counsel. In response the claimant said she did mention the dates. In the panel's view if the dates were mentioned these would have been noted in her BOC. The claimant omitting significant details from her BOC has led the panel to draw a negative inference regarding her credibility.\n[11] The claimant said she could not return to Cuba because she is in disagreement with the Cuban system however this is not mentioned in her BOC. The claimant could not provide a reasonable explanation as to why this was not mentioned in her BOC. In the panel's view if this were a significant issue in regards to her returning to Cuba it is reasonable to expect that it would be included in her BOC. The claimant omitting this information from her BOC has led the panel to draw a negative inference regarding the claimant's credibility.\n[12] The claimant said she was afraid that her daughter would suffer because of having a mother that was being targeted. Again this is not mentioned in her BOC. In the panel's view if this were of concern to the claimant it is reasonable to expect that this would be included in her BOC. The claimant is represented by counsel. As such the panel is drawing a negative inference regarding the claimant's credibility.\n[13] Given serious credibility concerns the panel finds the claimant was not threatened by Cuban authorities.\n[14] The panel accepts that the claimant has been outside of Cuba for longer than two years. As such, the panel has considered the claimant's profile as a Cuban citizen whom has not abided by Cuban law in regards to the length of time spent outside of Cuba. To be considered persecution, the mistreatment suffered or anticipated must be serious and the harm must occur with repetition or persistence in a systematic way.5 In this case the panel has considered the documentary evidence.\n[15] The panel acknowledges that Cuba is an authoritarian state where human rights abuses occur. Country documents specify that along with citizens being denied the ability to change their government, the government employs threats, extrajudicial physical assault, intimidation, violent government-organized counter-protests against peaceful dissent, and harassment and detentions (both short and long-term) to prevent free expression and peaceful assembly.6\n[16] The claimant may hold political views contrary to the state, by virtue of her life experiences, but the panel finds she would not be considered high profile enough to suffer harm amounting to persecution from the authorities in Cuba based on her views. The claimant confirmed that she does not belong to any political organization nor is she active in expressing her views publically. The claimant is not active on social media. There is no evidence before the panel to suggest that the claimant has expressed political views in the past, there is no evidence that the claimant belongs to any organizations political or otherwise and she has never engaged in any activities against the government, nor does she have a criminal record.\n[17] While the documentary evidence does reference the detention of political dissidents, these are persons who have a political profile. They are opposition activists and human rights defenders who are considered dissidents due to their active involvement in organizations, blogs or in the production of other materials critical of the government. This is not the case for the claimant.\n[18] In the Response to Information Request titled Treatment by authorities of failed asylum seekers that have returned to Cuba, including treatment of family members that remained in Cuba, the Director of the International Institute for the Study of Cuba (IISC), provided the following information:\nWhat happens to failed asylum seekers in Cuba after they return depends upon what they did before they left [Cuba]. If they were good citizens before they left, very little if anything is done to them. However, if for example the asylum seeker was wanted for a felony in Cuba before they left it is certain that they will be arrested and dealt with accordingly.\nUntil the change in the migration law recently, it became an offence if a Cuban remained outside the country for longer than 11 months without registering with the Consulate in the country they were residing in and obtaining permission to remain abroad. That in itself would result in a fine and a criminal record if they returned. Such people in effect lost their citizenship and their property was taken by the state in their absence. They would not get it back automatically if they did not return voluntarily ...\nThat has now stopped since the recent reforms ... In my experience, the Cuban government and authorities treat such people very leniently, especially if their previous record in Cuba has been a good one. 7\n[19] In this case the claimant has not established with sufficient credible evidence that she is or was of any concern to Cuban authorities. Counsel has provided an RIR dated from 2013 regarding failed asylum seekers. In this case the panel prefers the more recent information provided above in regards to failed asylum seekers and finds that the claimant has not established that there is more than a mere possibility of being persecuted for her profile as someone whom has remained outside of Cuba for a prolonged period of time.\n[20] Given serious credibility concerns the panel is giving little weight to the letters from the claimant's mother and neighbour. As well the mother and neighbour were not called as witnesses.\n[21] The claimant has provided a document in regards to her leave of absence cancellation.8 This is in support of the claimant allegation that she will not be able to study in Cuba. The panel is giving little weight to this document as it is undated and, other than the stamp, does not appear to have been issued on any University letterhead. As well, there is no information in the objective evidence which supports that persons deported back to Cuba are being denied their education. In the panel's view if this were happening in Cuba it is reasonable to expect that it would be reported somewhere in the media or in the human rights reports.\nCONCLUSION\n[22] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant has not established that there is a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, or that, on a balance of probabilities, he would personally be subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment upon return to Cuba. The claim is therefore rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Carol Ann Gibbs\"\nC. Gibbs\nNovember 17 2017\nDate\n1 Exhibit 2\n2 Exhibit 5\n3 Exhibit 1\n4 Exhibit 6\n5 Canada (Attorney General) v.

He eventually fled Colombia and made a refugee claim in Canada. After he fled, members of FARC started to appear and threaten the claimants at their residence in Guadalupe (the male claimant was residing in XXXX from XXXX 2016 to XXXX of 2017). The principal claimant, in search of security, moved to XXXX XXXX in XXXX of 2016. She was approached in XXXX XXXX on several occasions while residing in XXXX XXXX by members of FARC who were demanding she pay XXXX's debt. The female claimant, together with the minor claimants remained in XXXX until the end of the school year in XXXX of 2016 at which point they relocated to XXXX. The female claimant was approached and threatened on a number of occasions while in XXXX. After the principal claimant was approached for the final time in XXXX of 2017 in XXXX XXXX, the claimants were able to put together the money to leave and left Colombia on XXXX XXXX, 2017.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] Having considered the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimants are not Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 as they have not credibly established that they are at risk of a reasonable chance of persecution in Colombia. In addition they are not persons in need of protection under subsection 97(1) as they have not credibly established on a balance of probabilities, that their removal to Colombia would subject them personally to a risk to life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or to a danger of torture.\n[7] The determinative issue in these claims is credibility.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[8] The claimants' personal identities as nationals of Colombia are established on a balance of probabilities by their Colombian passports, copies of which are on file.4\nCredibility\n[9] A claimant's sworn testimony is presumed truthful unless there are valid reasons to doubt the veracity of their allegations.5 The panel is cognizant of the many difficulties faced by the claimants in establishing a claim, including nervousness, cultural factors, the setting of the hearing room and the use of interpreters.\nInitial contact with FARC members looking for XXXX\n[10] The principal claimant testified that after XXXX left, the claimants (with the exception of the male claimant) were residing together at the female claimant's farm in XXXX, Huila. She testified that starting around XXXX of 2016 she would often see people who she recognized as FARC members hanging around the farm, watching them. She was asked if any of the men spoke to her, or to anyone else living in the house before she moved to XXXX XXXX in XXXX of 2016 and she testified they did not. She said that when they would see the men they would try to hide from them out of fear. In the BOC the principal claimant states that after XXXX left members of the group would arrive frequently at the home to ask for her brother in a threatening way.\n[11] When confronted with the discrepancy the claimant said she had forgotten during her testimony that the men had asked questions about XXXX, at first she said she couldn't remember on how many occasions, then she testified that she was asked about XXXX on one occasion. The panel does not find the explanation for this discrepancy reasonable. The principal claimant indicated that it was as a result of these men asking about XXXX that she decided to move. The panel does not find it reasonable that such a significant incident as being specifically asked by someone about her brother XXXX would be overlooked when she was testifying about the incidents, and the incident had already been included in the BOC. While the panel recognizes that testifying at the hearing can be stressful, the claimant was directly asked whether she or her family had been spoken to and she replied distinctly in the negative.\n[12] The panel notes that there are three police reports6 about various threatening incidents that occurred to the claimants and none of the reports mention the family being approached or threatened between XXXX of 2016 and XXXX of 2016. The female claimant testified that she was first threatened by the group in XXXX of 2016 but that prior to that people would make inquiries about XXXX in an aggressive way, but she could not recall the first time someone asked her about XXXX.\n[13] Given the inconsistency between the principal claimant's testimony and the narrative and the lack of any supporting evidence the panel finds that the principal claimant's credibility is negatively affected and finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimants were not approached by members of FARC at their residence in XXXX before the principal claimant moved to XXXX XXXX.\nThreats in XXXX XXXX\n[14] The principal claimant testified that she had been threatened on several occasions by members of FARC while residing in XXXX XXXX. The first incident was in mid-September of 2016. Despite having been threatened the claimant brought the minor male claimant to reside with her in XXXX XXXXin XXXX of 2016. She testified that she moved to a different address in XXXX XXXXwhen he arrived and thought that moving to a new house would be sufficient precaution. She was, however, threatened once again on XXXX XXXX, 2017. After this occurred the female claimant came to XXXX XXXXand took the minor male claimant to reside in XXXX where the other claimants had relocated. Despite the new threats the principal claimant did not take any significant precautions to protect herself. She stayed at the same address, but tried to minimize how often she went out, including working from home as much as possible. She testified she spend some time in XXXX as well, only staying in XXXX XXXXwhen she needed to for work.\n[15] The principal claimant testified that she had to go to XXXX XXXX in April of 2017 and as she didn't want to be alone she had the female claimant and the minor male claimant accompany her to XXXX XXXX. She was asked if they had received any threats while they had been residing in XXXX and she said they had not. She was asked why she would want them to travel to XXXX XXXX if she had been previously threatened there, but her family had not been threatened in XXXX. She testified that she was feeling distraught and traumatized and she thought their presence in XXXX XXXX would serve as moral support for her.\n[16] The panel finds this behaviour is inconsistent and is not reasonable. She had sent the minor male claimant to a different city to be safe, but then decided to bring him back to the same city where she had been threatened on two occasions without taking any precautions, such as moving to a new residence. There is no indication that he was at risk while residing in XXXX and so the panel finds it contradictory behaviour for the principal claimant to send him away to keep him safe, only to bring him back and expose him to risk a few months later.\n[17] The panel finds that the claimant's inconsistent behaviour regarding her son negatively affects her credibility and in addition demonstrates a lack of subjective fear. If she was genuinely fearful for her safety the panel would not expect her to voluntarily expose other members of her family to risk.\n[18] The panel also notes the lack of evidence surrounding the alleged incident which occurred on XXXX XXXX, 2017. The panel recognizes the incident is described in the narrative and the details are consistent in the principal claimant's testimony. However, the principal claimant filed a police report in April of 20177 about another incident that occurred to her on April 7, 2017. In that police report she was asked whether she had previously been threatened and she indicated no. When asked why she had not disclosed the threats of January 2017 in the police report of April 2017 she said she did not because she was scared. This answer, however, did not seem consistent as she was reporting other threats that had occurred to her in April and so she was asked why she was afraid to report the January incident but not the April incident. She testified that she was afraid of filing the report and out of fear and nervousness she omitted the January incident. The panel again has difficulty accepting this explanation. She was asked by the officer \"if she had been the subject of any other threats by anyone\"8 and the answer recorded is no. The panel does not find it reasonable to believe that she could have forgotten all of the other threats she received when asked the direct question by the officer. There is no other corroborative evidence related to this incident.\n[19] The lack of any mention of this threat in any of the police reports undermines the claimant's credibility. Given the concerns about the evidence related to the XXXX XXXX, 2017 incident the panel finds that on a balance of probabilities that the claimant was not threatened by the FARC in January of 2017.\nPolice report filed by XXXX\n[20] The claimants have provided a police report that was filed on their behalf by the principal claimant's brother XXXX, who is a XXXX XXXX (and also a XXXX) on September 29, 2016.9 The principal claimant testified that she and the female claimant had related what had happened to them to XXXX towards the end of September 2016 and he filed a police report for them in the city he was residing in as they were afraid to file reports in their respective cities of XXXX and XXXX XXXX. The police report is vague and has few details regarding the threats they received and it does not include any dates.\n[21] The police report does reference an incident that occurred 'a few days ago' in which the principal claimant was threatened in XXXX XXXX. In the report it indicates that an individual approached her and threatened her. In her testimony and in the BOC the principal claimant described being approached in September of 2016 in XXXX XXXXby two men. She was asked if she had told her brother she was approached by two men and she said she had. She was also asked if she had seen the police report filed by her brother and she said she had. She was asked why the police report indicated that it was an individual, not two people who approached her. She said maybe it was a mistake but that she hadn't noticed the mistake until it was pointed out to her.\n[22] The panel does not find this explanation reasonable. The report is not lengthy, and the panel would expect that if she had reviewed the report she should have seen the error. This discrepancy, coupled with the fact that the police report is done through a third party and is lacking in detail leads the panel to place little weight on this document to support the alleged threats by members of FARC.\nIncident of August 2016\n[23] The female claimant also testified about the threats that she had received. The BOC indicates that on August 21, 2016, she and the minor female claimant were threatened by members of the FARC who asked about XXXX. The female claimant was asked to recount the first time she was personally threatened by the FARC and she said it was August 1, 2016. When asked to describe the incident she testified that she and the minor female claimant were on a motorcycle going home when two men on a motorbike approached them and asked about XXXX. Those details are consistent with the information about the August 21, 2016 incident in the BOC. The female claimant was asked how it was she remembered the date of the incident and she said she always had it in her mind. She was asked if there were any other incidents in August of 2016 and she said she couldn't remember.\n[24] The claimants have provided a police report in which the female claimant described to the police the incident as occurring on August 21, 2016 (there is an error on the English translation which lists the date as August 26, 2016, but the original Spanish version clearly indicates August 21, 2016).10 When the claimant was asked about the discrepancy in the dates she stated initially that she hadn't said August 1st, and then stated perhaps she hadn't understood, but the incident had actually occurred on the 21st. The panel does not accept the explanation for the discrepancy. The claimant initially provided the date of August 1, 2016, and was asked to confirm how she was able to recall the date. The panel would have expected that if there was any confusion about the date the female claimant would have identified it at that time, not when confronted with the discrepancy. The claimant, at other instances when she was unsure of dates, clearly indicated that, and had been instructed at the beginning of her testimony not to guess at the answers to the questions. As a result the panel finds that the discrepancy regarding the date of the incident in August 2016 undermines the female claimant's credibility.\nIncidents in September and October of 2016\n[25] The female claimant initially testified that she had been threatened by FARC members in August and on September 25 of 2016. The incident in September involved FARC members coming into her home, threatening her and her family and demanding she cook them a meal. When asked if she had reported both these incidents to the authorities the female claimant confirmed that she had. The police report from March 15, 2017 referenced the incident on August 21, 2016, and then describes another incident which occurred around October of 2016. There is no mention in the police report of any incident in September of 2016. The October incident describes how the female claimant had been confronted by four men who asked about XXXX when she had gone out of the house and was on the road near her house. When the female claimant was asked about this incident she said that this incident had indeed occurred in October and was separate from the September 25 event. She said the police told her just to report the first and last threats she received.\n[26] The panel then asked why the October incident had been omitted from the BOC as the BOC only indicates there were incidents in August and September. The female claimant said there were incidents were she had encounters with the group but that she hadn't told the principal claimant about. It was pointed out to her that her BOC says to refer to the principal claimant's narrative and she was asked why she had not ensured that all the encounters were recorded in the principal claimant's BOC. Her response was that maybe she was confused and she didn't realize that the other incidents should be included.\n[27] The panel does not accept the female claimant's explanations for the discrepancies and the omissions regarding the incidents that occurred in September and October of 2016. Her testimony regarding the incidents evolved when confronted with inconsistencies. For example, she testified she had told the police about the incident in September but when asked why the incident in September wasn't in the police report she said they told her only to list the first and last incidents. When she was then asked why she had not included the October incident in the BOC she then stated she was confused and didn't realize she needed to make sure it was included. Her explanation for not including the October incident is also deficient in that she provided a police report that describes the incident and therefore it is a significant omission and the panel would have expected that the BOC would be amended to include the event given it was described in the police report that was received by the IRB on July 10, 2017. The panel notes there were amendments made to the BOC on July 3, 2017, well after the initial BOC was signed and therefore the claimants were clearly aware that amendments could be made to the BOC. Therefore, the omission of the October incident significantly undermines the female claimant's testimony.\n[28] As a result of the inconsistencies regarding the incidents described in the police reports the panel places little weight on the police report filed by the female claimant on March 15, 2017.\nStaying with XXXX\n[29] The female claimant testified that after she was threatened in September of 2016 she stayed with friends, including one friend in particular, XXXX. She was asked when she stayed with XXXX and she said she couldn't remember. She was then asked if it was after the incidents in August and September and she said yes. She was asked if she had ever stayed with him before the incident in August and she initially testified no. In reviewing the sworn statement provided by XXXX11 the panel notes that he stated she stayed with him in May and June of 2016. Further in the testimony the female claimant was asked how she got the statement from XXXX and if she had read it or seen any mistakes in it. She said she had not seen any mistakes in the document. The panel then asked her to confirm her earlier testimony, that she had stayed with him after the incident in August of 2016 and at that point the claimant changed her testimony saying she had forgotten, but it was before that she had stayed with XXXX, that she was getting mixed up. She then indicated that it was sometime between May and July of 2016 that she had stayed with XXXX.\n[30] While the subsequent testimony is consistent with the statement provided by XXXX the panel finds her inconsistent testimony regarding when she stayed with XXXX undermines her credibility. She had initially indicated she was not sure of the dates, but when asked to recall if it was before or after certain incidents she was able to recall that it was after she was threatened in person in August or September of 2016. She did not indicate during her initial testimony any confusion about whether it was before or after those incidents, she answered she had not stayed with him before August of 2016. It was only when the panel raised the possibility of mistakes in the affidavit that she changed her testimony. She again said she couldn't remember when she had stayed with XXXX, but did provide a different timeframe, this time a range from May to July of 2016.\nSupporting Documents\n[31] In support of their claim the claimants have provided a number of documents, including police reports filed by the principal claimant and the female claimant. Those police reports have been discussed above and the panel places little weight on them for the reasons listed above.\n[32] The claimants have also provided a number of sworn statements from friends and family to support their allegations that they are being threatened in Colombia. The affidavits do not describe any of the incidents where the claimants were allegedly confronted by members of FARC, they speak in generalities, indicating that the claimants were being persecuted by criminals or being harassed by criminals who wanted money and information. Some of those who provided affidavits offered residence to some of the claimants during the period in question, but none of them were witnesses to any of the threats. The information about the threats in the statements was provided to those swearing the statements by the claimants and the panel has found the claimants to be lacking in credibility. As a result, the panel finds that the sworn statements provide little corroborative evidence of the alleged threats by FARC and the panel places little weight on them.\n[33] The claimants have also provided the BOC and the decision and reasons for the claim of the principal claimant's brother XXXX. The panel has reviewed that decision but notes that it is settled law that refugee claims are to be considered on their own merits and the fact that a family member is granted refugee status based on a similar experience is not binding on the RPD as it must assess each claim individually.12\nCONCLUSION\n[34] Based on the totality of the evidence the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimants have not been targeted by, and are not being pursued by the FARC as alleged.\n[35] The panel finds that the claimants would not face a serious possibility of persecution in Colombia nor would they, on a balance of probabilities, be subjected personally to a risk to their lives, or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or to a danger of torture.\n[36] Their claims are therefore rejected.\n(signed)\n\"M.

Mr. and Mrs. XXXX and their counsel acknowledge that the minor claimant, XXXX, is also a citizen of the United States of America (U.S.A.) as she was born there, as indicated also in her certificate of birth and U.S.A. passport.2\n[3] The claims were heard together in accordance with RPD Rule 55 and Mrs. XXXX was designated by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) as the representative for the minor claimants.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] All of the claims rely on the core allegation that Mr. XXXX family tribe has demanded, in accordance with tribal traditions, that the minor claimant XXXX be circumcised - essentially that she be the victim of female genital mutilation (FGM), a harm that amounts to persecution.\n[5] Having consistently refused to submit their daughter to undergo FGM, Mr. and Mrs. XXXX have been threatened with death, as have the minor claimants. They fear that the tribe will persist to carry out this threat against all of them. Mr. XXXXtribe considers that the failure to have carried out the FGM of the minor claimant, has brought tragedy upon tribe members, who have suffered from mysterious illnesses and fates including death. The refusal has also been blamed as the cause for Mr. XXXXown illness, diagnosed in the U.S.A. as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[6] Following consultation with an oracle, Mrs. XXXXwas also accused of being a witch whose refusal to permit the FGM of her daughter was her ruse of avoiding contact with her husband's family so that her nature as a witch would not be discovered. The accusation of her being a witch reinforces the risk of death for Mrs. XXXXas well as for her family, not only from Mr. XXXXfamily, but also, from community members who would pursue \"jungle justice\" against them by taking matters into their own hands.\n[7] Further details are provided in the claimants' respective Basis of Claim (BOC) Forms,3 as amended4 and the panel will reference further testimony and documentary evidence as relevant to the analysis.\nDETERMINATION\n[8] As indicated at the hearing, the claimants have established their personal identities as nationals of Nigeria and, in the case of the minor claimant XXXX, as a national of the U.S.A. on a balance of probabilities, with sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence. They disclosed their passports5 to the claim intake office and the birth certificate of the minor claimant XXXX, showing her to have been born in the U.S.A.\n[9] In regard to the minor claimant XXXX, the determinative issue is that she has not demonstrated that she is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection in regard to all of her countries of nationality, including the U.S.A.\n[10] In regard to the claims respecting Nigeria, which therefore also includes the claim of the minor claimant XXXX as she is a national of that country also, the determinative issue is credibility.\n[11] The claimants have not established with sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence on a balance of probabilities the core of their shared basis of claim, that is, that Mr. XXXXfamily tribe has demanded that the minor claimant XXXXundergo FGM. From that allegation others flow, including that the adult claimants have refused this demand, as a result of which all of the claimants now face death were they to return to Nigeria. The panel finds that such allegations also are not credible, on a balance of probabilities.\n[12] The claimants therefore have not established that they are at risk of a reasonable chance of persecution in Nigeria, or, that their removal to Nigeria would subject them personally to a risk to life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or to a danger of torture.\nANALYSIS - Introduction\n[13] Evidence that is given under oath or affirmation is presumed to be true unless there is valid reason to find otherwise.6\n[14] The panel heard the claims together but has assessed each claim on in its own merits in the context of all of the evidence and submissions adduced for both.\n[15] The panel is also cognizant that many variables may impede the ability to establish a claim, such as: the very nature of the basis of claim; cultural, social, linguistic, educational, medical, psychological, economic, and other factors; and, the formalities of the claim and hearing process.\n[16] The panel was therefore also mindful of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada's Chairperson's Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.7 The Guideline provides insight into the impediments women who fear gender-related persecution may face in endeavouring to demonstrate the credibility and trustworthiness of their claims. The Guideline also provides an approach towards the assessment of such claims with such impediments in mind. The Guideline is helpful in the assessment of the Convention grounds and what may constitute gender-related persecution.\n[17] Keeping the Guideline in mind, the panel was sensitive to the nature of the questions posed, focusing on related information and events rather than on questions directly related to FGM such as a description of what this involves, as the panel accepts that FGM constitutes persecution.\n[18] Material credibility concerns arose which the claimants did not satisfactorily resolve, from which the panel finds that their core allegation and related allegations are not credible, on a balance of probabilities.\nANALYSIS - The minor claimant XXXX and the U.S.A.\n[19] As a national of Nigeria and the U.S.A., for the claim of the minor claimant, XXXX, to be allowed, it must be demonstrated that she satisfies either the definition of a Convention refugee as set out in s. 96 of the IRPA or the definition of a person in need of protection as set out in s. 97(1) in regard to both of her countries of nationality. Neither definition is satisfied in regard to the U.S.A., for the following reasons.\n[20] No allegation is made in any of the BOC Forms on behalf of this minor claimant that she fears persecution as set out in section 96 of the IRPA or a harm of the nature as set out in s. 97(1) of the IRPA, in the U.S.A. The BOC Forms all focus on claims made respecting Nigeria.\n[21] The panel considered the adult claimants' testimony, as alleged initially by Mrs. XXXX, that the minor claimant XXXXfaces a risk to her life also in the U.S.A. because Mr. XXXXhas three cousins who reside there: XXXX, who is married to a U.S.A. citizen and resides in Texas; XXXX, a student who resides in Connecticut; and, XXXX, a student who resides in New York.\n[22] The panel finds the allegation is not credible, on a balance of probabilities. As noted, no allegation of a fear of this minor claimant's return to the U.S.A. was made in any of the BOC Forms despite that amendments were made to same.\n[23] Furthermore, such cousins of Mr. XXXXare not referenced in the account as examples of some of his family members who are feared. Mrs. XXXXoral allegation of such persons being a cause for fearing the safety of her daughter was vague and speculative in nature. When the panel asked Mr. XXXXif he had any relevant information to add to his wife's account, he said he did not. It is reasonable to expect, that, if there were such information, he would have indicated so, since they are his family members and he said that he has been in contact with them in the past by telephone.\n[24] Finally, as conceded on behalf of the claimants, counsel submitted that adequate state protection would be available to the minor claimant in the U.S.A.\n[25] Since the minor claimant, XXXX is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection in respect of her country of nationality of the U.S.A., her claim for refugee protection must be dismissed.\nANALYSIS - The claimants' account respecting Nigeria\nThe vagueness in the written and oral accounts regarding the agent of persecution\n[26] The original narrative account,8 written in the voice of Mrs. XXXX, indicates the agents of persecution as: \"my husband's relatives;\" \"his relatives;\" \"my in-laws,\" in regard to referencing that her brother \"received a call from my in-laws saying they found out that our children were with him, accusing [...] and threatening [...];\" her \"husband's cousin's (XXXX XXXX), in the context of that cousin's friend having revealed that the minor claimants were in hiding at the home of her brother; and, \"the family\" in the context of her husband's family have consulted with an oracle. In Questions 2(a) and 2(b) of the BOC Form the agents are noted as: \"my spouse family memebers [sic]\" and \"my spouse's family,\" respectively.\n[27] Notwithstanding instructions in the BOC Form to indicate names wherever possible, the BOC Form is deficient in specifying who from among Mr. XXXXfamily they fear. The references to his \"family\" and \"relatives\" is broad and vague. The reference to his \"in-laws\" who placed the threatening telephone call to Mrs. XXXXbrother is similarly broad and vague, as it is unclear whether this means only Mr. XXXXparents and\/or his siblings.\n[28] It is reasonable to expect, as the adult claimants were evidently in contact with Mrs. XXXXbrother, that it would be noted, if not by name, then at least by the relationship (father, mother, sister, brother) who it is that telephoned her brother.\n[29] The broad and vague reference to Mr. XXXX\"relatives\" is similarly made in the context of the allegation that they \"descended on us, beat us up and damaged our Nissan Xterra vehicle, and left threatening that they would be back for our daughter.\"9 Having alleged such a direct experience as a beating, it is reasonable to expect that the adult claimants would identify, in accordance with the BOC Form instructions, the names of who beat them, or, at the very least, which relatives of Mr. XXXX(parents, siblings, uncles, cousin, etc.) did so.\n[30] Similarly vague assertions are made elsewhere regarding Mr. XXXX\"family,\" for example, that his family consulted an oracle and that \"they\" also said that Mrs. XXXX\"must swear to an oath that [she] is not a witch.\"10\n[31] Such vagueness is not addressed in the \"Additional Narrative,\"11 which also references in Mrs. XXXXvoice \"my husband's family.\" In Mr. XXXXvoice, the additional narrative does mention certain family members, when recounting an experience where his uncles \"XXXXand XXXX\" dragged him out of his parents' house after his uncle XXXXslapped him and took him to his \"eldest uncle's\" house where he was kept locked up for 2 days. He also references his uncle XXXXas having made efforts to look for him. An account of a \"final decision to kill [him] and [his] family\" references without further clarity that it was made by \"the elders of [his] family.\" In the summary, he makes reference to \"my extended family members\" and \"my relatives.\"\n[32] Clarity was therefore sought through oral testimony. When asked who he fears in Nigeria, Mr. XXXXreplied that he fears his whole clan who belong to the XXXXlineage that has its origin with his great, great grandparents. When asked to be more specific, he responded that he fears his relatives, namely, his uncle XXXX who slapped him, and also other relatives, but he does not know all of their names. He confirmed that he fears, in addition to his uncle XXXX, his whole clan.\n[33] When asked whether he knows the names of any other of his clan members, he mentioned: XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. At this point, the panel intervened to ask how many persons from his clan he fears. The claimant responded that his clan consists of about 400 persons, as his family is large. The panel asked how he would know that all of his clan members are against him, to which he responded that that his brother XXXXinformed him that the claimant (and his family) were reported to the clan (about the refusal to have his daughter undergo FGM). When asked where the 400 members of his clan are located, he stated that they are all over Nigeria. When advised by the panel, with that being the case, that the panel is not following his response how it is that he would know that all 400 clan members are against him, he replied that his immediate relatives, including his grandfather, reported what had happened to the clan.\n[34] The panel finds that Mr. XXXXoral account about who he fears was equally vague as his written account, not only in terms of identifying any specific persons, but also, how the history of his and his wife's refusal that their daughter undergo FGM was reported to the clan, such that the whole of the clan, dispersed throughout the country, would be aware of what had happened and would be against them, such that, as asserted in the narrative account, as amended, there would be nowhere in Nigeria to where they could flee.\n[35] Also, having alleged in oral testimony that he fears his whole clan, he provided a vague and inconsistent account in follow-up to clarify. The panel asked whether he fears his parents, to which he replied to the effect of: not really, as they have no say in the matter and are helpless. When the question was repeated, given his answer of \"not really,\" whether he fears his parents, he was similarly equivocal, replying that he would say that he fears them. His vague testimony about whether he fears his parents undermines the credibility of his allegation of fearing his whole clan and the credibility of the account of who the agents of persecution are and what they are alleged to have done.\n[36] The panel tried to elicit further clarification by asking whether he fears his sisters, to which he responded that he does because they support that his daughter be circumcised. When asked whether he fears his two brothers, he responded that he trusts his brother XXXX, but not his brother XXXX. Again, such testimony undermines the allegation that the claimants fear his whole clan.\n[37] In additional follow-up, Mr. XXXXtestified that he also fears his aunt, who again is not mentioned in the narrative account but who in oral testimony was alleged to be the person from whom Mrs. XXXXlearned that her daughter would have to undergo FGM.\n[38] Mrs. XXXXwhen asked about more detail as to who she fears confirmed her husband's testimony but added that she also fears his uncle XXXXand his parents, the latter who pass information along to all of the members of his family.\n[39] Neither adult claimant made reference to fearing \"XXXX,\" who Mr. XXXXalleged in later testimony, when specifically asked by the panel who has the most seniority in his clan, that such person is XXXXand that it is he who determined that they be killed. As discussed earlier, the BOC Forms as amended are largely vague about the alleged agents of persecution and therefore do not mention this person.\n[40] Furthermore, the claimants could not reasonably explain why they had not mentioned in the narrative accounts, as amended, apart from Mr. XXXXtwo uncles and a cousin, the names of specific persons in the clan they fear. Their explanation is that they did not know that they were required to do so and they mentioned the names that they did due to the significance of such persons to the incidents being described.\n[41] The panel finds neither explanation to be credible, on a balance of probabilities. The claimants are fluent in English and are educated. The BOC Form contains instructions in Question 2 (a) to indicate by name wherever possible who the claimants think caused the harm or mistreatment or threats. A corresponding instruction sheet that remained attached to the BOC Forms that were produced to the RPD states to: \"Make sure that you understand the instructions and the questions, before you write your answers. If you do not understand a question, ask someone to explain it to you.\"12\n[42] Furthermore, if the panel is to accept the explanation that names were given wherever relevant, then it is not credible that the aunt would not have been referenced in the narrative at all, whether by name or relationship, as the person who had allegedly informed Mrs. XXXXof such a horrific matter as her daughter needing to undergo FGM in accordance with her husband's tribe's custom. Nor is it credible that the clan member who ordered that the family be killed, that is, the most senior clansman \"XXXX,\" would not be mentioned. Nor is it credible that the persons who beat up Mr. and Mrs. XXXXwould not be mentioned, and likewise the identity of the caller(s) in regard to the significant telephone call that is discussed.\nMr. XXXXdid not know the name of Mrs. XXXXclan\n[43] The claimants alleged in their amended narrative that Mrs. XXXXsought \"the help and intervention of [her] other extended family members of the XXXXfamily of XXXXto which [she] belong[s].\"13 However, such persons declined to assist, because \"intervening in the matter could lead to inter-tribal disputes.\"14\n[44] After responding to the panel's question about what his own clan is - the XXXXclan - Mr. XXXXtestified when asked that his wife's clan is the XXXXand that as far as he was aware there was no sub-clan or another name for his wife's clan.\n[45] Mrs. XXXXtestified that her clan is XXXX. When asked why her husband testified that it is XXXX, she testified that XXXXis her maiden name. When asked why he had given his wife's maiden name as her clan, Mr. XXXXsaid that he had prefaced his earlier answer by saying that he was not sure of her clan's name.\n[46] The panel finds that the explanation is not credible. While to the panel's knowledge there was no such preface to his response, either way, Mr. XXXXhas stated by way of his explanation that he does not know his wife's clan's name. The panel finds that it is not credible that Mr. XXXXwould not know his wife's clan's name considering that: his wife sought the intervention of her clan; Mr. XXXXwould be aware of such an allegation as it is part of the amended, shared narrative; and, Mrs. XXXX alleged that her brother is the king of her clan. In the context of such circumstances, it is not credible that the name of his wife's alleged clan would be unknown to him. The panel also notes that the claimants have indicated that they have been married since 2009 and have therefore been together for about an eight year period within in which it is reasonable to expect that his wife's clan's name would have come to his attention.\nMrs. XXXXvisit to the U.S.A. in XXXX 2017\n[47] The panel finds that Mrs. XXXXvisit to the U.S.A. in XXXX 2017 further demonstrates that the account of her daughter having been targeted for FGM and events arising therefrom is not credible, on a balance of probabilities. She made the trip alone, without any of the other claimants, and, in particular, her daughter, in the midst of events that were happening as a result of the refusal to submit her daughter for FGM.\n[48] Mrs. XXXXexplained that she went to the U.S.A. to assist her sister with her newborn baby and intended to return to Nigeria in two weeks' time. She said that she could not have foreseen that within a few days of her arrival in the U.S.A. her husband's father would suddenly become ill and his clan would threaten to imminently kill them. She explained also that she and her siblings have an obligation to help one another as their parents are deceased.\n[49] The panel finds that the explanation is not credible. As at the time of her departure in XXXX 2017 to the U.S.A.: her husband's clan had been insisting for six years that their daughter be circumcised; numerous calamities had befallen her husband's clan for which their refusal to submit their daughter to undergo FGM was blamed; they had previously fled Lagos for one week upon learning that clan members were planning to come to their home, in context, to take their daughter; after their return to their home from being in hiding, clan members found them and beat them, also damaging their car and threatening to return for their daughter; police had advised them that they could not be of any assistance; when she and her husband went to the U.S.A. previously in November 2015 for medical treatment for her husband, his clan had discovered their children's hiding place with her brother and had threatened him; the family relocated after their return to Nigeria and their whereabouts were again discovered by her husband's clan; in early 2017, her husband's clan learned from an oracle that she is a witch and demanded that she swear an oath to the contrary; her husband's clan at that time demanded also that her husband and son undergo a \"blood ritual to cleanse his lineage\" and that her daughter undergo FGM; and, in June 2017 her husband was slapped by his uncle XXXXand forcibly confined by him and his uncle XXXXfor a period of two days and forced to undergo a blood ritual.\n[50] According to the totality of the account, the claimants' circumstances at the time of Mrs. XXXXtrip to the U.S.A. were serious, involving: threats of FGM, kidnapping, blood rituals, and witchcraft; property damage; beatings; the ability to locate the children's whereabouts and the family's new location thereafter; and, threats to the children's caregiver, Mrs. XXXXbrother. In such context, it is not credible that Mrs. XXXXfocus would be to provide care to her sister in the U.S.A., leaving her own children in the care of her husband, who though loves them, belongs to a clan that is after them. According to the totality of the written account, she left her children and her husband without having them securely in hiding at the time of her departure, but instead, residing in their own home (until the alleged additional threat, at which time they relocated to the house of her husband's friend \"XXXX XXXX\"). On a balance of probabilities, the travel to the U.S.A. demonstrates that none of such alleged incidents had occurred and therefore the credibility of the core allegation relating to FGM is materially undermined.\nLack of credibility of the allegation that Mr. XXXXquit his work with XXXX\n[51] The claimants allege that Mr. XXXXquit his work with XXXX. This allegation is material to the core account, because the claimants allege that Mr. XXXXhad to quit his job due to having received the imminent threat of death in XXXX 2017, while his wife was in the U.S.A. helping her sister with her newborn baby. The claimants alleged that on XXXX XXXX, he received the telephone call from his brother XXXXinforming him of their father's sudden illness and the imminent threat of death that would be carried out by the clan. On XXXX XXXX, Mr. XXXXtelephoned XXXX's human resources to inform them he was quitting because he would no longer be able to come to work because his life was at risk.\n[52] The panel finds that the allegation of Mr. XXXX having quit his job is not credible, on a balance of probabilities, and therefore, the associated allegation of an imminent threat of death that was given as his reason for doing so, is not credible.\n[53] According to the employment history in the original Schedule A Form15 provided by Mr. XXXX when he made his claim in Canada, his work with XXXX is marked as \"ongoing.\" His amended Schedule A Form cites that his work with XXXX finished in XXXX 2017.16 When asked for an explanation, Mr. XXXXsaid that the information in his original form was a mistake.\n[54] The panel does not find the explanation to be credible. The mistake was not supported by any document from XXXX to show that Mr. XXXXno longer works there.\n[55] Furthermore, Mr. XXXXexplanation for the lack of any such document further demonstrates the lack of credibility of his allegation to have quit working there due to threats received to his life. Mr. XXXXexplained that he tried to reach XXXX human resources (HR) for such purpose later in XXXX 2017, but the person in question with whom he would need to speak was on vacation. According to his account, he had called HR because he had been instructed to confirm in writing that he has quit his job. He said he did not make any attempts thereafter to reach HR about confirming in writing that he has quit as he was focusing on the safety of his family.\n[56] The panel finds that the explanation is not credible, on a balance of probabilities. It is not credible that since XXXX 2017 Mr. XXXXwould not have provided his workplace with confirmation in writing that he has quit and that he would make no further attempt to do so or to obtain a confirmation of his job status. In this regard, the panel notes that Mr. XXXXdid not enter the U.S.A. until XXXX XXXX, 2017, affording him almost one month within which to finalize his job status in writing while still in Nigeria. He would have also had approximately two months within which to do so either from the U.S.A. or Canada.\nNo report made to U.S.A. authorities of the threat to the minor claimant XXXX\n[57] Mr. and Mrs. XXXX testified that they did not make any report to the U.S.A. Embassy in Nigeria of the threat of FGM made against their daughter. They said it had not come to mind. On the totality of the account, they had also not reported the threat to police in the U.S.A.\n[58] The panel finds that their failure to do so is material, not to the assessment of state protection, but to credibility. In this regard, the panel appreciates that the U.S.A. Embassy is not an arm of the Nigerian state and therefore is not a body that can provide state protection in the immigration context when analyzing the application of sections 96 and 97(1) of the IRPA to the claims.\n[59] The panel finds however, that the allegation that it would not have come to mind to even consider approaching the U.S.A. Embassy, in the context of their American citizen daughter being the originating focus of the basis of the claims, reflects with the other credibility issues discussed that the core of the account is not credible. It is reasonable to expect that as parents they would have at least considered approaching the U.S.A. Embassy in regard to how they could assist in protecting their daughter in the U.S.A., what measures could be taken on her behalf in the interim, and, what option could be extended to her family to accompany her to the U.S.A. It is even more incongruous with the allegations that police in the U.S.A. were not alerted to her circumstances, especially given the allegations that were made of fearing family members of Mr. XXXX who are in the U.S.A.\nNo claims for asylum were made in the U.S.A.\n[60] According to the biometrics reports received from the U.S.A., Mrs. XXXXhas visited the U.S.A. on the following occasions: XXXX XXXX, 2008; XXXX XXXX, 2010; XXXX XXXX, 2015; and, XXXX XXXX, 2017.17 Mr. XXXXvisited the U.S.A. on: XXXX XXXX, 2011; XXXX XXXX, 2014; XXXX XXXX, 2014, XXXX XXXX, 2015; XXXX XXXX, 2016; XXXX XXXX, 2016; and XXXX XXXX, 2017.18\n[61] According to Mrs. XXXX testimony, her visits to the U.S.A. were for the following reasons: in 2008, while still single, to visit her sister; in 2010, for the purpose of giving birth to her daughter - she said there were complications respecting her son's birth in Nigeria and so she and her husband decided that it would be better for their daughter to be born in the U.S.A. where there is better medical care; in 2015, for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment for her husband; and, in 2017, to help her sister with her newborn baby.\n[62] Mr. XXXX testified that his visits to the U.S.A. were for the following purposes: 2011, for the birth of his daughter; 2014, 2015, and 2016 for medical care; and, 2017 due to the imminent threat of death from his clan.\n[63] The panel has earlier set out the developments that have been alleged to have occurred since 2011 when Mrs. XXXXfirst learned of the alleged rite of FGM that her daughter is expected to undergo. The panel finds that it is not credible that the adult claimants would not have made claims in the U.S.A. for asylum, if not earlier when they were both in the U.S.A. in 2015 and Mr. XXXXtwice thereafter in 2016, then, at the very least, in 2017.\n[64] The panel finds that the failure to make claims for asylum shows a lack of subjective fear of persecution, insofar as section 96 of the IRPA is concerned, and, in regard to both section 96 and section 97(1) of the IRPA, that the events as alleged, all of which go to the core of the claims, did not likely occur.\n[65] With regard to their time in the U.S.A. in 2015 and 2016, Mrs. XXXXexplained that she was focused on the health of her husband and therefore did not make any claim for asylum. Mr. XXXXconfirmed his wife's response and added that there were not yet any threats to anyone's life. On the totality of their accounts, therefore, no effort was made to enquire about the prospect of making asylum claims.\n[66] The panel finds such conduct to be materially inconsistent with the repeated threat since 2011 of the intended FGM of their daughter, which indeed is a threat to life. Furthermore, Mrs. XXXXwas in the U.S.A. for at least an XXXX month period at the time, arriving in XXXX, 2016, and was still in the U.S.A. when the telephone call came from her brother in XXXX 2016 that their children's hiding place had been discovered.\n[67] As well, no claims were made for asylum in 2017, after Mr. XXXXand the minor claimants joined Mrs. XXXXin the U.S.A. in August. The claimants explained that they were without money and it would have been too costly to make their claims in the U.S.A. They therefore came to Canada to do so.\n[68] The panel finds that the explanation is not credible. The panel acknowledges that there was no material delay in leaving the U.S.A. to make their claims in Canada. However, the explanation for not having made their claims in the U.S.A., where they have strong ties, is not credible and undermines the credibility of their account of a need for seeking protection.\n[69] The U.S.A. is where their daughter was born and where Mr. XXXX received treatment for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of a quality that, following his last treatment in XXXX 2017, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX according to his oral testimony (no medical documents were provided). Furthermore, Mrs. XXXXsister lives in the U.S.A. and on the totality of the account, the claimants stayed with her during visits. Within this context, the claimants did not provide a letter from the lawyer they said had advised them that it would cost $10,000.00 U.S.A. to make their claims. What they did provide is a letter confirming a consultation and a related $100 fee, but for a matter that is not identified in term of whether it is an immigration matter or an asylum matter.19 The claimants explained that they did not ask the lawyer for a more specific letter. More importantly, they did not consult with any other immigration professional and they undertook no on-line research of whether there are organizations that assist persons whose financial means are limited to make their claims. They did not do so despite alleging that they did an on-line search of how to make claims in Canada. They also did not ask Mrs. XXXXsister for assistance to carry out on-line research, explaining that she had already advised them that she knows of no-one who can assist. The explanation is not credible, as it is circular - she may not know anyone, but there is on-line means by which to conduct such an inquiry.\nPersonal disclosures\n[70] The panel has found that the credibility issues that have been discussed but which were not satisfactorily resolved by the claimants show that the shared basis of their claims is not credible on a balance of probabilities. This finding also materially undermines the reliability of their personal documentary disclosures made in support of the basis of their claims. The panel also provides additional analysis respecting some of the personal disclosures which shows that they are unreliable insofar as purporting to support the core of the claims.\nThe report of Dr. XXXX\n[71] The panel has considered the report of Dr. XXXX, dated XXXX XXXX, 2017,20 who has diagnosed the claimants with XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXand who reports that there may be \"difficulties in providing clear and consistent testimony\" and that if difficulties occur, then \"they likely reflect the disorganizing effects of XXXX XXXX rather than an attempt to evade or to obfuscate.\"\n[72] The panel kept in mind Dr. XXXXdiagnoses and gave the claimants breaks whenever needed. One such break occurred near the conclusion of testimony at which time Mrs. XXXXbegan to sob and shake. The panel remained in the room as did counsel to see whether further assistance may be needed. In this regard, the panel offered to call emergency services but was advised by Mrs. XXXXthat same would not be needed (to the panel's recollection, this exchange would likely be off record). The panel and counsel escorted Mrs. XXXXand her husband to the reception area and the panel requested security to keep watch for any further assistance as may be needed. The hearing resumed to its conclusion following Mrs. XXXXconfirmation, after her and her husband's return from the break, that she was able to proceed (as was also her husband).\n[73] The panel therefore observed first-hand the stress that the claimants were under. While the panel does not question Dr. XXXXprofessional diagnosis of XXXX XXXX XXXX, the panel notes that neither of the claimants made Dr. XXXXaware of Mr. XXXX's diagnosis of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and that he had been receiving treatment in the U.S.A. for same as recently as XXXX 2017. Mr. XXXXalso testified that he had had XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Furthermore, at the time of his interview with Dr. XXXX, although he had been seen by a family doctor as required by the immigration intake process, an appointment with a special and XXXX XXXX to confirm his current health status with regard to XXXX XXXX since his last news in the U.S.A. in XXXX 2017, remained pending.\n[74] The claimants explained that they were not asked about their medical histories and therefore (through no fault of their own), also made no mention of same. The panel therefore finds that the reliability of the report is undermined and does not reflect as stated therein that: \"[e]ach assessment [was] prepared after a careful and detailed investigation of psychological, social, and occupational functioning and has been tailored to provide a comprehensive, differentiated, and personalized evaluation of the individual.\" The panel is therefore unable to agree with the stated opinion that credibility concerns would not likely be due to an attempt to evade or obfuscate, considering also that the panel has had the benefit of hearing the totality of the claims with consideration also to documentary disclosures.\nLetters from XXXX XXXX,21 XXXX XXXX,22 XXXX XXXX,23 XXXX XXXX24\n[75] The panel observes that the aforementioned supporting letters are equally vague in terms of the agents of persecution despite alleging to be from persons closely associated to Mr. XXXX: the letter from his friend, to whose house he and his children went to hide (\"...threats by his relatives...\"); the letter from his brother (\"our whole family\"; \"our relatives decided in a meeting in which I was present\"; \"the elders of the family\"; \"Those extended family members sent to kill my brother and his family, went to my brother's house in Lagos...\"; \"They then called me to ask if I knew of their whereabouts...\"; \"...our relatives are now in a very desperate situation [to kill the claimants].\"\n[76] Likewise, the letter from Mrs. XXXXsister, who claims to be \"well-informed,\" references the agents vaguely: \"her in-laws presented as very superstitious people\"; \"this seemed to enrage the visiting relatives\"; \"the family members\"; \"[Mr. XXXX] extended family\"; \"her husband's relatives.\"\n[77] The letter from Mrs. XXXX brother is also vague: \"her husband's relatives\"; \"her husband's family.\"\nOther personal disclosures\n[78] Other personal disclosures do not relate to the determinative issue of the basis of the claims, but instead to the matter of the claimants' personal identities as nationals of Nigeria and, in the case of the minor claimant XXXX, as a national also of the U.S.A.\nCONCLUSION\n[79] For the reasons provided, after considering all of the evidence and submissions, the panel finds that the claimants have not demonstrated that there is a serious possibility of their persecution or that they would be subjected personally, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture, were they to return to Nigeria. In the case of the minor claimant XXXX, she has not demonstrated so also in regard to the U.S.A. Accordingly, the claimants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.\n[80] The claims are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"T. Maziarz\"\nT.

That was when a friend suggested that having faith in God and Jesus Christ would help him deal with the unhappy family life at home and a lack of satisfaction at work. The claimant's friend told him that by shouting out to God he would receive help, and invited him to join an illegal house church, reassuring the claimant that its members took safety precautions not to be discovered by the authorities. The claimant joined the church group the following month and attended regularly until January 2017, when it was raided by officers from the Public Security Bureau (PSB). The claimant managed to flee from the site and went into hiding. His father informed him that the PSB came to their home and left a summons; when the claimant failed to present himself as directed, the PSB returned and warned his father not to withhold any information about the claimant from them.\n[4] The claimant obtained a fraudulent Hong Kong passport with the help of a smuggler. He left China on XXXX XXXX, 2017, travelling through XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and the U.S. He crossed the Canada-U.S. border near Vancouver on XXXX XXXX, 2017 without presenting himself to immigration officials. He made his claim for Canada's protection inland on August 1, 2017 in Toronto.\n[5] The claimant fears persecution and arrest in China on the basis of his involvement in an underground church. He also wishes to practise his religion freely and openly, and would be prevented from doing so by the Chinese authorities.\nANALYSIS\n[6] The determinative issue in this case is credibility.\nIdentity\n[7] The claimant's identity has been established through his testimony and through the documentation on file: an original People's Republic of China Resident Identity Card (RIC)4 that was seized by the referring IRCC (formerly CIC) office; and the family household register, or hukou,5 which was presented for the panel's inspection at the hearing.\nCredibility\n[8] The determination as to whether a claimant's evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities. While statements given under oath are presumed to be true, that presumption can be rebutted by contradictions or inconsistencies in the evidence.6 The onus is on the person making a claim to present evidence that is credible on a balance of probabilities to support the allegations which form the basis of the claim. In this case the panel finds that the claimant has not met that onus.\n[9] In assessing the claimant's credibility, the panel considered the decision in Orelien7 wherein the Federal Court of Appeal held that it is necessary for the claimant to establish that his evidence is probably credible or trustworthy, not just possibly so. The panel also took into consideration the various factors that could affect oral testimony, including the milieu of the hearing room and the claimant's anxiety, age, cultural differences, level of education, and the use of an interpreter.8 While not every piece of evidence will be referred to in these reasons, the panel carefully considered the entirety of the evidence in reaching its decision.9\nClaimant's travel route and documents used\n[10] The claimant testified that he used a fraudulent Hong Kong passport when leaving China for XXXX and from there to XXXX, and another travel document from XXXX on; both of these fraudulent documents were destroyed on route. The claimant had difficulty recalling the length of time he spent in each country, in addition to providing inconsistent statements about how long he stayed in hiding at his uncle's home following the PSB raid and his eventual exit from China.\n[11] The claimant testified that he spent \"more than ten days but less than one month\" at his uncle's home, and that the PSB raid happened in May 2017. When alerted to the statements in the BOC narrative and the summons, both of which refer to the events as having taken place in January 2017, the claimant stated that he did not have a good memory. When the panel pointed out to him that there was no documentary evidence before it, such as boarding passes or luggage tags, that would corroborate the timing of his exit from China and entry into Canada, the claimant stated that he had \"pictures on [his] cell phone as proof.\"\n[12] The panel has considered, were it to adjourn the proceedings and allow the claimant to provide any such photographs as post-hearing documents, the following: would the pictures on a person's cell phone amount to sufficiently credible and reliable evidence, on a balance of probabilities, of the person's physical presence in an identifiable location at a specific time? The panel has determined that they would not.\n[13] The claimant provided inconsistent testimony of the timing of the PSB raid, the period of the time he spent in hiding, and of his travels on route to Canada; he provided no documentary evidence to corroborate his exit from China and entry into Canada. The panel is supported by Mr. Justice Nadon's ruling in Elazi10 wherein he finds that the failure to provide a passport, or any documentary evidence of the person's travel in the form of luggage tags or boarding passes, is an important matter in assessing the credibility of a claim. This documentation provides evidence of the route taken to Canada as well as previous travel, and therefore the claimant's location during the events that allegedly gave rise to the fear that forms the basis of a claim, and without it, the claimant's testimony regarding the chronology and history of his travel will remain largely unconfirmed.\n[14] The panel finds that the failure to provide corroborating travel documents without a reasonable explanation, in addition to the other credibility concerns outlined below, impugns the claimant's overall credibility.\nSummons\n[15] The claimant produced a summons11 as evidence that he is being sought by the PSB. The document is a single page with black print and a red-ink stamp as the only, rather rudimentary, security feature, and thus easily forged. In light of the above credibility concerns and the claimant's inconsistent testimony regarding the timing of the PSB raid, the panel refers to documentary evidence that indicates the widespread availability of fraudulent documents in China.12 The panel finds that the claimant produced a fraudulent document as the summons and draws a further negative credibility inference.\n[16] The foregoing findings lead the panel to conclude that the claimant's allegations that he attended an underground church in China and is of interest to the PSB are not credible. The panel therefore turns to the claimant's prospective risk of persecution on a forward-looking basis.\nChristian practice and church attendance in Canada\n[17] The claimant testified that since shortly after his arrival in Canada in XXXX 2017, he has been attending the Shouters church, referring to its street address at \"XXXX XXXX\" in Toronto, on a regular basis. He stated that after he introduced himself to the congregation and said that he was a refugee claimant, the church members \"disliked\" him and were not welcoming, even refusing to give him a Bible when he requested one.\n[18] The panel asked the claimant why he continued to attend this church when he was not made to feel welcome there, and he responded that he just sat by himself and listened, and that he wanted to go to a Shouters church specifically. He stated that while he had no Bible of his own to this day, some of the congregants were \"still observing\" but \"slowly accepting\" him now. When questioned by counsel about the situation at his Toronto church and why he did not simply purchase a Bible in a store himself, the claimant responded that the congregants must have suspected him of having another motive for joining, and that he was not familiar with the stores here.\n[19] The panel asked the claimant to speak about the services in Toronto in comparison to those at his underground church in China. He stated that while in both churches the members called God's name out loud, they did not sing hymns in Canada, and the method of prayer was also different. He testified that in China they always prayed loudly, whereas in Canada they prayed silently and with eyes closed. When asked about the reason for praying out loud in China, the claimant responded that it was what the leader told them to do as Shouters, and that it made them feel better. He added that in Canada he now prayed silently along with the others and it felt the same to him, because he felt like he was shouting inside.\nReligious profile\n[20] The panel is faced with a difficult task in assessing whether an individual is a genuine believer in a particular faith or not because of the intrinsic factors relevant to such an assessment. Credibility is, of course, central to making such a determination. Therefore, it is helpful to consider the matter through the lens of the claimant's general credibility.\n[21] The panel is aware that a sound grasp of theory of a belief system is not a requirement for one to consider oneself a follower of that belief system, and therefore stayed clear of a microscopic examination of faith that the Federal Court has warned against in Gao v. Canada.13\n[22] When asked about his intentions or plans to be baptized, the claimant stated that he wished to truly join the religion and it was important to be baptized. He indicated that he did not know whether there were any requirements he needed to fulfill before he could undergo baptism, only that \"when it's time for me to be, I will be.\" The panel has before it no evidence of the claimant's attempts to, in his own words, truly join the religion. The panel therefore draws a negative credibility inference regarding the claimant's profile as a Christian believer.\n[23] The claimant's testimony on his religious activities in Canada remained vague and repetitive. When asked about the topic of the most recent sermon he had heard, he responded that it was about Jesus being crucified and his redemption of people, and that at church he forgot about his parents always fighting. When asked by counsel about a particular lesson from the Bible that was important to him, the claimant responded that they were all significant. When asked to speak about one, he stated that it was Jesus being crucified and redeeming human beings.\n[24] When asked by the panel about what it meant to be a Christian believer, the claimant stated that he was a Christian and that he liked going to church, because when he was at church he forgot about his parents arguing.\n[25] The panel notes that the claimant's references to the Bible were limited to the story of Jesus' crucifixion, the central element of Christianity familiar to people of various religious and spiritual backgrounds and not an indication of a person's faith and commitment to Christianity in particular.\n[26] On the basis of the foregoing findings and negative inferences, and, on a balance of probabilities, the panel finds that the claimant's allegations that he attended a Shouter house church in China and that he was being persecuted by the PSB because of his illegal Christian activity are not credible. The panel finds that the claimant's religious identity as a Christian or an adherent of the Local\/Shouter branch of Christianity has not been established.\n[27] The panel finds that the claimant failed to demonstrate a sufficient level of involvement with his church in Canada to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that he is a committed member of the Local Church congregation in the Toronto area. Furthermore, the panel also determines that the claimant is not a genuine Christian practitioner.\n[28] Having considered all of the above, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has not established his claim on the basis of credible and trustworthy evidence and has not established the central element of his claim: that he is wanted by the authorities in China as an adherent to the Shouter sect of Christianity. Furthermore, the panel finds that the claimant is not a genuine follower of the Local Church branch of Christianity in Canada.\n[29] The panel has drawn negative credibility inferences on the claimant's evidence regarding being sought by the PSBs and his illegal religious activity, central aspects of the claim. As per Sheikh,14 the panel finds that the cumulative effect of the negative inferences and findings on these central aspects undermines the claimant's overall credibility as a witness.\nCONCLUSION\n[30] In light of the above considerations and findings, the panel finds that there is not a serious possibility of persecution on a forward-looking basis should the claimant return to China. For the same reasons, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant would not personally face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or be subjected to a danger of torture upon return to China.\n[31] The panel therefore finds that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee under section 96 nor a person in need of protection under subsection 97(1) of IRPA, and the claim is rejected.\n[32]\nThe panel also finds that pursuant to subsection 107(2) of IRPA, the claimant provided no credible or trustworthy evidence on which a favourable decision could be made, and therefore there is no credible basis for the claim.\n(signed)\n\"M.

The claimants had been living in XXXX when in April 2012, conflict broke out between the Syrian Army and the Free Syrian Army militia. They fled XXXX because of the conflict, travelling overland to XXXX to live with an uncle. At this time, the principal claimant married his cousin and they had a child. Their first daughter was born on XXXX XXXX, 2013 and they returned to XXXX. The principal claimant, when living in XXXX, was stopped at a checkpoint manned by the Syrian Army, his identity documents were confiscated and he was detained. He was beaten by the members of the security forces. He was interrogated while being accused of taking part in the uprising against the regime. He was accused of helping the militias and fighting against the army. He was released three months later. While he had been arrested, his extended family had fled to Jordan. Following his escape six months later, his wife and daughter entered Jordan at the same camp. The claimants were contacted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and advised that they were being relocated to the United States (U.S.). They arrived on XXXX XXXX, 2017 in the U.S. The principal claimant submits that when he arrived in the U.S., they were granted refugee claimant status, meaning that they would not be granted any permanent refugee status. The current process is suspended and they feared as Muslims that they would be denied permanent resettlement.\n[8] The principal claimant, whose grandfather and family live in Canada, decided that the best course of action for the safety and security of their family was to relocate to Canada and make their claim for protection. Their claims were referred to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (the \"Board\") on October 7, 2017.\n[9] In the BOC form narrative submitted by the principal claimant, he submits that his home in XXXX, Syria has been completely destroyed, his remaining family in Syria have had to flee to another place and their lives are threatened daily by militias and the disastrous humanitarian situation.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[10] The panel is satisfied on a balance of probabilities in the claimants' identities considering the documentation provided, including refugee identity documents issued by U.S. officials, birth certificates of the minor children born in Jordan and military document for the principal claimant.7\nCredibility\n[11] The presumption before all panels at the Board is that the claimants and their allegations are truthful.\n[12] Considering the record, there are no material issues for the panel to question the claimants' overall truthfulness; therefore, a hearing was not conducted.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\n[13] The duty of this panel is to find if there is sufficient, credible or trustworthy evidence to determine that there is more than a mere possibility that each of these claimants would be persecuted if they returned to Syria. The principal claimant has alleged that he will face persecution due to his past treatment by security forces as a dissident.\n[14] The latest Human Rights Report from the Department of State for 2016 states that:\nThe Asad government and its supporters reportedly continued to use indiscriminate and deadly force against civilians, conducting air and ground-based military assaults on cities, residential areas, and civilian infrastructure. Attacks against schools, hospitals, mosques, churches, synagogues, water stations, bakeries, markets, civil defense forces centers, and houses were common throughout the country. In April, UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan di Mistura estimated that the fighting had resulted in the deaths of more than 400,000 persons since 2011. The humanitarian situation reached severe levels. As of December 2015, there were more than 4.8 million Syrian refugees registered with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in neighboring countries and 6.1 million persons displaced internally as of August. The government frequently blocked access for humanitarian assistance and removed items such as medical supplies from convoys headed to civilian areas, particularly areas held by opposition groups.\nThe most egregious human rights violations stemmed from the state's widespread disregard for the safety and well-being of its citizens. This manifested itself in a complete denial of citizens' ability to choose their government peacefully, a breakdown in law enforcement's ability to protect the majority of citizens from state and nonstate violence, and the use of violence against civilians and civilian institutions. The government arbitrarily and unlawfully killed, tortured, and detained persons on a wide scale. Government and progovernment forces conducted attacks on civilians in hospitals, residential areas, schools, and settlements for internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugee camps; these attacks included bombardment with improvised explosive devices, commonly referred to as \"barrel bombs.\" During the year the United Nations reported increased use of incendiary weapons, including napalm and white phosphorous, as well as chlorine gas. The government continued the use of torture and rape, including of children. It used the massacre of civilians, as well as their forced displacement, rape, starvation, and protracted sieges that occasionally forced local surrenders, as military tactics. Government authorities detained without access to fair trial tens of thousands of individuals, including those associated with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), human rights activists, journalists, relief workers, religious figures, and medical providers. Government authorities rigorously denied citizens the right to a fair public trial and the ability to exercise civil liberties and freedoms of expression, movement, peaceful assembly, and association.8\nRisk Profiles\n[15] The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees International Protection Considerations with Regard to People Fleeing the Syrian Arab Republic, Update IV, from November 2015, reports on the particular risk profiles of those person at risk in Syria. Although this list is not exhaustive, I have only itemized the particular risk profiles relevant in this claim. According to the UNHCR, a person(s) who is identified in one more of these groups, is likely to be in need of international protection:\n* Persons opposing or perceived to be opposing the government, including, but not limited to, members of political opposition parties; protestors, activists and others perceived to be sympathizing with the opposition; members of anti-government armed groups, or persons perceived to be members of anti-government armed groups; draft evaders and deserters from the Armed Forces; Government and Ba'ath Party officials who abandoned their positions; family members and affiliates of persons opposing or perceived to be opposing the government; and civilian inhabitants of urban neighbourhoods, towns and villages perceived to be opposing the government.\n* Women, in particular women without male protection, women who are victims of or at risk of sexual violence, early and forced marriage, domestic violence, \"honour crimes\" or trafficking.\n* Children, in particular children who are at risk of detention or have previously been detained; children victims of or at risk of underage and forced recruitment, sexual and domestic violence, child labour, trafficking, and systematic denial of access to education. 9\nAccording to the London School of Economics. Centre for Women, Peace and Security:\nIn its attempt to crush the revolution and remain in power, the Assad regime has resorted to every possible tactic, from torture to enforced disappearance, and from indiscriminate bombings to the use of chemical weapons. Sexual violence against women, and especially rape, has been no exception. Massive harassment of female prisoners, sexual assaults and repeated rapes have become part of the repressive arsenal of the Syrian government as it started to feel under threat. Still, sexual violence committed by pro-regime forces has been little documented and has not raised attention.10\n[16] According to the 2017 UNICEF report on the impact of the war in Syria on children:\nChildren have paid the heaviest price in this six-year war and their suffering hit rock bottom last year in a drastic escalation of violence. At least 652 children were killed in 2016 alone - a 20 per cent increase from 20151 - making 2016 the worst year for Syria's children since child casualties have been formally documented. In less than one week in Aleppo, 223 children were injured and 96 were killed last September2, Doctors were forced to leave children with low chances of survival to die because of limited capacity and lack of basic medical supplies3. Challenges to access in Syria stand in the way of getting the full scope of children's suffering and of responding quickly, effectively and to scale. Beyond the bombs, bullets and explosions, countless children are dying in silence from preventable diseases that could easily be cured. But in today's Syria few doctors are left and access to medical care and facilities is increasingly difficult. Coping mechanisms are eroding fast and families are taking extreme measures just to be able to survive. Child labour, early marriage and child recruitment are on the rise. In 2016, over 850 children were recruited and used in the conflict - more than double the number in 2015. Children are being recruited at an ever younger age and are increasingly taking part in combat roles, including in extreme cases as executioners, suicide bombers or prison guards. These figures represent only verified instances and understate the scope of the problem.11\n[17] Considering the previous detention, interrogation and torture of the principal claimant, I find that more likely than not having to return following the prolonged absence, would put the principal claimant and subsequently his family at risk of ongoing harassment, arrests and potential serious harm. Given the history and the country condition evidence, there is sufficient evidence for me to find that it is more likely than not that the claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution if they returned to Syria.\nState Protection\n[18] State protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in this particular case considering the evidence that the Syrian state has manifestly failed to protect its citizens from mass atrocities. War crimes and crimes against humanity have been committed on a massive scale. Many Syrians have suffered multiple violations and abuses from different actors, including the Syrian state, representing a total failure of the state to protect civilians.12 Therefore, state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming if the claimants return to Syria.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[19] The first prong of this assessment is to determine on a balance of probabilities if there is a serious possibility of persecution in the internal flight alternative (IFA) or no risk to life, cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger of torture in the IFA for these claimants.\n[20] The armed hostilities have left no area within Syria unaffected by the conflict and the resulting massive humanitarian consequences. There are countless frontlines and the level of violence is particularly fierce in and around major cities and along main lines of communication. Soldiers at checkpoints regularly conduct arbitrary arrests, confiscate food and other basic supplies and prevent sick and wounded persons from seeking medical attention. Arrests of men and boys at checkpoints ringing restive areas are commonplace, with the consequence that male civilians inside those areas are unable to leave, even to seek food or medical treatment and are unable to flee the areas when they come under attack. Government officials continue to commit torture and other forms of ill-treatment at intelligence agencies and in prisons and military hospitals, subjecting tens of thousands of victims to unimaginable suffering. Most are civilians initially held at checkpoints and during military incursions, while the majority of accounts concerned are male detainees. The frequency, duration and severity of the torture suggest that victims are likely to suffer long-term damage to their psychological, as well as physical well-being. Considering the foregoing, I am not satisfied that there is anywhere in Syria where the claimants would no longer face a serious possibility of persecution given the situation in Syria.\nCONCLUSION\n[21] For the foregoing reasons the panel finds that, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, are Convention refugees as set out in section 96. Therefore, their claims are accepted.\n(signed)\n\"J. Schmalzbauer\"\nJ.

She further alleges that the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) government facilitated attacks on her community and her uncle was a victim of this policy. Her father joined the All Amhara People's Organization (AAPO) and in 1994 he was arrested, detained for three months and tortured. In January 2004, the claimant began to support the All Ethiopian Unity Party (AEUP) which replaced the AAPO.\n[3] In late 2004-2005, the party merged with others to form the Coalition for Unity and Democracy (CUD). The claimant and her parents joined that party, and many of its members were arrested after a 2005 demonstrations. Her father was detained for two months. The party was renamed the Unity for Democracy and Justice Party (UDJ) and the claimant made financial contributions and registered with the party.\n[4] The claimant was arrested on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, after she refused to allow EPRDF workers to address her class. She was detained for four days and she was asked to join the EPRDF.\n[5] On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, she was arrested again. She was interrogated for five days and endured a brutal beating. The claimant's uncle acted as a guarantor, her parents paid a bribe and she was released\n[6] As a result of this experience, the claimant applied to some North American universities and she was accepted by Centennial College in Toronto. She left Ethiopia and arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX.\nDETERMINATION\n[7] The panel finds the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nISSUES\n[8] The determinative issue in this claim is credibility.\nANALYSIS\nThe lack of corroborating documentary evidence\n[9] The panel notes the almost total lack of corroborative evidence as to the central issues in this claim. The panel acknowledges that the Federal Court in Maldonado has stated that a claimant's evidence is presumed to be true.1 However the Federal Court in Owoussou determined that \"It would be grossly unfair to allow safe haven as a refugee simply on a person's say-so.\" The Court acknowledged that \"often the core of a claim cannot be verified, but other elements can, which is why the rules call upon the claimant to provide acceptable documentation.\"2\n[10] In addition, the Court in Ortiz found that the RPD had not erred in drawing an adverse conclusion from the absence of corroborative evidence,3 and the Court in Joseph found that in key areas where one would have expected corroborative documentary evidence, none was offered. The Court concluded that the RPD was entitled to make an adverse credibility finding in those circumstances.4\n[11] As well, the Federal Court of Appeal in Adu has stated that \"the \"presumption\" that a claimant's sworn testimony is true is always rebuttable and, in appropriate circumstances, may be rebutted by the failure of the documentary evidence to mention what one would normally expect it to mention.\"5 The panel finds that this is the case in regard to this claim.\n[12] The panel notes the claimant stated that her father was arrested and detained twice as a result of his political views and activities and that her family's political history was an element in her own problems with Ethiopian authorities. The claimant further stated that after her arrest in 2010 for refusing to allow EPRDF workers to address her class, her parents were very proud of her actions.\n[13] The panel asked the claimant if she had a corroborating evidence as to her father's political history and her subsequent arrests. She said no. She was further asked if she made any effort to obtain such corroboration from her parents and she said no.\n[14] The panel noted that the claimant could have asked her father to provide a letter confirming his own political history and the claimant's arrests. The claimant responded that her father was in poor health and she was unwilling to ask.\n[15] The panel noted that the claimant indicated that her uncle was the guarantor when she was released from detention in 2012. The claimant was asked if she asked her uncle to provide a corroborating letter in this regard. She said no and that she did not want her family to be involved.\n[16] In response to questions from counsel the claimant testified that she had not sent any letters to her parents nor had she received any in the five years since her arrival in Canada. She further testified that they had been questioned by authorities after she came to Canada and she did not want them involved. However, the claimant testified as well that she had exchanged email messages and phone calls with her parents.\n[17] The panel noted that the claimant might have asked for some corroborating documentation from her parents in her email and phone conversations. In addition she was asked if he had ever phoned her uncle. She said she talked to him a few times. She was further asked if she had asked him for a corroborating letter and she said no and that she did not want him involved.\n[18] The panel notes it is clear from the claimant's evidence that Ethiopian authorities would have known that her parents and uncle were involved in her alleged problems. The claimant stated that her parents had been questioned after she left the country. The panel finds that if the claimant was willing to exchange email messages and phone calls with these family members, it is reasonable to assume that her situation was discussed and they were involved. The panel notes that the claimant stated that communications with family members was risky, but this did not prevent her from contacting her parents and uncle by email or phone.\n[19] The panel notes that subsequent to the claimant's testimony concerning her contacts with her parents, the claimant stated that she had not contacted her parents but rather only contacted her sister. The inconsistency was noted and the claimant was asked if she sought some corroborating documentation from her sister. She said no and she did not want to involve her sister as she feared it was risky and it would be known. The panel asked the claimant if she feared the authorities would know about these contacts why she had engaged in them. There was no credible response.\nThe panel finds that the claimant had access to corroborating documentation concerning the central issue in her claim, and that this documentation was likely available to her if she had requested it. The panel notes the claimant was represented by competent counsel and the requirement that such evidence be disclosed is clearly noted in the PIF instructions.\nMembership in the UDJ\n[20] The claimant stated she was a member of the UDJ and she was asked if she had a membership card. She responded she did not and the panel cited country documentary evidence indicating that Andinet Ethiopia (UDJ Party) issues membership cards because \"as a political party, they are required by Ethiopian law to do so.\"6\n[21] The panel asked why she did not have a membership card and the claimant responded she was just supporting the party. In response to a question in this regard from counsel as to whether she applied for a card, the claimant stated she just supported the party. Two receipts for party donations were disclosed by the claimant.7 The panel notes the claimant stated in her PIF that she had registered in the party.\n[22] The panel noted the claimant had disclosed a letter from the secretary of the party that indicated she had been a member since the party's founding.8 The panel further notes the inconsistency between the claimant's testimony and the information in this letter as to her membership in the party. The panel asked the claimant if she had requested this letter. She said yes and that she had received it \"through a person\". The panel asked the claimant, if she sought this letter, why had she not asked for corroboration regarding her alleged arrests. The panel noted there is no mention of her arrests in the letter. The claimant responded that she could not explain. The panel notes that the claimant's indication of a risk in corresponding with her family and she might have sought to have corroborating evidence from them brought to Toronto \"through a person\".\n[23] The panel gives little weight to the party secretary's letter on the basis of the inconsistency as to her alleged membership in the party.\nMedical treatment and documentation\n[24] The panel noted the claimant indicated in her PIF that she was brutally beaten during her alleged second detention. The panel asked the claimant whether she received any medical attention after her release and whether she had any documentation in this regard. The claimant testified that she did not seek medical attention and she just stayed in hiding in her home. Subsequently the claimant testified that she did receive medical attention from a traditional medicine practitioner. She was asked if she had any documentary evidence in this regard and she stated there was no documentation. She was further asked if she could have sought some documentation and she responded: no document.\n[25] The panel notes the claimant first testified that she received no medical attention and then changed her testimony and indicated she was treated by a traditional medical practitioner. In addition, the claimant stated that after her second detention she just stayed in hiding at home. The panel notes that the claimant testified she was followed after her release from her second detention and in addition she reported to the authorities weekly. The panel draws a negative inference from the claimant's inconsistent testimony regarding medical treatment and the allegation that she was in hiding. The panel also finds that there is insufficient credible evidence to confirm that the claimant experienced a brutal beating while in detention.\nExit from Ethiopia\n[26] The claimant stated that after her release from her second detention she was accepted by XXXX XXXX in Toronto and she was able to apply for, and obtain, a Canadian visa. In addition she was able to exit Ethiopia using her own genuine passport. The claimant testified that no one knew she had left Ethiopia. The panel noted however that she had testified that she was followed by Ethiopian authorities after her release from detention. The claimant agreed.\n[27] The panel noted in the hearing that country document evidence indicates that she was at risk of being detained at the airport if she was a person of interest to the authorities. This evidence states that \"...low level opposition members whose treatment would not attract outside attention are at risk of being detained, jailed or killed in Ethiopia. Generally, most opposition members who wish to leave the country travel first to Kenya by bus or other means of ground transportation, to avoid being apprehended at the airport, and fly out of Kenya. The Ethiopian authorities have an extensive security network and monitors opposition members, even low level ones at the village level.\"9\n[28] The panel finds that if the claimant were a person of interest to Ethiopian authorities and being followed as she testified, she would not have been allowed to exit the country. The panel draws a negative inference in this regard.\nPolitical activities in Toronto\n[29] The claimant testified that she was an active participant in an Ethiopian political organization in Toronto that organized demonstrations and other activities critical of the Ethiopian government. The claimant disclosed documentary confirmation in this regard.10 The panel has reviewed this evidence and finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant lacks the profile of a person whose activities in Canada would attract the attention of officials in Ethiopia.\nThe panel cites in this regard the decision of the Federal Court in Gebremedhin in which the Court found the RAD had not erred in finding the appellant's activities would not come to the attention of authorities on a balance of probabilities, and that she therefore did not face a serious possibility of persecution.11\nCONCLUSION\nThe panel acknowledges that Ethiopian authorities suppress opposition parties and their members, and the government uses arbitrary arrest, torture and excessive force in this regard. As well there is impunity for officials who commit these abuses.12 The panel finds however, on the basis of its cumulative findings noted above, that there is insufficient evidence to find that the claimant was a political activist in Ethiopia and a person of interest to Ethiopian authorities, as she alleged.\n[30] The panel therefore finds that the claimant is not a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. The claim is dismissed.\n(signed)\n\"Milton Israel\"\nMilton Israel\nOctober 12, 2017\nDate\n1 Maldonado, Pedro Enrique Juarez v. M.C.I. (F.C.A., no.

At the time this child was born the official policy was a \"one-child\" policy.\nThe Evidence\n[4] In his written and oral testimony, the claimant stated that once she realised she was pregnant, his wife went into hiding and did not attend scheduled appointments with her local family planning clinics, which prompted family planning officials to visit their home. Initially, these officials left notices for his wife to attend the clinic, however, these notices were changed requiring them to attend with the purpose of having either claimant or his wife sterilized.\n[5] The claimant states that he and his wife went into hiding at the homes of relatives. On the XXXX XXXX 2012 and with the assistance of a \"snakehead,\" he left China as part of a tour group travelling to San Francisco, in the United States of America (\"The US\"). Using a pre-determined route, the claimant made his way to Canada where he made a claim for refugee protection. His wife gave birth to their second son on the XXXX XXXX 2013. The birth of this second child has not been registered. She remains in hiding with this son. Family planning officials continue to pay regular visits to their former residence. Each time the officials visit they leave notices for their attendance at the clinic for sterilization.\n[6] After hearing the claimant's testimony the panel observed that there was no objective evidence to support the claimant's position that he and his wife had a second child. To resolve this issue, the claimant was permitted to submit a DNA test that involved himself and both children.3 Having had a chance to look at the document, the panel accepts that the claimant and his wife indeed have a second child.\nDETERMINATION\n[7] The panel determines that the claimant is not a Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of IRPA. The claimant is also not a person in need of protection pursuant to section 97(1) of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\nIssue\n[8] The issues in this claim are the claimant's personal identity; credibility, and change of circumstances. The question to be determined maybe stated as: -\n[9] Whether notwithstanding the change in law, as a person who had a second child prior to the change in China's \"one-child\" policy, and as a person who was sought by the authorities for violating this policy, would the claimant would be at risk of forced sterilisation? For the reasons that follow; the panel answers this question in the negative.\nThe Claimant's Personal Identity\n[10] The claimant's personal identity is sufficiently established by the certified copy of his Chinese passport contained in the documents provided by the Canada Border Services Agency, (CBSA\/CIC)\nRisk of Sterilisation - Violation of Family Planning Policy\n[11] The claimant argues that he will be forced to undergo sterilisation upon his return to China. He states that he and his wife, having had two children, were in violation of China's family planning policies, as it stood when their second child was born. He acknowledges that China's current family planning policy now allows couples to have two children, however, he takes the position that the new policy does not apply to him, because his violation pre-dated the change in the law. Therefore, he will face retaliation from the family planning authorities whose many notices to him were ignored.\n[12] When the claimant's wife gave birth to a second child in May 2013, the law regarding family planning in China promoted what is familiarly known as a \"one-child\" policy. This policy stood until the 1st January 2016.\n[13] The documentary evidence indicates that as of the 1st January 2016 China's former population control policy was rescinded and replaced by a new policy permitting married couples to have two children and in some cases three.4 Chinese authorities have implemented the new law. With the implementation of the new policy the panel is of the view that with the claimant's violation of the former policy is now rendered moot.\n[14] The panel finds support for its position in the documentary evidence, notably the October 2015 United Kingdom Home Office Report5 on family planning states that while there have been reports in the past of unlawful crackdowns by local officials in a small number of provinces and areas resulting in women and, sometimes, men, being forcibly sterilised, the last such crackdown took place in spring 2010. The UK Home Office Report also states that, in general, for female returnees, there is no real risk of forcible sterilisation or forcible termination in China.6 Furthermore, the British Home Office Report (BHO) unequivocally states that:\nMale returnees do not, in general, face a real risk of forcible sterilisation, whether in their \"hukou\" area or elsewhere, given the very low rate of sterilisation of males overall and the even lower rate of forcible sterilisation.7\n[15] The claimant states that his wife and second child have been in hiding since before the child was born. The panel is not persuaded of the veracity of this aspect of the claimant's testimony. It calls for the panel to accept that the claimant's wife has been able to fly under the radar for some five years. The panel is not persuaded that in a society where services such as schooling and medical treatment are provided in accordance with one's Hukou or household register that in five years, and with a small child, that the claimant's wife has not had need of any social services. It stands to reason then that she cannot have remained hidden all this time. Commenting on the importance of a Hukou, the BHO OPN states:\nThe Chinese authorities retain the hukou system of registration. The hukou, a small red passbook, contains key information on every family, including marriages, divorces, births and deaths, as well as the city or village to which each person belongs and attached to the hukou are benefits including health care, a pension and free education for children. These benefits are only available if a Chinese citizen lives where he or she is registered. It is very difficult to get a driver's licence, buy a house or purchase a car without a hukou.8\n[16] Regarding the claimant's allegation that in an effort to avoid reprisals the birth of his second child has not been registered the panel notes that the documentary evidence does not support the claimant's allegation. The BHO report notes that unauthorised children are in fact registered: -\n(8) There are hundreds of thousands of unauthorised children born every year. Family planning officials are not entitled to refuse to register unauthorised children and there is no real risk of a refusal to register a child. Payment for birth permits, for the registration of children, and the imposition of SUC charges for unauthorised births are a significant source of revenue for local family planning authorities. There is a tension between that profitability, and enforcement of the nationally imposed quota of births for the town, county and province, exceeding which can harm officials' careers.9\n[17] Furthermore, there is documentary evidence to suggest that after the change in the law, children who had not formerly been registered could be registered, without having to pay a fine. In correspondence with the Research Directorate, a professor with the Institute of Population and Labour Economics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing has given the opinion on the Impact on Children Born outside Birth Limits before the Change to a Two-child Policy. The Professor states that,\n\"all children born should be registered, no matter if they are second or third or higher births, prior to or after the new regulation\" (Professor 2 May 2016). In April 2016, The Globe and Mail reported that \"[s]ome districts - Xicheng, Dongcheng and Changping - were registering children. Others were not,\" and in the city of Shenzhen, registrations began in January 2016 (3 Apr. 2016). Without providing further detail, the same source reports on the case of a mother who was able to register and obtain a hukou for her unregistered second child, a two year old, \"without first paying punishing fines\" (ibid.). According to the Professor, registration \"should be separate from the social compensation fee collection\" (Professor 2 May 2016).10\n[18] Thus, there appears to be impediment to the registration of the claimant's second child, if that child has not already been registered. As well, there appears to be no valid reason for the claimant's wife to remain in hiding or for him to fear forced sterilization.\n[19] The panel notes that counsel for the claimant has submitted many articles detailing the practices of forced abortion and sterilisation in China. However, nearly all of the articles pre-date the change in policy. One of the articles dealing with the forced sterilisation of a Chinese man after the change in policy also notes that the authorities have launched an investigation into the circumstances of the operation. The other article appears, indeed to be culled from an internet source that may or may not be reliable. For these reasons the panel prefers the Board's documentary evidence on the issue.\nCONCLUSION\n[20] The claimant alleged that he is at risk of forced sterilization should he be returned to China for all the reasons above the panel finds that he has not met his onus to establish, on a balance of probabilities that this would be the case. Therefore, he has not shown that he is a person who faces a serious possibility of persecution as contemplated by section 96, or that he would be in danger of being tortured, or would face a risk to his life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, as set forth in section 97(1) of the Act, because of a violation of the former family planning policy.\n[21] The panel finds that XXXX XXXX is not a Convention refugee under section 96 or \"a person in need of protection\" within the meaning of section 97 of the Act.\n(signed)\n\"Hazelyn Ross\"\nH.

The claimant resided in a home that had belonged to his family for generations, and made renovations to it as recently as 2014. In March 2016, he learned of the government's plans to demolish the buildings in his area in order to construct a road through it, and was given a notice to move out within three months. Unhappy with the amount of compensation he was set to receive, he met with twenty other affected home owners and obtained an independent appraisal for his property along with the others. As one of six representatives he attended the town government office in April 2016, where the mayor did not give them a favourable response. The representatives then went to the Fuqing City government and were told to go back and negotiate at the local level.\n[4] On May 20, 2016, approximately 30 home owners started a protest in front of the town government offices, shouting slogans and holding banners. On the third day of the demonstration, police showed up and arrested several protestors. The claimant escaped and went into hiding. His wife informed him that officers from the Public Security Bureau (PSB) came to their home, accused him of being the lead in an anti-government action, and left a warrant for his arrest. The claimant found a smuggler to help him leave China.\n[5] While the smuggler made travel arrangements on his behalf, the claimant heard from his wife that the family home had been demolished and that the PSB continued to look for him while also collaborating with the mafia in an attempt to locate him. With a fraudulent passport supplied by the smuggler, the claimant travelled from China on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, eventually making his way to Toronto on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX where he made his claim for Canada's protection at the port of entry on the same day.\n[6] The claimant seeks protection because of fear of persecution on the grounds of political opinion as a result of his public stance against the government's land expropriation policy in China.\nANALYSIS\n[7] The determinative issue in this case is credibility.\nIdentity\n[8] The claimant's original People's Republic of China Resident Identity Card (RIC), driver's license, family household register (hukou), and marriage certificate4 were seized by CBSA at the port of entry. Based on his testimony, seized identity documents,5 and additional personal documentation6 submitted, the panel finds that the claimant provided sufficient credible evidence to establish, on a balance of probabilities, his identity as a national of China.\n[9] The claimant did not submit the passport on which he travelled from China to Canada into evidence as part of his claim. The lack of travel documentation will be addressed by the panel separately as part of the credibility assessment.\nCredibility\n[10] While statements given under oath are presumed to be true, that presumption can be rebutted by contradictions or inconsistencies in the evidence.7 In assessing the claimant's credibility, the panel considered the decision in Orelien8 wherein the Federal Court of Appeal held that it is necessary for the claimant to establish that his evidence is probably credible or trustworthy, not just possibly so. The panel took into consideration the various factors that could affect oral testimony, including the milieu of the hearing room and the claimant's anxiety, cultural differences, level of education and sophistication, and the use of an interpreter.9\n[11] The panel \"also is entitled, in assessing credibility, to rely on criteria such as rationality and common sense.\"10 The onus is on the person making a refugee claim to present evidence that is credible on a balance of probabilities to support the allegations which form the basis of the claim. In this case the panel finds that the claimant has not met that onus.\n[12] While not every piece of evidence will be referred to in these reasons, the panel carefully considered the entirety of the evidence in reaching its decision.11\nClaimant's passport\n[13] The claimant testified that he used two passports on route to Canada: his own genuine People's Republic of China passport to exit China and enter Turkey; and a fraudulent passport provided by the smuggler at some point in transit from Europe to Brazil to Canada. Neither document was presented to Canadian border officials or submitted into evidence.\n[14] The claimant testified that the smuggler retained both passports but did not recall exactly when. When questioned by counsel about the reason why the smuggler kept his genuine passport as well, the claimant stated that he did not know and was simply following the smuggler's arrangements, later adding that he might not have been able to travel from Brazil to Canada still in possession of it.\n[15] The panel rejects this explanation as inconsistent with the claimant's possession of his original RIC, hukou, driver's license, and marriage certificate throughout his journey from China to Canada. All these documents were genuine and issued to him in his own name, and were presented to Canadian border officials as evidence of his identity at the port of entry. The panel finds it illogical that the risk of being found to be in possession of a Chinese passport in his own name while travelling from Brazil to Canada using a fraudulent passport in another name did not extend to being found to be in possession of several other Chinese documents under his own name.\n[16] The failure to provide a valid passport is an important matter in assessing the credibility of a claim. In addition to confirming a claimant's nationality and identity, a passport provides evidence of the route taken to Canada as well as previous travel, and therefore the claimant's location during the events that allegedly gave rise to the fear that forms the basis of a claim. The panel's view is supported by Mr. Justice Nadon's ruling in Elazi.12\n[17] The panel finds that the failure to provide his passport without a reasonable explanation, in addition to the other credibility concerns, impugns the claimant's overall credibility.\nTravel on own passport while of interest to the PSB\n[18] The claimant testified that he exited China on XXXX XXXX, 2016 while using his own passport. When questioned by the panel about the ability to pass through passport control when already being sought by the authorities as of May 25th, the claimant responded that he was wanted by the town government without the higher government being aware.\n[19] Here the panel notes the availability of documentary evidence concerning the efficiency of Chinese authorities and the presence of the Golden Shield Project.13 The panel finds that if the claimant were being sought by authorities for leading anti-government actions, slandering government officials, and disturbing social order, he would have been wanted for arrest as per the summons issued against him, and would have then been identified while attempting to exit China on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2016 using his own passport, as he testified that he did.\n[20] Documentary evidence states that authorities control the exits of citizens and that travellers wanted by PSB are flagged in Policenet, the national computer network of policing to which airport authorities are also connected: \"airport security officials have access to the Public Security Bureau of China's online database of citizens who have been convicted of crimes or are wanted by the authorities\"14 [emphasis added].\n[21] The panel considered the claimant's testimony that the government beyond the town level was not aware of his identity as a protestor in light of the substantial documentary evidence which indicates that citizens' exits from China are closely monitored and that public security organs are interconnected and \"integrated,\" as noted below:\nPolicenet, a component of the Golden Shield, stores a wealth of information on Chinese citizens and connects the various agencies and levels of command within the public security apparatus. This integrated system enables Chinese public security forces to effectively target and neutralize political dissidents.15 [emphasis added]\n[22] The panel also acknowledges that there is systematic corruption in China,16 airport officials can be bribed, and regulations are not always applied evenly or consistently. The panel finds, however, that the substantial majority of the documentary evidence before it does state that authorities at airports conduct thorough screening of passengers, including evidence that passenger manifests are provided to the authorities in advance of flights departing China.17\n[23] The claimant testified that he exited China using a genuine passport validly issued to him in his own name. The panel finds that if the claimant were sought by the PSB, he would have been identified in the Golden Shield database and on the passenger manifests while attempting to exit China using his own passport, and concludes that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant is not wanted by PSB. The panel therefore draws a negative inference regarding the claimant's overall credibility.\n[24] The panel's finding is supported by a Jurisprudential Guide in the form of the RAD decision in TB6-11632,18 and by case law: in Zeng, Su, and Cao,19 the Federal Court has supported findings that proceeding unimpeded through Chinese exit controls is inconsistent with being wanted by Chinese authorities.\n[25] The panel also acknowledges a recent Federal Court case20 wherein Mr. Justice Russell, in overturning the RAD decision, accepts that it is not implausible for a person to depart China using his or her own documents while wanted by the PSB; however, the panel refers to the concluding paragraph in the Federal Court decision as supporting the panel's finding in the case at hand:\nI am aware that similar cases to the present have arisen frequently in the Court, particularly with regard to the issue of whether claimants are able to exit China with their own passports given the Golden Shield system in place. Decisions have gone both ways. In my view - and the Respondent acknowledges this - it really depends upon the facts and evidence adduced in each case. In the present case, I think there are sufficient concerns about the factual findings of the RAD, as outlined above, to require a reconsideration of this case. This does not means that I am establishing any kind of precedent that can be applied in future cases.21\n[26] In addition, as the panel finds that the claimant exited China on his own identity documents, thus confirming that the authorities were not concerned with him, the panel finds that the claimant's identity as a protestor against the unfair compensation for his property who is wanted by the PSB is undermined. This finding thus undermines the claimant's credibility as a person who fears persecution based on his stance against the government land expropriation policy.\nSummons\n[27] The claimant produced a summons22 as evidence that he is being sought by the PSB. The document is a single page with black print and a red-ink stamp as the only, rather rudimentary, security feature, and thus easily forged. In light of the above credibility concerns and the finding that proceeding unimpeded through Chinese exit controls is inconsistent with being wanted by Chinese authorities, the panel refers to documentary evidence that indicates the widespread availability of fraudulent documents in China.23 The panel finds that the claimant produced a fraudulent document as the summons and draws a further negative credibility inference.\n[28] The foregoing findings lead the panel to conclude that the claimant's allegations that he participated in a protest that was critical of the Chinese government, and is of interest to the PSB as a result, are not credible.\nAdditional supporting documentation\n[29] The claimant submitted the following documents, among others, in support of the allegations: house ownership record24; appraisal estimate25; notice of land expropriation26; and a petition letter.27\n[30] The panel asked the claimant whether he had any photographs of the family home, financial records of the renovations done in 2014, or photographs of the demolition which eventually occurred according to his testimony, and he replied that he did not. He stated that he had received no compensation to date, and that his wife and children were residing with her family.\n[31] Both counsel and the panel questioned the claimant about the circumstances which led him to believe that government officials were defrauding the home owners of their full compensation amount. The claimant presented no evidence on how he came to that conclusion, simply repeating that the compensation should have been much higher than the stated amount. His testimony here was vague and repetitive, as were his statements about government officials working with criminal gangs in order to punish him for delaying the construction project.\n[32] The panel questioned the claimant about how he would be identified by the authorities to be one of the several residents who signed the petition letter28 submitted into evidence. He testified that the letter on file was a copy of the petition that was presented by six home owners, including himself, to the local government office.\n[33] The panel notes that the letter contains printed text and only partially legible signatures, covered by finger or thumb imprints, of twenty villagers without any additional means of identification. The claimant's name may possibly appear as one of the twenty signatures, but any other way to identify him, such as an ID number or address, is missing. Other than \"Dear ... Town government office,\"29 the letter contains no name or title to whom it is addressed, nor does it possess any indication, such as a date stamp or receipt, that it was delivered to and received by the town government officials as alleged. As such, the panel assigns no weight as to its probative value.\n[34] Furthermore, the panel finds that the letter could have been written by anyone at any point, does not identify the claimant through a national ID number, date of birth, or address, and as such does not go toward establishing a link between the claimant and the alleged protest against the unfair compensation as alleged.\n[35] The claimant stated repeatedly that he was one of six representatives who called for a higher compensation amount for their expropriated property. Four protestors had been arrested by the PSB and, according to the claimant's testimony, remain in custody to this day. The panel finds that the claimant failed to produce any reliable, credible documentation to establish, on a balance of probabilities, his profile as a protestor who publicly accused government officials of corruption. The panel also finds that a lack of corroborating documentary evidence goes directly to the material aspects of the claim and draws a negative credibility inference.\n[36] Based on the failure to document a link between the claimant's profile as a protestor who was one of the organizers of a petition campaign and a public protest to fight for fair compensation for all affected home owners, the panel finds that the claimant is not wanted by the authorities.\n[37] The claimant failed to establish a profile as a protestor against government corruption in China; furthermore, he failed to establish a link between his activity as a person who petitioned on behalf of his village to receive fair compensation and being sought by the PSB as a result of this activity. The panel therefore finds that the claimant is not of interest to the authorities. This finding thus undermines the claimant's overall credibility as a witness.\n[38] The claimant also expressed a fear of criminal gangs who are allegedly seeking to harm him on behalf of government officials as a means of punishment for causing a delay by protesting for fair compensation. The claimant's testimony on this aspect was vague and inconsistent. At one point in the hearing he stated that the protest resulted in the \"loss of their project\" for the criminal gangs, while later he stated that the project was just delayed, only to repeat at another point that the criminals lost the project.\n[39] The panel draws a negative inference to the claimant's overall credibility as a witness as a result of the above inconsistencies for which he was not able to provide satisfactory, reasonable explanations.\nIs the risk objectively well-founded?\n[40] The panel considered the documentary evidence before it and the claimant's testimony and acknowledges that \"In recent years there has been a significant increase in petitioning and civil unrest in China mainly related to the issues of unpaid wages, land confiscation, forced evictions and corruption.\" 30\n[41] However, the panel has previously found that the claimant is not being sought by the PSB for protesting the unfair compensation for his property, and refers to the Guidance Note which goes on to state the following:\nAlthough the Chinese government is wary of any form of popular protest and is likely to respond harshly to protests that challenge the state's authority, the majority of these land and industrial protests are based on local issues and directed against local officials. Even when the protests are directed against the state they rarely challenge the state's authority or right to govern ... In general, applicants from this category of claim are unlikely to be seen by the Chinese authorities as having engaged in a political act and are therefore unlikely to engage the United Kingdom's obligations under the Refugee Convention.31 [emphasis added]\n[42] In light of the above negative credibility finding, the failure on the part of the claimant to establish a profile of a person who is wanted by the PSB as a result of his protest activities, and taking into consideration the Guidance Note before it, the panel concludes that the claimant has not established that his risk of persecution in China is objectively well-founded.\n[43] The above credibility findings go to the material aspects of the claim. The panel finds that the claimant failed to establish the material aspects of his claim: that he is sought by the authorities for protesting against the expropriation and demolition of his property by local government officials. As per Sheikh,32 the panel concludes that the cumulative effect of the negative inferences and findings above undermines the credibility of the claimant in general.\nCONCLUSION\n[44] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant has not satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, or that, on a balance of probabilities, he would be personally subjected to a danger of torture, or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, if he were to return to China.\n[45] The panel therefore determines that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee under section 96 nor a person in need of protection under subsection 97(1) of IRPA and rejects the claim.\n[46] The panel also finds that pursuant to subsection 107(2) of IRPA, the claimant provided no credible or trustworthy evidence on which a favourable decision could be made, and therefore there is no credible basis for the claim.\n(signed)\n\"M.

He further alleges that he will be persecuted by the ruling government in Ethiopia due to his participation in protest rallies and other political events in Canada and the United States.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] The panel finds that the claimant has not established a serious possibility of persecution in Ethiopia based on a Convention ground. He has also not established, on a balance of probabilities, that he would be personally subject to a danger of torture, or to a risk to his life, or to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, were he to return to Ethiopia. Accordingly, he is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\nIDENTITY\n[4] On a balance of probabilities, the claimant's personal identity and identity as a national of Ethiopia was established through his Ethiopian passport4 and birth certificate.5 The panel is satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is ethnically Amhara, based on his testimony.\nANALYSIS\n[5] The determinative issue is credibility. For the reasons that follow, the panel finds that the claimant was not credible about the allegations raised in his BOC.\n[6] When a claimant swears to the truthfulness of certain facts, there is a presumption that what he says is true, unless there is a reason to doubt it.6 When assessing credibility, the panel is entitled to rely on its rationality and common sense.\n[7] In this case, the panel finds that there is reason to doubt the truthfulness of the claimant. Specifically, there are contradictions, inconsistencies, omissions, and implausibilities in the claimant's evidence that went to the heart of the claim and undermined his credibility; these were not satisfactorily explained by the claimant.\nThe claimant was not detained in Ethiopia\n[8] The claimant declared in his BOC that he studied theology at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and that he has travelled around the world to preach the gospel as a missionary evangelist. In Ethiopia, the claimant preached at the Gotera Ethiopian Mullu-Wengel Church.\n[9] The claimant further declared in his BOC that on or about 20 February 2016, he was stopped by three government security agents while on his way to visit friends at Arat Killo. The agents told the claimant that they wanted to talk to him and demanded that he drive to Sidistegna police station in Addis Ababa. When the claimant asked the agents to produce a warrant, one of them beat the claimant with his police baton and insulted him with derogatory language, telling him \"you will come with us.\" The claimant declared that he had no choice but to comply.\n[10] It is alleged that once the claimant arrived at the police station, the agents took him to an office, where he was accused of associating himself with opposition members of the Ethiopian diaspora and representing their views in Ethiopia. They referred to the claimant's frequent travels abroad, and accused him of criticizing the ruling government under the guise of preaching the gospel and that his sermons were similar to those of evangelists in the diaspora who were aligned with the opposition. He was held at the police station until 29 February 2016, during which time he was badly beaten on his head and legs with a rubber stick.\n[11] It is further alleged that the claimant was released on bail of 10,000 Ethiopia Birr, with conditions that he be of good behaviour, refrain from criticizing the government or aligning himself with anti-government forces, and report to the police station on a weekly basis. The latter condition is said to have been modified to monthly reporting, following the payment of a bribe by the claimant's brother-in-law.\nOmission RE: charged and taken before the court\n[12] At the hearing, the claimant's testimony was generally consistent with his BOC with respect to being pulled over by the police and ordered to the police station for questioning. However, it became apparent to the panel during questioning that the claimant omitted a significant detail from his amended BOC, specifically that he was formally charged by the Ethiopian authorities and appeared in court.\n[13] The panel asked the claimant if he was formally charged with a crime. He responded in the affirmative and, when further asked by the panel, stated that he was charged with communicating with foreign elements and speaking against the government during his preaching. The panel asked the claimant if he ever appeared in court in answer to the charges. He replied that he appeared in court one time, on 28 February 2016, and that the judge decided that he would be released from detention and would have to answer to the charges against him.\n[14] The panel drew the claimant's attention to the fact that he failed to mention in his BOC, as amended, that he had been taken to court on 28 February 2016, and asked him if there was a reason why he did not mention this detail. In reply, the claimant testified that all he had was a letter of arrest and release and that he thought this was what he needed. The panel asked him if there was any other reason he failed to mention this detail in his BOC, to which he responded that there was no other reason.\n[15] The panel finds that the claimant's explanation of why he omitted the reference to being charged and appearing in court from his BOC is not reasonable. The panel notes that the claimant signed a declaration that his BOC and amended BOC were interpreted to him, that he understood the interpretation, and that the information contained therein is complete, true and correct. He further affirmed this to be the case at the outset of the hearing. The BOC instruction that claimants should include everything that is important for the claim, including dates, names and places, is encompassed by this declaration. The panel also notes that the claimant had the benefit of being represented by experienced legal counsel.\n[16] In the panel's view, the claimant's testimony that he was formally charged and appeared in court, and was ordered released by the court, goes to the heart of his claim that he was detained by the authorities and maltreated for allegedly having aligned himself with the opposition diaspora while abroad and preaching anti-government rhetoric in church at home. The panel expects that the claimant would have included these details in his BOC, and draws a negative inference about his alleged arrest and detention from their absence. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant was never formally charged, did not appear in court on 28 February 2016 in answer to charges against him, and was not ordered released from detention by the court on that day.\nContradiction RE: time spent in detention and when he was released.\n[17] At the hearing, the panel questioned the claimant about a document he provided entitled \"Evidence of imprisonment time,\"7 specifically about how he came to receive it and its purpose. The document is dated 29 February 2016 and allegedly signed by the Addis Ababa Police Commission. The panel asked the claimant for the date that he requested the letter from the police. He testified that he asked for it on 28 February 2016 when he was released from jail. The panel asked him when on 28 February 2016 was he released, to which he replied that it was sometime in the afternoon. The panel asked when he was given the letter. The claimant responded that he received it on the same day.\n[18] The panel drew the claimant's attention to an apparent contradiction raised by his testimony, specifically that he declared in his BOC that he was kept at the police station until 29 February 2016, whereas his testimony was that he was released on the afternoon of 28 February 2016. The claimant maintained that he was released on 28 February and stated that it was a problem of translation with the document. The panel asked the claimant where he thought the problem of translation lay. He stated that maybe it was a problem of figuring out the difference between the Ethiopian and Western calendars.\n[19] The panel then drew the claimant's attention to the fact that, like the release date of 29 February declared in his BOC, the letter said to have been issued to him by the police is also dated 29 February 2016. The panel asked the claimant if he could explain why the letter is dated 29 February if, as he testified, he was actually released on 28 February and received the letter on 28 February. The claimant stated that the date given on the letter, i.e. 29 February, was the exact date he was released.\n[20] The panel pointed out to the claimant that it appeared he was now changing his testimony, specifically that he had, moments earlier, stated he was released on 28 February and received the letter on 28 February, but was now saying that it happened on 29 February. In reply, the claimant stated that he had made a mistake.\n[21] The panel finds that the claimant's testimony does not satisfactorily explain the contradiction in dates raised by the claimant's testimony vis-\u00e0-vis his BOC and amended BOC, and relative to the \"Evidence of imprisonment time\" letter. When the panel initially drew the claimant's attention to the contradiction between the date provided in his BOC and his testimony, he held steadfast to his testimony that he was released on 28 February and explained that there may have been a translation issue in the BOC. Only when the panel drew the claimant's attention to the fact that his testimony also contradicted the date of issue for the \"Evidence of imprisonment time\" letter, did he change his testimony and say that he had made a mistake.\n[22] The panel finds the claimant's testimony on this issue was inconsistent. The panel notes, again, that the claimant signed a declaration and affirmed at the hearing that the information contained in the BOC and amended BOC narrative had been interpreted to him and that the information provided by him was complete, true, and correct. If there were some issue of date, the panel expects that the claimant would have picked up on it and amended his BOC, accordingly, as he did with some other aspects of the claim. Based on the contradiction, the panel draws a further negative credibility inference about the claimant's alleged arrest and detention and assigns little weight to the detention release letter.\nContradiction RE: treatment while in detention\n[23] The claimant declared in his BOC that during his detention he was badly hit by a rubber stick on his head and legs.\n[24] At the hearing the panel asked the claimant about the treatment he received while in detention. As mentioned above, he stated that his jailers did whatever they wanted to do, which he described as abuse, attacks and the prohibition of food delivered by family members or friends. The panel asked the claimant to describe how the police would abuse and attack. He replied that they would insult and abuse the detainees, that they would say all kinds of things, and that they would do whatever they wanted. The panel asked the claimant what he meant when he said they would abuse him. He replied that they would insult and ridicule him and the other detainees as an ethnic group.\n[25] The panel drew the claimant's attention to the declaration he made in his BOC narrative that he was badly hit on the head and legs with a rubber stick during his time in detention, but that he had not mentioned this when asked by the panel to describe the treatment he received while in detention. The claimant responded that he had told the panel that he was hit by one of the police officers on his forehead. The panel reminded him that allegedly happened when he was first stopped on the road by the three agents and that his BOC refers to him being badly hit with a rubber stick on the head and legs during the period of his detention. The claimant explained that he had a very bad experience in jail and that also applied physical violence to him, attacking with sticks or whatever they had, and that he was trying to bring this to the panel's attention.\n[26] The panel is cognizant of the fact that some people may be reluctant to talk about their experience in detention. However, the panel notes that in this case, the claimant did not have difficulty testifying about the officer who allegedly struck him in the forehead with a baton when he was initially pulled over. Similarly, the panel expects that the claimant would have been able to mention the physical violence he allegedly experienced in detention, even if he was hesitant to go into too much detail about it. The panel asked the claimant very specifically what he meant when he said he was attacked and abused and at no time did he mention being beaten by a rubber stick on the head and legs. The panel draws a further negative credibility incident about the claimant's alleged arrest and detention based on the contradiction between his BOC and his testimony with respect to his experience in detention.\nOmission RE: post-detention treatment by authorities\n[27] The claimant declared in his BOC that after he was released from detention, the situation in Ethiopia was getting worse and he was worried that anything could happen to him. He was monitored in the past by government intelligence and security officials in relation to comments he made from time to time during his sermons. Therefore, in consultation with his family, and with his fianc\u00e9e in the United States, he decided to leave the country.\n[28] At the hearing, the panel asked the claimant if he had any further involvement with the Ethiopian authorities following his release from detention and before leaving for the United States. In reply, the claimant testified that he did have further problems. He testified that the authorities were calling him on the telephone and that whenever they saw him they would tell him that they knew he has a problem; they were warning him to be careful.\n[29] The panel asked the claimant about the phone calls he testified he was receiving. He stated that they called him and told him to stop what he was doing and giving him warnings. He testified that the authorities also met him in person and said these things to him. The panel asked the claimant how long after his release did he start receiving the phone calls. He stated that it was weeks after he was released but could not remember the dates. The panel asked him if he was able to say how many weeks after his release he received the first call. He replied that it was around 10 days after his release. When asked by the panel about how many calls in total he received, the claimant stated that he received two further calls after the first one.\n[30] With respect to the claimant's testimony that the authorities met him in person, the panel asked him if he could remember when that event happened. He responded that he could not remember. He subsequently testified that it was, perhaps, 15 days after they called him on his phone that that they met him in person. The panel asked the claimant where the meeting took place. He stated that they met him on the road in an area called Bole. The panel asked him to describe the meeting. The claimant testified that the authorities approached him and told him that they know what he is doing and that he had better stop it, and that they were following him. He further testified that they threatened him not to return to what he was doing before, which, when asked by the panel to explain, the claimant stated they meant not to have any connection with people abroad and being a terrorist against the government.\n[31] The panel drew the claimant's attention to the fact that his testimony raised the issue of an omission in his BOC and amended BOC narrative, specifically that he failed to mention anything in the BOC and amended BOC narrative about being subjected to further threatening phone calls from the authorities, or being stopped by them on the street. The panel asked the claimant if he could explain the omission. In reply, he stated that after arriving in Canada he had but 15 days to submit his BOC and at that time he was not feeling well, and that his lawyer was also busy and that he cannot keep telling the lawyer that this thing happened or that thing happened.\n[32] The panel rejects the claimant's explanation for the omission as unreasonable. The panel notes that the claimant bears the onus of establishing his claim and, again, that he was instructed in his BOC to include everything that is important to his claim, including dates, names and places. The panel further notes that the claimant's lawyer did submit an amended BOC narrative that the panel accepted into evidence. The panel therefore finds it highly unlikely that the claimant's lawyer would not have time to file an amended BOC had the claimant apprised him of some additional interactions with Ethiopian authorities following his release from detention. The panel further notes that the claimant's BOC was signed by him in November 2016, meaning he has had plenty of time to provide an amended narrative.\n[33] In the panel's view, the claimant's testimony that he was contacted and approached by government authorities following his release from detention, and threatened by them, is material to his claim that he was arrested and detained for alleged involvement with foreign elements and preaching anti-government rhetoric, and that he will be arrested, tortured and beaten up if he were to return to Ethiopia. Based on the omission, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant was not contacted by Ethiopian authorities in the period following his alleged detention. The panel also draws a further negative credibility inference about the claimant's alleged arrest and detention based on the omission.\n[34] Based on the evidence, the panel accepts that the claimant is a missionary evangelist and that he has preached the gospel in Ethiopia and abroad. However, in light of the noted credibility concerns, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant was not arrested and detained by government authorities for suspected involvement with the opposition diaspora or for preaching against the government during his sermons, and that he is not being sought on that basis in Ethiopia.\n[35] Before making this finding, the panel considered a number of documents in evidence, including a letter from a friend of the claimant's, XXXX XXXX XXXX;8 a letter from the claimant's brother-in-law, XXXX XXXX XXXX;9 and a recommendation from the Gate of Hope Church in Burnaby, British Columbia.10 However, the panel finds that these letters do not overcome that panel's noted credibility concerns.\n[36] The letter from the claimant's brother-in-law, dated 29 November 2016, refers to the claimant as being released from detention on 29 February 2016, which contradicts the claimant's testimony that he was released on 28 February, and as being harassed by the government authorities after his detention, which the claimant omitted from his BOC. The letter from the claimant's friend, dated 1 December 2016, indicates that the claimant has been followed very closely by Ethiopian government security forces in relation to his preaching and mentions the alleged arrest of the claimant on 20 February 2016, his alleged detention for nine days, and his allegedly being beaten, insulted and tortured while in detention, the latter of which the claimant failed to mention in his testimony. The letter of recommendation from the Gate of Hope Church refers very generally to the claimant having been incarcerated. The panel considers these letters to be of low probative value and assigns little weight to them.\nSur Place Claim\n[37] The claimant declared in his BOC that in addition to events alleged to have transpired in Ethiopia, he will be arrested, tortured and beaten up by Ethiopian authorities for his participation in a protest rally and other political activities in the United States and Canada.\n[38] Specifically, the claimant declared that he attended a protest rally in Washington, D.C., on 19 September 2016, to denounce the genocide committed by the Ethiopian authorities against innocent civilians of the Amhara and Oromo regions of the country. He further declared that since coming to Canada he has attended a fundraiser for an independent television program in Canada that is critical of the government of Ethiopia. The claimant declares that because of his attendance at these events, his opposition to the Ethiopian government is known and that he fears that he will be detained and tortured were he to return to Ethiopia. The panel considered documents in evidence establishing the claimant's presence at these events, including photographs11 and a ticket stub.12\n[39] At the second sitting of his claim on 20 September 2017, the claimant also presented evidence of his attendance at a protest rally in Toronto, held on 18 September 2017, including six photographs13 of the claimant at the rally and documentation showing that there is footage of the rally on YouTube.14\n[40] The panel must consider whether the claimant's participation in opposition political activity in Canada has come or will come to the attention of Ethiopian authorities and whether the claimant will face a serious possibility of persecution as a result.\n[41] The Federal Court has affirmed that claimants who assert a sur place risk based on in-Canada activities must provide some evidence to show that their activities in Canada have made them a target.15 The panel finds that the claimant has failed to demonstrate that his attendance at various events in the United States and Canada have come to the attention of the authorities in Ethiopia and have made him a target.\n[42] With respect to the rally in Washington, D.C. and the fundraising events in Canada, the panel questioned the claimant as to how his attendance at these events made his opposition to the Ethiopian government known to that government. In response, the claimant testified that, especially with the Washington rally, a lot of people would see it and the Ethiopian government would also see it, and in addition, the Ethiopian government has supporters who would report his presence. The panel asked him whether he had any received any indication that he has been identified by the Ethiopian government as being present at the events declared in his BOC. In reply, the claimant testified that he assumed that because the rally has been posted on YouTube that Ethiopian authorities would watch it and know of his attendance.\n[43] Assuming for a moment that the ruling government in Ethiopia has viewed footage of the rally, the panel finds that it is still a very large leap to conclude on the basis of the evidence in this case that the claimant has been positively identified, or that the government has the means to place a name to a face in the crowd. Counsel for the claimant conceded as much in his submissions, at least with respect to the Washington rally. The panel finds that the claimant speculates that he has been identified, but there is no credible evidence before the panel that this is the case, or that he has been targeted as a result. The panel makes the same finding with respect to the claimant's recent attendance at a protest rally in Toronto.\n[44] The panel is entitled to import its credibility findings into its assessment of a claimant's sur place claim. The panel has already found, due to issues of credibility, that the claimant was not arrested and detained by government authorities for suspected involvement with the opposition diaspora or for preaching against the government during his sermons, and that he is not being sought on that basis in Ethiopia. In light of this finding, the panel finds that the claimant is not someone who was on the Ethiopian government's radar, so-to-speak, and that he is not, then, as high a profile target as he would have the panel believe with respect to his activities in Canada.\n[45] The panel has considered the objective documentary evidence, which informs that the Ethiopian government has harassed and conducted surveillance on Ethiopian nationals living abroad,16 but in light of the foregoing findings, the panel finds that is unlikely that they have an interest in the claimant.\n[46] Therefore, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant does not have a sur place claim to refugee protection based on his activities in Canada.\nPersecution based on Amhara ethnicity\n[47] The claimant declared in his BOC that he is of Amharic ethnicity17 and that he fears arrest, mistreatment and persecution by Ethiopian security forces because he is Amhara.18\n[48] The panel found the claimant's testimony to be credible when testifying about his ethnicity and therefore finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is of Amhara ethnicity.\n[49] However, the panel finds that simply being Amhara in Ethiopia is insufficient to create a residual risk profile, and that the claimant has not credibly established his opposition to the government to make him a target because of his ethnicity. The panel's reading of the documentary evidence is that the risk to persons of Amhara ethnicity, who comprise about 30% of the Ethiopian population, is for those who are politically involved.19\n[50] In light of the panel's credibility findings, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant would not be persecuted in Ethiopia based on his Amhara ethnicity alone, were he to return there.\nCONCLUSION\n[51] Having carefully considered all of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant has not satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, or that, on a balance of probabilities, he would be personally subjected to a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture, were he to return to Ethiopia. He is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\n[52] Accordingly, the panel rejects his claim.\n(signed)\n\"K. MacLennan\"\nK.

He is seeking refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The details of the allegations for this claim are set out in the claimant's Basis of Claim (BOC) form.1 To summarize, the claimant's parents were the targets of extortion by the now demobilized XXXX in the 1990s. The claimant's siblings left Colombia between 1997 and 1999 and made successful refugee claims. The claimant's parents left Colombia in XXXX 2007 and also made successful refugee claims. In XXXX 2015, the claimant alleges to have begun to receive threatening phone calls from unknown individuals who demanded that he leave Colombia the way his parents had. Fearing that these alleged phone calls were coming from members of demobilized XXXX, the claimant fled Colombia for the U.S.A in XXXX 2016. After initiating an asylum claim in the U.S.A, the claimant made his way to Canada and initiated a refugee claim at the port of entry.\n[3] The claimant fears that should he return to Colombia, he would be killed by the XXXX and the XXXX because of the problems his family had with them in the past and also because of his brother's occupation as a XXXX XXXX in Canada.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] The panel finds that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 nor a person in need of protection pursuant to section 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] The claimant testified that his Colombian passport was seized by U.S. immigration officials and his Colombian identity card was lost. A faxed copy of the claimant's Colombian birth certificate2 was submitted post-hearing. In addition, the claimant's brother, who is a member of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX,3 served as an identity witness at the hearing. Based on the testimony of the identity witness, as well as the post-hearing disclosure, the panel will accept the claimant's personal identity as alleged.\nCredibility\n[6] This claim fails on the issue of credibility. Credibility concerns arose very early on in the hearing and continued throughout. There were serious enough omissions, contradictions, discrepancies and implausibilities to give the panel reason to doubt that the sworn testimony of this claimant was not truthful. Counsel himself requested that he be permitted to provide written submissions due to the complex credibility concerns that arose during the hearing or as counsel termed it \"confusing testimony\". The credibility concerns were numerous and therefore, for brevity sake, only a few will be outlined in these reasons. However, let it be clear that this decision was not based on any one credibility issue in isolation but rather on the cumulative assessment of all areas of credibility concerns even those not mentioned within these reasons.\nDelay In Leaving\n[7] The panel finds the claimant's delay in leaving Colombia to be egregious and speaks negatively to the credibility of his allegations. The claimant's parents fled Colombia in fear of their lives in 2007. The claimant's siblings left Colombia between 1997 and 1999. The claimant was asked why he did not leave Colombia at the time that his siblings left. The claimant stated that he remained in Colombia to care for parents, however, the panel notes that even after the claimant's parents left Colombia ten years ago, the claimant remained.\n[8] The claimant's parents' narrative4 specifies that three of their children were threatened in 1997 with machine guns. Three of their children fled Colombia between 1997 and 1999. The claimant did not. This leads the panel to question whether the claimant was threaten at all either in the 1990s or now.\nNature Of Threats\n[9] The claimant indicated that the threats made against him were for him to leave Colombia. There was no demand for money as was the case with his parents neither was there a demand for his brother to cease his XXXX XXXX activities in Canada. The claimant indicated that the caller stated that the claimant's brother caused them to lose a lot of money yet no demand for money was made of the claimant as a reprisal. The only demand made was for the claimant to leave Colombia. The panel questioned how the clamant leaving Colombia to join his family for a better life in either the U.S.A or Canada would benefit these alleged callers or be considered a reprisal. The panel does not find these assertions to be plausible. The panel believes that the claimant had a desire to leave Colombia for economic reasons and when attempts to obtain U.S.A and Canadian visas failed, he concocted these threats.\nAttempts To Leave Colombia\n[10] The claimant applied for U.S.A visas in 2012, 2013 and 2015. His applications were all denied. The panel questioned why the claimant would apply for visas in 2012 or 2013 if the fear for his life did not begin until 2015. The claimant testified that he did not have any problems in Colombia from 2006 to 2015. The panel asked whether something happened in 2012 that urged the claimant to apply for visas. The claimant responded that his business closed and his economic situation started to diminish. The panel finds that the claimant's attempts to leave Colombia beginning in 2012 were for economic reasons and not for reasons of fear. The claimant denied this stating that the fear for his life in Colombia was always there because of everything that had happened to his family in the past. The panel finds this to be inconsistent with the claimant's testimony regarding why he did not report to the authorities in Colombia sooner than he did.\nReporting To The Authorities\n[11] The claimant testified that he did not go to the police after he received the first threatening phone calls despite the fear that he earlier testified was always with him. The claimant testified that he thought that the first threatening phone call was a bad joke and he did not place great importance on it. The panel does not find this to be consistent with the claimant's earlier statements. The panel does not find it credible that the claimant who testified to having an ongoing internal fear for his life such that he had attempted to leave Colombia in 2012, would not place importance on a threatening phone call from those whom he perceived to be the very persons who caused his parents to flee Colombia for their lives, especially considering that the claimant indicated that the callers made specific mention of his family and their situation.\n[12] When confronted with the panel's concerns, the claimant then changed his testimony. He testified that he did not go to the police after the first threatening calls because he had no confidence in the police. He changed his testimony to indicate that he did not ignore the first calls and that the first calls did in fact cause him fear. This testimony directly contradicts his earlier testimony. The claimant's inability to maintain a consistent story gives the panel serious reasons to doubt the truthfulness of his allegations.\n[13] The claimant was asked whether he had already made a decision to leave Colombia when he went to the fiscalia in XXXX 2016. He responded that he had not. The panel pointed out that the claimant's written story5 states that he had already purchased his ticket for Mexico when he reported the final phone call to the fiscalia. The claimant was given the opportunity to explain this contradiction. The claimant's explanation was obtuse and indirect.\n[14] Counsel attempted to address this contradiction during cross-questioning. He asked the claimant whether he bought tickets to leave Colombia before or after he went to the fiscalia. Contrary to what is written in his narrative, the claimant responded, \"after.\" The claimant could not provide a reasonable explanation for this contradiction. The panel also notes with regard to the fiscalia that the claimant testified that the report from the fiscalia had been \"lost\". Given the credibility concerns in this claim, the panel does not believe that a report from the fiscalia ever existed. The panel does not believe that the claimant ever went to the fiscalia. The panel does not believe that this particular claimant was ever threatened by the XXXX, the XXXX or the XXXX in 2015 and 2016 as alleged. The panel finds this claimant to be untruthful in his assertions as is evidenced in his inability to maintain a consistent story.\nAgents Of Persecution\n[15] The claimant was asked who he feared in Colombia. He responded that when he received threats over the telephone, \"they identified themselves as XXXX.\" The panel asked the claimant to clarify whether during the first calls he received in XXXX2015, the callers identified themselves specifically as belonging to the XXXX. The claimant responded that they did. This information contradicts what is written in the claimant's BOC narrative.6 The claimant writes that he received a telephone call in August 2015 from an unknown individual. He writes that he thought that the call could be from someone associated with the XXXX but he does not write that the caller specifically identified themselves as belonging to the XXXX as he stated in his oral testimony. The claimant did not testify that he perceived the caller to be XXXX or that he concluded that the caller was from XXXX. He stated that they specifically identified themselves as such. The panel finds this to be a contradiction.\n[16] When the claimant was presented with the contradiction between his written story and his oral testimony, the claimant changed his testimony. The claimant testified that the callers did not identify themselves as XXXX but rather he perceived them to be XXXX because they made mention of forcing his family out of the country which was done by XXXX. The panel asked the claimant to explain the inconsistency in his oral testimony, as well as the differences between his oral testimony and his written story regarding whether the alleged callers ever identified themselves as XXXX, XXXX, XXXX or otherwise. The claimant's explanation was that it was an \"oversight\" in his written story. He stated that when he wrote his story he was under a lot of pressure, fear and stress. Even if the panel were to accept this explanation as truthful regarding the contradictions between the claimant's written story and oral testimony, it does not account for the inconsistencies that were inherent in his oral testimony at the hearing.\nMiscellaneous Discrepancies-Education\n[17] When discussing a possible internal flight alternative in Bogota, the claimant indicated that he did not have a university degree. He stated that he does not have a five year B.A degree as was written in his Port of Entry forms.7 He testified that he had a three year technical diploma or certificate but not a bachelor diploma or degree. He testified that a B.A is a five year university program but that he only completed a three year program.\n[18] The panel asked the claimant to explain the discrepancy between his oral testimony and his port of entry documents. The claimant indicated that it took him five years to complete a three year technical program because the university was continually being shut down due to protests which would delay the academic term making the period in which one would finish one's degree longer. However, when the claimant's brother was called to testify, he testified that the claimant attended university in Colombia where he obtained a Bachelor XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He testified that this was a five-year degree. The panel accepts the witness' testimony as truthful for the reasons that will be outline below. The panel finds that the claimant was untruthful about his highest level of education as it was quite apparent that the panel was trying to ascertain whether, based on his level of education, the claimant could easily relocate and re-establish himself in another part of Colombia. The panel finds that the claimant deliberately attempted to mislead the panel in this regard.\nMiscellaneous Discrepancies - The Claimant's Parents\n[19] The claimant's parents made successful refugee claims in Canada in 2007. The claimant submitted the narrative8 used in those claims. His parents' narrative states, \"At the end of XXXX 2001, my son XXXX[the claimant] decided to marry and leave our home. Unfortunately XXXXleft in anger over our lack of support for his wedding plans. He has not contact[ed] us since he left.\"\n[20] The claimant, however, testified that he lived in the same city as his parents and remained in contact with them until they left Colombia. He testified that after his parents left Colombia he then moved to Bogota in XXXX 2007. The claimant was asked if he ever lost contact with his parents. The claimant responded that he did not lose contact with his parents until after they left Colombia for Canada. He stated that while his parents were in Colombia he always maintained contact with them.\n[21] The claimant's testimony completely contradicts his parents' narrative. The claimant testified that he is unsure of why his parents would indicate that he lost contact with them. Yet aside from his parents' narrative, the claimant's oral testimony contradicts his own written narrative in this regard. The claimant's oral testimony was that he never lost contact with his parents in Colombia and lived in the same city as they did until they left Colombia in 2007. The claimant's written story indicates that his parents moved to a different area of Medellin and he moved to Bogota after which he lost contact with Medellin and his family.9 The claimant was given an opportunity to explain the contradiction. He maintained that he only lost contact with his parents when they left Colombia despite what was written in his narrative and the narrative of his parents. The claimant provides no explanation for the contradiction between his oral testimony and his written story.\n[22] The claimant's written testimony contradicts his oral testimony and parts of the claimant's oral testimony contradicts itself. The panel agrees with counsel's submissions in that these particular areas do not go to the heart of the claimant's allegations but the panel finds that it does speak to the claimant's overall credibility. The panel finds overall that the claimant had difficulty maintaining a consistent story as he attempted to juggle what was true and what was not.\nWitness\n[23] The panel found the witness to be credible mainly because he testified in a straightforward and spontaneous manner and did not attempt to embellish his testimony. He testified without inconsistency or contradiction. The panel accepts his testimony as credible. That being said, the witness' testimony regarding the problems his brother had in Colombia is based on the verbal assertions of his brother and admittedly not based on first-hand knowledge. The panel has already found the verbal assertions of this claimant not to be credible and therefore places no weight on any evidence that relies on the truthfulness of this claimant.\n[24] With regard to the witness' profession as a member of the XXXX, there is nothing before the panel to suggest that the witness' occupation as a member of the XXXX has placed or would place this claimant at risk of harm in Colombia. This witness left Colombia almost twenty years ago. He has been a member of the XXXX since 2010. There is no credible evidence before this panel to suggest that any armed group has linked or would link this particular claimant to his brother in Canada. There is no credible evidence before this panel to suggest that any harm has come or would come to the claimant as a result of his brother's employment in Canada.\n[25] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that no threats were ever made to this particular claimant because of his brother occupation or because of his family's past problems. Based on the claimant's testimony, the panel does not find it credible that the claimant was threatened by telephone beginning in 2015 as alleged. The panel finds that it is more likely than not that this claimant concocted these threats and the allegations contained in his BOC as a means of obtaining status in Canada and escaping his deteriorating economic situation in Colombia.\nCONCLUSION\n[26] The claimant did not provide any reliable evidence to support his allegations. Given that the panel places no weight on the claimant's ever-changing oral testimony or on the contradictory statements contained within the claimant's BOC, the panel is left with no credible or trustworthy evidence upon which a favourable decision could be made in this claim.\n[27] The panel therefore finds that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection pursuant to sections 96 or 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The Refugee Protection Division rejects this claim.\n(signed)\n\"M. Dookun\"\nM.

They claim refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The Principal Claimant alleges persecution in Turkey because of his involvement with the Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi (CHP) party. He states that he was interrogated on two occasions about his CHP activities and that this led him to flee Turkey in June 2017, with his family. He also alleges that he is a Kurd and an Alevi and that this has increased his risk profile.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] The Panel finds that the Claimants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\nMilitary Career\n[4] The Principal Claimant was a member of the Turkish military, specifically the Turkish military police, for 31 years.\n[5] The Panel raised the issue of exclusion with the Minister prior to the hearing of this claim. The Minister indicated that they would not be participating. The Panel had the opportunity to question the Principal Claimant extensively about his career in the military and has determined that exclusion is not an issue in this claim.\nKurdish Alevi Identity\n[6] The Principal Claimant stated that he does not identify strongly either with his Kurdish ethnicity or Alevi faith. He stated that he is a secular Turk. The Panel accepts that the Principal Claimant is of Kurdish ancestry and that his family are also members of the Alevi religion. The Principal Claimant acknowledged that these are not major factors in this claim, but the Panel will take them into consideration below.\nRecent Events in Turkey\n[7] The Panel is aware of the state of emergency that has come into effect since the attempted coup of 2016, and the many other troubling effects that followed the attempted coup of July 2016.\nCHP Party\n[8] The Principal Claimant supports the republican party, also known as the CHP party, which is the party most closely associated with the secular republicanism of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. It is the official opposition party in the current Turkish national assembly, occupying 131 of 550 seats in parliament.2 Its voters and supporters number in the millions.\n[9] Prior to the rise of the Adalet ve Kalkinma (AK) party, the CHP party was in power in Turkey for many years. It is the oldest mainstream political party in Turkey. It is the official opposition party holding having won just over 25% of the popular vote in the last election, with over 12 million one hundred thousand votes.3\n[10] After his military career ended in 2015 the Principal Claimant was legally permitted to join a political party. He joined the CHP party, the party he had always supported and voted for. He stated that he espouses the beliefs of that party, secularism, Kemalism, etc. He devoted a significant amount of his time to volunteering for this party. He was active in the \"No\" campaign in the context of the recent referendum on constitutional amendments in Turkey. The \"No\" side lost the referendum narrowly. The Principal Claimant was one of millions to vote \"No\", and one of hundreds of thousands of volunteers.\n[11] There are many controversial political organizations noted in the objective evidence in Turkey at present including the Kurdistan Worker's Party, the Gulenists, and others. The CHP are not one of them. The CHP as noted is the oldest political party in Turkey, having formed multiple governments previously in the past. It is a well-established mainstream political party.\nPrincipal Claimant Questioned by Police\n[12] On September 19, 2016 the Principal Claimant was called in for questioning by the police in connection with the failed coup attempt that occurred in July of that year. He was released the same day. The Panel does not find this to have been persecutory, as the Turkish police have questioned hundreds of thousands of people in the context of their post-coup investigations.\n[13] He was questioned again on May 19, 2017. He was asked about his CHP activities, any connection with Kurdish groups, his use of social media accounts and telephone apps, the purpose of the United States (US) visa in his passport, etc. The Principal Claimant had nothing to hide and answered all of these questions. He was a member of the CHP, had nothing to do with Kurdish political activism, etc.\n[14] The Principal Claimant alleges that he became afraid after this interview that he would be arrested. He began to fear that he was being followed, when he saw a particular kind of car. However, it is not clear from the Principal Claimant's testimony upon which basis he ought to have been afraid.\n[15] The Panel asked counsel for any reference in either the National Documentation Package (NDP) or the objective material he had tendered that was indicative that members of the CHP, the second largest political party in Turkey, were being targeted, or otherwise subject to persecutory conduct, for their support of that party and its stated objectives. No sources were provided to the Panel in this regard. Accordingly there is no persuasive objective evidence before the Panel which suggests that active members of the CHP part are at risk of persecution at this time in Turkey.\n[16] The questioning of the Principal Claimant by the Turkish authorities on two occasions was not, in the view of the Panel, persecutory. The Principal Claimant has never experienced conduct that would amount to persecution at any time in his life. Yet he asserts that if he returns to Turkey he will suffer persecution on the basis of his affiliation with the CHP and related activities. The Panel does not agree. This assertion is inconsistent with the objective evidence which contains nothing to suggest that volunteering for the CHP party in the manner in which the Principal Claimant did would result in more than a mere possibility of persecution for the Principal Claimant. The Panel finds that this claimant has not established a nexus to a Convention ground.\n[17] Nor, in respect of the Female Claimant and the Child Claimants, is there a nexus to a Convention ground. Their claim is predicated upon the notion that their husband and father is at risk. The Panel finds that the Principal Claimant is not at risk. Therefore the Panel also finds that the Female Claimant and Child Claimants are also not at risk.\nExit from Turkey\n[18] The Principal Claimant alleges that shortly following the second interview he and his family used US visas to exit Turkey for the United States, whereupon they immediately travelled to the US border. As noted above, at this time he believed that he was being followed by secret agents of the Turkish state in unmarked police car. The Principal Claimant stated moreover that the police questioned him on why he had acquired a US visa. In other words, according to the Principal Claimant, the police were specifically interested in the prospect of the Principal Claimant travelling to the United States, and specifically interested in the contents of his passport.\n[19] Nevertheless, the Principal Claimant went on to say that he exited through Ataturk Airport, in Istanbul, with his family, using his own passport, and passed through the security checkpoints there with no difficulty.\n[20] The National Documentation Package for Turkey4 and in particular Response to Information Request (RIR) TUR105394.E5 sets out the stringent checks and procedures for exiting from Turkey through an international airport. If, as the Claimants have alleged, they were wanted by Turkish authorities, it is likely that they would have been detained at the airport.\n[21] The Panel finds that the Claimants knew that Turkish authorities were not looking for them; if they sincerely believed that they were wanted by state agents, they would not have presented themselves to them at exit control using their own passports. The Panel makes a negative credibility finding against the Claimants in this regard.\nRESIDUAL PROFILE AS ALEVIS\n[22] The Panel accepts that the Claimants are members of the Alevi faith, and, at least in part, ethnically Kurdish. The Panel finds that this, in and of itself, is not sufficient to ground this claim.\n[23] The NDP at item 1.8 contains a report from the UK Border Agency titled Operational Guidance note for Turkey.\n[24] With respect to Claimants of the Alevi faith, the report concludes as follows at section 3.11.10.\nA claimant of the Alevi faith is unlikely to encounter ill-treatment by the authorities amounting to persecution solely on the grounds of religious belief.\nIn cases where membership of the Alevi faith is cited as the sole basis of claim, internal relocation to another such area to escape this threat is viable. Turkish citizens belonging to the Alevi religious faith may face some unequal treatment or discrimination within Turkey this does not generally reach the level of persecution. Therefore it is unlikely that applicants in this category whose claims are based solely on persecution due to their belonging to the Alevi religious faith would qualify for a grant of asylum or Humanitarian Protection and such claims are likely to be clearly unfounded.6\n[25] The Panel finds that the Claimants Alevi ethnic identity does not, in and of itself, give rise to a well-founded fear of persecution.\nRESIDUAL PROFILE AS KURDS\n[26] It is clear from the country documentation that while Kurds continue to face societal discrimination, the situation is not generally such that Kurds as a whole face such treatment as would amount to persecution, a danger of torture, or a risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\n[27] As noted in the National Documentation Package, the Report by the United Kingdom Home Office, notes as follows in its conclusion, quote;\nAlthough Turkish citizens of Kurdish ethnic origin may face some unequal treatment or discrimination, both from the authorities and the general population, this does not generally reach the level of persecution or breach of Article 3 of the ECHR.\nTherefore, it is unlikely that applicants in this category whose claims are based solely on persecution due to their Kurdish ethnicity would quality for a grant of asylum or humanitarian protection, and such claims are likely to be clearly unfounded.7\n[28] The UK Home Office in their report of February 2016 concludes as follows:\nEven when taken cumulatively, the discrimination faced by Kurds does not in general amount to them being subject to action on the part either of the populace or authorities which would amount to persecution within the terms of the Refugee Convention or otherwise inhuman or degrading treatment. Each case must be assessed on its own merits, taking full account of the particular circumstances and profile of the person and any past persecution.8\n[29] The Panel finds that the Principal Claimant has not established that should he return to Turkey, there is more than a mere possibility that he would be persecuted on the basis of his Kurdish ethnicity, or for the same reasons, that on a balance of probabilities he faces a personal danger of torture or a risk to life or of cruel or unusual treatment or punishment.\n[30] While the situation in Turkey has deteriorated, merely to establish Kurdish ethnicity is not sufficient to meet the legal threshold for a positive refugee determination.\n[31] It is significant moreover that the Principal Claimant himself does not identity strongly as a Kurd politically, and acknowledged that, in the main, his claim before the Refugee Protection Division was predicated upon his activities with the CHP. He suggested at one point that he also supported the HDP, which is largely a Kurdish political party, but after some questions from the Panel the Principal Claimant acknowledged that he had a membership in and donated only to the CHP party. The Panel accepts that there are aspects of the HDP platform that may appeal to this claimant. But the Principal Claimant acknowledged that his partisan political affiliation was not with the HDP but with the CHP.\n[32] Moreover, the Principal Claimant stated that he was not an actively practicing Alevi, but regarded Alevism as a significant part of his cultural heritage.\nPSYCHOLOGICAL REPORT\n[33] A report was submitted to the Panel by XXXX XXXX, which comprises Exhibit 10 in respect of the Principal Claimant. She appears to have adopted as assumed facts the allegations in the BOC, many of which are re-iterated in her report. Ms. XXXX opines that the Principal Claimant has symptoms consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder, \"anxiety disorder\", and \"depressive disorder\". She suggests that these aspects of his current functioning could affect his ability to give testimony.\n[34] Justice Annis provided some caution to decision-makers in the case of Czesak v. M.C.I. when he discussed psychological reports submitted into evidence before administrative tribunals:\nOur legal system has a long experience in dealing with forensic experts testifying on matters relating to technical evidence for the purpose of assisting courts in their determinations. From that experience, the courts have developed what I would describe as a guarded and cautionary view on conclusions of forensic experts which have not undergone a rigorous validation process under court procedures.\n...\nThis is not to say that every expert report prepared for litigation should be dismissed as having no, or little, weight. But what the court's experience with forensic experts does suggest in relation to these reports being proffered before administrative tribunals where there exists no defined procedure to allow for their validation, is that caution should be exercised in accepting them at face value, particularly when they propose to settle important issues to be decided by the tribunal. In my view therefore, unless there is some means to corroborate either the neutrality or lack of self-interest of the expert in relation to the litigation process, they generally should be accorded little weight.9\n[35] The Panel notes that Ms. XXXX did not appear to testify in support of the Claimants or to be cross-examined on her reports. Taking into account these foregoing reasons, I give the psychological report little weight in corroborating the allegations of the Claimants. Moreover, the Principal Claimant exhibited no difficulty in testifying at the hearing.\n[36] Moreover, in both reports, Ms. XXXX speculates about what the future would entail for the Claimants if they were returned to Turkey. She alleges that if the Claimants are returned to Turkey in the future, their psychological symptoms will worsen.10 However in doing so she has assumed as true the very facts at issue in this hearing, many of which the Panel has not accepted, as noted above.\n[37] The Panel finds that the psychotherapist has inserted her own speculative opinion about the matter at issue in the Claimants' asylum claims. The psychotherapist has done what Justice Annis warned of in the case of Czesak v. M.C.I. when he discussed psychological reports submitted into evidence before administrative tribunals:\nMoreover, I am of the view that decision-makers should be wary of reliance upon forensic expert evidence obtained for the purpose of litigation, unless it is subject to some form of validation. This remark would apply to the report of Dr. Koczorowska which went as far as to advocate on the applicant's behalf in the guise of an opinion on the very issue before the panel.11 [emphasis added]\nCONCLUSION\n[38] The Panel finds that there is not a serious possibility of persecution and that the Claimants would not be subjected personally on a balance of probabilities to a risk to life, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture should they return to Turkey.\n[39] The Panel finds that the Claimants are neither a Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. Accordingly, these claims are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"J. Yousif\"\nJ.

He argued that in assessing the claim, the panel should look at the Falun Gong activities of the claimant here in Canada, to determine whether she is a genuine Falun Gong practitioner because if she is, based on this evidence alone, there is no need to consider whether she was a Falun Gong practitioner in China. In other words, since the panel must assess the risk the claimant would face if she were to return to China, and whether her activities here in Canada put her at risk, it makes sense to deal with the evidence of her activities here in Canada in the interests of efficiency since whether she is a Falun gong practitioner in China is not determinative of the case.\n[5] This approach has its merits subject to two caveats. The evidence from China is still relevant in assessing the evidence as a whole, and the fundamental question of whether the claimant is a genuine Falun Gong practitioner, whether in China or in Canada.\n[6] Secondly, I agree with the approach presented by Judge de Montigny in Chen v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration),2 where the judge had this to say:\n[25] ... the second issue raised by the applicant is more serious. The Board accepted that the applicant attends a Christian church in Canada, but concluded he is not a genuine Christian. The Board said the witness lacked credibility, and as such, concluded that he acquired his knowledge of Christianity in Canada to bolster a manufactured refugee claim and not because he is committed to Christianity... [26] This finding is questionable as it falls far short of explaining why the Board does not believe that the applicant is not a genuine Christian. The Board could reasonably come to the conclusion, based on the applicant's lack of credibility, that he had not been a member of an underground church in China. However, in light of his intimate knowledge of the Christian faith, his baptismal certificate and the letter provided by his pastor attesting that he attends church on a regular basis, the Board had to come up with an explanation as to why the applicant was not a true Christian at least since he came to Canada. Indeed, I find this case to be on all four with the decision reached by Justice Lagac\u00e9 in Yonghai Jiang v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2008 FC 635 (CanLII). In that case, the applicant had similarly submitted a baptismal certificate as well as a letter from a Canadian reverend attesting to the applicant's active membership in the same congregation. Coming to the conclusion that the Board's failure to address these relevant pieces of evidence constitutes a reviewable error, Justice Lagac\u00e9 wrote:\nIt could very well be that the Board did not believe that the Applicant was a genuine good faith practitioner of the Christian faith and did not accept the pieces of evidence which supported his contentions, but if this was the case, it should have addressed the matter and said so. It does not appear from the decision that the Board did address the evidence supporting the Applicant's contention on this issue.A statement in the Board's decision that \"[a]ny knowledge that the claimant has learned about Christianity could easily have been learned here in Canada\" in insufficient and does not address the issue (...).\n[27] That error led to a further mistake, that of not assessing whether the applicant should be considered as a refugee sur-place. Whatever may have been the motives of the applicant to convert to Christianity, the Board had an obligation to conduct a meaningful analysis to determine whether he would be at risk if removed to China. On this point, I am in complete agreement with my colleague Justice Blanchard in Ejtehadian v. The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, 2007 FC 158 (CanLII), where he stated (at para. 11):\nIn a refugee sur-place claim, credible evidence of a claimant's activities while in Canada that are likely to substantiate any potential harm upon return must be expressly considered by the IRB even if the motivation behind the activities is non-genuine: Mbokoso v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, [1999] F.C.J. No. 1806 (QL). The IRB's negative decision is based on a finding that the Applicant's conversion is not genuine, and \"nothing more than an alternative means to remain in Canada and claim refugee status.\" The IRB accepted that the Applicant had converted and that he was even ordained as a priest in the Mormon faith. The IRB also accepted the documentary evidence to the effect that apostates are persecuted in Iran. In assessing the Applicant's risks of return, in the context of a sur-place claim, it is necessary to consider the credible evidence of his activities while in Canada, independently from his motives for conversion. Even if the Applicant's motives for conversion are not genuine, as found by the IRB here, the consequential imputation of apostasy to the Applicant by the authorities in Iran may nonetheless be sufficient to bring him within the scope of the convention definition.See also: Guobao Huang v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2008 FC 132 (CanLII), at para. 8; YanLing Li v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2008 FC 266 (CanLII), at paras. 24-25.\n[7] Thus, the panel must firstly determine whether the claimant is a genuine Falun Gong practitioner, at least since coming to Canada. Secondly, the panel must assess whether the claimant's activities here in Canada put her at risk, regardless of her motivation for practising Falun Gong.\nALLEGATIONS\n[8] The claimant's allegations are as set out in her Basis of Clam (BOC) and will not be repeated here.3 Briefly put, the claimant alleges that she was a genuine Falun Gong practitioner in China. She joined a practice group. The practice group was raided. The claimant then went into hiding at her aunt's house. The claimant then had the help of a smuggler to obtain a US visa, and left China on her genuine passport. She went to the US. She then crossed into Canada illegally.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[9] The claimant has proved her personal identity and identity as a citizen of China, based on a certified true copy of her Resident ID card and a copy of her Household Register.4 Her identity as a genuine Falun Gong practitioner is more problematic and therefore will be dealt with below in more detail.\nCredibility\n[10] The panel had the following credibility concerns with regards to the claimant's evidence.\nWhether the claimant is a genuine Falun Gong practitioner in Canada\n[11] One way to assess whether a claimant is a genuine Falun Gong practitioner, is by looking at the knowledge they have of their \"religion.\"\n[12] In assessing the claimant's knowledge of Falun Gong, the panel notes the following comments from the Refugee Appeal Division, on the issue of Falun Gong practice (RAD TB6-17595):\nThe RPD found that the Appellant had a reasonable understanding of concepts, and listed the concepts of the law wheel, the fourth talk in Zhuan Falun, attachments, black matter, and white matter. However, based on the negative credibility issues made earlier in its decision, the RPD stated that Appellant was not a genuine practitioner. The RPD stated that Falun Gong can be learned, by those who are non-genuine practitioners, through memorization over a short period of time. The RPD stated, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant's ability to articulate concepts of Falun is not sufficient to establish her genuineness of practice.\nThe Appellant submits that the RPD's acceptance of her articulation of Falun Gong concepts clearly indicates that her membership in Falun Gong is not in dispute. She also submits that the RPD's approach to analyzing her Falun Gong activity was flawed. Following the practice by the RPD in this instance would mean that any refugee claimant with any negative credibility inferences drawn against them will invariably fail to prove their religious identity. The Appellant submits that her testimony regarding the Falun Gong practice in China was detailed adequately.\nThe RAD has listened to the recording of the RPD hearing, and disagrees with the finding of the RPD. The questions asked by the RPD were factual, not conceptual. With respect to the factual questions, the RAD agrees with the RPD that they can be learned, and responding accurately to these questions does not lead to the Appellant being considered a genuine practitioner. It is necessary to address how each of these factual answers fits conceptually into the practice of Falun Gong. How these Falun gong concepts fit into the practice of Falun gong is a much more complex issue and can be one of the tools used in determining the genuineness of practice of an alleged Falun Gong practitioner. In addition, the RAD finds that the credibility issues addressed earlier in the RPD decision, are insufficient to be used as a determiner of the genuineness of her practice. The RAD is unable to make a determination of the genuineness of the Appellant's Falun Gong practice given the information in testimony before it.5 [Emphasis added]\n[13] In this claim, the claimant was asked about the factual aspects of Falun Gong by the panel, and about the conceptual aspects by her counsel.\n[14] The claimant was able to recite the 5 verses without error. She has been studying Falun Gong since July 2016, so this was not surprising. Her counsel asked her some basic questions about Falun Gong theory, such as gain and loss, and the transformation of Karma. This is the conceptual side of Falun Gong.\n[15] She said \"loss\" refers to loss of desires and attachments, such as competitiveness and jealously. She said to \"gain\" is to get white substance, to upgrade the mind and nature. The second part of her answer is not correct. \"Gain\" means an improvement of your level, and eventually, it means to attain Right Fruit and complete cultivation and solve the fundamental issue. \"Right Fruit\" in turn, means the attainment of Right Fruit status in the Buddha school.6 \"White substance\" or \"de\" is acquired by doing good deeds.\n[16] The claimant confused \"white substance\" and \"Right Fruit,\" two distinct concepts, and also she did not know what \"gain\" means.\n[17] This is a basic concept of Falun Gong. As a result, the panel draws a negative credibility inference.\n[18] The claimant was asked about the transformation of Karma. She said that it means to transform dark substances into white substances in a person, primarily by doing good deeds, ridding one's self of attachments such as jealously.\n[19] This answer is also half correct. In order to transform karma, the other half of the equation is that one must suffer, sacrifice and endure tribulation.7\n[20] This is a major error in one of the ABC's of Falun Gong theory. The claimant got it wrong.\n[21] The panel finds that quoting verses does not show true knowledge of Falun Gong. The claimant's whole case is that she started learning Falun Gong to transform Karma into virtue, and yet some 1.5 years after she started to practice, including time here in Canada, she could not account for half the method by which Karma is transformed.\n[22] As a result, the panel draws and negative credibility inference.\n[23] The claimant produced two letters from practitioners in Canada. The first writer, XXXX XXXX, provided no ID, and thus her identity could not be confirmed. The letter is short. It gives no real basis to conclude that the claimant is a genuine Falun Gong practitioner. The second letter is from XXXX XXXX. It says the claimant is a \"kind Falun gong practitioner.\" But kindness does not make one a genuine Falun gong practitioner. One needs to know the religion, practice on a regular basis, etc.\n[24] The panel finds the letters do not assist in determining whether the claimant is a genuine Falun Gong practitioner, and are therefore given no weight.\n[25] The claimant provided faxed photos, which were basically black. Originals were produced at the hearing. They show the claimant doing the exercises at Pacific Mall. The panel finds that the photos, taken on one or two occasions, do not demonstrate that the claimant has been practising on a sustained basis here in Canada.\n[26] The claimant testified that she practices Falun Gong every morning at 9 am, five times a week, at Pacific Mall. There is a tutor who teaches the group. The tutor does not allow pictures to be taken. The claimant said the tutor would correct her motions. The claimant was asked whether she had asked the tutor for a letter in support of her claim. She said that she had not, because if they were not allowed to take photos, then for sure she could not get a letter.\n[27] She also studies Zhuan Falun at XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[28] The panel finds that there is insufficient evidence that the claimant is a genuine Falun Gong practitioner in Canada. Her lack of knowledge, lack of supporting documents or other evidence, or even witnesses, fall short of the standard required, being a balance of probabilities.\n[29] The panel finds that the claimant is not a genuine Falun Gong practitioner in Canada, nor is there any evidence that her activities here in Canada would put her at risk back in China. As a result, the panel draws a negative credibility inference.\nWhether the claimant was a genuine Falun Gong practitioner in China\n[30] The claimant was asked about whether she had any evidence of her practice of Falun Gong in China. For example, whether she had any evidence from the other 11 practitioners who were there at the time of the raid. She did not. She said the reason was because they don't write letters about it and she did not ask for them.\n[31] She said there were no official documents, because the practice of Falun Gong is based on voluntary participation.\n[32] She was asked whether she contacted Ms. XXXX XXXX the teacher of Falun Gong in China. The claimant had her number due to the lookout arrangement at the practice groups. The claimant said she did not because \"the phone was just used for that one occasion.\"\n[33] She was asked if she made any effort to contact the other 12 members, and she said she did not. She said she was afraid to make calls. The panel reminded her that she had contacted her family after she came to Canada. She said that she contacted her family via WeeChat and QQ. She was reminded that she provided two letters from practitioners in Toronto, as to her practice here.\n[34] The claimant said that after the raid, she did not collect information about her practice back in China. She was asked if she had any information from XXXX, her other friend who had also gone into hiding. She did not ask her for a letter either. She said that she did not do so because she did not think that it would be useful for the hearing.\n[35] The panel does not accept the reasons given by the claimant for not providing any evidence of her practice of Falun Gong in China. Guangzhou city China is an extremely modern, well developed city. Its technological sophistication rivals that of any modern G7 country. It has modern infrastructure for telecommunications.\n[36] The claimant made no effort to get information from her fellow practitioners about her practice in China. There were no letters, faxes, emails, nothing at all. Yet she claims she practised with 12 others for some one year. There is not a trace of her practice there. Even in a voluntary practice group, where the location for the group was always changing, there would need to be co-ordination by email or text to arrange these meetings. There could be photos of the group together in practice, or videos. The claimant would have had these details on her mobile phone or written down. Yet she brought nothing in this respect to the hearing nor did she try.\n[37] As a result, the panel draws a negative credibility inference about the claimant's alleged practice in China.\nSubpoena\n[38] Now, the claimant produced a subpoena which is at Exhibit 5.\n[39] The panel would refer to CHN104188.E in the NDP at Exhibit 3. Summonses and subpoenas are commonly issued in China. That Response to Information Request refers to subpoenas, and it says that they are served by courts to all parties to criminal proceedings to appear in court. It also notes that fewer than 10 percent of subpoenaed witnesses appear in court, and it also notes that Chinese Courts have subpoena powers, but no legal penalty has been set for not complying with a court subpoena.\n[40] So, it is clear that these subpoenas are issued, but they are not often adhered to, and they are not often enforced, and they are often just disregarded in China.\n[41] So, the panel has to consider the subpoena within the preponderance of the evidence as a whole. And the panel finds that even if it shows that the claimant was wanted for questioning, in relation to Falun Gong, so would anybody else that was being investigated in that particular case, and that it is not unique to her. They are issued to all parties in criminal proceedings.\n[42] So, the panel finds it does not really advance her claim one way or another, particularly in light of the other findings, and the negative credibility findings which have been made in relation to her knowledge of Falun Gong practice and knowledge.\n[43] So, the panel would also note that fraudulent documents are common in China. (See CHN104579.E, Item 3.22 of the NDP Exhibit 3)\n[44] Moreover, the summons was not followed by either a criminal summons, a coercive summons, or a public security summons, as would be the case if she was wanted by the PSB for failure to show up at the time specified in the first summons: (See Exhibit 3, Response to Information Request CHN105217.E.)\n[45] As a result, the panel concludes the claimant was not wanted by the PSB when she left China, nor was she wanted after she left China.\nLocation of Practice Groups in China\n[46] The claimant stated in her BOC that the location of the practice groups changed and lookouts were arranged for safety reasons. But in her testimony, she said that the majority of the practice sessions were held at the home of XXXX XXXX XXXX. She said, in one day, they may practice 2-3 times. She said that if they changed location with so many people, it did not look good. The claimant could not provide a rational explanation for the inconsistency. She said that \"locations were changed, but in a month, I could practice 2-3 time on average, and I go home on Saturday and Sunday.\" This answer not only did not address the inconsistency, and merely re-asserted it, but also, it contradicted her testimony that they may practice 2-3 times in one day. As a result, the panel draws a negative credibility inference.\n[47] The panel finds as a result that the claimant was not genuine Falun Gong practitioner in China.\nIllegal Entry into Canada\n[48] The claimant alleges that she went to the US on a genuine PRC passport with a US visa. It was after this that a summons was issued against her.\n[49] But the panel has already concluded that the claimant was not wanted by the PSB. As a result, her life was not in danger in the US, nor did she face a serious possibility of persecution if she was returned to China from the US.\n[50] As a result, there is no justification for her illegal entry into Canada from the US, and the panel draws a negative credibility inference.\n[51] She was also asked what happened to her passport. She said that the snakehead brought her to Toronto, but because her parents had not paid off the debt the passport was kept by the snakehead.\n[52] This was also stated in her schedule 12, which stated that the snakehead was still owed US$10,000.\n[53] Of course, it is trite law that sworn evidence is presumed to be true unless it is found not to be so.\n[54] It was only after the panel asked further questions that the claimant said that in fact the debt had been paid off in October 2017, but that the snakehead had said on the phone that he would call in two weeks about the return of the passport but he never did.\n[55] Here is yet another contradiction in her testimony (i.e. she said initially that the debt was not paid off, but then later said that it had been paid off), and also between her testimony and Schedule 12. As a result, the panel draws a negative credibility inference.\nCONCLUSION\n[56] The panel has found that the claimant is not a genuine Falun Gong practitioner in Canada, and that there is not a risk that she would come to the attention of the authorities in China for her activities here, since she is not wanted in China. This then disposes of any sur place claim.\n[57] Her s. 96 and 97 claims are both rejected for lack of credibility.\n[58] As a result, the claim is dismissed.\n[59] The panel has found that she is not a genuine Falun Gong practitioner and that she is not wanted by the PSB, and the panel therefore concludes that the summons tendered is fraudulent.\n[60] As a result, the panel concludes that the claim is manifestly unfounded pursuant to s. 107.1 of the IRPA.\n(signed)\n\"J.

As well, the Taliban has threatened to kill him for working too closely with women. He states that there is nowhere in Afghanistan where he could live safely and that state protection would not be available to him because of the reach of the Taliban and other non-state actors who view his former activities as foreign to Afghani culture.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] The panel finds that the claimant has not met the evidentiary burden of establishing, on a balance of probabilities, that there is a serious possibility that he would be persecuted if he returned to Afghanistan or that he would personally be subjected to a danger of torture, or a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment upon return to Afghanistan. Therefore, the panel determines that the claimant is not a Convention refugee nor is he a person in need of protection.\nISSUES\n[4] The issues to be determined at the hearing were, the claimant's personal identity; his profile as a male working with women to further women's development; and credibility.\nANALYSIS\n[5] In coming to its decision the panel considered the totality of the evidence, including the oral testimony and the documentary evidence tendered in the claim.\nIdentity\n[6] The identity of the claimant was an important issue to be determined in the hearing because he travelled to Canada using false documents. He stated that he left Afghanistan with a Canadian Permanent Resident Card and an Afghani passport, neither of which belonged to him. At the hearing, the claimant tendered copies of his Afghani passport and his Tazkira (Afghani identity document). He testified that his family in Afghanistan had sent him the Tazkira and that he used that document to obtain his passport. He also submitted a copy of his marriage certificate as well as a copy of his divorce certificate. The marriage certificate listed the number of his Tazkira. It matched the number provided on the copy of the Tazkira that was exhibited.\n[7] On the basis of these documents the panel finds that the claimant has satisfactorily established his personal identity and his identity as a citizen of Afghanistan.\nThe Claimant's Professional Profile\n[8] The claimant's professional profile is at the heart of this claim. He alleged that he and nine other students formed the \"Education, Scientific Research Organisation\" while he was in the third year of his university studies. He sought to establish his profile within that organisation in a number of ways. The claimant submitted a copy of the organisation's licence, issued by the Afghan Ministry of Justice.3 After graduation, the organisation began to work in the area of women's rights. One of their first projects was sponsored by an arm of US AID, the Ambassador's Small Grants Programme. The grant allowed the claimant's organisation to carry out work with disadvantaged Afghani women. The claimant submitted a copy of a certificate attesting to the fact that the organisation had successfully completed the project.4\n[9] The claimant alleges that his work with women is what led to whispers and threats against him and ultimately what led to him having to flee Afghanistan.\n[10] He submitted a letter signed by XXXX XXXX XXXX to support his claim that he was a part of the Education, Scientific Research Organisation, which letter attested to the claimant being a permanent member of the \"Aamozish\" Scientific Research Organisation.5 Ms. XXXX letter also stated that the claimant had been forced to leave Afghanistan due to the warnings and pressures he faced.\n[11] The claimant also tendered a number of photographs. The first nine photographs depict him at his graduation ceremony6. The claimant appears in four of the remaining photographs. In all four he is by himself. The remaining photographs show a group of Afghani women being spoken to by an Afghan woman.7 The claimant was asked about the photographs; when they were taken and where they were taken. He responded that the three photographs on page 39 were taken in Bamyan province when he had gone there to try to convince local elders to permit a tailoring initiative for women. The other photograph shows him pointing to a wall chart during the 5th workshop.8\n[12] The claimant submits that the photographs and documents tendered are positive proof that he was a member of the Education, Scientific Research Organisation. The panel disagrees. The licence tendered does not name the claimant in any way; neither is he mentioned in the completion of grants certificate. While, these omissions by themselves are not determinative of the claimant's participation in this organisation, the omissions are significant in light of the fact that the claimant relies so heavily on these documents. Furthermore, given that he is not named in the documents, the panel finds that it would have been reasonable for the claimant to obtain and tender other documents that could prove more specifically his participation in this organization.\n[13] The letter from XXXX XXXX, also does not assist the claimant in establishing his claim that he was a member of the Education, Scientific Research Organisation because the letter is vague on details as to the actual role the claimant played in that organisation. For this reason the panel gave it little weight.\n[14] The panel came to the same conclusion about the photographs. Without disputing that the claimant is pictured in all four photographs in which he is shown, the panel finds that the photographs alone cannot provide support towards the conclusion that the claimant had the role in the group that he alleged, or in fact any role at all. The photographs on page 39 show the claimant against the backdrop of a dock, this alone cannot establish the purpose of the claimant's visit.9 Neither does the fact that he appears to carrying a file folder in one of the pictures establish the contents of the folder or the purpose of the claimant's visit.\n[15] With regard to the photograph where the claimant is pointing to a wall chart, the panel notes that the claimant appears to be the only person in the room. Thus, it cannot be inferred from this photograph that he was addressing the group of women, or indeed, anyone at all. Accordingly, the photograph does not support a finding that that the claimant had the role in the organization he alleged.\n[16] In assessing the credibility of the claimant's evidence, the panel is guided by the statements of the Federal Court of Appeal, which noted that the Refugee Protection Division, (the RPD), does not necessarily have to accept a claimants' testimony simply because it was not contradicted at the hearing. The RPD is entitled to make reasonable findings based on implausibilities, common sense and rationality, and may reject evidence if it is not consistent with the probabilities affecting the case as a whole. The RPD may rely on rationality and common sense. In this respect, the British Columbia Court of Appeal stated in Faryna v. Chorny: -\nThe credibility of interested witness, particularly in cases of conflict of evidence, cannot be gauged solely by the test of whether the personal demeanour of the particular witness carried the conviction of truth. The test must reasonably subject his story to an examination of its consistency with the probabilities that surround the currently existing conditions. In short, the real test of the truth of the story of a witness in such a case must be its harmony with the preponderance of the probabilities which a practical and informed person would readily recognize as reasonable in that place and in those conditions.10\n[17] Based on its analysis of the claimant's evidence as set out above, notwithstanding the fact that the claimant provided his testimony in a seemingly straightforward manner and given that there was little inconsistency between his testimony and his statement in his PIF and at the Port of Entry, the panel finds that there was insufficient credible evidence on which it could conclude that the claimant had the role in the Education, Scientific Research Organisation that he claimed to have had.\nThe Claimant's Flight from Afghanistan\n[18] The panel had reason to doubt and reject the claimant's testimony concerning the way in which he was able to leave Afghanistan and come to Canada. As stated earlier the claimant used false documents to come to Canada. The panel put a number of questions to the claimant about how he was able to acquire these documents. The panel found his explanation regarding the Canadian Permanent Resident Card to lack the ring of truth. It was the claimant's evidence that he happened to notice this card in the possession of his cousin, who had only returned to Afghanistan shortly before the Taliban threatened to kill the claimant.\n[19] In response to the panel, the claimant stated that he noticed the card in his cousin's pocket. He expanded upon this response when asked further by his counsel. He stated that he noticed that his cousin had the card when they went to buy groceries. Two things about the claimant's evidence do not ring true. First, he stated in his PIF that he knew when he saw it that the card did not belong to his cousin, but instead to his cousin's roommate. This begs the question as to how the roommate's permanent resident card would have come to be in the possession of the claimant's cousin by accident, as was originally claimed. The claimant flatly denied that his cousin had taken the card with him to Afghanistan in order to facilitate the claimant's travel, for which purpose it was ultimately used. Secondly, this alternate explanation for how he came to know about the roommate's permanent resident card was given for the first time at the hearing. Nowhere in the PIF is it mentioned that the claimant saw the card while he and his cousin were shopping for groceries. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant's testimony in this regard, evolved to address the implausibility of him seeing a card that he initially testified happened to be in his cousin's pocket.\n[20] In fact, the claimant demonstrated a lack of straightforwardness when he denied at the Port of Entry that he had family and friends in Canada, since as he later stated he had a cousin living in Canada. The panel does not accept that he withheld the truth because he did not want to implicate either his cousin or his cousin's roommate, given that the claimant stated in his PIF that he returned the permanent resident card to his cousin while they were in flight. In the panel's view, the claimant's lack of straightforwardness in regards to this critical aspect of his claim, impeaches the overall credibility of his testimony.\nWill the Claimant face a Risk of Persecution if returned to Afghanistan?\n[21] The claimant's counsel submitted that the claimant would face persecution if he were returned to Afghanistan because he would continue his work and because he would be deemed to have become \"westernized\" and, therefore, not trustworthy. He submitted that state protection would not be available to him and that there was nowhere in Afghanistan that the claimant could go.\n[22] For the reasons set out earlier, the panel is not persuaded that the claimant would face persecution upon return to Afghanistan for these reasons. Furthermore, the claimant could be said to have already been westernized as his everyday form of dress as well as his dress during the graduation ceremony could be described as \"western\", yet this formed no part of his claim.\n[23] In the circumstances of this claim, the panel finds that the issue of state protection is rendered moot.\nCONCLUSION\n[24] The claimant alleged that he has a well-founded fear of persecution in Afghanistan based on his political opinion, or imputed political opinion, as a man who worked with women to promoted women's rights. For the reasons set out above, the panel finds that he has not met his onus to establish that he has the profile he claimed. Accordingly, the panel finds that he is not a Convention refugee as defined by section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. For the same reasons the panel also finds that the claimant is not a person in need of protection as set out in section 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[25] The claim is rejected.\n(signed)\n\"H.

In addition, the principal claimant bases his claim on membership in a particular social group, namely stateless Palestinians who are coerced into being informants for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) government. The female claimant bases her claim on that of the principal claimant and membership in a particular social group, namely women who are subject to unwanted touching by a male employer. In addition, she does not want to adhere to the strict dress code imposed by society and government policy upon women in the KSA. Furthermore, she is politically opposed to the restrictions on women in the social sphere, including the ban on women driving or going out without a male escort.\n[3] The panel has considered the Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-related Persecution3 in its assessment of all the relevant facts. The panel took into consideration cultural norms and the fact that evidence is heard through an interpreter.\n[4] Post-hearing, the Minister forwarded a U.S.A. visa application4 to the panel and counsel. Written submissions5 were received from counsel on October 2, 2017. The panel considered both exhibits in its deliberation.\nHISTORY OF CLAIM\n[5] The claimants arrived in the U.S.A. on XXXX XXXX, 2017 and claimed refugee status at the Fort Erie border on XXXX XXXX, 2017. The principal claimant stated that he had a brother in Canada who was found eligible to have his refugee claim referred to the RPD. The principal claimant presented documents showing that he and his brother share the same birth parents. As a result, the examining officer believed that the principal claimant is eligible to have his claim and that of his wife referred to the RPD, as they meet an exception to the Safe Third Country Agreement.6 They have a Canadian born son who was born in XXXX 2017.\nALLEGATIONS\n[6] The following is a summary of the written narrative contained in the principal claimant's Basis of Claim (BOC) form.7 He is 32 years of age and he was born in KSA of Palestinian parents who lived there because of employment. The female claimant is of the same background and they are cousins. He allegedly could not play on a soccer team in high school and was not allowed to attend university in KSA.\n[7] The principal claimant studied in Jordan from 2003 to 2008. He returned to KSA in 2008 and had difficulty finding employment. He stated that he had many difficulties in his job, such as lower pay and technical positions. He was employed as a XXXX XXXX from XXXX 2010 to XXXX XXXX, 2014 by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.8 This employment was renewed in from 2014 to 2017, as evidenced by a letter he submitted from this company who states his position as XXXX XXXX.9\n[8] The principal claimant's problems began after he returned from a business trip to Spain. On June 20, 2017, he received a strange call from a man who introduced himself from a security apparatus. He said he needed my help and indicated he knew the claimant's history in KSA and told him to attend at an office one week later. After discussing with his father and brother, he met the man who identified himself as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX from the Bureau of Investigation and Prosecution. He wanted him to inform on three colleagues. He related this information to his father.\n[9] The claimants left on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017 to the UAE and then to the U.S.A. and made refugee claims at Canadian border on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017.\n[10] The principal claimant's narrative describes the discrimination his wife experienced. She could not attend university in KSA. Therefore, she studied Dentistry in Egypt. She had difficulty finding a job in KSA. She experienced sexual harassment from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, her employer. She alleged her employer has brothers employed as law enforcement officers. On May 20, 2017, after an inappropriate touch, she slapped her employer and left her job.\nISSUES\n[11] The issues in these claims are identity, country of habitual residence and credibility.\nIDENTITY\n[12] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants are stateless Palestinians based on information contained in the certified true copies of their Palestinian passports and Egyptian travel documents.10\nCountry of Habitual Residence\n[13] The panel finds that the claimants established their personal identities and that they are stateless Palestinians whose last country of habitual residence is the KSA based on the testimony and copies of their travel documents.11 In addition, the panel finds that the claimants established they have no other country of habitual residence available to them.\nCREDIBILITY\nCredibility was raised as a potential issue at the beginning of the hearing\n[14] The following examples are some of the negative credibility findings. The Federal Court of Appeal stated in Maldonado,12 that when a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true unless this is a valid reason to doubt their truthfulness.\n[15] The Federal Court of Appeal stated, in Orelien13 that \"One cannot be satisfied that the evidence is credible or trustworthy, unless satisfied that it is probably so, not just possibly so.\"\n[16] The panel also refers to the Federal Court decision Muhammad,14 wherein Mr. Justice Shore states:\nThe Court agrees with Justice Peter B. Annis who disagreed with the statements that \"plausibility findings are dangerous and should only be made in the clearest of cases\" [Emphasis in original.] (Bercasio v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 244 at para 29). There is a need for plausibility findings; however, must be based on either significant subjective, or objective evidence, or both which in this case, they are.\nPlausibility of not reporting the incident gave rise to his departure from Saudi Arabia\n[17] The principal claimant alleged that two weeks prior to his departure from KSA, he received a telephone call from a man who was from the Bureau of Investigation and Public Prosecution of the government of KSA. The government employee wanted to meet with the principal claimant. An appointment was set up for June 27, 2017. The principal claimant phoned his father who advised him to attend the meeting. When asked why he did not report this incident to his superior at work, he said he was afraid. He attended the meeting and met XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who informed him that he was to gather information on two colleagues and one friend. When asked what information pertaining to the three men was required, he said, \"Information that was discussed with the three colleagues.\" The principal claimant said he agreed because he was afraid. XXXX scheduled another meeting one month later. When asked if he reported the meeting with XXXX to the security department of his company, he said no. When asked why not, he said that he did not think that the company could do anything. The company is a Saudi owned and has 75 employees. When asked again why he did not tell his employer that a government official was pressuring him to be an informant, he said, \"I was afraid and XXXX said not to tell anyone.\" When it was pointed out to him that the information that XXXX told him not to tell anyone was not included in his BOC narrative, he was evasive and unable to provide a reasonable explanation for the omission. This story simply does not have the ring of truth. The principal claimant has worked for this company called XXXX since 2010 and he has been promoted to XXXX XXXX.15 This company has sponsored him to take a workshop titled XXXX XXXX XXXX in Riyadh in March 2011.16 He was sponsored to attend workshops in the U.S.A. in 2011 and 2015, although he said that because he was Palestinean he had to pay. There is no reliable evidence before the panel to support this allegation. The company sent him to Spain in 2017 and issued a letter to the Spanish Embassy in Riyadh17 indicating that the company intended to send the claimant to Spain on frequent visits in the future and requested a multiple entry visa. The letter also stated that the company will be responsible for his expenses. The principal claimant is a university educated professional man who was born in KSA, received his elementary and secondary education in KSA and has been employed in KSA since he graduated as an engineer. He has not provided a reasonable explanation for not reporting the incident to any of his superiors at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He was not even able to recap the conversation that took place during an alleged two hour meeting with XXXX, the government employee at the Bureau of Investigation and Public Prosecution. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant fabricated a story in order to support a fraudulent refugee claim. The panel therefore does not believe that the principal claimant was being pressured by a government employee of KSA to be an informant. It is the principal claimant's own evidence that he did not resign and there is no evidence before the panel that he cannot return to KSA where his entire family has lived for years.\n[18] The principal claimant said that he faced persecution since birth. He faced racism at school where he was unable to attend university in KSA and he had to go to Jordan. He described discrimination at work as not being able to enter certain work sites. The panel finds that what the principal claimant described can be described as discrimination but there is no reliable evidence before the panel that it amounted to persecution.\nEvidence of the Female Claimant\n[19] The family of the female claimant has lived in KSA for at least three generations. She received her dental training in Egypt. Her marriage to her husband was arranged and they are cousins. Her mother is university educated and her father is an electrical engineer. They own property in KSA. The grandparents also live in KSA.\n[20] The female claimant alleged that while she was six months pregnant and working as a dentist in a clinic, she was touched inappropriately on one occasion by her employer, a male dentist. She told her parents. When asked if her parents reported this to the licencing body of dentists, she said no, because he's a Saudi and he had a brother in security. The female claimant has not provided a reasonable explanation for her not reporting this incident to the authorities or the licensing body of dentists in KSA. Her employer is affiliated with the dental society as is evident by her evidence stating that she has to work as an apprentice for two years in KSA in order to get a permanent license. She has not provided a reasonable explanation for her parents not reporting this incident. Her father is a well-established electrical engineer whose family has lived successfully in KSA. While the family may not hold citizenship in KSA, they have been able to work and enjoy a remarkable life style there. The panel makes a negative inference.\n[21] The female claimant's BOC was amended at the beginning of the hearing to indicate that her mother and four brothers are here in the Toronto area and have made refugee claims. The panel was aware that the principal claimant's brother had previously made a refugee claim and was aware that his wife is the aunt of the female claimant. When asked if she knew why her mother and brothers were making refugee claims, she said no. When asked why her father did not come to Canada, she said that she did not know. When asked if she speaks with her mother and brothers, she said yes and she sees them on a weekly basis. The panel finds that the female claimant is not credible. The female claimant's position, while it may be possible, it is not plausible. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the female claimant does know why her mother and brothers have made refugee claims and that she knows why her father is remaining in KSA. The female claimant has not provided any reliable evidence as to why she cannot return to KSA.\n[22] When all of the above is taken into consideration, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants' evidence is not credible. The panel does not believe that the principal claimant was approached by any authority in KSA to act as an informer. The panel does not believe that the female claimant was inappropriately touched by her dentist employer and does not believe that she does not know the reason why her family members are claiming refugee status. The panel does not believe that she does not know why her father remains in KSA.\n[23] The claimants did not present any evidence with respect to their residence in KSA to indicate that they are unable to return to KSA. The documents that one would expect to be presented are their Iqamas (their residency cards issued by KSA.) The absence of the latter is suspicious. It leads the panel to believe that the claimants are selective with respect to presenting documents to support their claims.\nCONCLUSION\n[24] Having considered all the evidence and based on the above analysis, the panel finds the claimants are not Convention refugees, as the claimants have not established that there is a reasonable chance or serious possibility that they will face persecution for a Convention ground or that they will face a risk to their lives or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture should they return to KSA.\n[25] Therefore, the panel rejects these claims, pursuant to both sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n(signed)\n\"Martin Wakim\"\nMartin Wakim\n\"October 25, 2017\"\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended.\n3 Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution: Guidelines issued by the Chairperson pursuant to section 65(3) of the Immigration Act, IRB, Ottawa, March 9, 1993, Update: November 1996, as continued in effect by the Chairperson on June 28, 2002 under the authority found in section 159(1)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n4 Exhibit 10.\n5 Exhibit 11.\n6 Exhibit 1, Minister's Delegate's Notes by M.

The claimant's father allegedly worked with the former government of Yahya Jammeh, as a driver for the XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[5] After the new president, Adama Barrow, was elected on December 1, 2016, Yahya Jammeh refused to give up power. The claimant alleges that his father decided likewise that he would not leave his post and following meetings with employees of the XXXX XXXX XXXX, there was an agreement that everyone would stick together.\n[6] The claimant alleges that men from the security forces visited their home warning that his father should not change his mind about sticking together or the entire family would be killed.\n[7] On January 20, 2017, following pressure from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Yahya Jammeh decided to give up power. Shortly after, the claimant's father decided that the family was no longer safe in The Gambia. The claimant, his mother and siblings went to Senegal on February 2, 2017, with his father joining them approximately one week later.\n[8] The claimant alleges that his father sent him to Canada because his father was worried for his safety in The Gambia and Senegal. Using false documents, obtained under a false identity, the claimant travelled to Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2017, and filed a refugee claim. The claimant's father was apparently unable to make travel arrangements for himself and the rest of the family.\nDETERMINATION\n[9] The panel finds that the claimant has not established that he faces a serious possibility of persecution for a Convention ground pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA. The panel further finds that the claimant has not established that pursuant to section 97 of the IRPA on a balance of probabilities he would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment upon return to his country of nationality.\nANALYSIS\n[10] The determinative issue is credibility.\nIdentity\n[11] The panel accepts, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is a citizen of the The Gambia. The panel relies on the copy of a birth certificate2 issued to the claimant by The Gambia, which was seized by Citizenship and Immigration Canada when the claim was filed.\nCREDIBILITY\n[12] In assessing this claim the panel considered the Chairperson's Guideline 3: Child Refugee Claimants: Procedural and Evidentiary Issues (hereinafter \"the Guidelines.\")\n[13] In accordance with this guideline, the panel took into consideration the claimant's age, cultural background, and experiences in its assessment of the claim. The panel likewise ensured that the minor claimant was aware of the process to be followed throughout the hearing and questioned him in a manner that was sensitive and appropriate for his age.\n[14] Testimony given under oath is presumed to be truthful, unless there are valid reasons to doubt it. In accordance with this guideline, the panel took into consideration that the claimant may not have been informed of the specific circumstances, or details of those circumstances, that led to his family's departure from The Gambia. Further, the panel was alert to the fact that the claimant is relying on a story that was relayed to him by others for the most part, and recognised that minor claimants may not be able to give evidence with the same degree of precision as adults, and may manifest their fear in a different manner. Nevertheless, the panel notes that the claimant was able to answer questions put to him in a cogent manner, and appeared quite mature for age.\n[15] The panel does not doubt that the minor claimant believes the story that was relayed to him which comprises the basis of his fear. However, the panel doubts the truthfulness of portions of the claimant's testimony, and the credibility of his story, so far as it is based on information relayed to him by others, which raises credibility concerns as discussed in these reasons.\nWhy is the claimant afraid to return to The Gambia?\n[16] In the affidavit appended to his Basis of Claim form, the claimant explained that his father worked for the former government but when the elections started in November 2016, he noticed things were different.3 The old president began hurting people before the election because people did not want him to remain in power and there were lots of demonstrations across the country.4\n[17] It was explained further in the affidavit that the claimant and his family had to leave The Gambia because it was no longer safe for them; persons working with the new government were seizing property and money from people who worked for the former president; further some people were angry with the old government and wanted revenge.5\n[18] The claimant states that after travelling to Senegal, his father felt it was not safe for the family in that country either since the Senegalese government was sending people who worked for the former president back to The Gambia for punishment.6 The claimant learnt from his father that former government employees were being arrested in Senegal and due to his father's connection to the old government it was not safe for him to return to The Gambia.7\n[19] The nature of the claimant's father's work and the reasons why the claimant fears returning to The Gambia changed drastically on the day of the hearing, when it was revealed that the father was a driver for the XXXX XXXX XXXX and that he had witnessed, and was possibly complicit, in atrocities committed by the security forces within that organization.\nDriver for the XXXX XXXX XXXX\n[20] On the day of the hearing the claimant disclosed an affidavit from his father.8 In the affidavit, the claimant's father states that approximately six or seven years ago he began working as a \"driver for the XXXX XXXX XXXX or XXXX,\" and that prior to this he was a farmer.9\n[21] The claimant's father stated further in his affidavit that after being on the job for a few months, he drove men from the XXXX XXXX XXXX to different places and witnessed as they beat, and sometimes murdered people who opposed the government.10 The claimant's father further stated that when the opposition came to power he became worried that people would seek revenge against him and members of his family.11\n[22] The claimant made a similar revelation at the hearing, testifying that his father was responsible for driving the security forces. However, he added that sometimes when people were killed his father would transport the bodies. When asked how he knew this information the claimant initially stated that he spoke to his father and his father told him, only to then change his statement testifying that it was actually the guardian whom he spoke to and the guardian explained his father's work functions to him.\n[23] The panel notes that the information disclosed at the hearing, including the testimony from the claimant, is very different from that in the affidavit appended to his Basis of Claim form, where the claimant had only explained that he was informed after he arrived in Canada that his father worked for the XXXX XXXX in a \"middle position;\" that his father had worked for the government for approximately fifteen years but that things became dangerous for his father and his family because of his connections with the old government that people were angry with.12\n[24] At the beginning of the hearing the claimant stated that he wished to amend the narrative to indicate that his father worked for the former government for six or seven years. This is consistent with the information found in the father's affidavit disclosed on the day of the hearing.\n[25] At the hearing the claimant was asked about his statement in the affidavit that his father worked for the XXXX XXXX in a \"middle position,\" versus his testimony that his father worked as a driver for the XXXX XXXX and transported dead bodies. The claimant stated that he was only recently informed that his father worked as a driver.\n[26] The panel draws no negative inference from the inconsistency between the claimant's written and oral evidence given the explanation that certain matters were hidden from him prior to his arrival in Canada. The panel finds the explanation to be reasonable.\n[27] While acknowledging that the claimant is a minor and did not know much about his father's work prior to his arrival in Canada, the panel would expect that some documentary evidence would be available regarding the father's work and provided in support of the claim.\n[28] The panel asked the claimant whether he had any documents to show that his father worked for the former government. The claimant stated that he was aware that his father has a Gambian ID card, but he did not know if he had any document regarding the work that he was doing. When asked if he had ever seen his father with any type of work ID the claimant stated no.\n[29] The designated representative sought to clarify, explaining that the claimant did not have knowledge of his father's work; that he never saw his father drive a special government car and had informed her that his father drove his own car to work. Further, she stated that the claimant had never seen his father in uniform and that he wore an ordinary shirt and tie to work.\n[30] The father's friend and the claimant's guardian, XXXX XXXX, was a witness at the hearing. The claimant is currently living with this individual. Mr. XXXX testified that he was born in Sierra Leone, but that his wife originates from The Gambia. He met the claimant's father approximately 10 years ago while visiting The Gambia and they became good friends.\n[31] When Mr. XXXX was asked by the claimant's counsel whether he knew what the claimant's father work was about he stated that he did not know anything until after the father sent the claimant to Canada. When asked what he was told Mr. XXXX stated that the claimant's father explained to him that when he started working for the government he was a regular driver but after some time he drove people who committed killings. When asked how is it that he did not know this information beforehand he stated that the work the father did was \"secret\" and was not discussed with anyone; that the father would simply explain that he worked for the government. However, later when Mr. XXXX was asked when he found out what the claimant's father did for a living he stated that when the election took place (December 2016), the claimant's father told him what work he did. The panel asked Mr. XXXX to explain the discrepancy between his former testimony and the latter response. He stated that the father explained his work when the election took place, but it was explained in further details after the claimant came to Canada. The panel sees no reason why Mr. JXXXX would explain initially that he became aware of the claimant's father's work duties only after the claimant travelled to Canada, only to later state that he knew about it prior to the claimant's arrival. The panel finds that the testimony of Mr. XXXX did not assist, but rather raised more questions regarding the father's work in The Gambia.\n[32] The panel finds that there was insufficient evidence before it to support a finding that the claimant's father worked for the XXXX XXXX XXXX. Where the panel has credibility concerns, the absence of corroborative evidence can be a valid consideration for the purpose of assessing credibility. Given the conflicting information surrounding the father's work functions, as well as, the period of time that he was allegedly employed with the government, it would have been helpful to have documentation regarding his work.\n[33] The panel acknowledges that the claimant's father provided an affidavit wherein he described his duty within the XXXX XXXX XXXX. However, the original document was not available for the panel to view and the father did not provide any identification with the affidavit. The panel finds the affidavit on its own to be insufficient evidence on which to base a finding that the father worked as a driver for the XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[34] Counsel asserted in submissions that the lack of identification from the father can be explained by the fact that the father left The Gambia in haste and was concerned about his safety. Further, counsel speculated that the father would likely not bring documents with him that would help the authorities identify him and cause him problems with the new government. The panel notes that these statements are from counsel and evidence of this nature was not presented.\n[35] The panel draws a negative inference from the absence of documentary evidence, apart from the affidavit, to prove that the claimant's father worked with the XXXX XXXX XXXX as a driver. In the absence of such documentation the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant's father was not employed in that role and that the claimant faces no risk to his life, on account of his father's work history in The Gambia.\n[36] If the claimant's father did in fact work as a driver for the XXXX XXXX XXXX, which is not conceded, based on the reasoning below, the panel finds that the claimant is not at risk of harm in The Gambia, as he is not of interest to anyone in that country.\nWhy did the police visit the claimant's home?\n[37] The claimant wrote in his affidavit appended to the narrative that, as tensions escalated after Yahya Jammeh refused to leave office, men from the military started visiting their home.13 These men wanted to ensure that his father would remain faithful to their plan to stick together.14 It was stated that these men went to the house and told the claimant's mother to tell her husband not to change his mind about sticking together, or the entire family would be killed.15\n[38] At the hearing the claimant testified that it was actually the police who went to his house, and that this occurred on one occasion only. When asked whether he knew why his family left The Gambia the claimant responded that it was related to his father's work with the government; that the family was told they needed to leave the country or risk being killed.\n[39] When asked who told the family to leave the claimant stated that he was not there when the message was relayed but he was informed that the police went to the house.\n[40] The claimant was asked about the statement at paragraph 6 of his affidavit wherein it was stated that men from the military went to his home after the election on December 1, 2016. The claimant testified that the police (not the military) went once to their home and told his father that the family should leave or they will get killed. The claimant testified that the police gave this warning to his father, who then told his mother and the mother told the claimant.\n[41] When asked by his counsel as to whether he wished to make changes to the statement at paragraph 6 of his affidavit, the claimant clarified that a single event occurred, wherein men from the police went to their home, warned his father to continue sticking together and told him that the family should leave the country or get killed. The claimant was told about this by his mother. He testified that the police never spoke to his mother and that no threats were made to his mother.\n[42] When asked to explain why in his affidavit, at paragraph 6, it was stated that these men made threats to his mother and gave a message for her husband, the claimant stated that he did not know where that information came from but the police never spoke to his mother, just his father.\n[43] While there are clear discrepancies between the claimant's written and oral evidence, taking into account the Chairperson's Guideline 3, the panel does not fault the claimant for the inconsistencies. The panel takes into consideration the claimant's minor age and fact that the claimant was not present at the time of the incident and had to rely on information that was told to him by his mother. It is possible that the information was miscommunicated either when it was told to him by his mother or when he relayed it to counsel.\n[44] The panel prefers to rely on the father's affidavit given that he was allegedly the recipient of the threats. The panel notes that the father did not explain in his affidavit that men from the police or the military went to his home. Rather, he explained the circumstances as follows:\n7. At first, after the election, Jammeh said that he would be staying in the country and did not accept the results. There were meetings with people in the security forces, and it was decided that we would stick together and stay in The Gambia. There were threats made that if anyone left, we and our families would be in danger (emphasis added.)\n8. Still, in February, after Jammeh had left, I sent my father to go across the border to Senegal for safety...\n---\n10...The new government is now looking for people connected with the old regime, and especially the XXXX. Many people are angry at us as we had caused a lot of pain for people and they wanted some sort of revenge. XXXX could easily be connected with me, through his last name, and he looks very much like me as well.\n11. I am scared that they might interrogate him, hurt him and hold him to try to get to me.16\n[45] It is clear from the father's affidavit, unlike the account given by the claimant, that the father was warned to \"stick together\" and \"stay in The Gambia.\" The panel does not believe that men from the police or the military visited the claimant's home and warned his father to leave the country or get killed, otherwise he would have likely stated so in his affidavit. Further, the claimant's father acknowledged in his affidavit that it was his decision to leave The Gambia.17\n[46] The panel accepts that the claimant's father may have made a pact with others within the security forces to stick together and remain in the country. This was likely to preserve their secrets regarding the atrocities committed while working for the former government.\n[47] According to the documentary evidence, the period starting December 1, 2016, was marked by political crisis in The Gambia, when the former president, Yahya Jammeh, refused to accept defeat peacefully and allow for the new president, Adama Barrow, to form the government.18 Fearing political unrest, thousands of Gambians, mainly women and children, crossed into Senegal to escape the political tensions.19\n[48] On January 19, 2017, Adama Barrow was sworn in as the president of The Gambia.20 Yahya Jammeh then agreed to go into exile in Equatorial Guinea.21\n[49] The claimant and his family's decision to leave The Gambia coincides with the departure of the former president. The claimant's father and his former colleagues had previously decided to stick together, likely in support of Jammeh who refused to leave office. However, with mounting pressure from the ECOWAS, Yahya Jammeh decided to leave office. The pact to stick together likely lost its force, and as the father acknowledged he decided to flee the country with his family. The father's belief was that the \"new government is now looking for people connected with the old regime, and especially the XXXX\" and that his life and the lives of his family members may be in danger. Although members of the security forces allegedly made threats that if anyone left the country, such persons and their families would be in danger, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that this was likely an empty threat made to encourage loyalty among the group.\n[50] Based on the available evidence, the panel finds that the claimant faces no risk of harm from the police or any members of the security forces in The Gambia.\nWhy would the claimant be a target?\n[51] The claimant testified at the hearing that he believes some employees of the former Gambian government were now working for the new government and his father felt that he will be targeted by these individuals. Since the claimant was the eldest son and would soon become an adult, his father feared that the claimant would be harmed if their family relationship and the fact that he worked for the Jammeh government became known.\n[52] As stated beforehand, the claimant testified that his father was responsible for driving the XXXX XXXX and that sometimes when people were killed his father transported the bodies. The claimant testified that he believes the new government wants to take his father to court.\n[53] The documentary evidence indicates that the new president has pledged to launch a \"Truth and Reconciliation Commission\" which would likely investigate possible crimes committed by the former government.22 Counsel for the claimant likewise disclosed information indicating that the current government is prosecuting members of the former government accused of wrongdoing.23 The panel finds it a reasonable belief on the part of the claimant that his father would likely be of interest to the authorities in The Gambia, given the nature of his past work functions. If true, the allegations made by the claimant regarding his father, corroborated by statements made by the father in an affidavit, are serious enough to warrant an examination as to whether the father was complicit in crimes against humanity based on his own admissions.\n[54] However, there was no persuasive evidence before the panel to indicate that anyone has an interest in the claimant in The Gambia. It was the father who was responsible for such actions, not the claimant. The panel finds that the claimant's belief that he would be subjected to an enquiry and possibly harmed should he return to The Gambia is speculative.\n[55] The panel asked the claimant to explain why he believes that he would have problems in The Gambia given that it was his father who had worked in the former government and the claimant personally had done nothing wrong. In response the claimant stated \"I don't know the reason why they would come after me, I don't know.\" The designated representative stated that the risk is based on the fact that the claimant shares his father's surname, is the eldest son, and looks like his father. Still, the panel finds this does not disclose reasons why the government or anyone who supports the government would target the minor claimant. Although the minor claimant testified that he believes upon return to The Gambia the government would interrogate him as to the whereabouts of his father and \"could torture\" him to disclose the father's location, the panel finds this belief speculative. There was no persuasive evidence before the panel indicating that the government or anyone else would harm the minor claimant to get to his father.\n[56] Further, the panel finds that the credibility of the allegation that the claimant is at risk of harm is undermined by the fact that the claimant's father is the one with the problems yet he chose to send his son to Canada while he remains in Senegal, where that government is allegedly arresting and sending employees of the former government to be punished in The Gambia.24 If accurate, the claimant's father is at risk of being deported to the very country where he faces serious problems. While the claimant explained that his father's wish was to get all the family out of Senegal, which he was unable to do, the panel sees no reason why he would not have sought safety for himself, then made arrangements for the claimant and the rest of the family subsequently. The panel finds that the failure to do so undermines the credibility of the allegation that the father, and hence the minor claimant, faces a risk of harm in The Gambia.\nWhy did the claimant come to Canada?\n[57] The panel notes that when Mr. XXXX, the claimant's guardian, was asked whether he had discussions with the father about any intentions he had to join the claimant in Canada, he replied stating that the father told him his wish was for the claimant to continue his education in Canada. Mr. XXXX testified that he was helping the family by ensuring that the claimant goes to school.\nCONCLUSION\n[58] The panel found material aspects of this claim not credible, in particular that the claimant's father worked for the XXXX XXXX XXXX and the claimant is at risk of harm in The Gambia. Having considered all the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant has failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution, or that he faces a serious possibility of persecution for a Convention ground upon return to The Gambia. The panel likewise finds that the claimant has not established on a balance of probabilities that she will face a danger of torture or a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, upon return to The Gambia.\n[59] The panel therefore rejects this claim pursuant to both sections 96 and 97(1) of the IRPA.\nNo Credible Basis\n[60] Subsection 107(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act states as follows:\nIf the Refugee Protection Division is of the opinion, in rejecting a claim, that there was no credible or trustworthy evidence on which it could have made a favourable decision, it shall state in its reasons for the decision that there is no credible basis for the claim.\n[61] The panel finds that this claim lacks a credible basis and the sole purpose of the claimant being in Canada is so that he can attend schooling in this country.\n(signed)\n\"Alesha Green\"\nA.

XXXX was a drug addict and alcoholic. He was violent and abused the claimant. He beat her up, and forced her to smoke marijuana laced with cocaine.\n[5] XXXX was a mechanic in town and the police were his customers and friends as he worked on their police vehicles and private cars. Therefore he thought he could get away with abusing her. The police had a policy of not interfering with domestic abuse, and they ignored her and did not assist her. Once they refused to help her get a restraining order. The beatings never stopped, especially when he was drunk or on drugs. When the claimant left him, he threatened that if he could not have her, nobody else could.\n[6] In December, 1987, he beat her severely and tore off her clothes when he spotted her talking to a male friend. She went into hiding but he found her, and she eventually was forced to return home.\n[7] XXXX used to break into her home and physically attack her. She learned that she was pregnant by him as a result of a rape a month earlier. He wanted to reconcile and threatened to kill her when she refused. She reported to police, but he got off with only a warning. Her daughter was born on XXXX XXXX, 1988. He threatened to kill the baby.\n[8] The claimant entered into a relationship with XXXX in 1988, so that she would have protection from XXXX, but XXXX still broke into her home and raped her in 1989. She got pregnant as a result of the rape, but the baby was stillborn. XXXX continued to harass her.\n[9] In 1999 she had a daughter with XXXX, who is the father of the co-claimant. Her relationship with XXXX did not last because of the harassment by XXXX. Then in 2001, the claimant got together with XXXX. XXXX broke off the relationship in 2004 because of the continued harassment and threats by XXXX. The claimant was afraid to go to the police as she was afraid that XXXX would harm her family.\n[10] In 2006, when the claimant became the XXXX XXXX for Dr. XXXX, XXXX constantly persecuted her at her work place, insulting her and threatening to kill her. She worked there for 5 years. During this time he made several attempts on her life, and even poisoned her water supply. The claimant called police but they always had an excuse for why they could not get him, such as that their only vehicle was out or that they were short on manpower.\n[11] He assaulted her on the office steps on June 8, 2011. On December 24, 2011, he accosted her with a huge stone but was overcome by some young men. In February 14, 2012, he attacked her with intent to kill, but she was able to escape.\n[12] The Minister tried to help, but nothing stopped the abuse. The claimant is afraid that XXXX will get a gun from one of his drug dealers and will kill her.\n[13] The claimants arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2012, and made claims for refugee protection on May 10, 2012.\nGender Guidelines\n[14] The Chairperson's Guidelines for Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution3 were taken into account when considering the process of the hearing and the facts in this case. All relevant factors, such as social and cultural context in which the claimant found herself, along with the issue of state protection and changing country conditions, were examined with consideration of the Chairperson's Gender Guidelines. Given the sensitive nature of the allegations, I am cognizant of the difficulties faced by the claimant in establishing her claim, including the challenge of remembering difficult and emotionally charged events, and as a result, addressed the claimant with heightened sensitivity and avoided unnecessary detail when asking questions. Only the principal claimant testified.\n[15] The co-claimant relies on the narrative of her mother, the principal claimant.\nDETERMINATION\n[16] I find that the claimants are not Convention refugees pursuant to s. 96 of the IRPA, nor persons in need of protection, pursuant to s. 97(1) of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[17] The claimants' personal identities and country of citizenship have been established, on a balance of probabilities, as per certified true copies of their passports.4\nCredibility\n[18] In assessing the credibility of the claimant, I was aware of the Maldonado decision,5 which states that, \"when a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there be reason to doubt their truthfulness.\"\n[19] I find that the principal claimant's whole story has a sense of being not plausible. In essence, the claimant alleges she lived with XXXX for only 13 months beginning in 1986 and had a child with him, named XXXX, who is now 29. The claimant testified that XXXX had abused her for 25 years after she left the relationship and is still intent on killing her. When she left the relationship, he threatened that if he could not have her nobody could. However, in the meantime, the principal claimant had two serious relationships and lived with two different men, XXXX and XXXX. She had a child with XXXX, who is the co-claimant, XXXX. She lived with XXXX from 1988 on, and with XXXX from 2001-2004. She testified that she lived with them to get some protection from XXXX. However neither relationship worked out because of interference and harassment by XXXX. However, despite his threats, XXXX did not kill the claimant while she was living with these men.\n[20] I do accept that some men become obsessed with a particular person. However, according to the principal claimant this man not only was harassing her, but he allegedly beat her, raped her, accosted her, has been threatening to kill her, and had attempted to kill her multiple times for many years before she came to Canada in 2012. For example, she recounted that he poisoned her water and that he tried to stone her. To me, it does not seem plausible that this man has been so unsuccessful in his attempts. After all, he is an adept mechanic. The claimant's explanation that she has just been lucky because always someone came along to stop him from killing her stretches credulity.\n[21] Secondly, it does not seem plausible that the police had not responded to protect her. This is not just a case of domestic abuse. This man has allegedly threatened to kill her, has raped her and has also made multiple attempts to kill her. I find that the criminal courts should have been involved in cases of attempted murder. The documentary evidence does not indicate, even though the police may not be the most responsive and well-staffed and equipped, that they would not act in cases of outright attempted murder, especially since in some instances there were witnesses, as when, for example he attempted to kill her with a large stone and people intervened.\n[22] The principal claimant has not been the only one to receive death threats from XXXX. XXXX, the father of the co-claimant, wrote in his support letter that XXXX also threatened to kill him. And yet there is no evidence that XXXX reported these threats to the police.\n[23] As well, the claimant worked in the constituency office of the local elected politician in her village for five years. During this time she would have had the opportunity to get the politician's help to get the police to act to protect one of his employees. The claimant testified that he did contact the police who made a report, but they never caught XXXX because he ran away. He must have returned eventually, as the claimant stated that he continued to harass and abuse her and threaten her. He also continued to run his garage. There was no explanation why the police did not arrest him when he returned and why the politician did not pursue the matter with the police.\n[24] The principal claimant gave three reasons why the police were not responsive. First of all, she stated the police are not interested in helping abused women, and are also ill equipped and always have an excuse for why they cannot respond, such as there is no vehicle available, or there is not enough staff, or we cannot find XXXX. Since the police know where his garage is in the small village, they could always find him eventually. Secondly, the claimant testified that the police would not help because he is their mechanic and they are buddies with him. However, when the claimant was asked about individual police that were stationed in the village, she said that she doesn't know because they were constantly changing. It is not likely, if there are new policemen at the police station, that all of them would be refusing to help her just because XXXX is the mechanic in the village, or that they would all be buddies with him.\n[25] The claimant testified that the third reason the police did not want to do anything against XXXX is because XXXX family is rich, owns many businesses and has influential friends. The claimant did not produce any objective evidence about his family's influence. She said that they always manage to get XXXX out of trouble and he gets sent temporarily to a mental institution instead of going to jail. The claimant also omitted any mention of XXXX family standing in her original PIF narrative. She filed a recent amendment where she included this allegation. However, as the amendment was used to rectify deficits in the original PIF and I therefore give it little weight. Her original PIF should have had information about his family's influence if that was a major factor influencing the police from dealing with XXXX. I draw a negative inference from the omission.\n[26] The claimant submitted a letter from the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, signed by XXXX XXXX XXXX.6 I give this letter little probative value as it only refers to police reports but does not actually include the reports. Nor does the letter mention where the claimant made the reports since this letter is from Castries and she only reported it in the village. Nor does the author of the letter state how he knows about the relationship between the claimant and XXXX, nor how he knows that they were in a common-law relationship, nor how he knows that XXXXr is an alcoholic and drug abuser. The letter states that XXXX was never prosecuted for what he did to the claimant but it does not state why.\n[27] Another factor to consider is that the principal claimant's family has shown a desire to live in Canada. One of her four daughters is a permanent resident in Canada after being sponsored by her female common-law partner. Then the claimant came to Canada with her daughter XXXX and made a refugee claim. Then this year her daughter, XXXX, came to Canada and made a refugee claim on the basis of being a lesbian. Thus, the family members are motivated to support each other's claims.\n[28] The claimant submitted letters of support from XXXX and XXXX.7 XXXX refers to the fact that the police did not act because XXXX is their mechanic. Neither of them mention that police did not act because of XXXX rich and influential family. Hence I give the letters little weight.\n[29] The claimant's daughter, XXXX, wrote two letters of support8. Neither mention the police, nor the allegation that the police did not act because of XXXX powerful family. Since she is XXXX daughter, she was probably introduced to his family or at least must have information about them. The fact that she did not does not persuade me that police are not acting because of XXXX family standing in the community.\n[30] The supporting letter from the claimant's friend, XXXX, who lives in Canada, is undated and does not give any particulars as to how and when she knew XXXX and whether her knowledge of the way he abused the claimant is derived from her own observations or reports from the claimant. I give the letter little weight.\n[31] The affidavit from XXXX XXXX purports to speak of the situation of abused women in St Lucia. The affidavit is dated 2012, when she was the XXXX XXXX XXXX, an organization which deals with women's issues in the Caribbean. I give this affidavit limited weight as it has a particular slant on the issues and because it is now more than 5 years old. I prefer the IRB National Documentation Package (NDP), which is objective and drawn from various, reliable, sources.\nCo-claimant\n[32] XXXX is 18 years old. She did not testify. The principal claimant testified that XXXX never hurt XXXX. The principal claimant testified that she fears that he may hurt her in the future because he likes to hurt people who are close to her. I find that this is mere speculation.\n[33] XXXX has two serious medical conditions. She has had a XXXX condition since birth, which just requires monitoring, and she has a problem with her XXXX XXXX. The necessary surgery has been performed in Toronto and she requires hormone therapy, likely for the rest of her life. I find that there is no documentary evidence that her medical conditions cannot be managed in St. Lucia. Her XXXX condition was managed appropriately by a cardiologist in St. Lucia until she arrived in Toronto at the age 13. There is no evidence that doctors in St. Lucia cannot manage the appropriate administration of hormones.\n[34] The co-claimant has been here for 8 years and is enrolled in university. She has been receiving good medical care and is doing well emotionally. Her family wants her to remain in Canada. However, she is now an adult and the only decision I can make is to determine if she would be persecuted if she returns to St. Lucia. I find that there is not a serious possibility that she will.\nSummary\n[35] I find, on a balance of probabilities that the principal claimant has not provided sufficient, credible evidence that she was in an abusive relationship with XXXX in 1987 in which the abuse continued until she left St. Lucia in 2012, a total of 25 years. I am aware that none of the credibility concerns raised here may be sufficient, each on its own, to negate this claim, but taken cumulatively, they do. I find that the claimant may have been abused at some point by XXXX, but not to the extent she alleges. I also find that her interactions with the police are not credible, as the police would have acted, at least, on the criminal acts if they had occurred and if she had reported them. There is no convincing evidence that she reported the alleged rape or the repeated murder attempts. If she was severely beaten, there is no evidence that she sought medical attention, except for one time in 2011, and there is no convincing evidence that the injuries were caused by XXXX. There is also no convincing evidence that the police would not act if she made reports, as her testimony that they don't prosecute XXXX because of his powerful family has been found not to be credible.\n[36] An RIR in the IRB NDP,9 indicates that St. Lucia's Criminal Code prohibits rape and prescribes a punishment of a prison sentence ranging from 14 years to life imprisonment and the Royal Saint Lucia Police Force (RSLPF) is \"not reluctant\" to arrest alleged rape offenders. Sexual violence against women is handled by a separate unit of the RSLPF known as the Vulnerable Persons Unit (VPU), established in December, 2007.The VPU increased police responsiveness to cases of violence against women and children, and there were more cases of this nature reported to the unit. According to the 2010, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Citizen Security Survey, 48.8 percent of women in Saint Lucia who reported \"violent crime\" to the police were either \"satisfied\" or \"very satisfied\" with the action taken by the police. As a result of the claimant's testimony, I find her credibility further diminished.\n[37] In summary, as stated at the outset, none of the credibility concerns raised above may be sufficient on their own to negate this claim. However, the cumulative effect of credibility concerns, outlined above, results in the lack of sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence upon which to base a determination that the claimant is credible.\nState Protection\n[38] In the alternative, I find that the claimants can obtain adequate state protection in St. Lucia should they require it.\n[39] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant has not established that state protection is unavailable for her and the 18 -year old co-claimant in St. Lucia.\n[40] There is a presumption that a state is capable of protecting its citizens. The claimant may rebut this presumption by providing \"clear and convincing\" proof of the lack of state protection in their country of origin. The claimant must approach his or her state for protection, providing state protection might be reasonably forthcoming.10\n[41] Evidence that protection being offered is not necessarily perfect11 is not clear and convincing proof of the state's inability to protect its citizens, as no government can guarantee the protection of all its citizens at all times. However, where a state is in effective control of its territory, has military, police and civil authority in place and makes serious efforts to protects its citizens, the mere fact it is not always successful at doing so will not be enough to justify a claim that the victims are unable to avail themselves of protection.12 The onus is on the claimant to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that state protection is inadequate.13\n[42] No government can be expected to guarantee perfect protection of all of its citizens at all times, and the fact that a state is not always successful in protecting its citizens is not enough to justify a claim. This is particularly true when a state is in effective control of its territory and has military, police and civil authorities in place and is making serious attempts to protect its citizens.14\n[43] The burden of proving an absence of state protection is directly proportional to the level of democracy that exists in the state.15 The independent documentary evidence indicates that St. Lucia is a functioning democracy.16 It has functioning political and judicial systems in place, and an official apparatus sufficient to provide a measure of protection to its citizens. Local failures to provide effective policing do not amount to a lack of state protection unless they are part of a pattern of a state's inability or refusal to provide protection.17 Therefore, a claimant must do more than approach one police officer unsuccessfully before deciding that state protection would not be forthcoming. There is an onus on the claimant to exhaust all courses of action reasonably available to him.18\n[44] St. Lucia is in control of its territory and has functioning security forces, both military and police, in place. There is no evidence of a total breakdown of state authority in the country. Therefore, the burden of attempting to show that one should not be required to exhaust all avenues of domestic recourse is a heavy one.19\n[45] I have found the claimant's testimony with regards to alleged assaults and police interaction to be untrustworthy.\n[46] I have considered the independent documentary evidence with regards to state protection against domestic violence.\n[47] The Domestic Violence Act (DVA) was passed in 1995.20\n[48] One RIR provides the following information with regards to legislation, state protection and support services available to victims of domestic violence:21\n[49] According to the UN Women's Caribbean Gender Portal, the Domestic Violence Act of 1995, amended in 2005, offers \"a wide range of speedy and effective remedies to reduce domestic violence,\" including protection orders, occupancy orders and tenancy orders... a protection order \"prohibits abuse and molestation, excludes the abusive person from the home or workplace.\"\n[50] Some acts of domestic violence, such as assault and wounding, as well as threats to kill and attempted murder, may be prosecuted under the Criminal Code and under the common law. The report indicates that there are delays throughout the judicial system, taking two to five years for a case to go through the High Court.22 I believe that such delays are not unknown in Canada.\n[51] The Division of Gender Relations, a division of the police, conducts training of police recruits and distributed domestic violence referral protocols to police stations. The police have the separate Vulnerable Persons Unit for dealing with cases of domestic violence and the results of that unit's work has been found to be effective. The unit works in collaboration with the Family Court, governmental agencies and NGOs. The RIR indicates that there has been an improvement in the response and sensitivity to domestic violence since the establishment of the VPU. The Director of the Division of Gender Relations expressed the opinion that the police response to domestic violence is \"generally\" effective.23\n[52] According to a legal source in St. Lucia, police officers typically treat victims of domestic violence with respect and inform them of their rights to protection and occupancy orders. It is more common now, than in the past, for the police to arrange for the man to leave the home in cases in which there is a dispute between the man and the woman in their home. \"According to the instructions in the RSLPF manual, domestic abuse incidents cannot be resolved over the phone and all cases require that an officer be dispatched to the scene. The manual also instructs that police actions be prompt, positive, and recorded properly.\"24\n[53] A legal source in St. Lucia expressed the opinion that, \"the Family Court handles the issuing of protection orders well and that they are not difficult to obtain.\"25\n[54] Apparently the enforcement of protection orders is an issue when domestic violence victims do not give the local police a copy of the protection order, causing the police to be less responsive. Similarly there are challenges with the enforcement of protection orders and that perpetrators are not always arrested because the victim does not report the breaches or does not want the perpetrator to be punished.26 However, I do not find that these problems can be characterized as inadequate protection on the part of the state.\n[55] The Department of State (DOS) report indicates that St. Lucian police are willing to arrest offenders and that the government prosecute crimes of violence against women when the victim presses charges.27\n[56] As discussed above, the objective evidence indicates that the police are effective in dealing with cases of alleged sexual abuse.28 In addition, the DOS report indicates that the police and courts enforce laws to protect women against rape.29\n[57] Although not related directly to state protection, I note that the documentary evidence30 indicates that the Division of Gender Relations of the Ministry of Health, Wellness, Human Services, and Gender Relations run a Women's Support Center, which provided shelter, counselling, residential services, a 24-hour hotline, and assistance in finding employment which could provide support to the claimant if she so chooses.\n[58] As a result of the above analysis, I find that there is adequate state protection for the claimants in St. Lucia should they require it.\nCONCLUSION\n[59] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that the claimants not Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection, pursuant to section 96 or subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\n[60] The Refugee Protection Division therefore rejects their claims.\n(signed)\n\"Rose Andrachuk\"\nRose Andrachuk\nDecember 27, 2017\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, sections 96, 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b).\n2 Exhibit 2, Personal Information Form (PIF) of the principal claimant.\n3 Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution: Update, Guidelines Issued by the Chairperson Pursuant to Section 65(3) of the Immigration Act, IRB, Ottawa, November 25, 1996, as continued in effect by the Chairperson on June 28, 2002, under the authority found in section 159(1)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n4 Exhibit 1, Package of information from the referring CBSA.\n5 Maldonado, Pedro Enrique Juarez v.

XXXX XXXX was appointed the designated representative of the minor claimant and acted in that capacity at the hearing.\nINTRODUCTION\n[3] The complete story alleging the basis of the claimants' fear in Bangladesh is captured in the principal claimant's Basis of Claim form (\"BOC\") narrative and amended BOC narrative.2\n[4] The principal claimant is a 53-year-old man who was who was born in Bangladesh on XXXX XXXX, 1964. He resided in the United States on a work permit for approximately 10 years, from 1999 to 2009, before returning to Bangladesh.\n[5] After returning from the United States, the principal became an entrepreneur, but alleges that he would \"also write and publish blogs from time to time.\" He allegedly faced problems in Bangladesh because of his profile as a blogger. In addition, the principal claimant alleges that he faced problems in Bangladesh because his sister and her husband (a Hindu man), who were accepted as refugees in Canada due to problems they faced because of their mixed marriage, sought shelter at his home before leaving Bangladesh. The principal claimant alleges that he was targeted by fanatical Muslims who sought revenge because he assisted his sister and her husband.\n[6] The principal claimant alleges fear of Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh (a.k.a Jamaat), an Islamist political party in Bangladesh. He also fears affiliated groups.\nDETERMINATION\n[7] The panel finds that the claimants have not established that they face a serious possibility of persecution for a Convention ground pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA. The panel further finds that the claimants have not established that pursuant to section 97 of the IRPA, on a balance of probabilities, they would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment upon return to their country of nationality.\nANALYSIS\n[8] The determinative issues are identity and credibility.\nIDENTITY\nPersonal identity\n[9] The panel accepts, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants are citizens of Bangladesh. The panel relies on certified true copies of the People's Republic of Bangladesh passports on file,3 identifying them as nationals of Bangladesh. The original passports were seized by Citizenship and Immigration Canada when the claims were filed.\nCREDIBILITY\n[10] When a claimant gives evidence under oath, the testimony is presumed to be truthful unless there are valid reasons to doubt it. In this particular case the panel has several reasons to doubt the truthfulness of the principal claimant's testimony and the truthfulness of the allegations put forth. As will be discussed more substantively below, there were numerous omissions and inconsistencies in the evidence, arising from discrepancies between the principal claimant's written and oral evidence, that were not explained to the satisfaction of the panel. Since all claimants rely on the allegations put forth by the principal claimant and the panel has found those allegations not credible, as discussed in these reasons, the panel must reject all the claims.\nThe principal claimant's profile as a blogger\n[11] The principal claimant stated in his BOC narrative that after returning to Bangladesh he wrote and published blogs \"from time to time.\"4 The principal claimant was unable to tell the panel when exactly he began writing blogs, stating it was either near the end of 2009 or in 2010.\n[12] When asked how often he wrote blogs the principal claimant stated, \"once or twice\" monthly or \"every other month.\" The principal claimant testified that these blogs were published on his website, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The panel finds that the word \"XXXX\" does not act as a unique identifier of ownership in this case. The principal claimant did not disclose any documents showing he owns the domain's name \"XXXX XXXX XXXX\" or that the blogs posted on this website are his. Further, the principal claimant testified that \"XXXX\" means human.\n[13] The panel finds that the principal claimant has not proven his profile as a blogger on a balance of probabilities. Aside from the fact that the word \"XXXX\" appears on the sample blogs he disclosed and the website contains the word \"XXXX,\" the same moniker as the principal claimant's given name, there is nothing linking the principal claimant to this website or the blogs that were allegedly posted on this website. Further credibility concerns arose when the principal claimant was questioned in depth about his blogging and this website he allegedly created.\n[14] The principal claimant disclosed three (3) articles he allegedly wrote, dated XXXX XXXX, 2015, XXXX XXXX, 2015, and XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015.5 The principal claimant alleges that he wrote and published these articles on his website XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The first article, dated XXXX XXXX, 2015, discusses war criminals and names alleged war criminals.6 In the second article, the writer questions religion and criticises \"religious bigots.\"7 The third article addresses the tragic circumstances whereby a crane fell on worshipers while they were performing haj, killing more than a hundred persons and injuring others.8 There were two (2) additional articles disclosed that discuss XXXX XXXX, a well-known blogger and activist killed in 2015.9\n[15] While the name \"XXXX\" appears next to the date on these articles, the author was not identified by that person's full name or by a photograph. The panel asked the principal claimant how anyone would associate him with these articles given that his photograph does not appear on the article. The principal claimant acknowledged that his photograph does not appear on any of his blogs but stated that, referring to the agents of persecution, \"their hand is very long\" and that they likely have people who are IT experts. The principal claimant stated further that this is evident by the fact that his website was hacked twice and some of his posts were deleted.\n[16] Aside from the principal claimant's speculation, there is nothing to support a finding that his identity was uncovered by Muslim fanatics, with the assistance of IT experts or would become known. Further, there was no persuasive evidence before the panel that the principal claimant's website(s) was hacked by Muslim fanatics or persons affiliated with Muslim fanatics.\n[17] Counsel pointed to the fact the website is titled \"XXXX XXXX XXXX,\" to indicate that the principal claimant's identity could have been revealed in this manner. However, again while the website has the claimant's given name the panel finds it difficult to believe that in a country with approximately 157 million people10 the principal claimant is the only person with that name. The panel does not accept, based on the principal claimant's testimony, which is does not find credible, and the fact that \"XXXX\" appears on these articles and forms part of a domain name for a website which he claims belong to him, that the principal claimant authored these blogs. There is insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence before the panel to support such a finding.\n[18] Further, even if the principal claimant did in fact write these blogs, it is unclear from looking at the articles how anyone would be able to identify the principal claimant as the author of this article. The principal claimant does not have a public persona, akin to activists and bloggers who have played key roles in organizing protests calling for the death penalty against those who committed crimes during the 1971 War of Independence.11 Such individuals have been blatantly targeted by extremist groups, but the principal claimant does not fit this profile. For instance, in February 2013, thousands of people protested in the streets close to Dhaka's Shahbag square, demanding that Jamaat-e-Islami leader Abdul Quader Molla be sentenced to death for crimes committed during the 1971 War of Independence.12 A number of secular bloggers and other activists play a key role in organizing the protests.13 There was no evidence put forth that the principal claimant was involved in organizing these protests.14 Following the protests, secular blogger XXXX XXXX was hacked to death by men wielding machetes in Dhaka.15\n[19] Notably, although the principal claimant testified that his blogs, which he began writing either in 2009 or 2010, were always critical of extremist groups, the principal claimant did not have any problems until 2015. The principal claimant's explanation was that he did not write about extremist groups \"in a big way\" earlier in his career as a blogger and that the attacks on bloggers have been more recent. However, according to the documentary evidence, bloggers who criticised extremists began facing problems in Bangladesh as early as 2013. In 2015, five secular activists were murdered.16 The panel accepts that far more bloggers have been murdered in Bangladesh since 2015. However, the panel notes that according to the documentary evidence, as early as 2013, bloggers who protested impunity for war criminals and criticised Islam fundamentalists were targeted for attacks, and \"at least one blogger had been murdered.\"17\n[20] The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the principal claimant does not fit the profile of those targeted by Muslim fanatics; that he is not a blogger or activist, and that he is not of interest to Muslim fanatics because of blogs he allegedly wrote.\n[21] The panel's finding is buttressed by the fact that although the principal claimant testified that he began writing blogs near the end of 2009 or in 2010, he was unable to produce any articles written earlier than 2015, just before he left the country. When asked why he did not disclose earlier blogs that he wrote and published, the principal claimant stated that the blogs he disclosed were the ones that led to the phone threats he received.\n[22] The panel finds this explanation unsatisfactory. The principal claimant's identity as a blogger is a central issue. The panel finds it reasonable to expect that the principal claimant who allegedly began writing blogs near the end of 2009 or in 2010, would have disclosed some of his work before 2015. The panel finds that the principal claimant's failure to do so seriously undermines his credibility, specifically in regards to his identity as a blogger.\n[23] Further, the panel does not believe that the reason the claimant presented only blogs from 2015 was because those were the ones that led to the threats he received. In fact, when asked when the website was created the principal claimant stated it was \"probably\" in January 2015. However, the claimant testified that he began writing and publishing blogs near the end of 2009 or 2010, and when asked earlier in his testimony where he published his blogs, the principal claimant stated they were published on his website, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[24] The principal claimant's explanation for the discrepancy was that he created two websites prior to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and that the blogs before 2015 were published on those websites. The principal claimant further stated that some of his blogs were published in magazines. The principal claimant testified that he created the first website (XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX) in 2010. The claimant was unable to produce corroborative documentation because this website was allegedly hacked. The principal claimant testified that he created a second website XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX) in 2012. He also was unable to corroborate this with documentation, explaining that the hosting of that website was not renewed.\n[25] The panel finds the principal claimant's explanation for the discrepancy between the date that he began publishing blogs on his website (2009 or 2010) and when the website was created (January 2015) lacking in credibility. The principal claimant produced no documentation corroborative of these predecessor websites or the magazines in which his blogs were also published. Further, in his BOC narrative, the principal claimant mentioned only one website, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX,18 where his blogs were published. The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that if these other websites existed they would have been mentioned in the BOC, as they relate to a central issue, specifically establishing the principal claimant's profile as a blogger.\nAttempted kidnapping of son\n[26] On September 10, 2015, the principal claimant amended his BOC narrative to indicate that there was an attempt to \"snatch\" the minor claimant, XXXX,19 when he and his wife were attacked by Muslim fanatics while attending a Bengali new year's celebration on April 14, 2015. The principal claimant was questioned about this alleged kidnapping attempt.\n[27] Most astonishingly, although mentioned in the amended narrative, at the hearing the principal claimant informed the panel there was no attempt to \"snatch\" his son on April 2015. In fact, the principal claimant was adamant that it could not have happened, stating that his son was with his in-laws on April 14, 2015. When the panel read the principal claimant's own statement to him, pointing out that he had in fact amended his BOC narrative to state that there was an attempt to \"snatch\" his son on April 14, 2015, the principal claimant reiterated that it did not happen on that date, adding that it was on the 28th, but later stating it was actually \"on July 6 at night.\"\n[28] However, the principal claimant's evidence was even more confusing because he also testified about a kidnapping attempt relating to a threat received by telephone. The principal claimant testified that he received a threatening call from persons who stated that his son would be taken away and he would not find him. The principal claimant testified that he received this threatening phone call \"after 28 June 2015.\" When he was asked whether the persons who called him told him anything else the principal claimant stated that he was told that if he did not stop \"writing these things in blogs\" his son would be taken, and further that he should place 50 lakhs taka in an account and remove his blog. The panel asked the principal claimant when he received these threats. In response he stated that they \"happened before\" and again on June 28, 2015.\n[29] When the principal claimant was asked about previous phone threats he allegedly received, his story evolved and his testimony became further confusing. The principal claimant stated that he received phone threats in January also, but went on to testify that there were several times when he was threatened but only \"once or twice\" was he told that his son would be kidnaped and a demand for money was made. When the panel tried to ascertain when exactly Muslim fanatics threatened to kidnap the principal claimant's son and demanded money from him he stated it was \"around February 2015 and after the June 28, 2015.\"\n[30] Notably, the principal claimant only mentioned one kidnapping attempt in his amended narrative.20 The principal claimant was asked why the attempted abduction in or about February 2015, and the phone calls requesting a ransom, as described in the news article and oral testimony, were not mentioned in his BOC narrative or amendment. The principal claimant stated that he had mentioned it but due to a language barrier it was not expressed in this manner.\n[31] The panel finds the principal claimant's explanation for the omission of this information from his BOC narrative and amended BOC narrative unacceptable. The principal claimant's testimony contradicts the information in both his original BOC narrative and the amended BOC narrative. The principal claimant amended his narrative on September 10, 2015, adding that he \"received threatening calls on June 29, 2015 from unknown Moslem fanatics.\"21 However, there was no mention in the principal claimant's original narrative or the amended narrative that there had been threats from the callers to kidnap the principal claimant's son on that date and that he was asked for money. Further, as stated beforehand, the only mention in the amended narrative of an attempt to \"snatch\" the principal claimant's son was of an incident on April 14, 2015, while the family was attending New Year's celebration,22 which he now states never occurred.\n[32] This information, regarding an attempt to kidnap the principal claimant's son on April 14, 2015, is also found in a newspaper article provided by the principal claimant.23 The principal claimant testified that the article was written by a journalist who lived in an apartment building where he also resided at the time. The article mentions that there had been three attacks against \"XXXX\" and stated that \"they even tried to abduct little XXXX for ransom and threaten to kill in using military techniques.\"24 In addition, the article mentions that the principal claimant and his family are being hunted, resulting in them having to \"run away from home, friends, and family.\"25\n[33] The principal claimant testified that the journalist approached him and asked why he was \"running away.\" When asked why the journalist would believe he was \"running away\" the principal claimant explained that the journalist knew that he was attacked 3-4 times. When asked how the journalist knew this information the principal claimant stated that they would generally \"run into\" each other in the apartment building. The principal claimant stated that he gave the information in the article to the journalist who interviewed him.\n[34] The panel asked the principal claimant about the specific information in the news article indicating that there had been an attempt to abduct his son XXXX. He was asked when this event happened. The principal claimant gave a lengthy, often rambling story, stating that \"right after February\" the maid left with their son and had not returned for 2 to 3 hours. This maid also worked for others in the area hence he went to the apartments of persons where the maid was known to work but he could not locate her. Further, he asked the security to make an announcement asking the maid where she was and informing her to return to the home immediately. The principal claimant testified that approximately 15 minutes later the maid returned with his son, that she was laughing and told him that she was in the building at someone's home. The principal claimant testified that he told the maid she could not behave in this manner and she did not return to their compound the following day. When asked why he viewed this event as an attempt to abduct his son, the principal claimant stated \"she used to work in 3-4 different houses but she was not in any of them\" when he went to look for her.\n[35] The panel does not find the principal claimant's story of the alleged kidnaping credible. The story kept evolving when he was questioned about this alleged kidnapping; the date that the alleged kidnaping took place changed at least three (3) times, as did the circumstances. When asked by his counsel about the different dates he gave for this alleged kidnaping attempt the principal claimant merely stated \"I told them about 6 July...I did not tell them about April 14...I said 6 July.\" The principal claimant stated maybe his story was not properly converted from Bangla to English and the error may be related to a language barrier. The panel does not find this explanation credible. The principal claimant had the services of an interpreter. It appears that Urdu was the language of interpretation used at the time.26 The principal claimant testified that he understands Urdu. Prior to the hearing, there was no complaints about a language barrier and the principal claimant informed the panel at the outset of the hearing that he understood the contents of the BOC, as interpreted to him by the interpreter, at the time that they both signed the form.\n[36] The principal claimant's story does not have the ring of truth and evolved each time contradictions were put to him. The panel draws a negative credibility inference from the principal claimant's inability to keep his story straight.\n[37] The panel gives the newspaper article27 disclosed by the principal claimant no weight. The article was based on information given to the journalist by the principal claimant who lived in the same building as the journalist. The panel finds the article self-serving. Further, the content of the article is unreliable because the principal claimant has not been a reliable witness and was unable to keep his story straight concerning the information reported by this journalist.\nIncident on April 14, 2015\n[38] The principal claimant testified that on April 14, 2015, he and his family were celebrating Bengali New Year when they were attacked by Muslim fanatics. The principal claimant stated they were with \"other blogger families\" when a crowd of approximately 25 to 28 people attacked them. The principal claimant was allegedly approached and grabbed; the attackers pulled him from the rickshaw that he was travelling on, and proceeded to kick and punch him.\n[39] When asked by the panel whether the attackers said anything to him or his wife, the principal claimant stated that they asked him why he was writing \"these things\" in his blogs given that he is Muslim. The principal claimant added that one of the men then began touching his wife in \"her private\" and that this individual put his hand in her \"shirt\" and \"pulled her to ground.\"\n[40] Describing the incident in his BOC narrative, the principal claimant wrote \"my wife was physically assaulted and her clothes were ripped apart.\"28 He went on to state \"I was beaten up. We were badly beaten because of the blogs I had written and I was threatened that if I continue writing these blogs critical of Moslem fanatics I would be killed.\"29 There was no mention in either the original or amended BOC narrative that anyone had touched his wife in her private area.\n[41] The panel asked the principal claimant why it was not mentioned in his narrative that his wife was touched in her private area. The principal claimant stated that he had explained it; that that they did it to other couples also, and maybe it was omitted due to a language barrier.\n[42] The panel does not find the principal claimant's explanation satisfactory and draws a negative credibility inference for his inability to keep his story straight. The panel notes that the principal claimant had the assistance of an interpreter in preparing his BOC and had also retained counsel by then to assist him in completing this form.30 Further, after the BOC narrative was filed, the principal claimant made amendments31 to the form, yet he did not include that information. Finally, at the outset of the hearing the principal claimant and his spouse were asked to confirm whether the information in their BOCs is complete, true and correct. They both indicated that was the case. If the information was not complete the claimants, who were represented by experienced counsel, had an opportunity to inform the panel about this in advance of being questioned.\n[43] The panel finds that the omission of a central detail from the BOC narrative detracts from the claimants' credibility, and leads the panel to further question the allegations put forth.\nThreatening Phone Calls\n[44] On September 10, 2015, the principal claimant filed an amended narrative, adding that he \"received threatening calls on June 29, 2015 from unknown Moslem fanatics.\"32\n[45] The principal claimant was asked how many threatening phone calls in total he received. In response the principal claimant stated that he received two and that both were in February 2015. The principal claimant stated he did not know the identity of the callers but they complained about his writings, telling him to remove his writings \"or the time is near.\"\n[46] The principal claimant did not mention in his BOC narrative that he received threatening phone calls in February 2015. Rather, as stated beforehand, in the amended narrative received from the principal claimant on September 10, 2015, the principal claimant indicated that he \"received threatening calls on June 29, 2015 from unknown Moslem fanatics.\"33 The panel asked the principal claimant why he had not stated in his BOC narrative that he received threatening phone calls in February 2015. The principal claimant stated he was \"not really asked that question.\" He later added that the information was given but maybe not written in the narrative.\n[47] The panel rejects the principal claimant's explanation and finds that this reoccurring inability to keep his story straight detracts from his credibility. As stated beforehand, the principal claimant had the assistance of an interpreter in preparing his BOC. Further, he had the assistance of competent counsel who further assisted him with making amendments after the BOC was filed.\n[48] The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that if the principal claimant received threatening phone calls in February 2015 that information would have likely been in the BOC or sent in as an amendment, similar to how an amendment was filed to indicate that he received threatening phone calls on June 29, 2015. The panel does not believe that the principal claimant received threatening phone calls in February 2015. The panel draws a negative credibility inference from the principal claimant's inability to keep his story straight.\nThe principal claimant's sister\n[49] On April 4, 2014, the principal claimant's younger sister filed a refugee claim in Canada and was granted convention refugee status.34 The sister, a Muslim, was married to a Hindu and had problems because of their interfaith marriage.35 The principal claimant alleges that he received death threats from Muslim fanatics because he gave his sister and her husband shelter before they fled the country. The principal claimant was asked to describe the problems he had.\n[50] The principal clamant testified that on June 28, 2015, he and his spouse were attacked by 4 or 5 persons on a motorbike. The principal claimant testified that the persons who attacked him stated \"you are the same XXXX who helped your sister escape from this country.\" The principal claimant stated he and his wife were beaten and warned to think before doing anything. The principal claimant said similar statements were also made in a phone call he received, and at the time of the incident on July 6, 2015. The panel asked the principal claimant what exactly was said to him on July 6, 2015. The principal claimant testified that he was told that his sister is married to a \"Malaun,\" which he described as a derogatory word used in reference to Hindus. The principal claimant testified that after this comment was made he was beaten. The principal claimant testified that Muslim fanatics also made reference to his sister on June 29, 2015.\n[51] The panel does not find the principal claimant's allegation that Muslim fanatics confronted him and made reference to his sister at any time credible. There was no mention in the principal claimant's original or amended narrative that on June 28, 2015, Muslim fanatics made reference to his sister. Rather, the principal claimant stated in his narrative that on June 28, 2015, Muslim fanatics attacked him and threatened that if he did not \"remove these blogs that I had written\" he would be killed.36 Further, there was no mention in the principal claimant's original or amended narrative that similar statements were made in a phone call he received, or that he was confronted about helping his sister on June 29, 2015, or on July 6, 2015.\n[52] When the principal claimant was confronted with the fact that he had not mentioned that he was attacked by Muslim fanatics on any of these dates, because he helped his sister, but rather because of what he had written in his blogs, the principal claimant stated the Muslim fanatics mentioned his sister also and he had mentioned this at the beginning of his narrative. The panel does not find the principal claimant's explanation for the discrepancy between his oral and written evidence satisfactory. The panel agrees that the principal claimant mentioned early on in his narrative that he encountered problems from Muslim fanatics because he helped his sister and her husband.37 However, the principal claimant did not give a date when he was supposedly threatened by these fanatics. Moreover, the panel notes that on the occasions that the principal claimant now alleges that the Muslim fanatics mentioned his sister, in the BOC narrative he describes these as confrontations that took place mainly because of the blogs he had written.\n[53] The panel finds that the discrepancy between the principal claimant's oral and written evidence detracts from his credibility. There is insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence before the panel to support a finding that the principal claimant received death threats from Muslim fanatics because he gave his sister and her husband shelter while in Bangladesh.\nPsychological functioning\n[54] The principal claimant disclosed a report from Dr. XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX Corporation, dated November 3, 2015.38 Dr. XXXX met with the principal claimant on October 29, 2015, for a psychological assessment.39 The clinical interview lasted approximately two (2) hours.40 After meeting with the principal claimant on this single occasion Dr. XXXX diagnosed the principal claimant with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.41\n[55] The panel accepts that the principal claimant was possibly exhibiting symptoms at the time of the assessment that warranted the diagnosis of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. However, this assessment was performed over two years before the present hearing. There was no persuasive evidence before the panel that the principal claimant is currently suffering from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Notably, although Dr. XXXX stated in the report that in her professional opinion the principal claimant \"is in dire need of psychological intervention\"42 the principal claimant provided no documentation corroborative of efforts to seek further assistance.\n[56] The panel assigns little weight to Dr. XXXX report as I find it is not persuasive evidence of the principal claimant's current condition, nor is it persuasive evidence that the allegations of persecution put forth by the principal claimant occurred. Dr. XXXX gave a professional opinion based on her observations at the time of the interview. However, the panel finds that the psychologist is not in any position to state that the principal claimant is credible or that the allegations put forth in fact occurred. As stated in Rokni,43 a report from a mental health practitioner submitted as evidence \"cannot possibly serve as a cure-all for any and all deficiencies in a claimant's testimony\". The court reiterated its position in Danailov, 44stating \"that opinion evidence is only as valid as the truth of the facts on which it is based\".\n[57] Further, while the principal claimant's spouse testified that her husband has problems explaining himself and is forgetful, the panel is not persuaded that this impacted his ability to give testimony at the hearing. The principal claimant was able to write a detailed narrative after coming to Canada setting out the events which allegedly transpired in Bangladesh, in spite of the fact he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder then.\nDocumentary Evidence\n[58] Although the principal claimant and his spouse provided a number of documents45 in support of their claims, including copies of complaint letters they allegedly filed with the police, business cards for the police officers they allegedly interacted with, medical reports, and prescriptions notes and an email image, as well as, documentary evidence on country conditions, the panel finds that the probative value of the personal documents is substantially undermined by the fact that the central allegations put forth have been found not credible. The panel assigns these documents no weight.\n[59] Likewise, having found that the central allegations put forth are not credible, the panel finds that the country conditions evidence addressing the situation of bloggers and activists has no bearing on the claimants' personal circumstances. The panel finds these documents have no probative value and assigns them no weight.\nCONCLUSION\n[60] The panel found the allegations put forth not credible; specifically the panel did not believe that the principal claimant was a blogger in Bangladesh and that he and his family members were targeted by Muslim fanatics for that reason, or because he assisted his sister and her husband. The claimants are not of interest to anyone in Bangladesh.\n[61] Having considered all the evidence, and based on the above analysis, the panel finds that the claimants have not established that they have a well-founded fear, or that there is a serious possibility of persecution for a Convention ground upon return to Bangladesh. The panel likewise finds that the claimants have not established that, on a balance of probabilities, they will face a danger of torture or a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, upon return to Bangladesh. The panel rejects their claims pursuant to both sections 96 and 97(1) of the IRPA.\n(signed)\n\"A. Green\"\nA.

He alleges that mediation, exercise, going out with friends and visits to the doctor in March 2016 did not resolve his depression.\n[6] The claimant alleges that his friend introduced him to Falun Gong in July 2016. The claimant decided to try Falun Gong despite the illegal status of the practice in China. The claimant's friend introduced him to group practice by the end of August 2016. The claimant alleges that he also introduced a different friend to Falun Gong by December 2016 when the benefit of the practice became self-evident to him.\n[7] The claimant alleges that on April 30, 2017, the Public Security Bureau (\"PSB\") raided the claimant's group practice. The claimant allegedly managed to escape with the other practitioners due to advance warning by his group's lookouts. The claimant then went to his uncle's house where he hid. The claimant was advised by his parents while in hiding that the PSB paid them a visit on May 2, 2017, searched the house for the claimant and left a Chuanpiao (loosely translated as a court summons) with them. Some of the claimant's friends were then arrested or went into hiding. The PSB allegedly returned to the claimant's and his parents' house to inquire about the claimant's failure to respond to the court summons.\n[8] The claimant alleges that his uncle found him a smuggler to obtain a U.S. visa who also assisted him to leave China on XXXX XXXX, 2017 through Los Angeles and then come to Canada to make a successful refugee claim. The claimant alleges that on the flight from Vancouver to Toronto, the smuggler told him that he must surrender his passport to him until the balance of the fees are paid and any rate it would be harder to deport him without the passport. The claimant complied. The claimant alleges that his parents paid the balance of the fee but that the smuggler told them that he would return the passport to the claimant in Toronto. The claimant alleges that that he was still waiting for the smuggler to do that as of the drafting of the BOC.\n[9] The claimant fears returning to China due to the PSB search for him and because he would not be able to practice Falun Gong freely as he as is able to in Canada.\nANALYSIS\n[10] The determinative issue in this case is whether the claimant adduced any credible and trustworthy evidence to establish the basis of his claim.\n[11] I note that the claimant caused some confusion between the two sittings of his hearing with respect to his preferred language of interpretation. In the first sitting when the claimant was XXXX, he asked for a Cantonese interpreter. In the second sitting, the claimant changed his mind and asked for a Mandarin interpreter, particularly for the questioning on Falun Gong because he allegedly learned the technical aspects of the practice in Mandarin. After some clarification, it became evident that the claimant speaks Cantonese with his family since he lived in the province of Guandong but that at school he was educated in Mandarin. I note that the claimant's BOC requests a Mandarin language interpreter, with a Cantonese \"dialect\", which indicates bilingualism to me because Cantonese is a free standing Chinese language and not a dialect of Mandarin.\n[12] Given that the claimant clearly understood Cantonese, I proposed that we defer the questioning on the technical aspects the claimant's Falun Gong practice (for example, the names of five exercises and their verses) until the Mandarin interpreter could arrive, about an hour later. In the meantime, the claimant would be questioned on other aspects of his basis of claim in Cantonese. No objection was raised to this proposal. At no time during the claimant's questioning with Cantonese interpretation was there any indication that the claimant did not understand the interpreter. In fact, I find that the claimant affirmed that he understood the Cantonese interpreter before questioning proceeded. Once the Mandarin interpreter arrived about an hour later, the claimant chose to continue in Mandarin without any objections. Accordingly, I find that the claimant was provided with adequate interpretation throughout the hearing. I find that that none of the following adverse credibility findings were tainted by inadequate interpretation.\nIdentity\n[13] The claimant in this case did not provide a passport at the time of referral or at the hearing, nor did he provide the original air tickets which he used to fly from China to Los Angeles, U.S. and within Canada. I asked the claimant to explain his failure to produce an original passport and air tickets. The claimant explained that he threw out the air tickets since he did not know that they were important and his smuggler took the passport and air tickets since claimant still owed him money.\n[14] The Federal Court has held that it may be reasonable in the particular circumstances of a claim for the Board not to accept these sort of explanations, which generally revolve around smugglers stealing their clients' passports, without further reasonable explanation.4 The Federal Court has held on this issue as follows:\n\u00b615 There can be no doubt, as Reed J. stated, that the passport \"would have provided some objective evidence of her travels through the various countries which she asserts took place\"\n[...]\n\u00b617 I take this opportunity to add that it is entirely reasonable for the Refugee Division to attach great importance to a claimant's passport and his air ticket. In my opinion, these documents are essential to establish the claimant's identity and his journey to come to Canada. Unless it can be assumed that a refugee status claimant is actually a refugee, it seems unreasonable to me to ignore the loss of these documents without a valid explanation. In my view, it is too easy for a claimant to simply state that he has lost these documents or the facilitator has taken them. If the Refugee Division insists on these documents being produced, the facilitators may have to change their methods.\n\u00b618 Minimizing the importance of the passport and air ticket as documents to be produced or ignoring their non-submission for all sorts of reasons in my opinion only serves to encourage all those whose only purpose is to take advantage of a system which is intended solely to enable genuine refugees to come to Canada.5\n[Emphasis added]\n[15] I find it reasonable to attach significance to the production of genuine original passports, not only because they have great evidentiary weight when considering identity, but also because they contain the travel history of the claimant. Claimants are not entitled to deny immigration authorities and the Board the opportunity to examine their travel history which may intersect with material aspects of their claim. This is important especially in the case of the claimant who alleges and later testified that he was able to depart China under his own genuine passport and air tickets bearing his own name after the PSB searched his house, left a court summons for him, and later paid his house a second visit to follow up on the claimant's lack of response to the Court summons. Given the referring immigration officer's handwritten notes in the Schedule 12 and Generic Application forms which indicate that the claimant stated to the officer that he initially obtained his passport with the aid of a smuggler, examination of the passport itself for genuineness would have likely been considered as well. I adopt the Federal Court's reasoning as my own and find that it applies to the analysis of the claimant's explanations.\n[16] The claimant's explanation for why he threw out the air tickets because he thought they had no further use is also unreasonable because the claimant was represented by an experienced immigration law firm at all material times and he came to Canada with the express intention to make a refugee claim, allegedly because the Canadian system is superior to the U.S. inland asylum system. I find it not credible that in these circumstances the claimant would be unaware of the importance of maintaining such records. I draw an adverse inference as to the claimant's general credibility from his failure to present his air tickets at the time of referral in the absence of a reasonable explanation.\n[17] I find the claimant's explanation for his failure to produce his passport is also not reasonable and not credible because it was evolving and ultimately inconsistent. I initially asked the claimant where his passport was. The claimant answered that the smuggler has it. I then asked the claimant if he made efforts to re-obtain the passport. The claimant testified that he had requested that his family please pay the smuggler the full amount of the fee balance so that he would receive the passport. The claimant then testified that his family had paid the full amount to the smuggler by October (2017) and the smuggler promised that they would give back the passport. The claimant then testified that the passport is at his family's home. I pause here to observe that the claimant's explanation is inconsistent with his answer to the straight forward question I initially asked to the effect of \"where is your passport\" which has now changed from being in the possession of the smuggler to being in the possession of his family.\n[18] The claimant then testified that there was insufficient time to courier the passport from China to Canada in time for the hearing. I asked the claimant if he made any efforts to obtain a copy of the passport (similar to his Hukou colour copy) by electronic means, such as a picture attached to an email. The claimant at this point stated that he actually had a picture of his passport on his cell phone which was not given to counsel. I asked the claimant to explain to me why he had failed to provide his counsel, or the Board with the picture of the passport or a printout. The claimant explained that he did not know he needed to do that. I find that the above summary of the claimant's testimony indicates an evolving testimony which was circular and ultimately not credible in that the claimant was clearly aware of his obligation to provide his counsel with documents which would be produced to the Board (the prime example is the voluminous late disclosure accepted into evidence). I find it not credible that the claimant would not know that he had to provide his counsel with a picture of his passport, an important identity documents, given that he has made efforts to provide his counsel with a colour copy of his Hukou. I find that the claimant has withheld his passport, in physical form or electronic copy form, from the Board in the absence of a reasonable explanation. I draw an adverse inference as to the claimant's general credibility from his conduct and his inconsistent and evolving testimony and explanations.\n[19] Notwithstanding the absence of the claimant's passport and his lack of a credible and reasonable explanation for his passport's absence, I find that his personal and national identity as a citizen of China is established by his Resident Identity Card (\"RIC\") which was seized by the referring immigration officer but available in copy form in the file.6 The picture in the RIC matched the claimant's appearance in the hearing room.\nThe claimant is not credible about his motivation to practice Falun Gong in China\n[20] The claimant testified that his motivation to practice Falun Gong was to ameliorate the lack of sleep caused to him by his parents' constant quarrelling. I asked the claimant Falun Gong made his parents stop fighting. He answered no. I then asked the claimant how was he able to sleep if his parents were still fighting. The claimant testified that Falun Gong transformed his entire person, meaning his heart was not burdened as before.\n[21] The claimant then added, unprompted, that he also spread Falun Gong to his parents and they began to quarrel less. The claimant testified that he told his parents the benefits of practicing and they responded to him that if what he said is true, maybe they should practice too. The claimant testified that his parents began to practice several times, they felt the difference, and they began to quarrel less. The claimants' parents only practice at home secretly but they continue to practice to the date of hearing, although their frequency is limited, described as \"sometimes\". The claimant's brother does not practice Falun Gong.\n[22] I asked the claimant to explain to me why his BOC omits any reference to the alleged fact that he successfully spread Falun Gong to his parents who have effectively become occasional practitioners. The claimant explained that he must have forgotten to include that in his story. Counsel relies on case law to in submitting that the Board ought not to take adverse inference as to the claimant's credibility from this omission.7\n[23] Having reviewed the claimant's explanation in conjunction with counsel's submission, I find that the claimant has failed to reasonably explain the omission and that I cannot accede to counsel's submission. As a starting point, the cases counsel cites relate to \"peripheral omissions\", \"collateral detail\", \"minutiae\" and an unreasonable expectation that the narrative be an \"encyclopedic recitation\" of the evidence.8\n[24] I find that the claimant's testimony about the conversion of his parents to be not be a mere \"peripheral omission\", \"collateral detail\", or \"minutiae\". The claimant's Falun Gong religious activities in China, especially when those religious activities are prohibited by the state, go to the core of the claim and are material to the narrative. The alleged conversion of the parents would also raise the risk profile of the entire family given that the PSB has been to the claimant's home and has spoken to the parents after the claimant went into hiding. I find it not reasonable or credible that the claimant would forget to include his alleged conversion of his parents in the BOC narrative in these circumstances which include the claimant being represented by experienced counsel.\n[25] Another reason why I do not find the claimant's explanation to be credible or reasonable is because of his overall demeanor at hearing room when questioned on this point, which I find clearly indicated that the claimant's testimony was evolving in response to my questions. I made note of the claimant's changed demeanor after he confirmed that his practice of Falun Gong did not stop his parents fighting. It was apparent at this point in the testimony that his motivation for practicing Falun Gong was somewhat disconnected from the main problem in his life, the constant fighting of his parents. While the claimant added that Falun Gong generally helped him by transforming him, that still leaves his parents fighting and keeping him up at night due to their loudness. I find that his account at this point in the testimony was obviously deficient and problematic and it was apparent to me that the claimant recognized this issue.\n[26] His unprompted testimony about the conversion of his parents followed after a few seconds, which I find is a clear attempt to embellish an otherwise obviously problematic account of motivation to practice an illegal form of religion. I find that the claimant's demeanor in the way that he delivered his testimony was not credible.\n[27] I draw an adverse inference as to the claimant's general credibility from his demeanor and from the material omission in his BOC narrative in the absence of a reasonable explanation. I find that the claimant has adduced insufficient credible evidence to establish that he converted his parents to Falun Gong. I find that the claimant has failed to adduce sufficient credible evidence to establish his motivation to start practicing Falun Gong\nFailure to claim in the U.S. not reasonably explained\n[28] The claimant testified that he landed in the U.S. after flying directly from mainland China on XXXX XXXX, 2017. His schedule 12 form indicates that on XXXX XXXX, 2017 he flew from Los Angeles to Seattle and that he crossed into Canada by car and walking the next day. This itinerary places him in the U.S. for approximately three days. The claimant would have interacted with U.S. airport authorities on at three separate occasions: entry to Los Angeles, departure from Los Angeles, and entry to Seattle. The claimant testified that he did not claim asylum in the U.S. I asked the claimant to explain.\n[29] The claimant explained that he did not claim asylum in the U.S. because the smuggler instructed him that in the U.S. it is not easy to get refugee protection, the U.S. discriminates against refugees, he will be deported and in comparison, Canadian immigration honours, loves and respects refugee claimants.\n[30] I find that the claimant's explanations are not reasonable. The Board expects claimants to make a claim for protection at the earliest opportunity. The U.S. is a signatory to the Convention. It is trite law that real or perceived differences in refugee recognition rates between different Convention signatory countries is not a reasonable explanation for failing to claim asylum at the first opportunity as stated by the Federal Court:\n...The applicant's submission that he did not apply for asylum because it would be granted more easily in Canada or because he would gain permanent residence faster in Canada are not valid reasons for negating the adverse inference that he lacked subjective fear by not applying for asylum in the United States...9\n[31] I adopt the Federal Court's reasoning as my own to find that the claimant's explanation is not reasonable. In addition, I note that the claimant had three opportunities to interact with U.S. airport staff which likely would have included Customs and Border Patrol or Department of Homeland Security agents who he could have assisted him with making a claim for protection. Had the claimant sought asylum in the U.S., he may have been in a position to ask for refugee protection from Canada in the future in the event his U.S. claim was refused. In other words, the claimant's chances to obtain protection under the Convention would have been higher by his ability to resort to a second application if needed. I find it not reasonable that the claimant would squander this opportunity. I draw an adverse inference as to the claimant's general credibility from his failure to seek asylum in the U.S. at any of the three opportunity he may have had in the airport. I also find that this evidence a lack of subjective fear of persecution.\nTravel to the U.S. Consulate in China through public transit is not credible\n[32] The claimant testified that he was required to personally attend at the U.S. Consulate in Guangzhou City for an interview on July 11, 2017. The interview took place after the claimant was allegedly in hiding.\n[33] The claimant testified that he took a taxi from his hiding place to the bus station locally where he purchased a ticket and waited for 20 minutes. He then boarded a bus which took him on a 5-6 hour ride to Guanzhou City. Upon getting off the bus at the Guangzhou City bus terminal, the claimant went to a hotel. The second day the claimant walked to the U.S. Consulate from the hotel. He followed a similar travel routine returning to his hiding place, the only change being that he did not stay overnight in Guanzhou City again. The claimant testified that it was summer time so he wore a T-shirt, black pants and white shoes.\n[34] I asked the claimant if he was afraid to be caught by the PSB on the course of his travels to the Consulate and back. The claimant testified that he was afraid but that he took precautions, namely, he purchased a special bus ticket, departed late at night, and tried to avoid the PSB officers that he saw walking around. He states that he did not see any PSB officers outside of the U.S. consulate so he walked right in.\n[35] I find the claimant's evidence is not credible and his testimony for his willingness to expose himself in the open to the PSB given the precautions that he said he took is not reasonable. The claimant was effectively out of hiding for over five hours of travel and several more hours while staying at the Guanzhou City hotel and susceptible to arrest by the PSB at various points on his journey, including the public bus stops, on the bus itself and while walking to the U.S. Consulate.\n[36] The claimant in his testimony stated that he saw PSB officers walking around inside the Guanzhou City bus station and that security cameras were also visible inside the station. The claimant would have gone through this surveilled building a total of two times. Furthermore, the claimant would have likely exposed himself during the walk from the hotel to the U.S. Consulate to the various CCTV or security cameras that are posted in various public spots in China,10 including around U.S. diplomatic facilities which I would reasonably expect includes its consulate in Guangzhou City:\nAll visitors should have no expectation of privacy in public or private locations. Security personnel carefully watch foreign visitors and may place you under surveillance. The U.S. Embassy regularly receives reports of human and technical monitoring of U.S. private businessmen and visiting U.S. citizens. The areas around U.S. and other foreign diplomatic facilities and residences are under continual overt physical and video surveillance. Dozens of security personnel are posted outside of facilities and around residences, and video cameras are visible throughout the diplomatic district (including offices and residential neighborhoods) of Beijing. Overt microphones and video cameras are common in taxis.11\n[Emphasis added]\n[37] I also find that the claimant's testimony, that there were no PSB guards around the U.S. Consulate, to be not credible on its face because it is contradicted by the documentary evidence cited above which indicates that there are dozens of security personal outside diplomatic facilities and residences. I prefer the documentary evidence over the claimant's testimony because it is well researched and compiled by reliable institutions such as the U.S. State Department which would expected to be aware of the conditions outside of its diplomatic facilities.\n[38] I find that the claimant's willingness to expose himself by using public transit and attendance at places of interest to the PSB as well as passing through the same surveilled area twice (the Guanzhou city bus station) while he was allegedly wanted by the PSB and in hiding is not credible. Not only would the claimant would have been in a serious risk of being arrested, but it is just as likely that the PSB would have been in a position to follow him back to his hiding place and arrest the claimant and anyone else in his uncle's house for harbouring a wanted person. I draw an adverse inference as to the claimant's general credibility from his conduct. I find that his behaviour also evidences a lack of subjective fear of persecution.\nThe claimant's travel route from China on his own passport is not credible\n[39] The claimant testified that he exited China through the Guangzhou Airport. From there he flew to Korea and then to Seattle, in the U.S. I asked the claimant to explain to me the inconsistent information about his travel route in his Schedule 12 form which omits any reference to Korea and in fact indicates that he flew to Los Angeles directly from China.12 The claimant explained that what is written in Schedule 12 is correct, that he travelled from China to Los Angeles and from there to Seattle. The claimant explained that he did not know which airport it was and that he was confused, because the name of the airport was in English. I find the claimant's explanation to be not reasonable and not credible because there is a big difference between a Korean airport and a U.S. airport. I would expect the claimant to be notice the fact that he was still in Asia, albeit in a foreign country, which happens to use a non-English script, Korean. Furthermore, I note here that the claimant has failed to provide a reasonable explanation for his intentional disposal of his air tickets, addressed earlier in these reasons. These air tickets would have established the claimant's travel route and supported his allegation to be have been able to exit China on his own passport while wanted. I draw an adverse inference as to the claimant's general credibility from his inconsistent evidence about his route to Canada. I find that the claimant's inconsistent evidence in combination with his destruction of the air tickets leads me to find that there is no credible evidence to establish how he came to Canada.\n[40] The failure of the claimant to provide credible evidence about his travel route to Canada also affects the overall credibility of his alleged ability to exit China on his passport, while wanted, with the assistance of a smuggler.\n[41] The claimant testified that he went through customs and security controls at the airport where he was required to take out his phone. He testified that his passport was scanned by a computer and that his passport was eventually stamped by a customs official. While the claimant's testimony was brief on this issue, I find that it effectively describes a standard exit procedure at an international mainland Chinese airport. The claimant explained the absence of any alarms (after his passport was scanned) due to the prior bribery of the smuggler who he followed throughout the airport.\n[42] The evidence in the country documentation indicates that the appearance of exit stamps in passports for mainland Chinese citizens \"suggests that the passports are scrutinized to the same degree that you would expect [at] all points of exit\/entry throughout China.\"13 I find that this is a reasonable inference to make. As I explain further below, I find that the claimant's assertion of leaving China on his own passport from Guanzhou airport with the aid of a smuggler while wanted by the PSB to be not credible. I draw an adverse inference as to his general credibility from this allegation.\n[43] On July 18, 2017, the Chairperson of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) identified RAD decision titled TB6-1163214 as a as a Jurisprudential Guide with respect to the \"analysis of whether a person wanted by the authorities can exit China via an airport using a genuine passport.\"15\n[44] It is trite law that Members of the RPD are expected to follow the reasoning in a jurisprudential guide, unless there is reason not to do so, where the facts underlying the decision are sufficiently close to those in the case being decided to justify the application of the reasoning in the jurisprudential guide,16 and that such an expectation does not infringe on the independence of a decision-maker,17 create a reasonable apprehension of bias,18 or breach the appellant's right to be heard.19 The Federal Court has also held that there is no need to disclose the jurisprudential guide to claimants and counsel.20\n[45] Having reviewed the claimant's BOC allegations, testimony and counsel's written submissions, I find that the facts alleged in this case are sufficiently similar to justify reliance upon the Jurisprudential Guide. Similarly to TB6-11632 (where it was alleged that customs officers were bribed),21 the claimant in this case testified that the smuggler bribed the customs officials. This is the same type of vague and ultimately not reliable, trustworthy, or credible evidence that caused the RAD to prefer the documentary evidence over the appellant's testimony which leads me to the same conclusion.\n[46] I find that the National Documentation Packages are substantially similar between the appellant in TB6-11632 and the claimant before me on all material aspects. While the airport in this case is different (Beijing vs. Guanzhou), I find that the claimant's alleged facts are nevertheless substantially similar to the exit procedure described by the appellant in TB6-11632 in terms of the exit procedure and the likelihood that his biodata would have been entered into the Policenet\/Golden Shield system by his passport being scanned and stamped. I therefore adopt the reasoning in TB6-11632 and apply to the assessment of the claimant's allegations.\n[47] The claimant in this case was also not credible about his general travel route as explained above and he failed to provide evidence of his passport and air tickets in the absence of a reasonable explanation. These factors also militate towards preferring the country condition evidence and adopting the analysis of the RAD persuasive decision. Accordingly, I draw an adverse inference as to the claimant's general credibility from his allegation and testimony concerning his ability to exit China on his own genuine passport with the alleged assistance of a smuggler while wanted by the PSB.\n[48] In analyzing the evidence on exit from China, I have reviewed counsel disclosure package titled \"Refugee Claimants Using Valid Passports to Flee China\".22 I find that I cannot assign any evidentiary weight to these general articles for the following reasons. Articles numbered 1 and 6 related to smuggling through Hong Kong, which is a territory outside of mainland China subject to different rules. They are not relevant to the claimant's circumstances which involve a direct flight from Guangzhou to either Korea or the U.S. There is no evidence that the Policenet\/Golden Shield system play a similar role in departures from the Hong Kong airport. Articles numbered 3 and 8 relate to smuggling in U.S. airports and Vienna which is not relevant to the circumstances here also because the claimant had no interaction with Vienna and he appeared to have entered the U.S. in the regular stream as evidenced by the fact that his fingerprints were taken at Seattle.23 There are no allegations that the claimant or his smuggler was required to bribe U.S. customs officials upon entry, but even if he did, this is not relevant to the analysis of the exit procedure in China which is primarily based on the existence of technological measures such as the Policenet\/Golden Shield system. Article numbered 5 speaks to the failure of the airlines to provide CBSA with lists of passengers. This is irrelevant to the claimant's circumstances because the issue is not what information CBSA can get from China, but rather what digital information the Chinese exit control customs officers have in their fingertips and whether bribery can make that information non-actionable. There is no casual connection between the failures of the CBSA in Canada to enforce compliance with incoming airlines and the PSBs practices in exit control monitoring in China. Articles 2, 4, 7 and 9 are very general in nature when speaking about corruption and are not sufficiently specific in analyzing the situation on mainland China given the technological conditions that predominate the airport environment there. These articles are also fairly dated, having been printed in 2015 and 2013. The overtly general level of these four articles in combination with their relatively stale nature in the context of a fast evolving technologically-driven exit control regime renders these articles not helpful. I assign them no evidentiary weight. I find that that counsel's country condition package of documents titled \"Refugee Claimants Using Valid Passports to Flee China\" does not assist the Board and should be granted no evidentiary weight.\n[49] Counsel in written submissions referred to Federal Court decisions that have overturned Board decisions that relied on the lack of credibility of those claimants'' alleged exit from China while wanted on their own passports. Counsel provided as part of his disclosure articles concerning corruption in China. I find that I cannot accede to counsel's submissions. First, the Federal Court decisions that counsel has referred do not address the RAD persuasive decision. At any rate, those Federal Court decisions counsel cited reached conclusions based on the facts in those particular cases. I find that the claimant's inability to provide consistent testimony about his travel route, in combination with his withholding of his passport and destruction of his air tickets impugned the overall credibility of his allegations on his travel and exit from China to the point that I am not able to link his circumstances to the general country condition documentation (including counsel's disclosure) that speaks to the corruption in Chinese airports. In other words, I find that there is no credible or trustworthy evidence to establish that the claimant travelled as he says he did, used the travel documents he says he did, or retained a smuggler who bribed officials.\n[50] Based on the above adverse credibility findings, I find that the claimant has failed to adduce any credible and trustworthy evidence to establish that he was wanted by the PSB at the time when she exited Chin, allegedly on his own genuine passport.\nThe claimant is without general credibility as a witness\n[51] Given the credibility findings set out above, I find that the claimant is generally without credibility in regard to the basis of his claim. I do not believe that the claimant is wanted by the PSB, either in the past or currently. I do not believe that the claimant practiced Falun Gong in China or that he is a genuine Falun Gong practitioner in Canada.\n[52] Even without disbelieving every part of the claimant's testimony, the claimant may be found to be so lacking in credibility that the panel concludes there is no credible evidence relevant to his claim.24 I find that the claimant was generally lacking in credibility and this lack of credibility extends to all of his allegations and relevant parts of his testimony.\n[53] The claimant testified consistently about some aspects of his basis of claim. However, I find that his general credibility is so tarnished that I am not able to assign any parts of his testimony that may have been consistent and delivered without deficiency any evidentiary weight.\nOther evidence provided by the claimant does not establish his basis of claim\n[54] As stated earlier, the claimant has been found to be without general credibility. As indicated in the decision of Huang v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), \"overall credibility may affect the weight given to the documentary evidence.\"25 Furthermore, fraudulent documents are known to be easily obtained in China.26 Accordingly, and additionally for the specific reasons set out below, I assign no evidentiary weight to the remaining documentary evidence adduced by the claimant.\nClaimant's Chuanpiao - court summons - is a fraudulent document\n[55] The claimant provided a copy of the original People's Court subpoena or summons, which in Chinese is referred to as a Chuanpiao (in this decision I refer to this document as a court summons for ease of reference) and an English translation.27 I was provided with the original court summons at the hearing. The Chinese language court summons bears red stamps of the \"People's Court\" at the lower right corner and in cut-off form on the left side of the middle of the page.\n[56] I asked the claimant to explain to me a key discrepancy between his summons and the sample that the Board has in the national documentation package which I have set down below,28 namely the location of the Chinese character \"?\" found in the third box on the left side of the claimant's court summons (first column). This character is in a different position compared to the Chinese language sample in the country documentation. In the claimant's court summons the \"?\" character is to the right of the other characters in the box while in the sample the \"?\" character is in the middle.\n[57] The claimant (supported by the interpreter) explained the location of the \"?\" character does not change the meaning of this box. The claimant did not know why there is a discrepancy in the location of this character between his summons and the sample. Counsel submits that it is reasonable to assume that there is some variation in the summons given that an officer has to input data.29\n[58] I find that the claimant explanation, augmented by counsel's submission, is not reasonable. The claimant's summons is a \"People's Court\" summons, which distinguishable from the various PSB summonses or warrants, significantly because it is a different institution altogether. I find that there is no support for the submission that the difference in the standard language of the form, such as the location of the \"?\" character may be due to regional variations or in this case, data input by an officer. The Board's own country condition research has addressed this factual issue in detail:\nIn correspondence with the Research Directorate, the Associate Director of the Centre for Rights and Justice at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), who is also a research assistant professor at CUHK's Faculty of Law, provided court manuals as well as samples of summonses and a subpoena taken from police (Associate Director 22 June 2013). The samples were taken from manuals owned by the Associate Director as well as obtained from CUHK's library (ibid. 18 June 2013).\nAccording to the Associate Director, there has been no variation in the format of the summonses and subpoenas since 2003 (ibid. 22 June 2013). In subsequent correspondence, the Associate Director stated that such forms are supposed to be used throughout the country and that \"regional variations are not meant to exist\" (ibid. 24 June 2013). 30\n[Emphasis added]\n[59] The research above specifically relates to the sample summonses that are found in Exhibit 11 which the Board has officially translated.\n[60] I find that a fair reading of the Associate Director's evidence indicates that the format of the summons which are attached to this RIR and Exhibit 11 have not varied since 2003, which is a lengthy ten year period seeing as the Associate Director was interviewed in 2013. Reading the entire statement as a whole, I find that there is no evidentiary basis for counsel's submission that data input could result in variations in the standard language of the form.\n[61] I find that RIR CHN105217.E which was published on October 20, 2015, two years after the publication of CHN104458.E, reaffirms the reliability of the evidence provided by the Associate Director with respect to the non-variance of summonses by Chinese authorities in CHN104458.E:\nIn correspondence with the Research Directorate, an official at the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Ottawa indicated that according to officials in Beijing, there has been no update to the 2012 MPS templates mentioned in relation to the Criminal Procedure Law of 2014 (China 13 Oct. 2015).\nFor additional translated samples of summonses and a subpoena provided to the Research Directorate by an Associate Director of the Centre for Rights and Justice at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in June 2013, please refer to Response to Information Request CHN104458.31\n[Emphasis added]\n[62] Reading both RIRs together, I find that I cannot accede to counsel's submissions due to its lack of evidentiary foundation.\n[63] I find that variation in the format of the claimant's summons compared to the samples in the Board's country condition document, however small, adversely affects the reliability and authenticity of this form. I find that this deficiency, in combination with the claimant's lack of general credibility, the availability of fraudulent documents in China, and the relative ease by which this simple typewritten and handwritten document could be manufactured leads me to find that this is on a balance of probabilities a fraudulent document.\n[64] Counsel submits that this documents includes red ink stamps, which are a security feature. While stamps are generally accepted as security features, I find that the deficiencies on the face on this document in combination with the other reasons mentioned significantly outweigh any weight that these stamps may lend to the authenticity of this document. This is not a reliable document. I assign it not evidentiary weight. It does not overcome the claimant's lack of credibility.\nMedical documents\n[65] The claimant provided medical documents from China that speak to his insomnia, mental state, and other medical issues in China.32 I find that I cannot assign these documents any weight because of the absence of credible and trustworthy evidence that links the claimant's alleged medical condition to the practice of Falun Gong. I note here that these documents do not overcome the claimant's lack of credibility with respect to his motivation to start practicing Falun Gong, which was analyzed in detail earlier in these reasons.\nNo credible and trustworthy evidence to establish genuine Falun Gong practice in Canada - sur place\n[66] As the Court explains in Jiang, the Panel can \"import its credibility findings into its assessment of an application's sur place claim.\"33 The Panel can, \"assess an applicant's genuineness and therefore its sur place claim in light of credibility concerns relating to the original authenticity of a claim.\"34 Since the Panel has made negative credibility findings - the Panel, therefore, can import these findings onto the assessment of the Claimant's sur place claim.\n[67] In light of my earlier findings regarding the Claimants' overall credibility, I assign no weight to the remaining documentary evidence adduced by the claimant, such as the letters from fellow practitioners35 and pictures of the claimant allegedly practicing Falun Gong in Miliken Park.36 I note that those letters are not sworn in the manner of an affidavit or affirmed like oral testimony. These letters are therefore entitled to less weight. I also find that I cannot assign these letters and pictures any weight because the claimant was not credible about the genuineness of his Falun Gong practice in Canada.\n[68] I find that the claimant's testimony with respect to his own practice and beliefs about Falun Gong failed to establish an alleged sincere belief. The Federal Court has set out guidance for the Board in evaluating such evidence:\n\u00b612 The inquiry by courts (and tribunals) into religious belief is to be approached with caution given the very subjective and personal nature of a person's religious belief. In Syndicat Northcrest v. Amselem, 2004 SCC 47 (CanLII), 2004 SCC 47(Amselem) the Supreme Court of Canada stated that claimants seeking to invoke freedom of religion should not need to prove the validity of their beliefs are objectively recognized as valid. The Supreme Court indicated that a person must show sincerity of belief and not that a particular belief is \"valid\":\n50 ... Accordingly, courts should avoid judicially interpreting and thus determining, either explicitly or implicitly, the content of a subjective understanding of religious requirement, \"obligation,\" precept, \"commandment,\" custom or ritual. Secular judicial determinations of theological or religious disputes, or of contentious matters of religious doctrine, unjustifiably entangle the court in the affairs of religion.\n51 That said, while a court is not qualified to rule on the validity or veracity of any given religious practice or belief, or to choose among various interpretations of belief, it is qualified to inquire into the sincerity of a claimant's belief, where sincerity is in fact at issue: see Jones, supra; Ross, supra. It is important to emphasize, however, that sincerity of belief simply implies an honesty of belief: see Thomas v. Review Board of the Indiana Employment Security Division, supra.\n53 Assessment of sincerity is a question of fact that can be based on several non-exhaustive criteria, including the credibility of a claimant's testimony (see Woehrling, supra, at p. 394), as well as an analysis of whether the alleged belief is consistent with his or her other current religious practices... 37\n[69] The claimant in this case was found to be without general credibility. I find that factor adversely affects the weight that can be assigned to the claimant's testimony concerning the sincerity of his Falun Gong practice. Furthermore, the claimant's substantive responses to questions concerning his practice demonstrated lack of sincerity of belief.\n[70] The claimant displayed some knowledge of Falun Gong, although he was notably hesitating (repeatedly) when reciting the verses of the five exercises. I find that his repeated hesitation detracts from the credibility of his demeanour because it indicates that this knowledge was rehearsed and learned specifically for this refugee hearing. While I accept that the claimant may have been nervous as he indicated in response to me noting his hesitation in the hearing room, I nevertheless find that this hesitation is not consistent with practice of Falun Gong every weekend and weekly group study since he came to Canada. I find that this testimony does not indicate sincerity of belief.\n[71] The claimant was asked to detail the activities that comprise his Falun Gong practice in Canada. Through numerous questions and answers, it was established that the claimant performs the five exercises, attend group study and recruits new practitioners at Pacific Mall. The claimant confirmed that this was the extent of his activities and Falun Gong practice in Canada. I then asked the claimant how he connects with Falun Gong on a personal level. The claimant testified that when he is alone, he practices the five exercises and reads the book, Zuan Falun. He confirmed that this is \"basically it\" for his Canadian practice.\n[72] I then asked the claimant if his practice included \"sending righteous thoughts\". The claimant confirmed that he did send righteous thoughts. He explained that today he did the movements, tomorrow he will send righteous and that really, he should be sending righteous thoughts about four times a day, although not today because he is in Court. I asked the claimant why he failed to mention this element of his practice when he asked to detail the various elements of his practice earlier. The claimant explained that he thought it was not necessary.\n[73] I find the claimant's explanations to be not reasonable or credible because the claimant later on confirmed in testimony that sending righteous thoughts is important to him personally and for \"many deep reasons\". The lectures of Master Li, the founder of Falun Gong, confirm that sending righteous thoughts is important in the practice of Falun Gong. Master Li directs disciples like the claimant to \"take sending righteous thoughts very seriously\".38 Sending righteous thoughts is particularly important for practitioners, in similar position to the claimant, who allegedly suffered persecution in China because of the ameliorative effect of sending righteous thoughts where persecution continues:\nDafa disciples' sending forth righteous thoughts at this special historic period-in order to reduce the evil beings' persecution of Dafa, Dafa disciples, and the people of the world-has played a very critical role. A large number of evil beings have been cleaned out in a timely manner before the force of Fa-rectification arrives, and this has reduced many potential losses.39\n[74] I would have expected the claimant to identify such an important aspect of his practice when asked repeatedly to detail the various elements of his practice, without me prompting him, especially since this is an activity that the claimant allegedly performs four times a day. I draw an adverse inference as to the credibility of the claimant's sur place claim and alleged genuineness and sincerity of his Falun Gong practice from his testimony.\n[75] The claimant was also asked by his counsel to name the basic principle of Falun Gong. The claimant answered to strengthen body and health. I asked the claimant to explain to me why his answer is different than \"Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance\" which is also known as a statement of principles for Falun Gong.40 The claimant explained that Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance is just a slogan. I find the claimant's explanation to be not reasonable and not credible because it is contradicted by the documentary evidence which indicates that Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance are in fact the principles of this particular faith41. Counsel or the claimant have not referred me to any additional disclosure or another item in the national documentation package which provides an alternative set of principles, let alone the specific answer provided by the claimant. I prefer the documentary evidence over the claimant's testimony because this particular RIR is based on interviews with the Falun Dafa Association of Canada which is a well-established representative body for Falun Gong practitioners in Canada which I would expect would be knowledgeable about the faith that it represents. I find that claimant's answer evidences a disconnect between himself and the faith that he purports to practice sincerely. I draw an adverse inference as to the claimant's credibility with respect to the genuineness and alleged sincerity of his Falun Gong practice in Canada from his evidence which is inconsistent with the country documentation.\n[76] I find that the claimant has failed to adduce any credible and trustworthy evidence to establish the sincerity of his alleged Falun Gong practice in Canada. I find that any knowledge or activities he performed with respect to Falun Gong in Canada were conducted for the sole purpose of advancing this refugee claim. If returned to China, I find on a balance of probabilities that the claimant would not practice Falun Gong.\n[77] I also find that the claimant has failed to adduce any credible or trustworthy evidence to establish a sur place claim on the basis of his alleged activities in support of Falun Gong in Canada, such as by allegedly recruiting new Falun Gong adherents in public (at the Pacific mall) have placed him at a serious risk of persecution upon return to China. In the absence of credible testimony from the claimant, I find that he has failed to establish with credible and trustworthy evidence that his alleged activities in support of Falun Gong have come to the attention of authorities in China.\nMANIFESTLY UNFOUNDED CLAIM\n[78] Section 107.1 of the IRPA reads:\nIf the Refugee Protection Division rejects a claim for refugee protection, it must state in its reasons for the decision that the claim is manifestly unfounded if it is of the opinion that the claim is clearly fraudulent.42\n[79] I find that the false representations made by the claimant through his submission of fraudulent documentation relates to the central elements of his claim for protection, namely his alleged practice of Falun Gong. It substantively goes to the claimant's alleged risk profile in China.\n[80] The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Position on Manifestly Unfounded Applications for Asylum has provided the following guidance on this topic:\nThe Office has stated that the notion of \"clearly fraudulent\" could reasonably cover situations where the applicant deliberately attempts to deceive the authorities determining refugee status. The mere fact of having made false statements to the authorities does not, however, necessarily exclude a well-founded fear of persecution and vitiate the need for asylum, thus making the claim \"clearly fraudulent.\" Only if the applicant makes what appear to be false allegations of a material or substantive nature relevant for the determination of his or her status could the claim be considered \"clearly fraudulent.\"43\n[Emphasis added]\n[81] In Warsame v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)44 Justice Roy stated the following about manifestly unfounded claims:\nParliament chose to require that the claim be \"clearly fraudulent\" for particular consequences to flow. That would entail that it is the claim itself that is assessed as being fraudulent, and not the fact that the applicant would have used, for instance, fraudulent documents to get out of the country of origin or to gain access to Canada. However, once making a claim for refugee protection, the applicant would have to operate with clean hands and statements in support of the claim have to be accurate or they could be held against the claimant. In other words, the claimant would be attempting to gain refugee protection through falsehoods that may make the claim fraudulent. It is the claim that must be fraudulent.45\n[Emphasis added]\n[82] For all of the reasons that I have discussed, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the basis of claim is not credible.\n[83] Moreover, I find that the claimant has not operated with clean hands. His dishonesty, evidenced by the submission of a key fraudulent document, his Court summons, happened after the claim for refugee protection was commenced and concerned the material or substantive nature of his claim.\n[84] Given the claimant's submission of a fraudulent document that is of a material or substantive nature and its relevance to the determination of his claim, I also find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claim is clearly fraudulent. Therefore, I find that the claim is manifestly unfounded.\nCONCLUSION\n[85] Based on the totality of the evidence, I find that there is not a serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted in China, or that, on a balance of probabilities, he would be subjected personally to a danger of torture or to a risk to life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in China.\n[86] I find that the claim is manifestly unfounded. The claim is clearly fraudulent. My credibility findings apply with equal force to the assessment of this claim under both section 96 and 97(1) of IRPA.\n[87] I conclude that the claimant is not a Convention refugee. For the same reasons, the allegations do not give rise to successful claims under section 97(1) of the IRPA. I conclude that the claimant is not a person in need of protection. I therefore reject his claim. The claim is manifestly unfounded.\n(signed)\n\"Yonatan Rozenszajn\"\nYonatan Rozenszajn\nDecember 11, 2017\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n2 Exhibit 12\n3 Exhibit 2, Basis of Claim Form (BOC) TB7-16825.\n4 Elazi, Iseikete Simon v.

Grice\nConseil(s) du (de la\/des) demandeur(e)(s) d'asile\nDesignated Representative(s)\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\nRepr\u00e9sentant(e)(s) d\u00e9sign\u00e9(e)(s)\nCounsel for the Minister\nN\/A\nConseil du (de la) ministre\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The claimants, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, allegedly a citizen of Sri Lanka, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX, allegedly citizens of India, are seeking refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\n[2] The claims were heard together pursuant to section 55 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules.2\n[3] For ease of reference, and to anonymize this decision, the claimants will be referred to as follows: XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as the principal claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX as the adult claimant, and XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX as the minor claimants, and all the claimants collectively as the claimants.\n[4] The Refugee Protection Division appointed the principal claimant to be the designated representative of the minor claimants for the purposes of this proceeding. In making its determination, the panel considered the Gender Guidelines.3\nALLEGATIONS\n[5] The allegations of the claims are fully set out in the Basis of Claim forms (BOC).4 The claimants allege that they are being persecuted in India by the Islamic organization called Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamath (TNJT) because of their Christian religious beliefs. If returned to India, the adult claimant and minor claimants fear that they will be killed.\n[6] The principal claimant alleges the same fear in India. He also alleges that he cannot return to India because he has no valid immigration status within in India. The principal claimant further alleges that he fears persecution at the hands of the Sri Lankan authorities for his imputed political opinion as a member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). He also fears persecution at the hands of Bodu Bala Sena (BBS), a Buddhist extremist group, based on his Christian religious beliefs, and his refusal to pay the extortion money demanded of him. If returned to Sri Lanka, the principal claimant fears he will be arbitrarily detained by the Sri Lankan authorities, and killed by BBS.\nDETERMINATION\n[7] The panel determines that the claimants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.\n[8] The determinative issue in these claims are country of reference, and credibility.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[9] The claimants' identities are established, on a balance of probabilities, through their birth certificates and government issued identity cards which were seized by immigration officials upon their entry into Canada.5\n[10] The panel also finds persuasive the Port of Entry officer's finding with respect to the claimants' identities which was arrived at after an interview of the principal claimant and the family members that came to meet the claimants at the Port of Entry.\nCountry of Reference\n[11] The adult claimant and minor claimants are, on a balance of probabilities, citizens of India as they were all born in India, and at least one of their parents is an Indian citizen.6\n[12] The principal claimant is, on a balance of probabilities, a citizen of India. The Citizenship Act (Amendment), 20157 clearly stipulates that a foreign national married to an Indian citizen is eligible to apply for registration as a citizen overseas (outside of India), if they meet the following criteria:\na. the marriage is registered;\nb. the marriage has continuously subsisted for a minimum of two years;\nc. the foreign national (spouse) passes a security clearance completed by a competent authority; and\nd. Neither the foreign national or Indian citizen has parents, grandparents, nor great grandparents that were citizens of Pakistan, Bangladesh, or any such other country as designated by the Central Government which will be announced in the official gazette.\n[13] The principal claimant meets all the criteria for citizenship as:\na. The marriage was registered in India.8\nb. The marriage between the principal claimant and adult claimant has subsisted for more than two years.\nc. There is no persuasive evidence that the principal claimant would fail the security clearance, as he has never been charged or convicted of a criminal offence.\nd. Neither the principal claimant nor the adult claimant's parents, grandparents or great grandparents are\/were citizens of Pakistan or Bangladesh. The National Documentation Package (NDP) for India does not list Sri Lanka as a country designated by the Central government as one from whose ancestors excludes a person for citizenship in India.9 Nor did the claimants present any evidence to the contrary.\n[14] The panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimants' counsel is incorrectly applying the citizenship law in India as it relates to foreign nationals married to Indian citizens. The claimants' counsel argued that the principal claimant is unable to obtain citizenship as he does not meet the requirements. Specifically, the claimants' counsel argued that the principal claimant must be married to an Indian citizen, and have lived in India legally for seven years. However, the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2003 which the claimants' counsel relies on to support this argument pre-dates the Citizenship Act (Amendment), 2015. The Citizenship Act (Amendment), 2015 added wording within Section 7A allowing foreign nationals married to Indian citizens to register as citizens abroad, and reduced the eligibility requirements for citizenship.\n[15] The state of the current citizenship law in India allows the principal claimant to apply for Indian citizenship. Based on the current citizenship law in India the principal claimant meets the criteria for Indian citizenship. However, the panel must assess whether it is within the principal claimant's control to acquire citizenship in India.\n[16] Tretsetang10, clarified the control test set out in Williams, as follows:\na. On a balance of probabilities, does there exist a significant impediment that may reasonably be considered capable of preventing the claimant from exercising his\/her citizenship rights of state protection in that country of nationality; and\nb. On a balance of probabilities, did the claimant make reasonable efforts to overcome such impediment and that such efforts were unsuccessful that the claimant was unable to obtain the protection of the state.11\n[17] For the following reasons, the panel finds that:\na. There does not exist a significant impediment that prevents the principal claimant from exercising his citizenship rights, and\nb. The principal claimant made no reasonable efforts to overcome any impediments, such as making an application and submitting to a security clearance, to acquire Indian citizenship.\nNo Significant Impediment\n[18] The claimants' counsel argued that there existed two significant impediments to citizenship: a) the right to citizenship is not automatic, and b) the treatment of Sri Lankan Tamils in India is such that a person of that race\/ethnicity would not be granted citizenship in India.\n[19] The panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the principal claimant meets the criteria for Indian citizenship as set out in the Citizenship Act (Amendment), 2015, and would be granted citizenship, if he applied. The principal claimant presented no evidence that he would be subject to conditions, or restrictions, under the Citizenship Act (Amendment), 2015, that would significantly impede his application for Indian citizenship.\n[20] The panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, his race\/ethnicity as a Sri Lankan Tamil is not a significant impediment to acquire Indian citizenship.\n[21] Though the Indian government did conduct repatriation of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees, and there were some restriction of refugees' mobility within India,12 the principal claimant as a citizen of India would not be considered a Sri Lankan refugee, and therefore not subject to repatriation or restriction as to his mobility.\n[22] A review of the objective documentary evidence demonstrates that Tamil persons are generally well treated by Indian society, and government. There no is restriction to their mobility, and Tamil persons commonly relocate to other parts of India.13 A Tamil person's ability to find housing, and employment depends on their caste, and socio-economic class, and not specifically their race\/ethnicity. Tamils have not been targeted, directly or indirectly, when moving to large city centres outside of Tamil Nadu, like Mumbai or Bangalore. While there may been private incidents, there have been no outright discrimination or violence within state or city policies.14 There is a diversity of people amongst Tamils living in cities, including a large middle class, and those that live in slums.15\nNo Reasonable Efforts\n[23] The panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the principal claimant has made no reasonable efforts, after the passing of the Constitution Act (Amendment), 2015, to obtain Indian citizenship. While the principal claimant alleges that he made efforts to obtain Indian citizenship sometime in 2012, and in January 2013, these efforts occurred prior to the changes in the citizenship law in 2015.\n[24] The panel asked the principal claimant if he tried to make any efforts to obtain Indian citizenship, while in Canada. The principal claimant responded that he did not make any efforts as he recently arrived in Canada. The panel asked the principal claimant why he did not make any efforts to obtain Indian citizenship in Canada. The principal claimant stated that he was only in Canada a month. His life is in danger in India because he married a Muslim and she converted to Christianity for him.\n[25] The panel finds unreasonable the principal claimant's explanation that he made no efforts to try to obtain Indian citizenship while in Canada because he recently arrived, and had only been in Canada for a month. The principal claimant is a sophisticated individual with a university education from India and the United Kingdom. Though recently arrived in Canada, the principal claimant had the sophistication, and knowledge, to retain counsel for this refugee hearing. The panel would expect that an individual with the principal claimant's level of education, and life experience, would explore all legal avenues including citizenship in India.\n[26] For the reasons explained below, the panel finds not credible the principal claimant's allegation that he fears for his life in India because he married a Muslim, and she converted to Christianity for him. As the panel finds this allegation not credible, it also finds unreasonable this explanation as to why he made no efforts to obtain Indian citizenship.\nCredibility\n[27] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true unless there is a valid reason to doubt their veracity. In assessing a refugee claimant's sworn testimony, the panel is entitled to consider plausibility, and to apply common sense and rationality. Omissions that involve significant and important aspects of the refugee claim, and do not simply address or clarify minute details, can negatively impact the credibility of the claimant. However, the omission cannot be considered in isolation.16 Where evidence before the panel is inconsistent with the claimant's sworn testimony, the presumption of truth is rebuttable.17\n[28] The presumption of truth was rebutted in this case because:\na. The principal claimant provided no reasonable explanation for omitting from the BOC that the adult claimant's family members threatened to kill the claimants from the start of their marriage until now.\nb. The principal claimant omitted, without reasonable explanation, from the BOC that the adult claimant's family members were members of TNTJ.\nc. The principal claimant gave no reasonable explanation for failing to provide documents to corroborate that TNTJ operates in India.\nd. There is no objective documentary evidence before the panel that TNTJ exists in India.\nOmits Death Threats from Relatives\n[29] The principal claimant testified that the adult claimant's family members have threatened them from the start of their marriage until the present. The principal claimant testified that they were threatened that if they did not convert to Islam their life would be in danger. The principal claimant further elaborated that the adult claimant's family members meant to murder them by informing TNTJ about them. However, the BOC omits threats the principal claimant alleges the adult claimant's family members made towards them.\n[30] The panel asked the principal claimant to explain why the BOC omits that the adult claimant's family members threatened them. The principal claimant explained that they (the family members and TNTJ) are all together in harming them, and that he only mentioned TNTJ instead of mentioning them separately one by one.\n[31] The panel finds unreasonable the principal claimant's explanation. Given the severity of the threats and the frequency with which the claimants were allegedly threatened, the panel would have expected such allegations to be included in the BOC. After all, threats to the claimants' lives are significant incidents of persecution, and establishes an additional agent of persecution as well as a continued interest in the claimants.\n[32] Moreover, the BOC instructed the claimants, in bold font and capital letters, to include everything that is important for their claim.18 On the document itself, 19 and at the beginning of their testimony, the claimants confirmed that their BOC was \"complete\". The claimants also declared that they \"fully understood\" the form20, which was interpreted to them. 21\n[33] The claimants also prepared their BOCs with the assistance of an experienced lawyer.22 Counsel would have been aware that the form is the \"foundational document on which the application was considered and entitlement and credibility assessed\", and that \"omissions could result in adverse credibility findings against the claimant.\"23 Counsel would have had to interview the claimants \"extensively to prepare a narrative that detailed all of the incidents of persecution\" that they experienced, which would require Counsel to \"probe\" and \"dig for more.\"24 The panel finds that the omission of the death threats from the adult claimant's relatives are more than mere details or elaborations.25\n[34] The panel, therefore, finds that the omission of death threats undermines the credibility of the principal claimant's allegation that the claimants' lives are in danger in India because the principal claimant married a Muslim woman, and she converted to Christianity.\nOmits Relatives' Membership in TNTJ\n[35] The panel also asked the principal claimant to explain why it is omitted from the BOC that the adult claimant's family members were members of TNTJ. The principal claimant explained that all Muslims are one community, and that all Muslims are one.\n[36] The panel finds unreasonable the principal claimant's explanation. Firstly, the panel expected the claimants to name in their BOC all the agents of persecution whom they fear, and how they are interconnected, if at all. After all, the agents of persecution, and their interconnectedness, is significant to establish who the claimants fear, the reach those persons have within the country, and the extent of the harm faced, upon return.\n[37] Secondly, the panel takes judicial notice that members of the Islamic faith are made up of a diverse number of individuals from all walks of life whose interpretation of that faith is also diverse. It is, therefore, unreasonable to assume that because the adult claimants' family members may be Muslim that they are by default included when TNTJ is mentioned in the BOC.\n[38] The panel, therefore, finds that the omission from the BOC that the adult claimant's relatives are members of TNTJ undermines the credibility of the claimants' allegation that they are persecuted by the adult claimants' relatives and TNTJ because of their religious beliefs.\nNo Efforts to Provide Documents of TNTJ's operation in India\n[39] The principal claimant testified that TNTJ operated throughout India. However, he did not obtain any documents to corroborate that TNTJ operates throughout India. The panel asked the principal claimant to explain why he did not obtain any documents to corroborate that TNTJ operates throughout India. The principal claimant explained that he did not do so because one can find that information on Google.\n[40] The claimants bear the onus of presenting sufficient evidence to establish their claims.26 The principal claimant, and adult claimant, have many years of formal education.27 The principal claimant ran his own business in India. The adult claimant was a working professional in India. The claimants were able to provide documentation to this panel, including a medical report from Sri Lanka, identity documents, and education credentials.28\n[41] However, the claimants failed to make any efforts to provide documentation to this panel of the existence of TNTJ in India. Evidence of TNTJ's existence in India is important to establish as the claimants allege that this group is persecuting them.\n[42] The panel finds unreasonable the principal claimant's explanation for his failure to produce documents. Firstly, the claimants have demonstrated that they are aware of their obligation to put forward evidence in support of their claim by the fact that they submitted evidence to the Board. The panel reasonably expected, given the principal and adult claimants' level of education, that they would produce evidence of TNTJ's existence particularly since such information is allegedly readily available through Google.\n[43] Secondly, the claimants allege that they fear being killed by TNTJ, if returned to India. Given the threat faced by the claimants upon return, the panel would expect that the principal claimant would perform an easily accessible Google search to prove the existence of the group that is responsible for such a threat.\n[44] The panel, therefore, finds that the claimants' failure to provide any evidence of TNTJ's existence in India, undermines the credibility of the claimants' subjective fear of persecution at the hands of TNTJ.\nObjective Basis\n[45] The panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimants have failed to establish a well-founded basis for their fear of persecution at the hands of TNTJ in India.\n[46] The claimants allege that they fear persecution at the hands of TNTJ on the basis of their religious beliefs. However, the objective documentary evidence for India makes no mention of TNTJ's existence, or of any acts of violence committed by TNTJ on India's Christian population.29 While the claimants' counsel submitted documentary evidence that supports the existence of Sri Lanka Thowheed Jamath, the country conditions evidence submitted by counsel makes no mention of TNTJ's existence in India or of any acts of violence committed by TNTJ within India against the Christian population.30\n[47] The claimants are represented by experienced counsel, and counsel is, or ought to be, aware that establishing an objective basis is essential to any refugee claim.\n[48] As there is no objective documentary evidence before the panel of TNTJ's existence in India, the panel finds that the claimants failed to establish an objective basis for their fear of persecution at the hands of TNTJ.\n[49] The panel therefore finds that the lack of objective basis undermines the credibility of the claimants' allegations that TNTJ is persecuting them because of their Christian beliefs.\nCredibility Summary\n[50] The omissions in the BOC regarding the adult claimant's relatives death threats towards the claimants, the relatives involvement with TNTJ, and the lack of objective documentary evidence establishing the existence of TNTJ, rebuts the presumption of truthfulness of the claimants' allegation that they are persecuted in India by TNTJ.\n[51] For the above reasons, the panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimants have failed to establish a serious possibility of persecution upon their return in India.\nResidual Profile\nChristian Identity\n[52] The panel considered whether the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution in India as Christians.\n[53] For the following reasons, the panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimants, as Christian, do not face a serious possibility in India.\n[54] The claimants are less likely to be targeted, as they reside in Tamil Nadu, the southern part of India where incidents of mistreatment are less frequent. A review of the objective documentary evidence demonstrates that the majority of incidents take place in the northern provinces of India.31\n[55] Christians are more likely to be mistreated where anti-conversion laws are enforced. As the seven states that adopted the anti-conversion laws are located in the north, the claimants whom reside in Tamil Nadu, the south, are less likely to be subjected to violence or mistreatment.32\n[56] The majority of the Muslim population, whom the claimants allege to fear, reside in the northern provinces of India away from the claimants whom reside in the south.33\n[57] While one source states that Christians are at risk everywhere because they reside in relatively small pockets, the panel prefers the majority view that the Christian population is sizeable in Tamil Nadu, and that in at least three states Christianity is the majority religion.34 As there are portions of India with majority Christian populations, Christians are not exposed, on a balance of probabilities, to risk everywhere in India by virtue of them residing in relatively small pockets spread throughout India.\n[58] While the claimants, as religious minorities, may be subject to discrimination, the panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, this discrimination does not rise to the level of persecution.\nCONCLUSION\n[59] After assessing all the of the evidence before it, the panel concludes that:\na. India is a country of reference as the adult claimant and minor claimants are all citizens of India, and the principal claimant is eligible to acquire Indian citizenship;\nb. Due to a lack of credibility, the claimants failed to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that they will face a serious possibility of persecution at the hands of TNTJ, upon their return to India; and\nc. The claimants as Christians do not, on a balance of probabilities, face a serious possibility of persecution upon their return to India.\n[60] The panel concludes that the claimants have not established that they face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground. Consequently, the claimants are not Convention refugees as per section 96 of the IRPA. Upon their return to India, the claimants are not, on a balance of probabilities, at risk of their lives, danger of torture, or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. Consequently, they are not persons in need of protection, as per subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\n[61] The panel rejects their claims.\n(signed)\n\"A. Rico\"\nA.

Accordingly, this de novo decision has considered this issue in detail.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimant's allegations are set out in his Personal Information Form (\"PIF\")2 which he amended at the outset of the hearing to declare an additional material fact, namely that in XXXX 2016, his cousin XXXX XXXX was attacked by XXXX family members (there is no relation between the XXXX family and the XXXX family). This attack is allegedly tied to overall allegation that the XXXX family is seeking to kill the claimant in order to restore the XXXX family\/clan honour because the claimant, as a catholic man, inappropriately romantically courted a Muslim woman named XXXX XXXX who was already promised in an arranged marriage (which involved exchanges of land and money) to another man named XXXX XXXX. The claimant and XXXX nevertheless kept in contact and regularly met in secret from 2009 to about XXXX 2011. XXXX was supposed to marry XXXX in XXXX2010 but he was arrested and imprisoned for an unrelated assault in XXXX 2010.\n[4] The claimant alleges his romantic involvement with XXXX was eventually discovered in XXXX 2011 and that XXXX brothers, father and other XXXX clan members beat him up on at least two occasions which required hospitalizations. The claimant alleges that he received inadequate state protection in that the police officers who were called by the hospitals where he was in care effectively held him responsible for his own problems and refused to intervene. The claimant alleged that the XXXX family bribed a bar owner in XXXX 2011 in the town where he hid to alert them to his whereabouts. He departed Albania in 2011.\nNEXUS\n[5] Counsel submitted that this claim should be considered under section 96 of the IRPA. I agree. The allegations clearly raise some mixed religious animus by way of the Muslim XXXX family feeling dishonoured because the claimant is a Christian. Counsel also raised gender and politics (opposition to marriage patriarchy) as additional grounds. Seeing as religious nexus is already established, there is no need to analyze these additional grounds.\n[6] I find that the allegations raise a nexus to the Convention ground of religion and should therefore be considered under section 96 of IRPA.\nDETERMINATION\n[7] I find that the claimant is not a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, nor is he a person in need of protection, pursuant to subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\n[8] The determinative issue in this case is whether the claimant has successfully rebutted the presumption of state protection.\nIdentity\n[9] The claimant's personal and national identity as Albanian is established by his testimony, his driver's license3 which was seized by Canadian immigration and his other subsidiary documents from Albania.\nCredibility\n[10] The claimant was generally a credible witness. His provided consistent testimony on the events that occurred to him personally. I accept the general allegations in set out in the amended PIF have occurred, including the 2016 attack on cousin XXXX. However, there are a few matters where the claimant has failed to adduce sufficient credible and reliable evidence.\nInsufficient credible evidence to establish that the XXXX clan wants to kill the claimant\n[11] In the middle of the hearing, while the claimant was testifying about the proposed IFA in Tirana, he mentioned that in addition to the XXXX clan, he also fears the XXXX clan because they also feel dishonoured by the claimant's interloping with XXXX which they believe has caused the arranged marriage to ultimately collapse.\n[12] I asked the claimant to explain to me why his PIF omits any alleged fear from the XXXX clan. The claimant explained that he only learned recently, in 2017, of this threat through his neighbour \"XXXX XXXX\".4 I then asked the claimant why he has failed to orally declare this as a change to his PIF at the start of the hearing as he has done with respect to the cousin XXXX 2016 assault. The claimant explained that the XXXX threat escaped his mind.\n[13] I find the claimant's explanation not reasonable because I would have expected the claimant to learn about this threat, if it was credible, years ago, not just now in 2017. More importantly, the evidence about this XXXX threat is tenous at best. XXXX XXXX declaration dated XXXX XXXX, 2017 states that \"my sister has told me that the XXXX(sic) family as well has vowed to kill XXXX if they find him, even though they broke off the engagement\".5 This is second hand evidence for XXXX XXXX which at any rate is devoid any explanation as to when the sister conveyed this information. I assign no evidentiary weight to these second statements. If this threat was serious, I would have expected the claimant to amend his PIF, at least orally at the start of the hearing, and to sketch out the basic allegations about the threat XXXX clan and its general profile in Albania in basic form. I draw an adverse inference as to claimant's general credibility. I find that he has failed to establish a credible fear of persecution from the XXXX clan.\nInsufficient credible evidence of Catholic-Muslim intolerance and mixed marriage\n[14] As stated earlier, I believe the claimant when he says that the XXXX clan is persecuting him, including for religious reasons. However, I find that the balance of his testimony about the general climate of religious intolerance in Albania, including that held by the police, is not well founded and not credible.\n[15] At various points during his testimony, the claimant professed to have concerns (and some fear) that the police has not helped him in the past, and will not help him in the future because the police, like most of Albanians, are Muslim and he is a Catholic. He also said that Catholics and Muslims have clashes in Albania.\n[16] The claimant's concerns and fears are contradicted by the evidence in the national documentation package, and also the August 2013 Albania Country Marriage Package from the Refugee Documentation Centre of Ireland6, which states:\nInter-religious marriages are common in Albania, including marriages between Muslims and Christians. Numerous sources suggest that most Albanians have tolerance or moderate attitudes towards mixed marriages.7\n[17] The same document also indicates that \"language\" is the dominant source of identity in Albania and that Albanians have developed a \"strong tradition of religious tolerance\". Similar evidence is presented in the U.S. State Department Religious Freedom Report for 2016 which quotes the Grand Mufti Skender Brucaj, the leader of the Muslim community, welcoming the Israeli soccer team to Albania by citing the country's religious tolerance and harmony.8\n[18] I put to the claimant that there is some evidence that Christians and Muslims generally get along well in Albania, and even mixed marriages are tolerated and I asked him to explain why the documentary evidence appears to be different than his experience. The claimant's explanation was \"well, they did not accept me\".\n[19] While I believe the claimant when he says that the specific XXXX clan is prejudiced against him and this may have manifested itself in some religious slurs, I find that his explanation and testimony is otherwise not reasonable when it comes to the general alleged intolerance between Christians and Muslims because it is directly contradicted by the country condition evidence. I prefer the country condition evidence because it originates from reliable institutions such as the U.S. state department and a legal aid research centre in Ireland similar to the agencies that operate in Canada. The Country Marriage Pack cites other sources such as the Australian Refugee Review Tribunal research. If the situation in Albania involved \"clashes\" between Muslims and Christians leading Christian Albanian people to fear approaching Muslim police officers, I would have expected the documentary evidence to say so. I find that the claimant's testimony is in conflict with reliable and well informed country condition documentation. I draw an adverse inference as to the claimant's general credibility. I find that this is effectively an embellishment to the claimant's account. I do not believe the claimant when he says that there is a general climate of intolerance between Christians and Muslims or that the police, even if it is predominantly Muslim, discriminates against Christians or prefers Muslims over Christians. I find that the documentary evidence is sufficiently clear for me to find that generally, Albania is a religiously tolerant country, even if the XXXX clan is not.\nPrior adverse experiences with Albanian police - not a reliable indicator of forward looking police protection\n[20] The claimant testified that his two instances of interaction with the Albanian police in 2011 were not satisfactory. In both instances, the police basically blamed the claimant for his problems and refused to provide him with any protection or to even take a report. The claimant states that the policemen were cultural traditionalists who were not happy that the claimant was going after someone else's intended wife. The claimant also believes that the fact he was a Christian and the police were Muslims worked against him. The potential religious animus by random police officers is not a well-founded or credible assertion for the reasons provided above. However, there is nothing implausible or inherently not credible about police officers in Albania in 2011 being beholden to traditional values which would translate into victim blaming as the claimant experienced.\n[21] The problem with the claimant's testimony about his treatment by police in 2011, even when believable, is that it is significantly dated given the lengthy passage of time from the time of his departure to the hearing before me in 2017. As the next section on state protection indicates, considerable operational changes have occurred in Albanian with respect to state protection in the intervening six years. I find that the claimant's personalized evidence about police protection is so dated in light of the new country condition evidence that I cannot assign his testimony more than a small evidentiary weight. I do not believe the claimant when he says that he cannot obtain police protection in Albanian in 2017.\nThe claimant has failed to rebut the presumption of state protection\n[22] The claimant has not rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence which is sufficient to dismiss this claim.\n[23] There is a presumption that the state is capable of protecting its citizens except in situations where the state is in complete breakdown.9 A claimant who alleges that the state protection is inadequate must persuade the Board that the evidence establishes that the state protection is inadequate.10 The evidence that state protection is inadequate must not only be reliable and probative, it must also satisfy the Board, on a balance of probabilities, that the state protection is inadequate.11\n[24] A claimant can rebut the presumption by providing clear and convincing evidence of the state's inability to protect.12 The onus is on the claimant to approach the state for protection in situations where state protection might reasonably be forthcoming.13\n[25] No government can be expected to guarantee perfect protection of all of its citizens at all times, and the fact that a state is not always successful in protecting its citizens is not enough to justify a claim. This is particularly true when a state is in effective control of its territory and has military, police, and civil authorities in place and is making serious attempts to protect its citizens.14\n[26] The burden of proving an absence of state protection is directly proportional to the level of democracy that exists in the state.15 The documentary evidence before me indicates that Albania is a functioning democracy.16 Albania is in control of its territory and has functioning security forces, both military and police, in place. There is no evidence of a total breakdown of state authority in Albania.\n[27] Furthermore, the claimant cannot rebut the presumption of state protection in a functioning democracy by asserting only a subjective reluctance to engage the state.17\n[28] For the reasons provided, I find that the claimant has not provided sufficient evidence that is clear and convincing demonstrating that state protection is inadequate at the operational level and relevant to the claimant's circumstances in Albania on a forward looking basis.\n[29] The claimant's evidence with respect to seeking police protection consists of two separate interactions at hospitals in two different cities in 2011 after attacks by the XXXX clan. The first interaction was in XXXX 2011 in the hospital after the claimant was attacked in his car when he was with XXXX. The claimant told the XXXX year old police officer what happened. He testified that the police officer stopped taking notes and told him that he deserves to die because he is going against tradition by taking someone's wife. The claimant never followed up with any other police officers or stations, and he never complained about this particular police officer to a higher -up officer. The claimant explained his lack of efforts because he was afraid that the police are men who follow traditions, Albania is a Muslim country, this officer's colleagues would support his decision and he ultimately was concerned that he would be beaten up by the police themselves.\n[30] The second interaction with police occurred in XXXX 2011 after the XXXX clan attacked him in a different city. The claimant was again hospitalized. Two different officers saw him in the hospital. When the claimant mentioned that the reason he was attacked was because he loved the daughter\/sister of the attackers, one of the officers tore up his notes, called him a fool, and walked away. The claimant never followed up with the police after being discharged from the hospital. He never complained to higher authorities about these particular police officers' conduct. He provided similar explanations for not wanting to interact further with the police, adding that he feared that the rich XXXX clan would corrupt the police to actually mistreat him, or that the police would alert the clan about his whereabouts.\n[31] The inherent problem with the claimant's testimony is that it consists of knowledge and experiences from 2011, about six years ago, which I find is quite dated and stale and ultimately not representative of the current evidence with respect to police protection in Albania. While his explanations for failing to seek state protection at a higher level in 2011 may be reasonable, I find that the conditions today are significantly different. State protection is a forward looking assessments especially in cases such as these. I find that the current evidence indicates that Albania police can and will provide the claimant with adequate and effective state protection against any criminal offense committed against him as a result of the desire by the XXXX clan to kill him to in order to cleanse the family dishonour that he caused them due to his involvement with XXXX.\n[32] Before delving into the details of the documentary evidence, it is important address at the outset an important submission by counsel, to the effect that the claimant is not suffering from a blood but from a sort of vendetta, motivated by politics (opposition to patriarchy) and that protection should be viewed from the women's context, namely the insufficient implementation of protection for women suffering from gender based violence. Most importantly, counsel submits that crimes linked to blood feuds have declined, but homicides of vendetta are not impacted by any government efforts to reduce blood feud and that murderers are not systematically convicted.\n[33] I find that I cannot accedes to counsel's submissions because they are not supported by the evidence. First, I find that there is no link between the situation of the claimant to the evidence of gender based violence and the frailties of state protection in that context. The claimant is not a woman suffering domestic violence at the hands of her husband, which is the traditional situation involving the Board's Gender Guidelines.18 Item 1.3 in the national documentation package, relied upon by counsel, and addresses specifically the problem of women facing domestic violence, including sexual offences and murder from their partners. The fact that the genesis of the XXXX thirst for murder originated in a breach of gender norms does not render the claimant's situation equivalent to that of a female domestic violence victim. Item 1.3 indicates that domestic violence proceedings are subject to different statutory provisions which require lower burden of proof by the complainants. It is not the same scheme that applies to regular crimes, or even crimes associated with vengeance of \"blood feud\". This report notes that one of the challenges in effective implementation of domestic violence legislation in Albania is the view by some prosecutors and judges that domestic violence between man and wife is \"private\".19 This is not applicable to the claimant's situation which involves at this point a public proclamation by the XXXX claim that they will kill him, wherever he may be found. I find that counsel's referral to the documentary material addressing gender based persecution is not helpful to the assessment of state protection in the claimant's circumstances.\n[34] Furthermore, I find that counsel's overall submission that mere vengeance or revenge killings are not offered adequate state protection (unlike the more formal \"blood feud\") is without basis. As a starting point, I find that the recent change in Albanian criminal law in 2013 or 2014 is sufficiently broad to accommodate the claimant's threat of murder by the XXXX clan:\nArticle 78\/a Murder for Blood Feud\nIntentional homicide for blood feud shall be punishable by imprisonment of not less than thirty years or life imprisonment;\n...\nArticle 83\/a [No title in original]\nSerious intimidation for revenge or blood feud, against a person in order to have him immobilized within the house is punishable by imprisonment up to three years;\nArticle 83\/b Incitement for Blood Feud\nInciting other persons for revenge or blood feud, when it does not constitute other criminal act[s], is punishable by imprisonment up to three years.20\n[Emphasis added]\n[35] I find that the language of the law on intimidation and incitement which includes \"revenge\" which is a similar term to the word \"vendetta\" used by counsel, indicates that the state of Albania does not draw artificial divisions between \"classical blood feuds\" and the more modern version of blood feuds which is basically murder with intent due to some prior insult or disrespect that has generated a motive to attack.\n[36] The most recent documentary evidence in the national documentation package, dated June 29, 2017 and researched by the Office of the Commissioner General for Refugees and Stateless Persons in the E.U. provides the context for merger of \"blood feud\" and simple revenge killings:\n2.3 Blurring the distinction between blood feud killings and revenge killings\nPhilip Alston points out in his report that the terms blood feud (gjakmarrja) and revenge (hakmarrja) are nowadays often used interchangeably, meaning any kind of revenge is likely to be labelled as blood feud or gjakmarrja.\nRasim Gjoka stated that there is confusion in classifying murders in the north of Albania. Influenced by the customary law, there are cases of murders for ordinary reasons, committed to revenge, which are classified as blood feud.\nSimilarly, Elsa Ballauri stated this:\n\"In the south many crimes happen but they don't use the term blood feud. There are many cases in which they killed a close friend or a brother but nobody calls it blood feud. The intentions are not because of blood feud. They just want to take revenge. But when the same crimes happen in the north, it is called blood feud.\"\nThis observation is also confirmed by Mentor Kikia who stated that a murder that happens in the north of Albania will rather be considered gjakmarrja because of the perpetuation of the traditional mentality over there, while the same type of murder in the south of Albania becomes hakmarrja.65\nAccording to the AIPA report, a reason for the blurring between revenge killings and blood feud killings nowadays could be that sometimes ordinary revenge killings start to resemble blood feud killings after some time because of the way some people respond to them mentally:\n\"despite the lack of canonical grounds, in most cases families hide or isolate themselves, send mediators to negotiate reconciliation, thus entering into a blood feud. Under these circumstances despite the revengeful character of the intent to commit the second murder, parties position themselves in a blood feud situation, which makes the present day phenomenon a hybrid much more complex than the initial one.\"\nThe General Director from the Albanian State Police also stated that revenge cases, that most often are the consequence of criminal problems and individual conflicts or disputes, can happen to everyone and everywhere and are very often wrongly labelled as blood feud. But he also warned that cases of revenge killing often transfer into cases of blood feud. This happens \"as soon as the regulating role of the elderly is involved\". As prescribed by the Kanun, the elderly sometimes choose a target and the victim will lock himself up.\nRasim Gjoka explained that in the north sometimes \"they start with revenge and afterwards it transfers into blood feud\".\nOperazione Colomba in its 2015 report also stresses the difficulties in distinguishing revenge killing from blood feud. Modern blood feuds in Albania are a form of revenge justified by the norms of ancient practices. In fact, modern blood feuds resemble these practices only in their goal of killing the perpetrator of a crime or his family member and in that families isolate themselves in order to protect their lives. During Cedoca's fact-finding mission a representative from Operazione Colomba argued that her organisation labels a number of murders \"gjakmarrja\", even though the same murders are not considered blood feud murders by institutions. \"Many institutions do not call the first murder blood feud, but refer to it as \"hakmarrja\", whereas they call the second murder \"gjakmarrja\". However, through media analysis we know of criminal organizations that solve problems nowadays by using the same old mechanisms of taking revenge, including the link of family.\" She concludes that in many criminal issues \"there is mainly a cultural thing\".21 [Footnotes omitted, emphasis added]\n[37] I note that the Director General of the Albanian state police was interviewed as part of the above research. I find from his comments that the Albanian state police is aware of the nuance between blood feud and revenge killings, how one can turn into the other. I find that his comments explain why the new criminal code provisions include not only the words \"blood feud\" but also \"revenge\" which I find applies to the claimant's vendetta situation.\n[38] According to the Director General, once the elderly get involved, the case may be considered blood feud. The claimant's own circumstance appear to fit that mould in that community representatives attempted reconciliation without success and that there is evidence that the claimant's own family has abandoned him, apparently willing to see him get killed by the XXXX clan in order to avoid further attacks on other member of the XXXX family. This revenge situation has also resulted in an attack on cousin XXXX in 2016, indicating an expansion of the murderous intent to harm other male members of the XXXX clan. I find that if the claimant approached Albanian police today or in the near future that his situation would be recognized as either a blood feud or sufficiently serious revenge or vendetta situation that merits heightened police protection at an adequate level.\n[39] I find that there is no reliable evidence to indicate that the claimant would be shut out from protection measures intended for victims of blood feud, which have grown around the time of the claimant's departure in 2011 to include the following:\n(i) establishing special structures for the fight against blood feud, especially in areas when this phenomenon is widely spread like in the districts of Shkodra, Lezha, Kukes, Diber, etc.;\n(ii) selecting the staff and their continuous training on specific issues related to prevention and reveal of murders in general and those of blood avenge or vengeance in particular;\n(iii) strengthening the co-operation with prosecution office for investigating quickly these penal offences and bring the offenders before law court;\n(iv) undertaking actions for the seizure of criminal offenders in general and those for blood avenge in particular as a very important means for prevention of blood feud;\n(v) arrangement of activities for the seizure of wanted persons convicted of commitment of murders for the motive of blood avenge, and these have led to reduce evidently blood feud murders;\n(vi) strengthening and institutionalizing co-operation between local government organs and NGOs for settling conflicts by reconciliation;\n(vii) strengthening co-operation between educational directorates and schools for education of the young generation with the spirit of tolerance and prevention of crimes;\n(viii) supporting and cooperating with commission of blood feud reconciliation, always in compliance with law, for the purpose of intermediating the solution by conciliation of conflicts of blood feuds.22\n[40] The Board's own research indicates that Albanian police have set up a database to keep track of potential victims:\nAccording to the UN Special Rapporteur, in June 2012, the Albanian State Police launched a countrywide database which lists all individuals identified as involved in a blood feud; this includes cases submitted to court and those \"not followed up through official channels\" (UN 23 Apr. 2013, para. 19). The same source indicates that the database is updated regularly and may be accessed by the State Police, the Prosecutor General's Office, representatives of the court, and the People's Advocate [Ombudsman].23\n[Emphasis added]\n[41] The country condition evidence indicates that these operational steps, along with the criminalization of making threats to kill for blood feud or revenge have been effective in Albania over the years during the claimant's absence, leading to the reduction in the incidence of blood feud murders.24 Indeed, recent crime statistics indicate a decrease in numerous violent crime categories for Albania.25 This directly addresses counsel submission to the effect that there has not been a reduction in non-blood feud homicides.\n[42] I find that the evidence does not support that submission. I reaching this conclusion, I reviewed item 7.16 in the national documentation package relied upon by counsel, now officially translated by the Board from French to English due to the absence of an original English publication. Counsel was given a chance to comment on the translation. No comments on the translation were received by the deadline, which was set for December 19, 2017.\n[43] Item 7.16 states similarly to the other sources cited that while blood feud and revenge killings continue to occur, there has been a decrease noted in the incidence of blood feud linked killings:\nAccording to the declaration, on 30 June 2016 of an employee form the Albanian Obudsman, the crimes linked to a blood feud have diminished during the last years. The USDOS reveals however, homicides generated by honor crimes and blood feuds during that same years 2015.26\nSelon les d\u00e9clarations du 30 juin\n2016 d'un employ\u00e9 du bureau de l'ombudsman albanais, les crimes li\u00e9s \u00e0 une vendetta ont diminu\u00e9 au cours des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es. L'USDOS rel\u00e8ve toutefois des homicides engendr\u00e9s par des crimes d'honneur et vendettas aussi durant l'ann\u00e9e 2015.27\n[44] There is nothing in this document to indicate that revenge killings have not experienced a similar decline in their incidence. Rather, this document simply states that revenge and honour killings nevertheless occurred, which appears to be intended to ensure that the reader does not get the impression that the problem of revenge killings and blood feud has been completely eliminated.\n[45] Counsel also relies on item 7.16 in arguing that state protection is inadequate. This document concludes that there is \"insufficient\" implementation of the laws in the fight against blood feuds because families of victims have complained that blood feud murderers are not \"systematically condemned\" and because the number of blood feud murderers convicted in 2014 and 2015 were four and three, respectively, figures deemed very low.28 I assign this evidence low evidentiary weight because it is effectively a criticism of state protection in Albania on the basis perfection, as opposed to adequacy. While it would be better that Albania prosecute and convict every murderer with or without a blood feud or revenge motive, this may not be realistic in terms of obtaining the required evidence for prosecution, let alone achieving convictions in accordance with due process of law. While this report states that the implementation of the law is insufficient and the number of conviction is very low, it does not explain what would be an adequate threshold for the report to find \"sufficiency\".\n[46] Item 7.16 also states that the Albanian state has \"insufficient\" preventative and protection measures and \"does not go far enough\" to protect blood feud victims and to prosecute perpetrators.29 This conclusion is based on the opinion of \"different sources\" and the fact that families implicated in blood feuds resort to isolation and confinement to protect themselves, thus denoting the absence or the lack of effective protection offered by the state. I assign this evidence low evidentiary weight because it is based on reverse logic and reasoning. In other words, the fact that some families choose confinement over interaction with police could be due to many reasons, including subjective reluctance, which is a real issue which even this document addresses on an earlier page where it cites families testifying in favour of an accused murderer so that the accused could be himself murdered upon his liberation from jail.30 Given this serious evidence of subjective reluctance to engage police, I find it problematic for this document reach a sweeping conclusion that there are insufficient protection measures using such reverse logic. I note that this same section also cites the failure to setup a particular coordinating council as required by a particular law as demonstrative of a failure to conduct prevention program \"in all the regions\". This is again evidence of lack of perfection. It is fairly minor in the assessment of protection in the aggregate to justify the conclusion of this document.\n[47] Item 7.16 goes on to cite a U.S. based university professor, \"Bernd Fischer\", who states that police rarely rakes any actions in blood feud because they are themselves afraid of being hurt since a family feud is very dangerous to police personal. I assign this evidence no evidentiary weight because it is directly contradicted by the most recent evidence dated June 29, 2017 and researched by the Office of the Commissioner General for Refugees and Stateless Persons in the E.U., discussed earlier in these reasons as well. I prefer the most recent evidence over item 7.16 and Professor Fischer's comments because they are based on new evidence from sources that are in Albania that are expected to be knowledgeable about these issues. As set out in the following excerpt, the new evidence indicates that police are not afraid to provide regular and personalized protection to potential blood feud victims, including by putting themselves in line of fire:\n... All the consulted experts agreed that the police forces nowadays try to intervene in blood feud situations and that police interventions can be of various kinds (identification, monitoring, prevention, arrest, etc.)(cfr. infra 5. Protection). A representative at the Shkod\u00ebr Regional Police Directorate declared that his police officers try to supervise the confined families in his district, \"by regularly contacting them, by patrolling in the proximity of their houses. Local police officers are tasked to stay near the affected families and to stay in contact with them.\" With regard to the affected families in his area who are not living in confinement he declared: \"we are trying to communicate, mitigate, mediate, negotiate and soothe down.\" This source declared that \"all the affected families know neighbourhood police officers. They have their phone numbers and general emergency numbers.\"\nMentor Kikia confirmed that police officers have visited many families in order to identify those who are still affected by blood feud. He also confirmed that many affected families have been provided with the necessary contact details in case they felt an immediate danger. Besides he stated that a lot of people have been arrested after the amendments in the penal code. Police units may also intervene in other ways. In Fush\u00eb-Arr\u00ebz for example, the police was called in order to provide security for two men who had come from abroad to attend the funeral of their father, who was the last person in the village to be in a blood feud.\nIn some cases affected families may have been visited by police officers of the Prosecutor's Office who encouraged families to denounce their situation. On this occasion they were asked to formally indicate by whom they were threatened so that a court case could be started (cfr. infra 3.8 Latency). In the years 2013-2014, officers of the prosecutor have gone to \"every house where there was a claim linked with blood feud\" in order to obtain \"enough evidence to start a case\". The representative from the Prosecutor's Office explained that 200 families in Shkod\u00ebr have been approached \"which are in conflict because of a murder case since the 1990s.\"31\n[Emphasis added]\n[48] The personalized service of Albanian police and their apparent reach as described above appears consistent with other evidence in the national documentation package which state that \"police have a visible presence throughout Tirana and other larger cities\".32 The U.K. Embassy in Albania similarly stated after a 2014 field mission concerning blood feuds that local authorities are active, police and criminal justice system representatives monitor, record, and provide a degree of protection to affected families and that authorities also prosecute perpetrators.33\n[49] The above lengthy excerpt is from an analysis conducted by a European Union institution committed to providing information for asylum determination. This is a similar entity to the Board's own research directorate. I find that this is a highly reliable source of information. I find that this report reliably indicates that in 2017 Albania, police protection from blood feud would include operational steps such as regular patrols in the potential victims' neighbourhood, relevant police officers personally becoming acquainted with potential victims, and personal visits by prosecutors and police for the purpose gathering evidence for prosecution of threats. Furthermore, I note that the police appears to be willing to be provide personal protection on occasion when called upon for special occasions. I find that this evidence indicates a fairly high level of police protection in Albania for blood feud victims who feel threatened by people who seek to commit a vengeance murder.\n[50] I weigh this evidence heavily and I find that it is responsive to the claimant's concerns which arise from an adverse experience with some individual police officers in 2011. I find that the evidence demonstrates a sufficient change in circumstances and protection measures in Albania in 2017. I find that if the claimant accessed protection today, that it is not probable that he would face the same unprofessional, disrespectful and arguably hostile attitude from police as he did in 2011.\n[51] I find that this evidence indicates that there is adequate state protection in Albania. Furthermore, I find that state protection in Albania contemplates that potential victims live their lives normally, without having to resort to confinement.\nPsychological report does not rebut the presumption of state protection\n[52] The analysis of the adequacy of state protection in the context of the claimant's personal circumstances was done in consideration of the claimant's psychological state. The claimant produced a psychological report from Albania which diagnoses the claimant in 2011 as suffering from depression.34 The report states that the claimant has nightmares of people seeking to kill him and insomnia. The claimant was prescribed Clopanize.\n[53] No accommodations were sought in the hearing room. As set out above, the claimant was generally consistent in his testimony. He was generally credible about the core of the claim, subject to the narrow exceptions detailed above. Given the overall credibility of the claimant, I am sympathetic to the emotional concerns he expressed and the diagnosis of depression. However, there is insufficient evidence that explains what limitations, if any, the claimant may experience in Albania is seeking state protection on his own behalf due to the diagnosis of depression. The claimant did not file an updated psychological or psychiatric report that would explain how his 2011 depression diagnosis is relevant today, six years later in 2017, and how it may affect his own ability to obtain state protection in Albania. Given the lengthy passage of time, the lack of evidence that links the 2011 depression diagnosis to any limitations that affect seeking state protection, I find that I can only assign this report a low evidentiary weight. It does not assist the claimant in rebutting the presumption of state protection.\nCorruption in Albania does not rebut the presumption of state protection\n[54] In assessing the adequacy of state protection in Albania to the claimants from blood feud threats and revenge killings, I have considered the incidence of state corruption in the police, judiciary, and prosecution services. The current U.S. Department of State Report makes the following general statement on corruption in Albania:\nThe most significant human rights problems were pervasive corruption in all branches of government, particularly in the judicial and health-care systems, and domestic violence and discrimination against women.35\n...\nPolice did not always enforce the law equitably. Personal associations, political or criminal connections, poor infrastructure, lack of equipment, or inadequate supervision often influenced law enforcement. Low salaries, poor motivation and leadership, and a lack of diversity in the workforce contributed to continued corruption and unprofessional behavior...36\n[55] I find that while there are valid concerns about corruption in Albania, there is insufficient personalized evidence to link to concerns to the claimant's particular circumstances. While the claimant states that the XXXX clan is \"rich\", he has not provided allegations, testimony, or documentary evidence about the XXXX clan corrupting the state officials in the past. While the XXXX corruption of a bar owner is concerning, I find that the weight to be given to this unofficial act of bribery is limited and low in analyzing the adequacy of state protection to the claimant in the context of corruption. The claimant has provided allegations, testimony or evidence about specific personal, political or criminal connection of the XXXX to the state police, prosecutors or judges. I find that his concerns are based on speculation and conjecture.\n[56] At any rate, there is insufficient evidence that the general corruption has affected the adequacy of state protection in relation to revenge killings, blood fraud killings or threats to carry out the either crime. The documentary evidence links corruption with organized crime, not necessarily with revenge killings.37 There are no allegations or evidence that the particular vendetta or revenge which motivates the XXXX clan is connected to organized crime.\n[57] The matter of corruption appears to have led to a historic perception that that the potentially corruptible judiciary \"tends to impose lighter sentences on perpetrators of blood feud-related homicides\".38 However, the documentary sources for those perceptions appear in the documentary evidence are usually dated to 2012 and 2013. I find that that the recent documentary evidence indicates that significant changes have recently occurred in Albania which have resulted in criminal proceedings being initiated against a diverse array of corrupt officials:\nSince the lifting of immunity for judges and high officials in 2012, prosecutors have investigated at least 23 high-level officials, including 14 locally elected officials, four judges, one court clerk, three prosecutors, and one police officer. Jurisdiction over judicial corruption and high-level corruption was transferred to the Serious Crimes Court in March 2014. Prosecutions led by the related Serious Crimes Prosecution Office have resulted in the convictions of two judges, one prosecutor, and one locally elected mayor on corruption charges. Two other judges and one prosecutor charged with corruption await trial.39\n[58] On a forward looking basis, I find that the increase in police salaries which occurred in 2014 will, on a balance of probabilities, further reduce the incentive of police officers to accept corrupt benefits.40 I note that the claimant's own documentary evidence from 2016 refers to \"unofficial reports\" that a little over $6,000 will secure a year's reduction in a judicial court sentence for blood feud murder.41 However, I assign this evidence low evidentiary weight because it is based on a fairly vague reference to \"unofficial reports\", which makes it impossible for me to assess the reliability of such reports or their source. I find that these references are, on a balance of probabilities, repetitions of the same perceptions of injustice and pervasive corruption which, according to the documentary evidence, do not directly affect the adequacy of state protection on the question of blood feud and revenge (in the absence of other aggravating factors such as the presence of organized crime).\n[59] While there is no guarantee that the claimant may one day cross paths with a corrupt official in Albania, I assess the risk to the claimant of not receiving adequate state protection due to corruption to be speculative, close to the mere possibility.\n[60] I find that the claimant in this case has failed to demonstrate the inadequacy of state protection at the operational level in his specific personal circumstances with clear and convincing evidence. I find that if the claimant were to return to Albania and approach the police and state authorities that he will receive the adequate protection that he needs to live normally and not in confinement. Accordingly, I find that the claimant does not face a serious risk of persecution upon return to Albania.\nCONCLUSION\n[61] After considering the evidence and counsel submissions and based on the above analysis, the panel finds the claimant is not a Convention refugee or person in need of protection due to his failure to rebut the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence.\n[62] Accordingly, I find that the claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution in Albania or, on a balance of probabilities, that he would be subjected personally to a risk to his life, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture. His claims is therefore rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Yonatan Rozenszajn\"\nYonatan Rozenszajn\nDecember 20, 2017\nDate\n1 XXXX v.

She claims to be a Convention refugee and a person in need of protection.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] For the following reasons the Panel determines that the Claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. The determinative issue is credibility.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] This claim was referred at Toronto Pearson Airport on October 7, 2015. The Claimant filed a Basis of Claim Form (BOC)1 containing the following allegations. On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2002 a bomb exploded on a bus in Haifa, killing 10 and injuring 30, most of whom were Israeli soldiers. The Claimant was detained and questioned for one day on XXXX XXXX, 2002. The owner of XXXX XXXX at which she worked was sentenced to prison for bringing the bomber to Israel. The bomber, who was with \"XXXX XXXX\" which is a part of Hamas, was then caught in XXXX 2002. The Claimant had to report to the police on a weekly basis and was arrested whenever there was a bombing. The Claimant met XXXX XXXX who works for national security and he enlisted her XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. At this point, she had been reporting to the police for XXXX years. The Claimant made friends with people who were connected to XXXX and gathered intelligence which she turned over to XXXX XXXX. She then started XXXX XXXX XXXX in their homes. On XXXX XXXX, 2014 the Claimant was caught XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX by the wife of one of these men, though it was not immediately obvious what the XXXX was. This woman and her husband came to the Claimant's home later that evening and confronted her. They soon found out what the XXXX was and realized that the Claimant had been working for the Israeli government. The next day other people found XXXX XXXX that the Claimant had XXXX and came to her home. The Claimant went to Tel Aviv for safety and stayed there for XXXX year. She decided to come to Canada in October 2015 and on arrival attempted to enter as a visitor. When she was refused entry, she made a refugee claim.\nIDENTITY\n[4] Based on her passport, the Panel is satisfied that the Claimant is who she says she is and that she is a national of Israel.\nANALYSIS\n[5] The hearing was scheduled for November 20, 2015 but was postponed because security screening had not been received. It was then scheduled for December 20, 2016. On December 16, 2016 the Refugee Protection Division received a notice that the Claimant had retained Nicholas Owodunni as counsel. The hearing commenced and the Claimant was accompanied by her husband who is a permanent resident of Canada. Counsel appeared at the hearing and requested a postponement. The Panel gathered more information and then denied this application and gave oral reasons. The overriding factor was that the Claimant had not been diligent in retaining counsel. The Panel offered counsel 30 minutes to speak with the Claimant and prepare. After 30 minutes he asked again for a postponement and the Panel again denied the request with oral reasons. The Panel informed the Claimant that the hearing would proceed with or without counsel and she was allowed more time to speak with counsel. Counsel then informed the Panel that he would have to withdraw as he was not prepared to proceed. He left the room.\n[6] The Panel informed the Claimant and her husband about the hearing process and told them that they would be given time to make written submissions if they wish, but that the hearing will proceed. The Claimant then informed the Panel that she did not believe that she was in a position to answer questions. The Panel informed her that she is required to answer questions if she wishes to proceed with her claim. She was given time to discuss the matter with her husband in private. The Claimant then said that she would answer questions. The Panel gave her a standard set of instructions, including that she may take her time while giving evidence, and that she may ask for clarification if she does not understand anything that is said.\n[7] The Panel has applied the presumption that the Claimant's sworn allegations are true. Nonetheless, the Panel finds that there are significant reasons to doubt the Claimant's credibility. The Claimant was questioned about her allegations and there were so many unexplained inconsistencies on central issues that the Panel has no confidence in her credibility.\n[8] The Claimant testified about working on the farm and the bombing in Israel. The Panel asked her if she knows what happened to the bomber. She testified that she does not know. The Panel asked her if she knows if he was killed in the explosion or caught by the authorities and she testified that she does not know. She testified that it was probably a suicide bombing. The Panel asked if she knows if he ever went to jail and she testified that she does not know. The Panel asked her where the bomb exploded and she testified that it was most likely in Tel Aviv. The Panel asked her if she knows whether it exploded in, for example, a building, a car, or an airplane. She testified that she does not know. The Panel asked her if she knows if anyone was killed. She testified that she heard there were casualties but she does not know how many were killed or wounded. The Panel asked her if she knows who was killed and she testified that they were Israelis. The Panel asked her if she knows anything more specific about who the people were, and she testified that she does not. The Panel asked the Claimant if the bomber was connected to any organizations and she testified that she does not know. The Claimant testified that the bombing occurred in April 2002. The Panel asked her when she first had contact with the authorities in relation to the bombing. She testified that it was in XXXX 2002 and she was detained overnight.\n[9] The testimony given by the Claimant as summarized in the preceding paragraph is shockingly inconsistent with what she wrote in her BOC. The Panel asked her if she remembers writing her BOC and she answered in the affirmative. The Panel asked her if she provided accurate information or if she made any mistakes. She testified that she provided accurate information. The Panel walked her through all of the inconsistencies. For several of the situations where she claimed not to know something, such as what happened to the bomber, the Panel informed her that she provided the information in her BOC. The Panel asked her to try to recall the issue and see if she can remember what she wrote. She could not do so for any of the examples the Panel gave. When the Panel asked her if she can explain any of the inconsistencies, she testified variously that she was beside herself or embarrassed, and that she was not well-composed at the hearing.\n[10] The Panel asked the Claimant if she had ongoing contact with the authorities after her arrest in XXXX 2002. She testified that she had to go to the police on a daily basis and sign in. The Panel asked her how long this lasted and she testified that she cannot remember. The Panel asked her if she can provide an estimate, like whether it lasted for weeks, months, or years, and she testified that she does not remember. The Panel asked her if she was ever arrested after that, and she testified that she was not. The Panel asked her why she wrote in her BOC that she reported weekly and not daily. She testified that she did not mention it in the BOC but that it started off as daily reporting. The Panel asked her why she wrote in her BOC that she was arrested every time there was a bombing. She testified that it was not an arrest, but questioning.\n[11] The Panel asked her when she met the man from the security services and she testified that she does not remember. The Panel asked her if she can try to estimate and she testified that she cannot do so. The Panel asked her if there is a reason why and she testified that she cannot remember.\n[12] The Claimant was able to testify that she XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in someone's house. However, contrary to what she wrote in her BOC, she testified that she only did this once. As for an explanation, she testified that she is very scared.\n[13] The Panel asked her when she was found out by the people she was collecting information from. She testified that she cannot remember the date. The Panel asked her if she can try to estimate and she testified that she cannot do so. The Panel asked her to recall the event where she was found out. She testified that she went to Tel Aviv. The Panel asked her to describe what happened that made her aware that she had been found out. She testified that she was under surveillance. The Panel found that these responses were not addressing the question. The Panel informed the Claimant that she wrote about a specific event in her BOC where something happened and one of the XXXX people found out she had been working for the government. The Panel asked her if she can remember this event. She testified that she is not sure and cannot remember, but that she may have been suspected of XXXX something.\n[14] The Panel again informed the Claimant that her testimony was very inconsistent with what she wrote in her BOC. The Panel asked her if there is an explanation. She testified that she does not know.\n[15] The Panel informed the Claimant and her husband that the Claimant's credibility is the outstanding issue. The Panel explained that this is the issue of whether the Panel should believe the Claimant's allegations. The Panel informed them that they may give any other evidence. The Panel gave the Claimant 30 minutes in private with her husband. Asked again after the break, the Claimant testified that she can now remember the date she was arrested and went to Tel Aviv, testifying that it was XXXX XXXX, 2014. This is consistent with what she wrote in her BOC as the date she was found out by the wife of the XXXX member. The Panel asked her if she wishes to give more evidence and she testified that she is under a lot of pressure and does not believe she can talk without counsel. The Claimant's husband also informed the Panel that he had a plan to go to Israel at the end of XXXX 2017 for two weeks and collect evidence. The Panel reluctantly decided to allow the Claimant until February 20, 2017 to make written submissions on the issue of her credibility and to provide any new evidence. The Panel informed them that they may, if they wish, retain counsel to assist with the preparation of submissions, and that counsel may ask for a recording of the hearing to do so.\n[16] On February 21, 2017 the Panel received submissions from Mr. Owodunni.2 The submissions are confusing in many areas, for example they are titled \"SUBMISSION FOR A NO-HEARING REFUGEE CLAIM.\" Counsel lists the issues as:\n1. Credibility\n2. IFA in Miland [sic], Rome and Sicily\n3. State Protection in Italy\n[17] Under the \"Credibility\" heading, counsel discusses the well-foundedness of the Claimant's fear as though she has already been found credible. Under the \"Subjective Fear\" heading counsel alludes to accepted themes of the jurisprudence such as the presumption of truth, and then asks that the Claimant be given the benefit of the doubt. He does not address any of the issues that arose in the hearing. Mr. Owodunni's submissions end curiously with this:\nNOTE: This submission is based purely on the narrative of the claimant in her Basis of Claim Form. There was no hearing where the claimant would have been able to address any areas in her claim the panel member would have wanted clarifications.\n[18] Counsel also attached three declarations to his submissions.3 However, no reference was made to them in the submissions and the Panel is left to discern how they apply to the Claimant's case.\n[19] The Panel does not accept the Claimant's explanations for the inconsistencies in her evidence. The Panel acknowledges that the hearing would have been stressful for the Claimant and that this can impact a person's memory. Nobody's memory is perfect and a refugee hearing is not a memory test. However, when a claimant is unable to offer a minimal degree of consistency in their account of straightforward events, it is trite that this can lead to a finding that the claimant is not credible. In the Panel's view, the inconsistencies in the Claimant's evidence are so numerous and so significant that the Panel can only conclude that she is not credible. Despite careful questioning in a calm manner by the Panel, and several opportunities to tell her story, the Claimant was unable to recite most of the basic elements of her allegations. The Panel notes that no medical evidence of any memory impairment was provided by the Claimant. Other than her testimony, the only other evidence provided by the Claimant is the declarations attached to counsel's submissions. The first two are difficult to follow and contain incomplete sentences and confusing language. They are vague and do nothing to rehabilitate the astonishing lack of consistency in the Claimant's evidence. The Panel does not find these declarations to be credible evidence of the Claimant's allegations. The third declaration appears completely unrelated to the claim, and seems to relate to the Claimant's husband's income taxes.\n[20] For the reasons that follow, the Panel finds, pursuant to subsection 107(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (\"the Act\"),4 that this claim has no credible basis. This provision reads as follows:\n107(2) If the Refugee Protection Division is of the opinion, in rejecting a claim, that there was no credible or trustworthy evidence on which it could have made a favourable decision, it shall state in its reasons for the decision that there is no credible basis for the claim.\n[21] The seminal case governing this issue is the 2002 Federal Court of Appeal decision in Rahaman5 where the Court ruled as follows:\n[28] Moreover, the wording of subsection 69.1(9.1) provides that a \"no credible basis\" finding may only be made if there was no credible or trustworthy evidence on which the Board member could have upheld the claim. In other words, the Board member may not make a \"no credible basis\" finding if there is credible or trustworthy evidence before it that is capable of enabling the Board to uphold the claim, even if, taking the evidence as a whole, the Board decides that the claim is not established.\n[29] However, as MacGuigan J.A. acknowledged in Sheikh, supra, in fact the claimant's oral testimony will often be the only evidence linking the claimant to the alleged persecution and, in such cases, if the claimant is not found to be credible, there will be no credible or trustworthy evidence to support the claim. Because they are not claimant-specific, country reports alone are normally not a sufficient basis on which the Board can uphold a claim.\n[30] On the other hand, the existence of some credible or trustworthy evidence will not preclude a \"no credible basis\" finding if that evidence is insufficient in law to sustain a positive determination of the claim. Indeed, in the case at bar, Teitelbaum J. upheld the \"no credible basis\" finding, even though he concluded that, contrary to the Board's finding, the claimant's testimony concerning the intermittent availability of police protection was credible in light of the documentary evidence. However, the claimant's evidence on this issue was not central to the Board's rejection of his claim.\n[22] In Iyombe,6 decided in 2016, Mr. Justice Martineau summarized the law thus:\n[15] Yet, the fact that the RPD finds that an applicant's testimony is not credible does not, de facto, lead to a finding that there is no credible basis for a claim (Foyet v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2000 CanLII 16312 (FC) at para 23 [Foyet]). There is a high threshold for finding that there is no credible basis for a claim (Ram\u00f3n Levario v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 314 at para 18). The RPD may not make a \"no credible basis\" finding in cases where there is independent and credible documentary evidence (Foyet at para 19). However, as the Federal Court of Appeal specified in Rahaman v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 FCA 89 at para 19, \"in order to preclude a \"no credible basis\" finding, the \"independent and credible documentary evidence\" to which Denault J. [in Foyet] refers must have been capable of supporting a positive determination of the refugee claim.\"\n[23] In Ebika,7 Mr. Justice Phelan recently ruled as follows:\n[11] A finding of \"no credible basis\" is a severe finding with significant consequences (loss of right to appeal to the Refugee Appeal Division). It is more than a credibility finding (Pournaminivas v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 1099 (CanLII)). Therefore, to make such a finding, the RPD must examine and reject a piece of relevant evidence so that there is no credible evidence which could support a claim. [Emphasis in original]\n[24] In view of this jurisprudence, the Panel must determine if there is any evidence in the record that is credible or trustworthy, and that could lead to a positive decision. This is a low threshold, but the Panel nonetheless finds that the Claimant has failed to meet it. Her oral evidence is not credible because of her failure to offer a basic level of consistency as described above. The three declarations she provided are not credible or trustworthy evidence of anything, given their vagueness and their confusing nature, to say nothing of the complete irrelevance of the third declaration. In sum, there is no evidence before the Panel that is credible or trustworthy and that could ground a refugee claim.\nCONCLUSION\n[25] The claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. This claim has no credible basis pursuant to subsection 107(2) of the Act.\n[26] The claim is rejected.\n(signed)\n\"K. Boothroyd\"\nK.

The following is a summary.\n[5] The claimant is a XXXX-year-old man who resided in the Takestan area where he resided with his father and step-mother before moving to Tehran in 2013. He states that following his mother's suicide in 1998, his father's second marriage was to a woman who mistreated him when he was a child. The claimant felt alone and misunderstood until he met XXXX, a fellow student, in 2009. The two began an intimate relationship. As they spent a lot of time together, the students and school administrators suspected them to be gay, and their parents were notified by the school. The claimant was badly beaten by his father and insulted with homophobic slurs by his step-mother, and eventually kicked out of the family home in 2012. With the help of his maternal uncle, the claimant started an XXXX XXXX that often required him to travel to Tehran, where he met XXXX, a gay man who introduced the claimant to other gay men in the city.\n[6] The claimant had several short-term casual relationships before meeting XXXX in 2015, and the two became a couple and started making plans to leave Iran together. However, as the claimant had not yet completed compulsory military service, he knew that he would most likely not be able to obtain a passport without an exemption. XXXX contacted an agent who said that he would be able to get them European tourist visas, and instructed the claimant to get identity documents from someone in whose name a passport could be issued. When the claimant approached his uncle as the only person he trusted and told him why he wanted to leave Iran, his uncle agreed to let him use his documents and keep things secret.\n[7] The claimant and XXXX travelled to Armenia in XXXX 2016, and applied for visas to Germany the following month. The claimant traveled to Germany on his own in XXXX 2016, because XXXX application was refused. After the claimant returned from Germany to Iran, the agent said that he could get Canadian visas for them, and he and XXXX travelled to Ankara, Turkey to file their applications, including being fingerprinted, in XXXX 2016.\n[8] The claimant left Iran for Canada on November 16, 2016 alone, as XXXX application had not yet been finalized. They remained in contact until the following XXXX or XXXX, when XXXX informed the claimant that he had resumed a relationship with an ex-boyfriend and was no longer planning to join the claimant in Canada. Shortly after getting this news, the claimant received a call from Iran that his uncle had been arrested and interrogated about his passport being used by the claimant to exit Iran. In a subsequent call, the claimant found out that XXXX had been arrested, and their relationship discovered, by the authorities, and that the claimant's father has now vowed to hand the claimant over to the police, calling on others to do the same or to kill his son if found.\n[9] The claimant made his claim for Canada's protection inland on July 19, 2017 in Toronto.\n[10] The claimant alleges persecution in Iran on the basis of membership in a particular social group as a gay man.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[11] The claimant's identity as a national of Iran has been established by his testimony and by the supporting documentation filed in the form of his national identity card,3 the original of which was seized by IRCC (formerly CIC) officials. The claimant also submitted copies, not originals, of the following: a birth certificate; a driver's license; and his mother's death certificate.4\n[12] An original, valid Iranian passport, issued in the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX (DOB: XXXX XXXX 1979), and which contains a Canadian B-1 visa counterfoil, was also seized at referral and stamped as \"suspected fraudulent.\"5\n[13] The panel will address the passport as part of its credibility assessment of the evidence as presented by the claimant.\nCredibility\n[14] The determination as to whether a claimant's evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities. While statements given under oath are presumed to be true, that presumption can be rebutted by contradictions or inconsistencies in the evidence.6 The onus is on the person making a refugee claim to present evidence that is credible on a balance of probabilities to support the allegations which form the basis of the claim. In this case the panel finds that the claimant has not met that onus.\n[15] The panel took into consideration The Chairperson's Guideline 9: Proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada Involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Expression (SOGIE)7 when approaching the process of the hearing and the facts in this case. All relevant factors, such as social and cultural context in which the claimant found himself, along with the issue of state protection and country conditions, were examined with consideration of the Chairperson's SOGIE Guideline. The panel also took into consideration factors that may affect oral testimony, such as the milieu of the hearing room, use of an interpreter, and the claimant's anxiety, age, cultural differences, and level of education.8\n[16] In assessing the claimant's credibility, the panel considered the decision in Orelien9 ruling that it is necessary for the claimant to establish that his evidence is probably credible or trustworthy, not just possibly so. The existence of contradictions and discrepancies in the evidence of a claimant is a well-accepted basis for a finding of a lack of credibility. A general finding of lack of credibility may extend to all relevant evidence emanating from a claimant's testimony.10\nClaimant's testimony\n[17] The determinative issue was whether the claimant was able to establish with credible and reliable evidence his sexual identity as a gay man, on a balance of probabilities.\n[18] The panel is faced with a difficult task in assessing whether an individual is a gay person or not because of the intrinsic factors relevant to such an assessment. Credibility is, of course, central to making such a determination. Therefore, it is helpful to consider the matter through the lens of the claimant's general credibility.\n[19] The claimant testified in a manner that was evasive, contradictory, and lacking in credible or reasonable explanations for the concerns identified by the panel at the hearing. After informing the claimant that the panel had to be satisfied that the claimant's personal and national identity had been sufficiently established on a balance of probabilities, the panel asked to see the original documents disclosed on file. The claimant testified that he left his driver's license at home and would provide it if necessary. As the driver's license, while issued in Iran in \"2102-XXXX XXXX XXXX11 [sic],\" does not establish the claimant's country of citizenship, the panel did not adjourn the proceedings in order examine the original document.\n[20] The panel asked to see the original of the claimant's birth certificate, as the document seized by the referring IRCC officer is stamped as a \"copy of a Copy\"12 only. The claimant testified that the original birth certificate was indeed kept by the officer, along with the original national identity card. When the panel pointed out that the identity card was clearly stamped and initialled by the officer as a \"Certified True Copy,\"13 whereas the birth certificate was not, the claimant stated once more that the officer kept the original as well.\n[21] The panel rejects this explanation for not having the original birth certificate available for the panel's inspection at the hearing. While the panel accepts, on a balance pf probabilities, that the claimant is the person he presented himself to be at the hearing and is a national of Iran, the panel draws a negative inference regarding the claimant's overall credibility as a result of his statements regarding the seizure of his original birth certificate by the referring officer.\n[22] The claimant's testimony regarding his ability to obtain a passport using his uncle's identity documents contained statements that were inconsistent both internally and with the documentary evidence before the panel. The claimant testified that he took his uncle's \"identity documents,\" as well as his military service completion card, and his grandparents' birth certificates.\n[23] When asked by the panel whose photograph was affixed in the passport, the claimant responded that it was \"a mixture of my and my uncle's photo but it looks more like me.\" He stated that he did not know how the agent who helped him obtain the passport and all the travel visas in it obtained this composite photograph. He further testified that the photograph in the Schengen visa which he used to travel to Germany in XXXX 2016 was \"also a mixture,\" but that the photograph submitted with the TRV application14 in Ankara was his own.\nRe-availment\n[24] In his submissions, counsel suggested that the claimant's appearance did not display the rather significant age difference one might expect from a XXXX-year-old person using the documents of a XXXX-year-old, as is the case here. The panel notes that the age difference is not a key concern when it comes to assessing the credibility of the claimant's testimony about using his uncle's documents to exit Iran and travel to Canada; rather, it is the claimant's actions while in possession of fraudulent documents presumably obtained, with significant risk to himself and his uncle, precisely to seek safety abroad. The claimant testified that he gave his uncle's documents to the agent who applied for the passport and visas on his behalf, but that the claimant was fingerprinted on at least three separate occasions: once at the passport office; once when applying for the visa to Germany; and once again in Ankara when applying for the Canadian TRV. The claimant testified that he and his uncle had a prearranged agreement: if the claimant were discovered by the authorities with the documents in his possession, he would say he stole them; otherwise, the uncle would report them as stolen once the claimant was safely out of Iran.\n[25] The panel pointed out that the claimant had travelled on the fraudulently obtained passport on four occasions over a period of eleven months, re-availing to Iran every time except for the last: in XXXX 2016 to Armenia; XXXX to Germany; XXXX to Turkey; and finally in November 2016 to Canada. Furthermore, according to the claimant's testimony, his uncle never reported his documents stolen until some time in 2017, only to be detained and interrogated about the fraudulently obtained passport a short time after that.\n[26] The panel asked the claimant why, having been safely out of Iran, the country he was intent on leaving for fear of persecution based on his sexual orientation, he repeatedly returned back, risking being discovered with a fraudulent passport by border officials each time. The claimant responded that the plan was for both him and XXXX to seek asylum together in Germany, but XXXX visa application was refused. The panel rejects this explanation as unreasonable. The claimant repeatedly entered into a situation where he risked being discovered during examination by customs officers when re-entering Iran on a fraudulent passport issued to a person 15 years his senior and containing a composite photograph.\n[27] As per Saez,15 wherein the Court found that \"someone who was truly fearful would claim refugee status at the first opportunity,\"16 the panel determines that the claimant displayed a lack of subjective fear by failing to claim asylum in Germany when able to do so in XXXX 2016.\n[28] Furthermore, the panel rejects the claimant's explanation for repeatedly re-availing with a fraudulent passport obtained with his uncle's identity documents by stating that to date, his uncle had no need for any of his identity documents except for his driver's license. The claimant testified that his uncle had an XXXX XXXX degree, and was responsible for \"looking after XXXX and the employees.\" The panel notes that the claimant's statements are inconsistent with documentary evidence17 which states that \"Iranian nationals must have a national ID card and a birth certificate,\" and must present the following documents in order to obtain a replacement:\nIf the ID Card which is going to be replaced has no photo, it is mandatory to present original and copy of valid documents affixed with photo such as (passport, military service completion or exemption card, driving [license]... or identity card affixed with photo for the employees of government departments while mentioning civil particulars). Meanwhile, the original document shall be returned after conformity of the original and copy of the above mentioned valid documents.\n- Civilian employees or businessmen (holding business [license]) may verify the holder's identification through endorsement of the photos.18\n[29] The claimant's uncle, according to the claimant, held a position of significant responsibility as a XXXX XXXX or an official of some capacity. He testified that after his uncle gave him his identity card, birth certificate, and military service completion card, the claimant obtained a passport in XXXX 2016. The panel finds that the claimant's allegations that his uncle has been able to go about his personal and business life in Iran for the past two years by using a driver's license on the only official documentation of his identity is inconsistent with the documentary evidence. The panel draws an adverse inference with respect to the overall credibility of the claimant as a witness as a result.\nDelay in claiming in Canada\n[30] The claimant arrived in Canada on November 16, 2016 with temporary status19 as a B-1 visitor, completed his Basis of Claim on July 11, 2017, and his claim was referred to the Board on July 19, 2017. In Huerta,20 the Federal Court stated that, \"The delay in making a claim to refugee status is not a decisive factor in itself. It is, however, a relevant element which the tribunal may take into account in assessing both the statements and the actions and deeds of a claimant.\" As he testified that his goal from the start was to travel to Canada in order to seek protection as a gay man, the panel questioned the claimant about the substantial delay in filing his claim.\n[31] The claimant testified that he expected his partner XXXX to join him in Canada once the visa post in Ankara received all of the required documents from him. He communicated with XXXX through an IMO, or instant messenger application, until XXXX stopped responding to his calls and finally told him in XXXX2017 that the relationship was over.\n[32] The claimant alleged that he was unable to live freely and openly as a gay man in Iran, that he had been assaulted by his father on the basis of his sexuality in Iran, and that the authorities would not protect him. As such it is reasonable for the panel to expect him to seek protection outside of Iran at the first opportunity when he arrived in Canada, the place where he had planned to travel to so that he could live freely and openly without fear of harm or persecution as a gay man. The panel does not find the claimant's explanation for the eight-month delay in Canada to be credible, given his testimony and statements in his BOC narrative that he travelled to Canada from Iran specifically in order to claim refugee protection here.\n[33] As such, the panel draws a negative inference as to the claimant's subjective fear and the credibility of his allegations from the delay in claiming in Canada.\n[34] Furthermore, as the claimant's temporary visitor status in Canada expired on XXXX XXXX, 2017, or six months from his original entry, his delay in seeking protection until his temporary status was no longer valid made him vulnerable to possible deportation to Iran if discovered to be without legal status by Canadian immigration officials. As such, the claimant demonstrated a lack of subjective fear. The panel therefore rejects the claimant's explanation for the delay as inconsistent and unreasonable and draws a negative credibility inference.\nClaimant's SOGIE profile\n[35] When questioned about his own understanding and realization of his sexual identity, the claimant described his sexual attraction at XXXX years of age to XXXX, a neighbour around the same age, and being severely beaten by his father when their relationship was discovered. The claimant's testimony was not consistent with the allegations as found in the BOC narrative in several instances, most notably when the claimant testified, in response to a direct question from the panel, that he had never resided in Tehran, nor ever moved there. This statement is in contradiction to the BOC narrative,21 where, under an underlined heading in bold, \"I Move to Tehran and Start a Long-term Relationship with a Man,\" he writes that he moved to Tehran \"around XXXX or XXXX 2013.\"22\n[36] Another material inconsistency between the claimant's testimony and the BOC narrative arose when the claimant stated that same-sex relationships are taboo in Iranian society, and that \"homophobic slurs are used against anyone, even those not necessarily suspected as gay... I was never called such slurs because I was never in such an altercation.\" This statement was again a direct response to the question whether the claimant himself was called insulting names, and is also contradicted in the BOC narrative, where the claimant writes that XXXX and he were called homophobic slurs by students at school,23 and that his step-mother would call him such names at home24 as well.\n[37] During testimony, not every contradiction was put to the claimant, as the panel was guided by Ngongo,25 wherein the Federal Court-Trial Division identified the following factors in assessing whether the contradictions in the testimony should have been put to the claimant:\n* was the contradiction obvious? (if yes, then no)\n* was it in answer to a direct question by the Division? (if yes, then no)\n* was it an actual contradiction or just a slip? (if the latter, then yes)\n* was the claimant represented by counsel? (if yes, then no)26\n[38] The panel finds that the claimant's testimony was inconsistent with the other documents submitted by the claimant with regard to material facts that went to the heart of the claim: the claimant failed to establish, with consistent and reliable evidence, that he had a relationship with XXXX that was discovered by the school administrators after it was first suspected by fellow students; he also failed to establish that, on a balance of probabilities, he met XXXX, a gay man who resided in Tehran and who introduced the claimant to other gay men in Tehran; furthermore, the claimant failed to establish, with consistent and reliable evidence, that he met XXXX, his long-term partner, after he moved to Tehran in 2013.\n[39] The panel appreciates the fact that corroborating evidence from family or friends may not be available in cases involving SOGIE,27 and a person's testimony may be the only evidence of their SOGIE identity.28 However, the panel has not in this case been presented with reliable, consistent, and credible testimony by the claimant on aspects both directly related to his sexual identity as a gay man and on those not specifically linked to it either.\nSupporting documentation\n[40] The claimant testified that he is being sought by the Sepah in Iran as a result of his relationship with XXXX, that XXXX has been arrested, and that his own father has threatened to turn him in to the authorities and called on others to kill the claimant. He testified that he had been in a long-term relationship with XXXX from XXXX 2015 to XXXX 2017.\n[41] The claimant was asked whether he had any other evidence to corroborate his and XXXX relationship, such as letters, texts, or photographs. He stated that he never received any texts or letters from him, because they only spoke face-to-face on the instant messaging application. When asked by counsel whether he would be able to access a log of these messages, or whether there was a log on his phone, the claimant responded that he had \"nothing saved.\" The panel rejects this explanation as insufficient in addressing the lack of documentary evidence of the claimant's two-year relationship with XXXX, a person whom he presented as a central figure in his life without whom his life had \"no meaning.\"\n[42] The claimant submitted a letter from his uncle, \"XXXX XXXX XXXX,\"29 as corroborating documentation regarding his sexuality being discovered by the authorities as a result of XXXX arrest. This letter is not a sworn statement or affidavit. It appears to be a hand-written note addressed to the claimant's counsel in name only, and contains no means to identify the author by address, telephone, ID number, or the means by which the note was transmitted or delivered to the recipient and from where.\n[43] The panel was not able to question the author of the note or in any way establish the writer's identity to be that of the claimant's uncle. The panel can therefore ascribe no evidentiary weight on the note as corroborating the allegations of the claimant's sexual identity as a gay man and as a person who is wanted by the authorities in Iran as a result of this profile.\nActivities in Canada\n[44] In support of the allegations regarding his activities in Canada, the claimant submitted the following documents: an attendance sheet30 from the LGBT Refugee Programs at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX; a confirmation of attendance at the orientation31 session at the centre; a photograph32 of the claimant taken at XXXX XXXX; and three photographs of the claimant at what appears to be the Pride Parade33 in Toronto.\n[45] The claimant testified that he joined XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on the advice of his former counsel who took him there and took photographs of him there. He stated that he did not understand English very well but could see that the sessions he attended were about credit, and police in Canada, and celebrations. The panel notes from the attendance sheet that the claimant attended XXXX XXXX on four occasions only, starting on XXXX XXXX, 2017.34\n[46] The panel accepts that the claimant briefly attended workshops organized by the centre as alleged; however, attendance at community events does not necessarily establish a person's identity as a member of that particular community. The panel therefore assigns the documents from XXXX XXXX little weight in establishing the claimant's sexual identity, as they are evidence of his participation in LGBTQ programs only.\n[47] The panel had concerns with the claimant's evidence on issues going to the heart of his claim, including his profile as a gay man and his sexual orientation being discovered by the authorities in Iran. The cumulative negative inferences with regard to the claimant's credibility lead the panel to find that the claimant was not a credible witness overall and that his allegations of persecution in Iran are not credible. For the foregoing reasons the panel finds that the claimant's documents are insufficient to establish his allegations, on a balance of probabilities.\n[48] The panel finds that based on all of the above credibility concerns and inconsistencies, the claimant has failed to establish the central aspects of his claim: that he had a long-term relationship with XXXX, that this relationship was discovered by Iranian authorities when they arrested XXXX, and that the claimant is now wanted by the authorities in Iran as a result.\n[49] In coming to this determination, the panel bears in mind the words of the Federal Court of Appeal, in Sheikh,35 that \"a general finding of a lack of credibility on the part of the applicant may conceivably extend to all relevant information emanating from his testimony.\" The panel finds that the claimant's oral testimony was as a whole neither trustworthy nor credible. The panel finds that the claimant's lack of credibility as a witness combined with a lack of persuasive documentation to support his claim to be fatal to his claim.\n[50] The panel concludes that the claimant has not provided sufficient credible and reliable evidence to establish, on a balance of probabilities, his sexual identity as a gay man, or that he would be perceived as such by the Iranian authorities. Accordingly, the panel finds that the claimant is not wanted by the authorities as alleged and thus he faces no prospective danger of arrest in Iran on the basis of his sexual orientation.\nCONCLUSION\n[51] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel determines that there is not a serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted if he were to return to Iran, or that, on a balance of probabilities, he would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment upon return to Iran.\n[52] The panel therefore finds that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee under section 96 nor a person in need of protection under subsection 97(1) of IRPA, and rejects the claim.\n[53] The panel also finds that pursuant to subsection 107(2) of IRPA, the claimant provided no credible or trustworthy evidence on which a favourable decision could be made, and therefore there is no credible basis for the claim.\n(signed)\n\"M.

The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board, pursuant to its powers under Rule 69, disposed of this application without a hearing. The applicants did not provide a copy of any notice of pending appeal or any pending application for leave to apply for judicial review or any pending application for judicial review, as required by Rule 62(5) and, therefore, this decision is made without any consideration of the other remedies contemplated in Rule 62(9).\nTHE ISSUE\n[3] The RPD has no jurisdiction to re-open a hearing of a Convention refugee claim except in circumstances where a breach of natural justice has occurred.2 The only issue to be determined in this application is whether there was a failure to observe a principle of natural justice in declaring the applicant's3 claim to have been abandoned.\nBACKGROUND\n[4] The following is a chronology of events pertaining to this application.\n[5] The applicant made a refugee claim at the Blackpool\/Lacolle inland office of the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), which was referred to the RPD on January 29, 2017. The referral documents provided to the applicant, then the claimant, included a Notice to Appear, set for March 24, 2017.\n[6] The claimant received his Basis of Claim Form (BoC) kit at the time of referral, including a copy of the Notice of Referral and the date when the BoCs would be due, fifteen (15) days after the referral, or February 13, 2017.4 The Division received the claimant's BoC on time.\n[7] The applicant also received a Notice to Appear for his hearing, setting out the date of the hearing as March 24, 2017 at 12:30 (24 hr clock), and cited that the claimant must be present and ready to proceed at the start time set out in the notice. The notice also provided another date, if the claimant failed to appear on the date indicated, for a special hearing to explain any failure to attend the hearing, set for March 31, 2017, or otherwise the claim may be declared abandoned (the \"Special Hearing\").\n[8] On the morning of March 24, 2017, the RPD received a fax letter signed XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who identified himself as \"an interpreter for XXXX XXXX XXXX\".5 He had advised a Case Management Officer that the claimant had been admitted to the psychiatric department of Sunnybrook Hospital as of March 21, 2017, and was still there. The letter faxed to the RPD repeated the information provided, and also indicated that the author of the letter had tried to obtain information of his status but the hospital would not provide it to Mr. XXXX XXXX He further wrote, \"Since Mr. XXXX had no lawyer no way to update his situation.\" [Sic.] He concluded by writing, \"I hope you find my explanations are satisfactory and do not declare this case to be abandoned.\"6\n[9] No one appeared before the Division on March 24, 2017, at the time set for the hearing.\n[10] The presiding member noted that Mr. XXXX is not a lawyer licenced by a Canadian Law Society and is not an authorized counsel recognized by the ICCRC, and therefore he has no standing before the division. On that basis, and without a medical certificate as contemplated by rule 54(6), the presiding member indicated that the special hearing date provided in the Notice to Appear would be activated.\n[11] The claimant did not appear on the date set for the Special Hearing of March 31, 2017 at 9:00 in the forenoon.7 The presiding co-ordinating member waited until the following Monday, or April 3, 2017, before declaring the claim abandoned and entering that disposition in the NOVA computer system. I also note that the records of the Duty Desk personnel, who greet claimants and others who come to the Board, indicate that no one appeared on March 31, 2017.8\n[12] On May 18, 2017, the Division received a package of documents from, James Gildiner (Claimant's Counsel) by hand (dated May 18, 2017) including an Application to Re-open, the Affidavit of XXXX XXXX XXXX (the applicant),9 a copy of the Sunnybrook Health Sciences discharge summary,10 and a copy of the hospital Psychiatry Progress Notes, covering each of the days the claimant was in hospital.11\n[13] On June 23, 2017, the claimant's counsel provided further affidavits from \"interpreters who assisted Mr. XXXX when he had a mental health crisis\", namely XXXX XXXX12 and XXXX XXXX, 13 plus a letter from the applicant's family physician.14\nDECISION\n[14] I determine that the applicant has not established that there has been a failure to observe a principle of natural justice by the presiding member at the Special Hearing for his failure to attend the date set for his hearing.\n[15] The application to re-open the claim is dismissed.\nANALYSIS\n[16] I have reviewed the record, including the materials submitted by counsel on behalf of the claimant in this application, as well as the claimant's affidavit, and the written submissions of counsel, including the exhibits sent in by him. I have also reviewed the RPD record of appearances on the special hearing date.15\n[17] I have considered the application pursuant to Rule 62 of the RPD. This Rule provides that the applicant, in order for his claim to be re-opened, would have to establish that there has been a denial of natural justice.16 For convenience, I have set out the rule, and the factors for me to consider, below:\nApplication to reopen claim\n62 (1) At any time before the Refugee Appeal Division or the Federal Court has made a final determination in respect of a claim for refugee protection that has been decided or declared abandoned, the claimant or the Minister may make an application to the Division to reopen the claim. ...\nFactor\n(6) The Division must not allow the application unless it is established that there was a failure to observe a principle of natural justice.\nFactors\n(7) In deciding the application, the Division must consider any relevant factors, including\n(a) whether the application was made in a timely manner and the justification for any delay; and\n(b) the reasons why\n(i) a party who had the right of appeal to the Refugee Appeal Division did not appeal, or\n(ii) a party did not make an application for leave to apply for judicial review or an application for judicial review.\n[18] The onus is on the applicant to establish on a balance of probabilities there was a denial of a principle of natural justice.17 The applicant has not done so.\n[14] The RPD's power to reopen a refugee claim is very limited. The Rules are highly prescriptive. Rule 62(6) states the RPD \"must not allow the application unless it is established that there was a failure to observe a principle of natural justice\" [emphasis added]. This rule updated the Rule 55(4) found in the previous version of the Refugee Protection Division Rules, (SOR\/2002-228), which was broader in scope and read that the RPD \"must allow the application if it is established that there was a failure to observe a principal of natural justice\" [emphasis added].18\n[19] The role of the Division hearing an application to re-open does not include a fact-finding mission on behalf of the applicant, and the Division is not to second-guess the assessment of the situation of the original member who presided at the Special Hearing. However, in this case, no assessment of the situation is required as no one appeared for the claimant, including the claimant, and no evidence, other than the failure to attend, was required of the Special Hearing member.\n[20] The decision to abandon a claim may be said to prevent a claimant from a full hearing where the case is decided on its merits, but such a decision, in and of itself, does not constitute a failure to observe the principles of natural justice. Here, the claimant had \"retained\" an interpreter, who assisted him in admitting the claimant to the hospital for a psychiatric assessment, and who assisted the claimant by writing to the Board on the date of the original hearing of March 24, 2017, indicating the reason why the claimant would not attend that hearing and that he \"hoped\" that the claim would not be declared abandoned.19 The interpreter assisting the claimant is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is not a person accredited with the Board as an interpreter, is not a member of any bar or law society of any province of Canada, and is not a licenced immigration consultant.20\n[21] The materials provided by counsel suggest that, although the claimant was no longer in the hospital at the time of the Special Hearing of March 31, 2017, he may have been taking medication, and he had not yet retained a lawyer or a licenced consultant.\n[22] Counsel for the claimant submits that the claimant has a right to be heard and that a procedural error on his part ought not to be reason alone to declare the claim abandoned. He further submitted that the claimant has always wanted to pursue his claim.\n[23] In this case, the Board committed no error in declaring the claim abandoned when it did so on the information, or lack of it, that it had at the time.\n[24] Furthermore, none of the material adequately explains why the claimant, since he had been released by the psychiatric team that had monitored him, several days before the Special Hearing, failed to appear at the Special Hearing.\n[25] The claimant's counsel's submissions21 include \"suggestions\" that the claimant suffered from suicidal ideation, prior to coming to Canada, but has not provided any medical evidence that that is the case, and the claimant in his own affidavit22 does not suggest that he had wanted to commit suicide in Turkey, only that he was anxious and depressed.\n[26] Claimant's counsel submitted further that \"the claimant is currently on a course of PMS-Quetiapine, Citralopram and Kenalog\", but provides no medical evidence that this is the case. In contrast, the Discharge Summary states, \"No medications were prescribed\" upon discharge of the applicant.23 Claimant's counsel further submitted that \"he slept for several days during the time of his hearing and did not recall that he missed the hearing when he woke up in Sunnybrook after the period of acute distress\".24 I have not been able to locate anything in the Discharge Summary25 or the Psychiatry Progress Note to corroborate this \"suggestion\". In fact, two things stand out about the stay at the hospital: the claimant was uncooperative, but after a day or two cheered up, and engaged with the nursing staff, regained his appetite, and was found \"suitable for discharge at his request\".26 The note indicates that the psychiatrist spoke to the \"friend\/interpreter\" who brought the applicant to the hospital and she indicated that the claimant seemed to be back to himself and feels he no longer needs to be in hospital. The note-taker found the claimant to be a \"well-groomed male, cooperative,..., mood good, affect mildly dysphoric, but displays full range, ... insight and judgment reasonable.27\n[27] I find28 that counsel, in his submissions is, in essence, giving evidence, contrary to the Law Society's rules and an abundance of case law, 29 and I can give the submissions as to the applicant's mental condition after discharge from hospital little weight.\n[28] Contrary to the submission of counsel, the applicant did not retain counsel in a timely manner. The claimant came to Canada in late January and did not retain counsel until the end of April. Not only did the claimant fail to retain counsel in time for his scheduled hearing or for his Special Hearing, but he also failed to provide the application to reopen for more than six weeks after the RPD declared his claim abandoned.\n[29] Counsel Gildiner submitted that the claimant did not have a \"meaningful opportunity to explain why the claim should not be declared abandoned\".30 However, the claimant had an opportunity to explain why the claim should not be declared abandoned but failed to show up at the Special Hearing for that purpose. He also submitted that the RPD must also provide fair consideration to the claimant's allegations of persecution31 and that the RPD must establish fair and efficient procedures.32 However, counsel did not provide any evidence that the board has not established such procedures that \"will maintain the integrity of the Canadian refugee system while upholding Canada's respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all human beings\".\n[30] Claimant's counsel also submitted that the claimant is not an English Speaker and his language proficiency is also responsible for his being \"a few minutes late on the date of the abandonment hearing\". This is not borne out by the evidence. The claimant was not \"a few minutes late\"; he failed to appear at all on that day.\n[31] Prior to making a decision in this application, I went to the two areas where persons wishing to conduct business before the RPD are directed to go. The main reception area is on the fourth floor. I canvassed the supervisor of the reception (or \"duty desk\") and confirmed that a person with a hearing is directed by the personnel to their scheduled hearing room. In this case, the case was scheduled for a fifth floor hearing room, and the supervisor indicated that either he or any other receptionist, would have directed the claimant to the fifth floor duty desk, if he had appeared. The Special Hearing was scheduled to take place in hearing room 43, on the fifth floor. I consulted with the receptionists on the fifth floor and they provided me with a printout for the date in question, which shows the room, the hour of the hearing, the assigned member, the file number, the name of the person concerned, the name of the assigned interpreter, and so on. It also shows the \"reasons for delay\/adjournment\", which indicates \"no show\".33\n[32] I have taken into account the words of Mr. Justice Shore, who stated:\n[9] In my view, the jurisprudence cited by the Minister does not support the proposition advanced in paragraph 23 of counsel's memorandum of fact and law that, \"where it appears that an applicant has not come to the Court with clean hands, the Court must initially determine whether in fact the party has unclean hands, and if that is proven, the Court must refuse to hear or grant the application on its merits.\" Rather, the case law suggests that, if satisfied that an applicant has lied, or is otherwise guilty of misconduct, a reviewing court may dismiss the application without proceeding to determine the merits or, even though having found reviewable error, decline to grant relief.\n[10] In exercising its discretion, the Court should attempt to strike a balance between, on the one hand, maintaining the integrity of and preventing the abuse of judicial and administrative processes, and, on the other, the public interest in ensuring the lawful conduct of government and the protection of fundamental human rights. The factors to be taken into account in this exercise include: the seriousness of the applicant's misconduct and the extent to which it undermines the proceeding in question, the need to deter others from similar conduct, the nature of the alleged administrative unlawfulness and the apparent strength of the case, the importance of the individual rights affected and the likely impact upon the applicant if the administrative action impugned is allowed to stand.34\n[33] A person who makes an application before a court or tribunal must come with clean hands. I find, on account of the above submission, that the claimant does not have clean hands. For that reason alone, I am in a position to dismiss the application, but there is more.\n[34] Firstly, the only evidence before the presiding member at the special hearing was a letter from a person without any standing before the Board, indicating the RPD should contact this person on his cellular phone, but also indicating the claimant had no counsel. This does not explain the reason the claimant did not retain counsel in a timely fashion or why the claimant did not appear at the Special Hearing, when he was released from hospital prior to that hearing.\n[35] Secondly, the medical evidence35 does not provide any reason to excuse the claimant from failing to appear at the Special Hearing provided to allow him to show cause why his claim ought not to be declared abandoned.\n[36] Thirdly, the affidavits of the interpreters allegedly \"assisting\" the claimant do not provide any valid reason why the claimant failed to appear at the Special Hearing, only the reason he did not appear for his original hearing.36 These affidavits do not advance the application favourably.\n[37] Fourthly, the claimant, as applicant, not only failed to retain counsel in a timely manner for his regular hearing, he also failed to retain counsel on a timely basis for his Special Hearing, and in fact delayed for more than six weeks after receiving the decision that his claim had been declared abandoned before making an application to reopen his abandoned claim. This does not indicate the claimant or applicant showed the required due diligence.\n[38] For all the above reasons, I find that the applicant did not establish any failure to observe a principle of natural justice, whether by the Division or otherwise, nor, as required by rule 62(7)(a) did the claimant make his application to reopen in a timely manner.\nCONCLUSION\n[39] After reviewing the submissions of counsel, the material provided, decisions of the Courts with respect to reopening a claim and the principles of natural justice and fairness, and keeping in mind the factors set out in rule 62(6) and (7), this application is dismissed.\n(signed)\n\"James V.

He then received a phone call on XXXX XXXX, 2016, instructing him to present himself on XXXX XXXX, 2016 to the location he was stopped at on XXXX XXXX, 2016.\n[5] After the XXXX XXXX, 2016 incident the principal claimant made a denunciation and received a Protection Measure document. As a result the police provided surveillance and had the principal claimant sign a document every time they stopped by the principal claimant's home.\n[6] The principal claimant did not present himself as instructed on XXXX XXXX, 2016 and decided to quit his job the next day.\n[7] On XXXX XXXX, 2017, he received another call from the Gaitanistas saying that because he had not present himself on XXXX XXXX, 2016 the matter became more serious. After this call the principal claimant and his spouse moved to a rural place called XXXX.\n[8] On XXXX XXXX, 2017, the principal claimant decided to go to the Attorney General's office in XXXX and have the Protection Measure document transferred to XXXX which it was. Further, the principal claimant cancelled his cell phone and stayed indoors.\n[9] He received a call from the Association for Victims of Violence in Colombia \"XXXX XXXX XXXX\" to participate in a program in Cali on XXXX XXXX, 2017. At the event, he was accosted by two men from the Gaitanistas. He was told to meet them at a particular location in eight days with the information they were demanding, and also that he and his wife were now military targets. After this encounter, the principal claimant made a denunciation at the nearest police station, received a Protection Measure document and was escorted by police out of Cali. On March XXXX, 2017, his wife quit her job and on XXXX XXXX, 2017, they left Colombia.\nDETERMINATION\n[10] The panel finds that the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection for the reasons that follow.\nANALYSIS\n[11] The determinative issue in this claim is state protection.\nIdentity\n[12] The claimants' personal identities, as nationals of Colombia, are established by way of certified copies of their passports.3\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[13] The state is presumed to be able to protect the claimants. It rests on the claimant to rebut this presumption with clear and compelling evidence. This evidence can include general country documentation, as well as evidence which is specific to the claimants.\n[14] In the particular circumstances of this claim the principal claimant has approached authorities. They responded by opening an investigation and issuing a Protection Measure document. The local police would conduct surveillance and have the principal claimant sign a document that acknowledged that security rounds were conducted. He received a phone number to the police station, and he was to call if something strange happened. He was also encouraged to change his travel route as well as time of travel. The spouse was a medical doctor working at a health care facility associated with the XXXX. She spoke with a person at her work place who confirmed the steps being taken by the principal claimant were the necessary steps. After the phone call on XXXX XXXX, 2016, the claimant made another denunciation. Since the principal claimant already had protection nothing further could be done other than be told that the authorities would continue with the investigation. He was also encouraged again to change his hours, his route and to be less mobile.\n[15] In the particular circumstances of the claimants, the authorities responded quickly in providing protection.\n[16] The documentation4 indicates that implementation of citizen security policies is weak, but commitment by the National Police to improve human rights conditions is noted. Concern is noted about organized crime, but police have taken action by arresting a number of gang members. The conclusion, therefore, is that while the situation of effective state protection is mixed, and can be improved, it cannot be said that it does not exist at all in Colombia. The problems with state protection and Colombia are documented, but are not universal. Significant efforts have been made, and continue to be made to reform and improve the police and judicial sectors. These attempts are reflected in the principal claimant's attempts to obtain and receive a Protection Measure document. The result of this document was that the claimants were provided with surveillance and in the particular circumstances of the principal claimant personal escort from Cali.\n[17] No government can guarantee the protection of all of its citizens at all times. Where a state is in effective control of its territory, has military, police and civil authority in place and makes serious efforts to protect its citizens the mere fact that it is not always successful at doing so will not rebut the presumption of adequate state protection.\n[18] Given that the claimants received state protection, the panel finds that the claimants have not succeeded in rebutting the presumption of state protection. It is therefore unnecessary to go on to determine the question of credibility.\nCONCLUSION\n[19] The panel finds that in the specific circumstances of this particular situation the claimants have failed to rebut the presumption of state protection and as such have not satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground or that they would personally be subjected to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture if returned to Colombia.\n[20] The panel finds that the claimants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.\n[21] Therefore, the panel rejects these claims.\n(signed)\n\"Walter Kawun\"\nWalter Kawun\n\"June 27, 2017\"\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n2 Exhibit 2.\n3 Exhibit 1.\n4 Exhibit 4, National Documentation Package (NDP) for Colombia (31 May 2017), item 1.7.\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRPD.29.1 (August 31, 2012)\nRPD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SPR : TB7-07597\nTB7-07637\n",

After the Libyan crisis in 2011, Islamist militant groups demanded that the claimant make new car keys for the cars they had stolen from people. He refused. On April XXXX, 2012 an Islamist group, called \"Revolutionary Militia Coalition of Misrata,\"abducted him and detained him for three weeks, threatening and beating him. He was dumped on a street on April XXXX, and left to die, but some passerby saved him and brought him to his family, who took him to a hospital, then arranged for him to travel to Tunisia for medical treatment. He then came back home and stayed at home with his parents, returning to Tunisia four times for follow-up medical treatment or relaxation.\n[3] In August 2012, the claimant was again taken by four men from the same radical group, demanding he report to them. When he did report, they asked him questions and accused him of being an informer. He was forced to pretend to agree to work with them and that he would help to reset the locks and security systems on high value cars they had looted in the revolution, so they released him. The claimant hid with various relatives. He travelled between Malta, Morocco, Tunisia, and Libya, returning six times to Libya, because he hoped there would be a stable government installed.\n[4] In December 2013, the claimant was accepted into XXXX XXXX University in XXXX, United States, so he went there that month. He studied at XXXX XXXX for six months, then transferred to XXXX College in Orlando. News from Libya became worse and the conflict escalated. The group that had abducted the claimant abducted his brother and held him from September XXXX, 2014 to February XXXX, 2015, also demanding that he work for them as a locksmith. When the brother promised he would work for them, they released him, but he fled to India, and then to Tunisia. The claimant applied for asylum in the United States. The claim was pending for almost two years with no hearing. The claimant's family continued to get notices that the claimant should report to the militant group to work for them, and then the notices changed to be that the group was going to kill the claimant. The claimant came to Canada and made a refugee claim on March 1, 2017.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] I find that the claimant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\n[6] The claimant's identity as a citizen of Libya is established by his testimony and the supporting documentation filed, namely his passport.2\n[7] Subjective fear and credibility are the determinative issues in the claim. There are several subjective fear issues raised by the claimant's behaviour. The claimant had multiple instances of re-availment to his country after his allegation that he was tortured and sought by a militant Islamist group. He failed to make claims for protection in several different countries prior to coming to the United States in 2013, delayed two years in claiming asylum in the US, and then abandoned his ongoing asylum claim in the US when he came to Canada in 2017. I recognize\nthat subjective fear issues, in and of themselves, if a claimant has a reasonable explanation for his actions, may not be fatal to a refugee claim. I also recognize that if subjective fear issues impact a claim for protection pursuant to section 96 of the Act, it is still necessary to consider whether there are grounds for a claim pursuant to section 97 of the Act. In this case, however, the claimant had no satisfactory explanation for his repeated re-availment to Libya, for his failure to claim protection in multiple different safe countries, or for his behaviour after arriving in the US. In addition, if the claimant had a credible fear of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, torture or a risk to his life, it would be unlikely that he would repeatedly return to Libya while there was no evidence or belief that the agents of harm were weakened or that some stability was on the horizon. Furthermore, the claimant's other evidence in support of his claim involves inconsistencies or gaps, without a satisfactory explanation, such that I conclude that the claimant has not provided sufficient reliable and credible evidence to establish the basis for his claim.\n[8] I will review my assessment of these and other credibility issues in the following analysis to explain why these matters lead me to conclude that the claimant has not established that he has a well-founded fear of persecution, or, on a balance of probabilities, a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Libya.\n[9] In this case, the claimant alleges that, in April 2012, the men who allegedly wanted him to work for them beat him to within inches of his life and left him for dead. Although the claimant provided a name for the militia in his Basis of Claim Form (BOC),3 in oral testimony he appeared to indicate that this reference was related not a particular militia but broadly connected to a coalition of various militias. He said he did not know exactly which militia or militias were specifically targeting him. This means that he had no evidence, in light of the ongoing power and influence of various militias in the Tripoli area at the time, that the particular individuals or group that he feared had had any diminishing in capacity over the time period following his alleged abduction. Yet after this he went to Tunisia repeatedly and returned back to the same area of Libya, before again, in August 2012, allegedly being detained by the same men who\nagain allegedly demanded that he work for them. After this second instance of being threatened by the militias, the claimant again travelled to Tunisia, Malta, Morocco, and Spain (travelling through Madrid on his way to Malta), and returned to Libya multiple times before finally leaving for the United States in December 2013. As pointed out by the Minister's Representative, each of the four countries the claimant travelled to before returning to Libya is a signatory to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol. However, the claimant did not seek protection in any of these countries, and did not even stay outside of Libya for as long as his visas for the other countries remained valid, but instead returned to Libya, the place where he alleged he had a fear that the same groups that threatened and harmed him in the past would again find him and subject him to serious mistreatment or death.\n[10] When asked to explain why he would return to Libya in the face of the alleged threats against him, the claimant gave confusing explanations that did not take into account the unstable nature of his country at the time or that addressed the question of how he thought his return could be safe in his circumstances. He stated that he loved his country and always had the hope that Libya would return to a stable government and that the country would become one of stability and security for Libyans to be able to live and maintain their standard of living in a secure environment, but that instead things went from bad to worse. When asked for further clarification, the claimant repeated that he had had high hopes for his country and stated that he decided to go and focus on learning English and wait until things quieted down.\n[11] I do not accept this explanation. I find that the claimant's explanation about hoping that the country of Libya would stabilize does not reasonably apply to the time period in which he voluntarily returned to his country, instead of seeking safety and remaining in one of the different countries where he could avoid the people who were allegedly threatening him. While hopes for a change in conditions in one's home country might conceivably provide a rationale for a person to delay in claiming protection while awaiting for conditions to change, it does not address the claimant's return to Libya at a time when his abductors allegedly were trying to find him, and during which the claimant alleged he remained terrified that if they caught him he would die.\n[12] In addition, the claimant had a US Visa that was issued on September XXXX, 2013, but he did not leave to go to the United States until three months later. As pointed out by the Minister's Representative, the claimant's statement in his BOC narrative that he went to the US after receiving admission to the XXXX XXXX in December 2013, is contradictory to the information in the US Visa that indicates that clearance was received at the University on July XXXX, 2013.4 Even if one accepts counsel's argument in submissions that, when the claimant referred to his \"acceptance\" in the program, he was likely referring to the date he commenced his program, this does not address the question of the claimant's delay in going to the United States. The acceptance into XXXX XXXX in July 2013, followed by the issuance of the visa in September 2013, means that if the claimant's intention-as indicated in his BOC narrative-was to enroll in an American College where he could both study for a degree and get away from his fears of radical Islamist groups in Libya, he had the opportunity to do so as soon as his visa was issued in September, rather than waiting three more months to go to the US, during which time his passport shows multiple entry and exit stamps to and from his country of Libya.\n[13] When describing why he returned to Libya on October XXXX, 2013, after travelling to Malta to pick up his visa for the United States on September XXXX, 2013, instead of travelling onward to the United States, the claimant said that he wanted to get his belongings from home. I do not accept this explanation for the claimant's delay in going to the United States, once he already had a visa. When balancing the practical matter of getting one's belongings against an alleged fear for one's life, it does not make sense that a person would return or face risk in such considerations.\n[14] I therefore find that the claimant's actions and his explanation for his behaviour is unreasonable and demonstrates a lack of subjective fear, and a lack of credibility. At no time did the claimant indicate that he had a reason to believe that the situation in Libya had stabilized or that the militia group that he feared was losing ground. Therefore, his actions in failing to claim\nrefugee protection in one of the countries he visited, and in returning to Libya, where he alleged he faced kidnapping and death, are actions which are inconsistent with that reasonably expected from a person who faces a serious possibility5 of persecution, or, on a balance of probabilities, a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in his own country. I find that if the claimant had been genuinely subjected to the kind of threats and harm that he alleged, it does not make sense that he-or even the rest of his family-would not have engaged in a deep consideration of how to balance his alleged risk against relatively minor issues such as collecting one's belongings. The claimant's vague and evasive responses to the questions in the hearing lead me to conclude that he had not genuinely turned his mind to these issues throughout his travels in 2012 and 2013, because the alleged kidnapping and torture and threats by the militia probably did not take place.\n[15] The Federal Court in Shah points out that an assessment of subjective fear, and the failure to claim asylum at the first available opportunity, needs to be decided on the circumstances of each case.6 The case of Goltsberg notes that:\nDelay or failure to claim refugee protection is an important consideration in assessing whether a claim is well founded. The reasons for not claiming refugee status in a foreign country must be valid in order to avoid an adverse inference.7\n[16] The Federal Court case of Licao8 deals with the question of delay in claiming, rather than failure to claim in another country, but the analysis of the relevance to the Board's credibility assessment is also applicable to other subjective fear issues. This case points out that the assessment of the delay is specific to the facts of the case and that an inability to provide a satisfactory explanation for a delay in claiming may be the factor that is fatal to a refugee claim. In that case, the Board did not accept that the claimants' conduct was consistent with that of persons exposed to the risk, experience and fear that they alleged.\n[17]\nAs pointed out by the Minister's Representative, the case of Ibnmogdad involves facts that are similar to the claimant's circumstances, in which the applicant in that case had travelled through Germany, Portugal and Ireland before claiming refugee status in Canada. The Court indicated that it was reasonable to draw a negative inference from those travels and to conclude that \"the failure of an applicant to claim refugee status in countries that are signatories to the Geneva Convention amounts to country shopping.\"9\n[18] Meanwhile, with respect to abandoning a claim in the United States, case law provides for a differing assessment of the relevance of these issues, as summarized in the case of Selvaratnam. Similarly to the other subjective fear issues raised, this case highlights the fact that while it may be reasonable in some instances for the RPD to take such actions into account, whether a negative credibility finding based on such a factor is reasonable depends very much on the facts of the individual case. 10\n[19] This review demonstrates that although subjective fear issues might not always be determinative factors in assessing a refugee claim, the relevance of actions such as the claimant's failure to claim in a safe country at the first available opportunity, re-availment, and abandoning of the US asylum claim, all depend on the claimant's particular circumstances, on his explanation for his actions, and on whether the Board accepts the explanations. In the case before me, I find that the claimant did not provide a satisfactory explanation for his behaviour.\n[20] First of all, as noted above, the claimant's primary explanation, namely that he hoped his country would stabilize, does not address his alleged fear at the time that he went back and forth between Libya and other safe countries. With respect to actions taken to secure his safety upon his return, the claimant also alleged that he managed to avoid militias by taking secondary roads and by calling people to see who was manning the checkpoints. I agree with the Minister's Representative that this answer is undermined by the claimant's other testimony that he did not know exactly which militia posed a risk to him. Furthermore, even if he did access some inside information about the location of checkpoints, and was, as submitted by his counsel, able to at least identify that groups that he believed did not pose a risk to him were at a checkpoint at a certain time, I do not find that he could have anticipated avoiding the people who were allegedly seeking him. This conclusion is based on the description of the situation at the time in country condition documents, which I will now consider.\n[21] Evidence in country documents regarding the activities of militias in Libya leads me to conclude that it would be highly unlikely that a person being sought by militias could avoid detection in the course of multiple border crossings into Tunisia and repeated need to travel from the border crossing to the claimant's home in Tripoli, or-as he later alleged-to his cousin's home near Tripoli. As indicated by the exit and entry stamps in the claimant's passport,11 the claimant crossed out of and into his country at a designated border crossing. A 2014 document dealing with the security situation in Libya, prepared by the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, relates to the time period when the claimant was travelling between Tunisia and Tripoli. It notes that, with respect to checkpoints on the roads:\nCheckpoints have been installed on access roads to towns and on city streets. In November 2013, experts stated that checkpoints are put into place without prior notice, according to the needs of the local militia, and that this greatly complicates traffic on Libyan roads. In August 2013, there were checkpoints on all the main roads leading into Tripoli, on roads between towns and at town entry points. Checks were not carried out systematically, depending on the agenda of the group manning the checkpoint. Serious difficulties to cross checkpoints with humanitarian aid for injured and displaced persons were reported.... Several international organisations have confirmed that there are checkpoints everywhere and that militias set them up whenever they feel like it. Crossing procedures are arbitrary and checkpoints regularly change place. Civilians fear checks because of the risk of being identified, rightly or wrongly, as a supporter of a rival militia.12\n[22]\nWith respect to border crossings to Tunisia, as highlighted by the Minister's Representative, this document notes that:\n[R]oads leading to the borders are open but the security situation is always liable to change suddenly, and delays or temporary closures are possible...There are three border crossings with Tunisia. According to the Crisis Group, the tribal militias that are in control of border crossings and smuggling routes change regularly in function of the evolving security situation.13\n[23] The fact that the border crossings at the time the claimant was crossing the border were, according to independent country documentation, controlled by various tribal militias, contradicts the claimant's allegation in testimony that it was local people living by the border who controlled the border crossings. Even if one assumes that the claimant's answer about the crossings being controlled by local people encompasses local militia groups, then the question remains regarding how the claimant would assume that these groups did not involve the people who were allegedly threatening him, since he did not know exactly which group had made the threats. When asked further questions about how he could be assured that the people checking his passage were not part of the militia that was seeking him, he said he was under the impression that in the remote rural areas the people did not know who he was, and that it was a risk, but that thankfully he was lucky.\n[24] This information leads me to conclude that at the time the claimant was making multiple trips between Tunisia and Libya, between April 2012 and December 2013, after the militias had allegedly identified him as a target and before the claimant left for the United States, he would have had no assurance that he could avoid militias, either at border crossings or on the roadways going to and from his home. In such circumstances, not only is the claimant's behaviour inconsistent from his stated fear, in that it does not make sense that the claimant would return to his country, but-if there was an objective basis to his claim-it would seem likely that the militia would have quite easily found him and stopped him over the course of his travels. The claimant says that he stayed with a cousin in a town 25 km from Tripoli. However, when a\nperson is travelling back and forth in and out of the country over that time period, I do not find that living away from his family home can be characterized as being in hiding. The claimant's activities are not a matter of a single surreptitious trip back to his country in unavoidable circumstances. Rather, he repeatedly chose to return to Libya, facing a strong possibility of being intercepted by the people who he said had repeatedly tortured and threatened him and who allegedly still wanted to secure his forced compliance with assisting them in making locks for their cars. In this particular fact pattern I find that the claimant does not have a satisfactory explanation for his re-availment, or for his failure to claim protection in one of the four countries in which he had access to a claim for protection and securing of safety without having to return to Libya, or for his delay in leaving for the United States and instead returning to Libya to get his belongings and not depart for the US until several months later.\n[25] Counsel argued that a consideration of the subjective fear issues raised by the claimant's re-availment to Libya in 2012 and 2013, his failure to claim in other countries that he was in, and his delay in claiming asylum in the United States do not take into account that the triggering event for the eventual asylum claim was the abduction of his brother, which the claimant said took place in September 2014. I do not accept this argument. The claimant had stated that he had already believed that the militias who allegedly tortured him in 2012 had maintained their ongoing interest in him and that he was \"terrified\" that his life was at risk from that point onward. He had also alleged in his BOC that even throughout 2014 his family and friends always told him that the militias were asking about him and wanted his head for being an infidel informer. In his BOC narrative, although he made reference to his brother's alleged abduction, he described his trigger for making an asylum claim as being friends who advised him to do so since the civil war was still ongoing in Libya. In this regard he did not identify how his own alleged fear changed at the time he finally made his asylum claim.\n[26] I have also considered the claimant's actions in abandoning his asylum claim in the US to come to Canada and make a claim instead. When asked why he would leave an active claim, he said that he waited two years in the United States and that then changes were made in the US for refugees so he came to Canada. When I asked him what changes had been made, he said that the US was no longer accepting refugee claims from Libya. I pointed out to him that his claim was already in process, so this policy would not be able to at this point prevent his filing an asylum claim. He then said it was a difficult decision but he decided to come to Canada. In combination with the claimant's previous actions in failing to claim protection in Tunisia, Spain, Malta, and Morocco, in spite of allegedly being terrified that militias would harm him in Libya, I find that the claimant's abandonment of an ongoing claim in the United States further demonstrates that the claimant is country shopping. This is inconsistent from a subjective fear of persecution, and is inconsistent from the behaviour reasonably expected from a person who faces, on a balance of probabilities, a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in their country.\n[27] Moreover, the claimant's profile as a locksmith who was forced into closing his business in response to the mistreatment and threats faced at the hands of the militia is central to his claim. Yet the claimant provided documentary evidence that was inconsistent from his testimony about the operation of his business. He stated that his work at his locksmith business slowed after the revolution in 2011, and that after the first detention and beating in April 2012 he \"ceased\" all work, and barely maintained operations, with occasional phone orders. He said that in 2013 the shop was vacated of tools and equipment, the employees were laid off and the business was closed down. According to his testimony, this was the result of the threats and beating he endured, as he allegedly no longer had the stamina to keep working and it would be unsafe to maintain a physical presence at the business where he could be found. However, the company documents he submitted show a business license renewal on September 20, 2012 for a three-year validity,14 and fees paid on January 14, 2014.15 When asked if he could explain, the claimant said his father must have renewed the business license on the claimant's behalf in 2012. When asked about fees paid in 2014, after the business had allegedly been completely closed down and all equipment sold, the claimant said that he had no idea why fees were paid at this time since he was out of Libya, and it might have been his father, who is his authorized representative in Libya, who paid on his behalf. Counsel further argued in his written submissions that if the father had been responsible for renewing the business license it was a step which would facilitate resumption of business activities for the claimant if Libya returned to a state where he considered it safe to resume business. I do not accept these explanations. The claimant is the one who submitted the documents to establish his claim. The Commercial Register16 lists only the claimant as the license owner, the sole member of the board of directors, and the sole legal representative, with no mention of the father, or-for that matter-of the brother, who the claimant later said was also a beginning locksmith working in Tripoli. If the father were renewing the claimant's business license on the claimant's behalf, in case he were to return to Libya, then it is reasonable to expect that the claimant would be aware of this plan. The claimant's testimony that the business closed down is tied to his allegations about the risk that he faces in his country. The evidence that the business license fees for the business were paid in 2014, just after the claimant left Libya, is contradictory to his allegation that following the threats the entire business was closed down, including the sale of all equipment. This inconsistency relates to the heart of the claimant's allegations about incidents after alleged threats against him.\n[28] The claimant also provided work orders dated March XXXX, 2012, February XXXX, 2012, January XXXX, 2012, December XXXX, 2011, and September XXXX, 2011,17 allegedly from various different militias as indicated by the letterhead and logos on each of the work orders, giving details about cars and requests for extraction of key codes for the cars. The claimant alleged that the cars that were brought to him by the militias were stolen vehicles, and that the reason he refused to make new keys for the vehicles was that it was improper according to locksmith ethics to make new keys without written authorization. I asked the claimant if he had any idea why the militias would provide written evidence of their possession of the vehicles if they had acquired the vehicles improperly. The claimant responded with a vague and off-topic answer, saying that at the beginning of the revolution those militias or brigades or groups would utilize those letterheads, which could be fraudulent or illegal, saying that the vehicles that were stolen were government vehicles, which-according to the claimant's view-should have been used for the good of the people of Libya, but which were stolen by the militia for personal use. I find that if the circumstances were as described by the claimant, it is unreasonable to expect that five different competing militia groups would each provide a similar and traceable work order, with letterhead, an official signature, and a group seal. The claimant's explanation that this is the\nethical way to proceed as a locksmith could explain his own desire to have operations proceed in a regulated manner. However, in this case he is alleging that the people demanding his services were working in an unscrupulous manner. It would also make some sense if the claimant had agreed to do the work for the militias, only if they had themselves agreed to submit the required paperwork. But that is not the case, either, since the claimant allegedly consistently refused to do any of the key activations, even when his refusals allegedly resulted in daily threats and verbal harassment from them. In these circumstances, I cannot conceive of any explanation for the provision of written work orders from the illegal militias, and the claimant himself did not provide any coherent explanation. I therefore do not give weight to these documents.\n[29] The claimant did provide medical documents from Libya and Tunisia, indicating that he was a victim of violent assault, resulting in broken bones surrounding one eye and his nose, treated in Libya on April XXXX, 2012, and in Tunisia immediately after that.18 Although the documents are consistent with the timing the claimant describes regarding the alleged beating and torture he says he endured from April XXXX to April XXXX, 2012, the documents do not mention general injuries resulting from what the claimant had described in his BOC as daily beatings over the course of his detention, but only make reference to reconstruction and treatment of injuries to the claimant's facial area. Even accepting that the claimant was injured and treated as the medical documents describe, these documents do not go beyond providing evidence that the claimant was a victim of a violent assault on April XXXX, 2012, likely a severe punch or hit with an object to the face, that resulted in fractures of the bones below his eye and his nose, as well as swelling and wounds on his eyelids and eye area. While this evidence likely indicates that the claimant was hit in the face with an object, resulting in a serious injury as described, in light of the claimant's other evidence that lacks credibility or a reason to believe- based on the claimant's behaviour-that he genuinely feared that the same attacker would target him again, I do not find that this evidence is sufficient to establish the additional information about the attack as alleged in the BOC.\n[30]\nIn addition, the claimant failed to provide evidence regarding happenings in Libya relevant to his allegations that would be reasonably expected in support of his claim. His BOC, signed in March 2017, states that the radical group still wanted the claimant, saying that his family \"has continued to receive notices from the group.\" His BOC says that initially these notices were that the claimant should report to them, and that more recently they were notices that the group would kill the claimant. In oral testimony the claimant stated that after his brother was released by the radical group in February 2015, his family received two letters, which were considered to be summons letters for a continuing investigation about the claimant and his brother. The claimant did not provide these letters in support of his claim, because, according to him, his family lost the letters and did not send him copies. He said he did not know if the family had had any further contact or problems with the militia since those letters were received in mid-2015 because he was not in Libya and was abroad.\n[31] It does not make sense that the claimant-if he was genuinely in fear of the militia groups in Libya in a personalized targeting-would not secure such evidence in support of his claim, or have more of an explanation for his family's alleged loss of the documents in light of the claimant's need for them. At the time the claimant allegedly learned about the letters sent to his family, the claimant would have been in the process of submitting his US asylum claim, based on the timing described in his BOC. It would be reasonable to expect that he would be asked to provide such supportive documents, just as is the case in the instructions for the Canadian refugee claim. The claimant stated that he has been in regular contact with his family and friends in Libya, and the claimant's testimony implies that his family is supportive of his attempts to seek safety. It would be reasonable to expect the claimant to request all assistance from his family in keeping and providing such documents to the claimant. In such circumstances, the claimant's brief description of his family \"losing\" both letters, not to mention the other ongoing notices referred to in the BOC demanding that the claimant report to them or threatening that they would kill him, is not satisfactory in accounting for the absence of this key documentation. In addition, considering the claimant's regular contact with his family, his failure to query about updated problems with militias over the course of two years demonstrates a disinterest in his personal risk that contrasts his detailed knowledge and description of general country conditions as outlined in his BOC. The BOC instructions are clear in asking the claimant, in question 2(b), whether he believes he would be harmed, mistreated or threatened by any person or group if he returned to his country, and to explain the reason for this belief. The claimant filled in the BOC in March 2017, and then prepared to present his case orally at the hearing before me on September 22, 2017. His failure to get information from his family about any issues with the militias over the past two years is indicative of a lack of engagement with matters that are clearly relevant to his claim. In addition, the absence of information about his ongoing risk means that the claimant has failed to provide sufficient reliable and credible evidence to demonstrate that he faces a serious possibility of persecution, or, on a balance of probabilities, a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Libya, from the parties he says pose a risk to him.\n[32] I therefore conclude that the claimant has failed to establish his claim pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Act, based on his alleged fear of militia groups who demanded work from him in 2012.\n[33] I recognize that the overall situation in Libya is serious and characterized by a serious conflict situation. As indicated by the UNHCR in 2015,\nThe current situation in Libya is characterized by a continued lack of rule of law and order, ongoing fighting between rival armed groups in many parts of the country and daily assassinations, bombings and kidnappings. Intense fighting between opposing armed groups over control of territory, resources and infrastructure since May 2014 has resulted in the death of thousands of people, including civilians, and led to the displacement of over 435,000 individuals, the destruction of vital infrastructure, disruption of basic services and deteriorating humanitarian conditions.19\n[34] Recent documents continue to indicate that there remain significant humanitarian needs in Libya.20 In light of the serious situation in his country, I have considered if there is anything about the claimant's profile that would give rise to a serious possibility of persecution for a\nConvention ground. I asked the claimant if he faced any problems in Libya outside of the issues related to the demands from militias to make keys for them in 2012. He said that his particular industry involves quite dangerous work, which would not be safe in circumstances of an unstable government. He also said that he would have been perceived to have been affiliated with XXXX XXXX XXXX based on his previous locksmith work XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[35] With respect to the claimant's allegation that he would be a perceived XXXX XXXX, he said that people would have been aware that he worked on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX because he did work remotely from his locksmith site, and could have been observed when he was called to make a key for a vehicle that was in a location connected to the regime or if the car was evidently a security vehicle. I do not find that this connection is sufficient to establish a perception that the claimant was a supporter of the regime. As pointed out by the Minister's Representative, the British courts have observed that:\nThe majority of the population of Libya either worked for, had some association with, or has a member of the family who worked for or had an association with the Gaddafi regime. Such employment or association alone is not sufficient to establish a risk of persecution or Article 3 ill-treatment on return.21\n[36] In addition, a 2014 Report by LandInfo regarding \"Libya: Vulnerable Groups,\" outlines a number of categories of groups and individuals who have a perceived association with the Gaddafi regime, including several different tribes and those who had been members of security and intelligence service for the regime, or who had been informers for the regime.22 Having found that the claimant's allegation that he was accused of being an informer to lack credibility, I do not find that the residual evidence, which is that the claimant was a person who merely performed commercial services for security members, places him within any of these categories. I therefore do not find that the claimant's prior activities in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX raises the possibility of perceived affiliation that would precipitate a well-founded fear of persecution or personal risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Libya.\n[37] With respect to the claimant's allegation that the locksmith industry is a particularly dangerous one, I do not find that the claimant has advanced sufficient evidence, beyond his personal allegations to this effect, all of which are subject to the credibility concerns outlined above, to establish that the locksmith industry is at particular heightened risk in Libya based on the identification of the particular industry itself. Also, if the locksmith industry were a particularly dangerous industry, it is hard to understand why the family would take the trouble of renewing the business license even in the claimant's absence. While the general country conditions in Libya do present some degree of risks to all citizens, in order to establish that the locksmith industry either comprises a particular social group that would lead to a serious possibility of persecution, or a distinguishing factor that would remove the claimant from the generalized risk exception in section 97, I find that the claimant would need to provide some evidence to establish such a link. In his case, he alleged particular threats based on his occupation that I have found lacking in credibility. Beyond this evidence, I have not identified other credible evidence that relates to particular risks to those in the locksmith industry in Libya. I therefore find that the claimant has not established the basis for a claim in connection to his particular job.\n[38] I also note that the description of rivalries and conflict in Libya demonstrates the possibility of persecution based on tribal or political affiliation. However, in his case, the claimant stated that his family was not part of any known tribe or political group. In addition, the claimant did not provide credible evidence to indicate that he was subject to personal targeting that would distinguish him from the exception to a section 97 claim based on generalized risk. Therefore, having found that the claimant did not establish a well-founded fear of persecution based on reprisals for his refusal to do locksmith work for a militia group, my consideration of the residual evidence regarding country conditions leads me to find that in this case, there is nothing else in the evidence - whether personal or documentary - that would provide a well-founded fear of persecution or a foundation for establishing a personal risk to life, or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or danger of torture for the claimant pursuant to sections 96 or 97 of the Act.\nCONCLUSION\n[39] For the foregoing reasons, I conclude that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is not a Convention refugee and not a person in need of protection and I therefore reject his claim.\n(signed)\n\"Lucinda Bruin\"\nLucinda Bruin\nNovember 7, 2017\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibit 1.\n3 Exhibit 2.\n4 Exhibit 1.\n5 Adjei v.

The Minister has filed two applications in this case; one for cessation of refugee status pursuant to section 108 and the other for vacation pursuant to section 109 of Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \"Act\").1 In this interlocutory application, the Minister wants to join these applications so that the hearing can take place simultaneously with respect to both applications.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] The Minister's application is denied for the following reasons.\nTHE APPLICATION\n[3] The respondent was granted refugee protection in XXXX 2004. In October 2017, the Minister filed two applications concerning the respondent. One is an application for cessation of the respondent's refugee status, pursuant to section 108 of the Act. The other is an application to vacate the respondent's refugee status, pursuant to section 109 of the Act.\n[4] By application dated November 1, 2017, the Minister requested that the vacation and cessation applications be joined and heard in one hearing. The Minister argued that the vacation and cessation applications relate to the same issue, which is whether the respondent's status should be removed. According to the Minister, both applications are closely related and joining the applications would bring a speedier conclusion to the case, which is consistent with section 162(2) of the Act, which indicates that each division shall deal with all proceedings before it as informally and quickly as the circumstances and the considerations of fairness and natural justice permit.\n[5] A pre-hearing conference was held on November 3, 2017, during which the Minister made further submissions regarding the application to join the proceedings. The Minister submitted that considering that the respondent is in detention, it is reasonable to hear all evidence at once rather than delaying matters by having two distinct proceedings.\nCOUNSEL'S POSITION\n[6] Counsel for the respondent (\"counsel\") opposed the application and requested that the matters remain separate and that each be dealt with individually. Counsel argued that both matters before the RPD are complex, and although the vacation and cessation issues may be interlinked in the sense that they may be based on the same evidence, they deal with separate issues. Counsel's position is that joining the matters will have a negative impact on the procedural fairness afforded to the respondent. The decision of the RPD concerning each allegation presented by the Minister has an immediate and significant impact on the respondent, as such, joining the matters would exponentially complicate the case and would put the respondent at a considerable disadvantage, thereby negatively affecting his ability to prepare for the matters to be heard.\n[7] Counsel further argued that while the Minister's vacation application requires the panel to analyse the evidence before the RPD member at the time of the hearing, the cessation application requires the panel to analyse the respondent's actions subsequent to obtaining refugee status. As such, joining the two applications will not have a positive impact on the efficient administration of the Division's work and nor will it assist the panel to deliberate similar questions of fact or law. Given these issues together with the complexity of each application, its restraint on the respondent's and his counsel's resources, which is further affected because the respondent is in custody and not readily available to meet with counsel, joining the two applications would likely cause an injustice.\nANALYSIS\n[8] As the Act indicates, the RPD's mandate is to deal with matters as efficiently as possible. However, this is to be done fairly and with consideration of fairness and natural justice. I find that, although joining the matters may result in a marginally quicker conclusion, doing so would negatively impact the fairness of the proceedings. I agree with counsel's submissions that joining the matters will exponentially complicate the case. I find that it would not be procedurally fair to the respondent to expect him to prepare to proceed with all the issues within the vacation and cessation applications at the same time.\n[9] Furthermore, although the vacation and cessation applications may deal with similar issues, the assessment of each matter is different. The Minister is relying on the same package of evidence for both matters. However, each application requires a different assessment of the same evidence; as such, the evidence needs to be assessed in a different light for each application. Therefore, it is neither efficient and nor does it allow me to combine the same questions of law when deciding each of the applications, in accordance with the factors set out in RPD Rule 56. For these reasons, I deny the Minister's application. The vacation and cessation applications are to remain separate and will be dealt with as such.\n[10] The application for vacation pursuant to section 109 will be dealt with first. Once the decision is rendered regarding the vacation application, the Minister retains the right to pursue the cessation application in the event that their vacation application is denied. For administrative purposes, the evidence already submitted by the Minister (12 volumes) on the vacation file will also remain on the cessation application file and the Minister is not required to refile the same evidence should they wish to pursue the cessation application.\n[11] As agreed to during the pre-hearing conference, counsel is reminded that he has two weeks from the date of this decision to advise the RPD whether he has been retained or not.\n[12] Furthermore, a transcript of the pre-hearing conference was not ordered. However, either party is open to requesting an audio copy of the pre-hearing conference should they require it.\nCONCLUSION\n[13] The Minister's application to join the vacation and cessation applications is refused. The matters will remain separate and the vacation application will be dealt with first.\n(signed)\n\"Zonia M. Tock\"\nZonia M.

The claim is made pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \"Act\").1\n[2] Counsel for the claimant provided written submissions which were entered as an Exhibit and were considered in this decision.2\nDETERMINATION\n[3] The panel finds that the claimant is not a Convention refugee as he does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Sudan.\n[4] The panel also finds that the claimant is not a person in need of protection in that his removal to Sudan would not subject him personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, and in that there are no substantial grounds to believe that his removal to Sudan would subject him personally to a danger of torture.\nALLEGATIONS\n[5] The details of the allegations are found in the claimant's Personal Information Form (PIF).3 In summary, the claimant alleges that he fears persecution at the hands of the Sudanese government for holding a perceived anti-government political opinion.\nIDENTITY\n[6] The claimant was initially detained by Canada Immigration because of a lack of identity documentation. The claimant obtained the following documents: a Sudanese National Identity, and Birth Certificate.4 The panel has had an opportunity to review the documents and question the claimant about them. The panel is satisfied that the claimant has established his personal identity and Sudanese citizenship on a balance of probabilities.\nCREDIBILITY\n[7] When a claimant swears to the truthfulness of certain facts, there is the presumption that what he is saying is true unless there is reason to doubt it.\n[8] The Federal Court of Appeal in Dan-Ash5 held that such a presumption of truthfulness may be rebutted by the existence of contradictions in the evidence presented by the claimant and that it is a valid basis for a finding of a lack of credibility.\n[9] When assessing credibility the panel is entitled to rely on its rationality and common sense. In this case, the panel finds that there is reason to doubt the claimant's truthfulness. In particular, there are contradictions, inconsistencies, and implausibilities in the claimant's evidence and these went to the heart of the claim and undermined his credibility. The explanations he provided were not satisfactory in resolving these.\nDid the Sudanese authorities seek to conscript the claimant?\n[10] The claimant stated in his written narrative that on April 10, 2007, he was called for conscription to the National Service.6 The claimant testified that he was detained by the Sudanese authorities on XXXX XXXX, 2007, for refusing to be conscripted into the Army. The claimant repeated the date of detention as being XXXX XXXX, 2007, a second time. The panel noted that in the PIF narrative it stated that he was detained on XXXX XXXX, 2007, not XXXX XXXX, 2007. When asked about the discrepancy, the claimant then testified that he was actually detained on XXXX XXXX, 2007.\n[11] The panel now had 3 different dates provided by the claimant for when he was detained by the Sudanese authorities in XXXX 2007, namely; XXXX XXXX, 2007, XXXX XXXX, 2007, and XXXX XXXX XXXX 2007. When asked as to whether there was an explanation as to why there are three dates given for the one detention, the claimant said that he had no explanation.\n[12] The panel finds that the claimant has not provided a reasonable explanation for providing three different dates for what is a core event in his claim. The panel finds that this undermines the claimant's credibility with respect to the events of XXXX 2007 and finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant was not arrested and detained by the Sudanese authorities in XXXX 2007.\n[13] The claimant further testified that he was again detained by Sudanese authorities in 2008. When asked to describe when it took place, the claimant stated that the detention occurred on XXXX XXXX, 2008. He then stated it occurred on XXXX XXXX, 2008.\n[14] The claimant testified that on XXXX XXXX, 2008, a member of the National Security service came to him home and asked the claimant why he had not done his national service. The claimant stated that he refused to do his military service. The claimant testified that upon hearing his refusal, he was immediately taken by the National Security officer to a ghost house, where he was detained for 2 days.\n[15] The claimant again confirmed that one officer came to his home on XXXX XXXX, 2008, and upon hearing the claimant's refusal to do military service, the officer took the claimant that same day and detained him for two days.\n[16] The panel drew the claimant's attention to his PIF narrative wherein he stated that on XXXX XXXX, 2007, he refused to report for military service AND that on the morning of XXXX XXXX, 2008, he was arrested by two members of the National Security from his home and detained for XXXX days.7 When this discrepancy was put to the claimant he said he was tired but had no other explanation.\n[17] The panel finds that the claimant has not provided a reasonable explanation to explain the discrepancies with respect to the XXXX 2008 incident. The panel finds that this undermines the claimant's credibility with respect to this incident and finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the events as described never took place and the claimant was not detained by the Sudanese authorities in XXXX 2008.\n[18] The claimant further testified that he was served with a call up for conscription in XXXX 2012. The claimant stated that a notice was left at his home. He did not produce a copy of the document nor did he make any inquiries from his father to obtain it. The panel notes that the claimant has counsel and that the PIF requests that documents be obtained that support the claim. Given the credibility concerns as outlined above the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant did not receive a call up for national service in XXXX 2012.\n[19] The claimant testified that upon graduation from secondary school he was told that he had to do national military service. When he refused to do the military service he was advised that he would not receive his secondary school graduation certificate. The claimant mentioned on at least three occasions during his testimony that he would not obtain his secondary school graduation certificate until he completed his national military service. The claimant stated that he never received the certificate.\n[20] The panel drew the claimant to one of his supporting documents which was the certificate of completion of secondary school.8 When asked how he was able to obtain this document given his previous testimony the claimant now stated that they actually refused to give him his grades.\n[21] The claimant was clear in his testimony that he was told that he would not get his certificate of completion of secondary school. The panel finds, on a balance, that the claimant did actually receive this certificate. The panel finds that the change in the claimant's testimony from not receiving a certificate of completion to not receiving grades, is an attempt to explain a major discrepancy in his testimony.\n[22] The panel finds that the claimant received a certificate of completion of secondary school. This suggests to the panel that the claimant either completed national military service or that national service is not tied into obtaining a certificate of completion from school. The panel finds that this discrepancy further undermines the credibility of the claimant with respect to the issue of military conscription.\n[23] The panel notes that the claimant produced two letter from his father and his brother with regards to the conscription issue.9 The information provided in the letters matches the information in the PIF narrative, which the panel has already found to be not credible. Given the credibility concerns as outlined above, the panel finds these letters to be of no weight and were created to bolster the claim.\n[24] Considering the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that there is no credible or trustworthy evidence to show that the claimant has ever been sought by the Sudanese authorities because of a failure to do military service in that country.\nDid the claimant belong to the XXXX group?\n[25] The claimant testified that he formally joined the XXXX group on XXXX XXXX, 2010. He identified the group seeking to change the government in Sudan, free all detained people and reform the country.\n[26] The panel questioned the claimant about how he formally joined the group. The panel repeated the question a number of times before the claimant answered and said that he joined the XXXX group through Facebook. He stated that the group sent him an invitation which he accepted.\n[27] The claimant was asked whether he had the XXXX Facebook page which would confirm his membership and he stated that he did not. When asked if he contacted the XXXX group through Facebook to obtain confirmation of his membership, he testified that he sometimes did not open Facebook.\n[28] The claimant was asked when the group was created and by who. The claimant stated that it was created in XXXX 2010. He later gave a new date of XXXX 2009. He further stated that the group was founded by a person named XXXX XXXX.\n[29] The documentary evidence indicates that the group was created in October 2009 by two persons: XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX.10 When this information was put to the claimant he indicated that he was confused. When asked again, the claimant stated that that he had no explanation for not knowing who founded the XXXX organization and when.\n[30] The panel finds that the claimant has not provided a reasonable explanation for not knowing the basic information about the group to which he allegedly belonged. Counsel submits that his evidence was only one month off from when the group was founded and that this should not be a credibility issue.\n[31] The panel disagrees. The claimant was actually a year off initially when he stated that the group was founded in XXXX 2010. He then provided a second date of XXXX 2009. The actual date of founding was XXXX 2009. The panel finds it reasonable for someone who alleges an active membership in such a group would know when it was created. The panel finds that the lack of information as to who founded the group and when is significant in this particular case. The panel finds that it undermines the claimant's allegations that he as an active member of this group.\n[32] The panel has seen letters from the XXXX organization itself in the past confirming membership and notes that it has its own website. The documentary evidence further confirms that the organization shares information via Facebook, on-line chats, emails, skype and cell phones.11 The claimant himself stated that he joined through Facebook and was a member on its Facebook page. The claimant has not provided a copy of that page which would assist the panel in establishing his membership in that organization. The panel finds that the lack of confirmation of the claimant's membership from the XXXX organization itself to undermine the allegation that he is an active member of that organization.\n[33] The claimant has produced a letter from a friend who confirmed that he was a member of XXXX.12 However, given the credibility concerns raised above and that fact that the claimant could have obtained direct confirmation from the organization itself, the panel places little weight on the letter and finds that it does not overcome the credibility concerns raised.\n[34] The claimant alleged that he was detained by the Sudanese authorities because of his XXXX activities. The claimant testified that he was detained on the 5th day in the middle of 2011. He did not specify a month. It was again confirmed that the detention occurred in the middle of 2011. The claimant further confirmed that he was detained only one time in 2011.\n[35] In the claimant's PIF narrative it stated that he was detained by the authorities for his XXXX activities on XXXX XXXX, 2011, and not the middle of 2011 as he stated in his oral evidence.13 When this discrepancy was put to the claimant he stated that he was confused and provided no other explanation.\n[36] The panel finds that the claimant has not provided a reasonable explanation for the discrepancy in the times of his alleged detention for his XXXX activities. This detention is a pivotal incident in the claim and finds that this discrepancy greatly undermines his credibility in this regard. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant was not detained by the authorities in 2011.\n[37] The claimant testified that he was forced to sign a document upon his release from his detention for his XXXX activities. The claimant stated that he was not allowed to read the document and had no knowledge as to its contents. In his PIF, however, he states that he had to sign a document promising to abandon any connection with the XXXX movement.14 When that discrepancy was put to the claimant, he again stated that he had no explanation.\n[38] The panel finds that the claimant has not provided any reasonable explanation for the credibility concerns that have arisen with regards to his activities with the XXXX organization. The panel finds the lack of a reasonable explanation to undermine his credibility. The panel therefore finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant was never an active member of the XXXX organization and further finds that he was never detained by the Sudanese authorities in 2011.\nActivities in Canada\n[39] When asked about his activities in Canada, the claimant testified that he attended only one demonstration in London, Ontario, where he lived.\n[40] The claimant testified that he attended that demonstration in XXXX 2017. He confirmed this date through his testimony a minimum of six times. The claimant further identified the photos presented as being from the only demonstration that he attended in XXXX 2017.15 The claimant confirmed that he was not on television while at the demonstration nor did he speak to anyone else. He stated that there were approximately 45 people present.\n[41] The panel referred to a letter provided by the claimant in which it stated that he attended two demonstrations in XXXX and XXXX 2016. There is no reference at all to a demonstration in XXXX 2017. The claimant went back and forth in his testimony whether he attended a demonstration in XXXX 2017 and finally stated that he attended two demonstrations in XXXX and XXXX 2016.16\n[42] The claimant was asked to comment on the discrepancy in the evidence in that he stated only one demonstration while in Canada and that occurred in XXXX 2017. It was further put to the claimant that he specifically stated XXXX 2017 six times. The claimant stated that he had no comment.\n[43] The panel finds that the claimant has not provided a reasonable explanation for this discrepancy. The panel further finds that this is a significant discrepancy as it undermines his allegations that he was politically active since coming to Canada. The panel finds that this greatly undermines his credibility. The panel further finds, on a balance of probabilities, that claimant did not attend any demonstrations here in Canada. The panel further finds that the letters and photos were created to bolster his claim and as such puts no weight on the documents.\n[44] Furthermore, there is no evidence before the panel to indicate that the Sudanese government or supporter are spying on Sudanese here in Canada.\n[45] Given that the panel has founds that the claimant was not politically active here in Canada and did not attend any demonstrations here, it puts no weight on the family letter which purports to allege visits to the claimant's family home in Sudan in XXXX 2017.17 The panel finds that the letter was created to bolster the claim.\nMedical report\n[46] Finally, the panel has before it the assessment of Dr. XXXX which states that the claimant is exhibiting symptoms consistent with PTSD.18 While the panel does not dispute the psychologist's assessment of the claimant, this document does not suffice to overcome the credibility concerns outlined above.\n[47] The panel notes that the claimant was provided with more than one opportunity to answer a question if he did not understand it or if he was confused. Counsel also had ample opportunity to question the claimant on any area he sought fit. The panel further notes that there was no application to have the claimant designated as a vulnerable person, nor did counsel or the claimants make any request for accommodations.\n[48] Considering the efforts made by the panel to assist the claimant in conjunction with the guidance of the claimant's counsel throughout the refugee process and the lack of any request for accommodations, the panel finds the credibility concerns that arose cannot be set aside and dismissed based on the psychological report.\n[49] Furthermore, the Federal Court has held that a psychiatric report cannot serve as a cure-all for any and all deficiencies in a claimant's testimony.19 As the panel has found the claimant to be lacking in credibility with respect to his allegations and as the psychologist's assessment is based upon those same allegations as recounted by the claimant, the panel gives the psychologist's report no probative weight in terms of establishing, on a balance of probabilities, the credibility issues which arose.\nCONCLUSION\n[50] The panel finds that given the negative credibility findings as outlined above and on the basis of the totality of the evidence considered, the claimant has not satisfied his burden of establishing a serious possibility that he would be persecuted or that he would be personally subjected to a risk to his life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture by any authority in Sudan.\n[51] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel concludes that the claimant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection and therefore rejects his claim.\n(signed)\n\"P.

The claimant was born in India in 1968 to Tibetan (Chinese) parents and has lived in India his entire life, raising his family and running his own business there.\n[5] The claimant fears religious and ethnic persecution in China because he is a follower of His Holiness the Dalai Lama (HHDL); is a former Buddhist monk; and has served as President of the Regional Tibetan Freedom Movement (RTFM) in Bangalore, which supports the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA).3 The claimant's family was connected to the Chu-Shi-Gang-Druk movement in Tibet and fled in the 1960s before the claimant's birth, fearing arrest by Chinese authorities.\n[6] The details of the claim are contained in the BOC. In short, the claimant left India using a fraudulent Indian passport containing a US visa, both issued in his own name, and entered the United States (US) on XXXX XXXX, 2013.4 After spending approximately five months in New York City (following a month in Portland), the claimant traveled to Minnesota where he stayed with family following his brother-in-law's stroke, death, and a forty-nine day mourning period. As an exception to the Safe Third Country Agreement, the claimant entered Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2014, with the assistance of his niece, and claimed protection shortly thereafter.\nISSUE\n[7] The determinative issue is whether the claimant has exercised his citizenship rights in India, a second country of reference against which he has not alleged persecution.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[8] The claimant's personal identity as a Tibetan born in 1968 is established by the claimant's testimony and the supporting documentation filed, including his Tibetan Green Book.5 The original documents are in the custody of Immigration Canada officials.6 These documents establish the claimant was born in India and\/or list his nationality as \"Indian.\"7\nIndia's Citizenship Act provides a right to citizenship for persons born in India\n[9] On the issue of national identity\/country of reference, the panel has considered the Indian legislative framework and finds on the face of the legislation, the claimant, a Tibetan born in XXXX, Mysore District, India on XXXX XXXX, 1968, within the relevant eligibility period from January 26, 1950 and July 1, 1987, has a birthright to citizenship in India under s. 3 of its Citizenship Act.8\n[10] The conferral of this birthright is made irrespective of parents' nationalities9 and, according to section 9 of the Citizenship Act, a person who has Indian citizenship can only lose such right by formally renouncing it, for example, by becoming a national of another country.10 There is no evidence before the panel the claimant has done so.\n[11] The panel also notes a person cannot declare himself or herself \"stateless\" when such a citizenship right exists.11 Therefore, despite the claimant's decision to identify himself as \"stateless\" in his interactions with immigration officials upon entry to Canada and on his related immigration intake forms, the panel finds he has a right to citizenship in India, where he was born in 1968 and has lived with his family for forty-five years.\nIndian authorities recognizing citizenship rights of Tibetans born in India\n[12] The panel has considered the practical realities that impact recognition of citizenship in India, including the past reluctance of Indian authorities to recognize Indian citizenship for Tibetans born in India.12 The objective country condition evidence includes examples of Indian authorities refusing to issue Tibetans passports, as well as instances in which, despite intervention by India's High Court, Indian authorities have denied passports to Tibetans.13 While an option, challenging such refusals by Indian authorities through litigation is costly and, therefore, out of reach for many Tibetans entitled to and seeking Indian citizenship.14\n[13] Despite these examples of the historical, and in some cases persistent, reluctance on the part of some Indian authorities to recognize citizenship, this objective evidence is counter-balanced by other recent reports. Country condition documents also report the Judicial Branch and electoral authorities in India's government recognize the right of citizenship for Tibetans. There are also differences in approach to the question of citizenship recognition within the Executive Branch of India's government itself; the Ministry of External Affairs is more willing to recognize citizenship of Tibetans born in India than the Ministry of Home Affairs, for example.15 While the panel recognizes that approaches by Indian government authorities continue to vary, and the realities facing applicants should be assessed in light of updated factual evidence, the panel nonetheless finds there is presently sufficient evidence to support a finding that Indian authorities will recognize Indian citizenship for ethnic Tibetans born in India within the designated period; the onus is, therefore, on the claimant to access his citizenship.\n[14] In making this finding, the panel has considered a series of favourable Indian High Court decisions in 2010, 2013 and 2014, as well as India's Election Commission's decision in February 2014 to recognize and implement the right of Tibetans to vote in India.16 The panel has also taken into account the Judicial Branch's more accommodating approach to citizenship for Tibetans born in India during the designated period, following the lead of the Ministry of External Affairs.\n[15] This finding that Indian authorities are favouring citizenship recognition for Tibetans forms the basis for the panel's main analysis.\nClaimant took two limited and substantially delayed steps to avail himself of Indian citizenship\n(i) The Federal Court of Appeal's decision of Tretsetsang places onus on claimant to show reasonable efforts to overcome impediment to citizenship [...]\n[16] The Williams \"control test,\" in essence, is \"if it is within the control of the applicant to acquire the citizenship of a country with respect to which he has no well-founded fear of persecution, the claim for refugee status will be denied.\"17 The practice of \"country shopping\" is \"incompatible with the 'surrogate' dimension of international refugee protection recognized in Ward...\" and steps required to acquire citizenship are not restricted to mere technicalities such as filing appropriate documents. 18 This \"reflects the notion which is transparent in the definition of a refugee that the 'unwillingness' of an applicant to take steps [within his power to control] to gain state protection is fatal to his refugee claim unless that unwillingness results from the very fear of persecution itself.\" 19\n[17] The Federal Court of Appeal in Tretsetsang relied on the Williams control test, 20 placing the \"onus on the applicant to establish an impediment [to exercising a right to citizenship in a particular country] that would result in the applicant not having control.\"21\nA claimant must establish on a balance of probabilities:\n(a) the existence of a significant impediment that may reasonably be considered capable of preventing the claimant from exercising his or her citizenship rights of state protection in that country; and\n(b) that the claimant has made reasonable efforts to overcome such impediment and that such efforts were unsuccessful such that the claimant was unable to obtain the protection of that state.22 [emphasis added]\n[18] What constitutes \"reasonable efforts\" is to be determined on a case by case basis. Where a claimant establishes it would not be reasonable to make such efforts, no efforts need be made.23\n[19] For the reasons set out herein, the panel finds the claimant has failed to establish on a balance of probabilities the existence of an impediment to Indian citizenship and that he made reasonable efforts but was unsuccessful in overcoming such impediment and could not access state protection.\n(ii) Claimant took two very limited steps toward obtaining Indian citizenship\n[20] The claimant took two steps to secure his right to Indian citizenship between the time he arrived in the US in XXXX 2013 and his hearing three years later, in December 2016.\n[21] First, at his lawyer's suggestion, the claimant \"looked up instructions\" for applying for Indian citizenship, noting the Indian Prime Minister's 2015 statement that he had no objection to Tibetans obtaining Indian citizenship. Upon looking up the application instructions, the claimant learned he needed a standard Indian passport to apply. In order to obtain a standard passport, he learned he needed an Indian birth certificate, which he testified he does not have because he was born at home. The claimant concluded that without a birth certificate to prove that he had been born in India between 1950 and 1987, he would be unable to obtain a passport or, therefore, Indian citizenship.\n[22] Second, the claimant made a single enquiry to a friend in India on December 10, 2016, four days before his hearing. Specifically, the claimant asked his friend to ask a lawyer in India how to get him an Indian birth certificate. The claimant did not present evidence that he directly contacted a lawyer in India to request this information.\n[23] To ascertain whether steps the claimant took were sufficient to meet his burden of establishing that he faces a \"significant impediment\" in his efforts to obtain Indian citizenship, as defined in Tretsetsang, the panel asked the claimant additional questions. For example, the panel asked the claimant about the official registration of his birth with the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA), noting the claimant's birthplace in India is clearly marked on this document, which he presented as evidence of his identity.24 The claimant testified that his parents registered him with the CTA when he was seven years old, adding that both of his parents were present for the registration. When asked whether the CTA registration can be used as proof of birth in India (in lieu of a birth certificate or as a tool to obtain one) given that it bears the claimant's registered date and place of birth, in India, the claimant testified that it is not possible because, according to the enquiries he made, a birth certificate has to be issued by a hospital and local office. The panel finds the claimant did not provide a satisfactory explanation.\n[24] Moreover, despite having earlier testified about contacting a friend in India to make related enquiries to a lawyer, the claimant demonstrated his ability to quickly and directly contact a lawyer in India directly when it suits him to do so by disclosing a brief lawyer's letter dated December 15, 2016, the day after the hearing. The letter states the claimant's name, his father's name, and his address in Bangalore, India, and concludes that his \"Birth Certificate...cannot be issued.\"25 The letter is on the letterhead of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. and is signed by XXXX XXXX, LL.B.\n[25] The lawyer's letter says nothing about why the claimant's birth certificate cannot be issued, whether because the claimant was born at home or otherwise, nor does it indicate whether it may be possible to provide other official documents to corroborate the fact of the claimant's birth in India for the purpose of supporting a citizenship application, whether in lieu of or to obtain the required birth certificate, such as the CTA registration, as the panel suggested. In light of its limited use and the absence in it of any reference to relevant instructions, requirements or laws related to the conditions for obtaining an Indian birth certificate for a person born at home, the panel finds the letter to be of little probative value and, therefore, gives it little weight as proof that the claimant cannot obtain the necessary birth certificate or take other steps within his control to prove his birth in India in order to apply for citizenship under section 3 of the Citizenship Act.\n[26] Following the hearing, the claimant also submitted a copy of his Indian Identity Certificate.26 This document, used for travel in lieu of a passport according to counsel's covering note, states the claimant's parents' names and lists his nationality as \"Indian.\" The document was issued by Indian authorities on May 29, 2006 and is valid for ten years. The purpose of submitting this document to the Board was to demonstrate that the claimant does not have a genuine Indian passport and, therefore, to show he is not already an Indian citizen. The claimant testified the Indian passport issued in his name on which he traveled, which he later destroyed, was fraudulent.\n[27] The panel finds presenting this document does not mean that the claimant cannot become an Indian citizen by exercising his right under the Act to do so. Nor does it show that he has applied for and\/or been refused an Indian passport or citizenship. The claimant cannot, therefore, rely on presenting the Indian Identity Card issued in his name to establish he has taken reasonable efforts to overcome an impediment to Indian citizenship beyond his control, nor that it would not be reasonable for him to make such or further efforts to apply for Indian citizenship. The panel also finds that simply producing this document does not necessarily indicate the claimant's genuine intentions, specifically about whether he has taken or intends to take any substantive steps to obtain Indian citizenship. The panel assigns the copy of the document little weight, in keeping with its minimal probative value.\n[28] What matters is not only what documents the claimant has and presents to prove his identity, which is a critical part of making his claim overall, but also and more to the point of his particular claim, what documents he has (or can access) that may be relied on to apply for Indian citizenship, directly or indirectly, and\/or whether and what steps he has taken to apply.\n[29] The panel finds it is unreasonable that the claimant could not use his identity card issued by Indian authorities which lists his nationality as Indian to apply for Indian citizenship or, at very least, to assist him in obtaining an Indian birth certificate or another satisfactory document that would enable him to obtain a passport or directly apply for Indian citizenship. The key question then, again, is what evidence is before the panel about the steps the claimant has taken, and are they sufficient to establish the required \"reasonable efforts\" in his particular case?\n[30] There is no evidence before the panel that the claimant has used this document or any other of his existing identity documents to apply for Indian citizenship or to obtain other documents upon which he could rely on to make such an application. In the absence of such evidence, and in light of the scant evidence of other steps he took earlier to exercise his right to Indian citizenship, the panel finds his efforts unreasonable in the circumstances and, therefore, insufficient to establish an impediment over which he has no control. In making this finding the panel has also considered the claimant's delay in taking any steps to apply for Indian citizenship, given that obtaining such citizenship, to which he is entitled, would grant him protection from any threat of deportation to China from India, which he allegedly fears.\n[31] In sum, the panel finds the two steps the claimant did take are insufficient to establish on a balance of probabilities the existence of an impediment to Indian citizenship, and that he made reasonable efforts but was unsuccessful in overcoming such impediment.\n(iii) Claimant substantially delayed taking any steps to obtain Indian citizenship\n[32] The claimant's failure to make timely enquiries by contacting Indian authorities to apply for citizenship and\/or to enquire about how he could do so, including by relying on the documents in hand and\/or by accessing other documents, weakens the strength of his claim that he took steps to avail himself of Indian citizenship. The panel draws a negative inference about the credibility of the claimant's account of having taken serious steps to secure Indian citizenship from the demonstrated lack of timeliness of his efforts, in addition to the limited content of the steps.\n[33] In assessing the claimant's actions and, specifically, efforts within his control to secure Indian citizenship and\/or documents to support his citizenship application, such as his birth certificate, the panel notes that many of the documents the claimant presented at his hearing were obtained after he arrived in New York. In the absence of any evidence he took other steps during this time to obtain documents related to Indian citizenship, and noting he only recently contacted a lawyer in India to ask related questions (after they were raised at his hearing), the panel finds the claimant failed to take timely, meaningful steps to obtain documents to assist him in seeking Indian citizenship. The panel concludes the claimant had no genuine intention to do so but rather meant to create sufficient impression for the panel that he had taken reasonable efforts.\n[34] The panel notes the claimant is an educated, self-employed business person who is, therefore, capable of making applications and enquiries, and seeking and relying on advice from his trusted and wide network of fellow Tibetans in the US, Canada and elsewhere. Therefore, just as the claimant took steps to obtain documents to assist him in making his protection claim based on his Tibetan identity, and indeed was able to contact a lawyer in India the day following his hearing to obtain a letter,27 the panel finds he could have taken timely and determined steps to obtain documents related to his Indian citizenship application well beforehand, including about obtaining a requisite birth certificate if he really intended to apply for Indian citizenship, but he did not.\n[35] While the panel acknowledges that different steps are required to obtain different documents, and not all are equally easy to access, the claimant testified he had had taken no steps during the eight month period while he was in the United States to access information about or otherwise secure his entitlement to Indian citizenship. Neither did he take any steps in the interim between his first scheduled hearing in the fall of 2014, and his newly scheduled hearing, on December 14, 2016, more than two years later except, four days before his hearing, following the gathering of general information about the application process and requirements.\n[36] The panel finds the claimant's failure to take any steps given ample opportunity to do so despite considerable time (three years) since he left India is unreasonable given his eligibility for citizenship under India's Citizenship Act and his alleged fear of deportation to China. Given this incongruence, the panel asked the claimant whether, if he could obtain a birth certificate, he would apply for Indian citizenship. The claimant testified he would take Indian citizenship.\n[37] The panel finds this statement is unreasonable because of its inconsistency with his other actions. Instead, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities, it is more likely the claimant waited until the very last minute before his hearing to make any effort to exercise his right to Indian citizenship because his purpose was to be able to say he had taken some step at his hearing, not because it was his genuine intention to apply for Indian citizenship. The claimant's delays in taking any steps until the last minute not only undermines the credibility of his account of taking the steps for the purpose of seeking Indian citizenship, but also undermines the credibility of his account, overall, which is based on fearing deportation from India to China, a fate he could avoid if he obtained Indian citizenship as he is entitled to do.\n[38] In sum, the panel therefore finds the claimant has not established on a balance of probabilities the existence of an impediment to Indian citizenship and that he made reasonable, and reasonably timely, efforts to exercise his citizenship rights, but was unsuccessful in overcoming such impediment.\nClaimant's delay in making his claim, risking deportation from the US to China, undermines his alleged subjective fear of deportation to China from India\n[39] The claimant left India on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2013 and remained in the US until XXXX XXXX, 2014, for nearly nine months. The panel notes the claimant did not claim asylum in the US and substantially delayed making his way from the US to Canada, explaining the delay in part because Canada is \"cold.\" The panel finds the claimant's explanation is unreasonable not only because of its incongruence with his alleged fear of persecution (one could reasonably expect the claimant to prefer being cold to being persecuted), but also because according to his evidence he was in New York and eventually, after five months, traveled to Minnesota en route to Canada.28 Both New York and Minnesota are cold in winter; Minnesota is often even colder than parts of Canada including Toronto, near where the claimant entered and where he now lives. Taking these considerations into account, the panel finds the claimant's explanation for the substantial delay in coming to Canada is unreasonable and, overall, also undermines the credibility of his account.\n[40] The panel accepts the claimant's evidence that he traveled to Minnesota to attend a family member during the end state of her husband's illness and throughout the forty-nine day mourning period after his death before he entered Canada. However, to be clear, the panel finds the rest of his explanation not to be satisfactory. Therefore, overall, the panel finds the claimant's explanation for the nearly nine-month delay in the US to be unreasonable and problematic both because the claimant took no steps during this time to secure his Indian citizenship, and, as noted, because of the length of the delay itself, irrespective of the claimant's failure to claim asylum in the US, which undermines his alleged subjective fear of deportation to China, whether from India or the US.\n[41] Again, it could be reasonably concluded that if the claimant genuinely feared such deportation he would have taken timely steps to secure his Indian citizenship and he would have ensured he did not overstay his US visa, thereby protecting against the possibility of deportation to China\/Tibet. Instead of protecting himself against possible deportation to China from the US, the claimant instead exposed himself to this risk, the very risk he allegedly fears in India, by overstaying his six month US visa.\n[42] When asked, the claimant testified that he was \"worried but not afraid of deportation\"29 while he was in the US, where he felt safe. Counsel submitted the consequence of being deported \"seems not to have occurred to\" the claimant while he was in the US. The panel finds these explanations unreasonable and, further, that the claimant's related evidence undermines his account of fearing persecution if deported to China\/Tibet, whether from the US or India.\n[43] The panel also notes the Minister's evidence that the claimant used a fraudulent Indian passport issued in his own name to enter into the United States when he arrived on XXXX XXXX, 2013, which may also have subjected him to deportation from the US to China\/Tibet.30 The panel accepts the Minister's overall conclusions that if the claimant feared being deported to China\/Tibet, it would be reasonable to expect he would have taken different steps, including seeking asylum in the US and\/or leaving before his six month stay had expired, which he failed to do. The panel acknowledges there may be reasons why a person seeking protection would use a fraudulent passport to flee a country where he or she faces a risk of persecution and\/or to therefore gain entry to a safe country. Even making this allowance for the claimant, the panel nonetheless finds the claimant's actions, as a whole, to be inconsistent with those of a person who allegedly fears persecution as a consequence of deportation to China.\n[44] There is no evidence before the panel that the claimant has been personally threatened with deportation by Indian authorities or anyone else. Where is some evidence of Tibetans being deported from India to China, the panel finds the preponderance of recent evidence shows such cases are exceptional and usually caused by another problem, for example failing to present a required identification card.31 Both the claimant's Resident Certificate and his Identity Certificate have expired, which may pose difficulties for him in returning to India.32\n[45] However, in the absence of any other evidence the claimant faces a personal and specific rather than general and speculative threat of deportation, the panel finds there is insufficient evidence before it to find the claimant is a similarly-situated person and, therefore, likely to be deported.33 Moreover, as set out earlier, \"country shopping,\" when the claimant has not taken steps within his power to control, which extends beyond the mere technicalities of filing paperwork, is \"incompatible with the 'surrogate' dimension of international refugee protection recognized in Ward.34 Based on the evidence before it of the claimant's own actions, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, it is more likely the claimant delayed making his way to Canada to claim protection because he does not fear deportation to China for the reasons he alleges, which are based on speculation.\n[46] The panel further finds the claimant's alleged concern about what may happen in India when His Holiness the Dalai Lama (HHDL) eventually dies, namely, the deportation of Tibetans to China, is speculative. The panel cannot base its decision of this claim on what may happen or change in India for Tibetans at some future time because of an unpredictable event, or an event unpredictable at least in its timing, particularly given the other evidence before it.\n[47] Presently, Tibetans like the claimant are free to live in India, raise a family, and engage in business just as the claimant has done for his entire life until 2013. And presently, there is sufficient country condition evidence to find Indian authorities recognize the Indian citizenship of ethnic Tibetans born in India during the time the claimant was born in India, in 1968. There is insufficient evidence before the panel that Indian authorities routinely deport ethnic Tibetans to China. That is the concrete evidence before the panel and the cornerstone for its decision, having applied the test in Tretsetsang to the particular facts and other evidence in the claimant's case.\n[48] The panel therefore finds the claimant is eligible for and it is within his control to apply for Indian citizenship and, because he has not alleged persecution against India, he has a second country of reference to which he can safely return.\nCONCLUSION\n[49] For the foregoing reasons, the panel concludes that the claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground should he return to India.\n[50] For the same reasons, the panel concludes that the claimant would not personally face a risk to his life, a risk of torture, or a risk of cruel and unusual punishment, on a balance of probabilities, should he be returned to India.\n[51] Because the claimant has not established a serious possibility of persecution or that he is a person in need of protection in respect of India, and the panel finds he is eligible for Indian citizenship under India's Citizenship Act, the claim is rejected.\n(signed)\n\"J.

To summarize, the claimants alleges a fear of persecution based on the principal claimant's investigation into corruption at his former place of employment.\n[4] The principal claimant alleges the he began hearing rumours at his place of employment XXXX, (a XXXX XXXX XXXX), that assets were being diverted for the benefit of his former manager XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX), who was running for XXXX of XXXX XXXX. He conducted an investigation and confirmed that there were irregularities in the company, including assets that were being diverted to people associated with the campaign of his former manager XXXX. The principal claimant alleges that the XXXX at the time XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX were in a romantic relationship and that XXXX was using his position as XXXXof the Board XXXX XXXX to divert resources to XXXX's campaign. The principal claimant produced a report documenting the irregularities in the company and it was provided to the president of the union and eventually to the Office of the National Comptroller General (Comptroller), the government authority charged with investigating corruption in public agencies, and to the Attorney General's office (Fiscalia) who opened an investigation. Rumours of the corruption began to circulate in the community and XXXX eventually lost the XXXX election. The principal claimant was called in by the Comptroller to give a statement about the corruption. Following that he began to receive threatening phone calls telling him to keep quiet about the corruption. He eventually reported the calls to the Fiscalia but received no assistance. The principal claimant alleges that XXXX has ties with the criminal group XXXX XXXX and he believes this group was behind the threats. After receiving further threatening phone calls the claimants left Colombia.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] Having considered the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimants are not Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 as they have not credibly established that they face a reasonable chance of persecution in Colombia. In addition, they are not persons in need of protection under subsection 97(1) as they have not credibly established on a balance of probabilities, that their removal to Colombia would subject them personally to a risk to life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or to a danger of torture.\n[6] The determinative issue in these claims is credibility.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[7] The claimants' personal identities as nationals of Colombia are established on a balance of probabilities by their Colombian passports, copies of which are on file.2\nCredibility\n[8] A claimant's sworn testimony is presumed truthful unless there are valid reasons to doubt the veracity of their allegations.3 In assessing credibility, the panel took into consideration some of the difficulties that a claimant can face in the hearing room, including cultural factors and the stress inherent in responding to oral questions. The panel has also taken into account the claimants' level of sophistication, noting that the principal claimant studied XXXX for 5 years in Colombia although he did not complete the degree.\n[9] After considering the principal claimant's testimony in its entirety and the supporting documents, the panel finds that material aspects of the claim are not credible. The panel's findings are based on material inconsistencies and omissions in the evidence, and the testimony of the principal claimant at the hearing. The areas of concern are outlined below.\nParticipation of XXXX in the corruption at XXXX\n[10] The principal claimant signed his BOC on June 28, 2016. He further filed an addition to the narrative which was signed on August 18, 2016. In the first narrative the principal claimant states \"I began to hear rumours in the community and from some of my co-workers that my former supervisor at XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, was using her connections within XXXX in order to divert company resources in order to boost her campaign for the XXXX position in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. It was rumoured that she was diverting supplies to buy votes in the community....It was also rumoured that she was involved in a romantic relationship with the current XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, whose term was about to end, and who owned and operated a number of businesses in the area, and this was frequently in the newspaper.\"4\n[11] In the additional narrative the principal claimant states \"In mid-2015 I began to hear rumours that the former Manager at XXXX, Ms. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (who was a candidate running for XXXX for the XXXX XXXX the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX) was diverting supplies to buy votes in the community.\" Further, \"Shortly after, a police investigation into XXXX was reported in the local news and the relationship between my former supervisor, namely XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and those affiliated with her in the company came to light about how supplies were being diverted to boost her campaign.\"5\n[12] During his testimony the principal claimant stated that XXXX, who was the XXXX of XXXX XXXX at the time, was on the board of the company XXXX and that he was the one who was directing resources from the company to be diverted to benefit XXXX campaign. When asked if XXXX was in any way involved in the corruption at XXXX the principal claimant stated that she was not, as she was not with the company anymore. When it was pointed out to him that the BOC states that XXXX was responsible for diverting resources from the company, not XXXX, he stated that XXXX had been the beneficiary of the corruption, but that she did not have the authorization to divert resources from the company. It was also pointed out to him that he did not state in his BOC that XXXX was on the board of XXXX, or even associated with the company at all. He stated that XXXX was part of the company because he was XXXX XXXX the Board, and that he was the one responsible for diverting resources, but that it was done to benefit XXXX.\n[13] The panel does not find the explanations for these inconsistencies to be reasonable. In the original BOC narrative and the additional narrative the principal claimant has indicated that XXXX used her connections within the company to divert resources. This is in direct contrast to his testimony at the hearing, where he stated she was not directing the corruption, it was XXXX. His only explanation was that she was the beneficiary, and that she was no longer at the company and could not have directed the corruption. This does not explain why the claimant, who has formal legal training and who was assisted by an experienced counsel stated in both the original and amended BOC that it was XXXX who was responsible for the corruption, not simply the beneficiary.\n[14] The principal claimant does not say that XXXX was involved in the corruption at all in the initial nor the amended BOC, only that he was romantically linked with XXXX. The principal claimant's testimony that it was XXXX who benefited does not explain the complete absence in the claimant's narrative of the involvement of XXXX in the corruption scheme. When it was pointed out to him that he had not included XXXX's role in the company in the BOC, he simply reiterated that he was part of the company because he was XXXXof the Board and responsible for directing the diversion of the resources of the company. This answer, however, does not address the omission of XXXX's role in the company or his role in the corruption from the BOC. The panel would have expected that if it was XXXX responsible for the corruption, the principal claimant would have included that information in his BOC, particularly given that he was a high profile individual, as he was the XXXX of the city at the time of the alleged corruption. As the panel has not been provided any explanation for this omission, the panel finds the omission significantly undermines the principal claimant's credibility.\n[15] As a result of this inconsistency between the BOC and the testimony the panel finds the principal claimant's credibility is significantly undermined. The panel also concludes on a balance of probabilities that neither XXXX nor XXXX were involved in any corruption at XXXX, and that the principal claimant did not play a role in uncovering corruption at XXXX.\nXXXX XXXX, 2016 phone call\n[16] The principal claimant testified that he received a threatening phone call on XXXX XXXX, 2016, in which his family was directly threatened. The caller stated that they knew who his wife was and where his daughter studied. This call is not mentioned in his BOC or in the amendment signed August 18, 2016. The initial BOC states that he decided to report the threatening phone calls on XXXX XXXX, 2016, but no specific dates are given for any of the threatening calls, just that they began in XXXX of 2016. In the amendment the principal claimant refers to threatening phone calls in late XXXX of 2015, XXXX XXXX, 2015 and late XXXX of 2016. The principal claimant was asked why the XXXX XXXX phone call was omitted from the BOC and he stated that he made a mistake, that maybe he had omitted this particular phone call from the narrative because it was discussed in the Fiscalia report provided.6 The panel does not accept this as a reasonable explanation. The instructions to the BOC clearly state to \"include everything that is important for your claim. Include dates, names and places wherever possible.\"7 The principal claimant has a legal education and indicated at the beginning of the hearing that the contents of the forms had been interpreted to him and that the forms were complete, true and correct. He was assisted by an experienced counsel and was aware that amendments or correction could be made to the BOC as he had submitted an amended narrative.\n[17] Furthermore, the principal claimant testified that this was the call that finally made him seek out the assistance of the Fiscalia. This was clearly a significant event and its omission from the BOC undermines the claimant's credibility. The panel does accept that the claimant believed he did not have to include information in his BOC that was found in the supporting documents. The panel notes that the claimant has provided other documents that refer to incidents mentioned in the BOC, for example the request to attend the interview with the Comptroller and the reports he filed with the company about the corruption. His explanation that he did not think it necessary to include the XXXX XXXX call in the BOC is inconsistent with his own evidence.\n[18] The panel also notes that the Fiscalia report does not say that the caller knew who the principal claimant's wife was or where his daughter went to school. When asked why that information was not included in the Fiscalia report the principal claimant stated that he just wanted to establish a record of what had happened, but that he did not trust the Fiscalia as he feared that the criminal organizations might have infiltrated the Fiscalia, and so he did not want to give them too much information. The panel finds this explanation is not reasonable and is inconsistent with his actions. The principal claimant stated he went to the Fiscalia hoping for some assistance, but also that he did not fully trust the Fiscalia and so did not provide them all the details. He was unable to explain what assistance he was expecting if he did not provide a full account of the threats to the Fiscalia.\n[19] The panel noted that despite his testimony that he did not trust the Fiscalia and had given them only minimal information, he had provided the Fiscalia with his residential address and phone number. The principal claimant then stated that he had abandoned that residence after he made the Fiscalia report and gone into hiding at his parents' house. This information was not in the BOC and so the panel asked why that information had not been included in the BOC. The principal claimant stated he hadn't thought it necessary, that it was only for the last week before he left Colombia and that maybe it was a mistake not to include the information. The panel does not accept the explanation for this omission in his BOC. The principal claimant describes other steps he took as safety precautions after he reported to the Fiscalia, including pulling the minor claimant out of school and not leaving the home. The panel would therefore expect that all the precautions he took, including changing his residence, would have been included in his BOC.\n[20] The principal claimant's testimony about events surrounding the XXXX XXXX phone call and the report to the Fiscalia shifted and evolved in response to being confronted with inconsistencies and omissions. As a result the panel finds that the principal claimant's credibility is significantly negatively impacted and also finds on a balance of probabilities that the principal claimant did not receive a threatening phone call on XXXX XXXX, 2016, as alleged.\nOther threatening phone calls\n[21] In his initial narrative the principal claimant states that he began receiving threatening phone calls in XXXX of 2016. In the amendment to the narrative the principal claimant states he received a threatening phone call in late XXXX of 2015, one on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and the threatening calls continued in XXXX of 2016. The principal claimant was asked about the discrepancy between the two narratives and he indicated that he had only been in Canada a short time when he completed the first narrative, and that he was in shock and that he didn't provide all the details because he wanted to protect his family. The panel does not find this explanation reasonably explains the discrepancies. The principal claimant in his initial BOC stated he started hearing rumors that his life was in danger after the XXXX XXXX, 2015 election, and as a result he moved on XXXX XXXX, 2016, to a different location. He then says he began receiving threatening calls. In contrast in his amended BOC, the principal claimant states that the threatening phone calls began before he moved on XXXX XXXX, 2016. There is a significant difference between hearing rumors of a threat versus being directly threatened, and the panel would expect that the claimant would be able to recall whether or not he had received threatening phone calls prior to his moving to a new residence. In addition, the principal claimant does not explain how withholding information in the initial BOC would protect his family, especially since the withholding of the information could jeopardize his refugee claim.\n[22] The panel also questioned the principal claimant about the omission of those threatening phone calls from the Fiscalia report that he filed on XXXX XXXX, 2016. The principal claimant was asked if he had told the Fiscalia about all the threatening phone calls and he stated that he did not mention them, that he only mentioned the last phone call. He explained that he did not trust the Fiscalia and that filing the report was a last resort as he was desperate. When asked why he had only told the Fiscalia about the XXXX XXXX phone call, the principal claimant said that since he didn't have clear information or phone numbers for the other calls, and he was told to focus on the most recent call. He stated that he had told the Fiscalia about the other calls but that they had not put the other calls in the report. The panel notes that his explanation for the omission of the other phone calls in the XXXX XXXX report shifted. He initially stated he did not tell the Fiscalia about the other threatening phone calls, but then when he was asked why he hadn't told the Fiscalia about the other calls he stated he had told them, but since he didn't have the details, they had not included the information. The shifting testimony undermines the claimant's credibility. Furthermore, the Fiscalia report states, \"I have no evidence to contribute to the research since it was through one phone call.\" The principal claimant signed the police report and the panel would expect that if the information in the report was not correct, the principal claimant, a sophisticated individual with legal training, would have taken steps to ensure the information was correct. The panel does not accept the principal claimant's explanation for the omission of the other threatening calls from the police report, as a result of his changing testimony about what he told the Fiscalia.\n[23] The inconsistent information about when he received threatening phone calls, combined with the omission of other threatening phone calls in the Fiscalia report leads the panel to conclude, on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant did not receive any threatening phone calls and the panel places no weight on the Fiscalia report.\nIs anyone in Colombia still looking for him?\n[24] The principal claimant was asked if he had any reason to believe that anyone in Colombia was still looking for him. He testified that on XXXX XXXX, 2016, two armed men went to his parents' house looking for him. He testified that they identified themselves as members of the criminal group XXXX XXXX. In his amended narrative the principal claimant states that his father was visited by some men who were armed and asking about his whereabouts. He does not state that the men identified themselves as XXXX XXXX. When he was asked why the amended narrative did not include the information that the men looking for him were from XXXX XXXX, the principal claimant stated that maybe he had omitted that detail, but he believed it was obvious that it was the same people as those who had threatened him before. The panel does not find that explanation for the omission reasonable. The principal claimant in his BOC has discussed the rumors in the community that XXXX had ties with XXXX XXXX, but he does not state in the BOC that those who threatened him identified themselves as being members of XXXX XXXX. If the individuals who went looking for him had identified themselves as being part of XXXX XXXX to his father, the panel would expect that this would be highly significant given it was the first confirmation that it was XXXX XXXX who were behind the threats, and so the omission of that detail from the amended BOC undermines the principal claimant's credibility.\n[25] When asked if anyone had approached his father since XXXX XXXX, 2016, the principal claimant testified that 10 days prior to the hearing he received a message from his brother stating that he had been contacted by people looking for the principal claimant and he did not disclose where the principal claimant was as he would be killed. This information was not in the BOC, nor provided as an amendment prior to the start of the hearing. The principal claimant has provided no documents that corroborate this threat.\n[26] The principal claimant was asked if he had tried to obtain a letter or affidavit from his brother or father that described the threatening incidents, and he stated that he had wanted to get a Fiscalia denunciation, but the Fiscalia had not taken a denunciation from his father. He was asked if he had tried to get a letter from his father instead and he stated that he had not, that he didn't think it was necessary and that his father is old, is taking care of the principal claimant's mother and finds it difficult to move and so it wouldn't be easy for him. The panel finds the principal claimant's failure to make any attempts to obtain corroborative evidence from his father undermines his credibility. While the principal claimant's father may be old and may have limited mobility, the principal claimant has not explained how it would not be possible for his father to have at least provided a letter of support for him.\n[27] As a result of the inconsistencies and omissions related to the incidents after the claimants left Colombia, and the principal claimant's failure to take reasonable steps to obtain corroborative evidence, the panel finds that the principal claimant's family have not been approached by anyone looking for the claimants.\nSupporting Documents\n[28] The principal claimant has provided some internal correspondence from his employment with XXXX which document some irregularities that occurred at the company.8 None of those documents corroborate the principal claimant's allegation that the corruption was at the direction of XXXX or XXXX. Neither of those individuals is mentioned in any of the documents related to investigations into irregularities at XXXX. As a result, the panel places little weight on these documents.\n[29] There is an e-mail9 from an individual by the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX with the information that a date and time has been set for the principal claimant's voluntary deposition. While the date and time correspond to the principal claimant's testimony, the panel notes that there is nothing in the e-mail to verify it comes from the Comptroller's office. There is also nothing in the e-mail that describes what the voluntary deposition is related to. As a result the panel gives this document little weight.\n[30] The claimants have provided some news articles10 that confirm that XXXX did run for XXXX, but lost the election and that she was previously a manager at XXXX. None of the articles provided link either XXXX or XXXX to any corruption or irregularities at XXXX. One news article does state that there were allegations that XXXX diverted public resources to the campaign of XXXX, but the allegations in the article relate to an organization called XXXX XXXX XXXX, not XXXX. As such, these articles do not provide corroborative evidence that XXXX and XXXX were involved in corruption at XXXX and the panel places little weight on them to support the claimants' allegations.\n[31] In summary the documents provided are not sufficient to overcome the significant credibility concerns of the panel.\nCONCLUSION\n[32] The panel has found that the principal claimant was not the victim of threatening phone calls, that he is not still being sought by anyone in Colombia and that neither XXXX nor XXXX were involved in any corruption at XXXX. As a result, based on the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimants would not face a serious possibility of persecution in Colombia nor would they, on a balance of probabilities, be subjected personally to a risk to their lives, or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or to a danger of torture.\n[33] Their claims are therefore rejected.\n(signed)\n\"M.

The central allegations of the case appear as follows.\n[3] The claimant and her husband, XXXX XXXX, are members of the Hizmet or Gulen movement. Her husband was an educator.\n[4] The claimant's husband had plans to come to Canada to study. He left his home around XXXX XXXX, 2016, but due to the attempted coup in Turkey at that time, he was only able to leave Turkey around XXXX XXXX, 2016.\n[5] On August 10, 2016, the police in Turkey raided the claimants' home looking for Mr. XXXX as Hizmet followers were suspected of being members of a terrorist organization. The police broke many things and took the computer and many documents. Subsequently, the claimant's husband made a refugee claim in Canada which has since been accepted.\n[6] The claimant was living in the northern\/Turkish part of Cyprus and went to the Turkish embassy to renew her passport, which expires XXXX XXXX, 2017. The officials would not renew her passport and told her she had to do so in Turkey. She did not do so out of fear of being arrested.\n[7] On XXXX XXXX, 2017, the claimants left Turkey and arrived in the United States of America, where they did not make asylum claims. They subsequently entered Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2017 and have made refugee claims because they fear being arrested by the police in Turkey.\nDETERMINATION\n[8] For the following reasons, the panel finds that the claimants are not Convention refugees and not persons in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\n[9] Specifically at issue is whether the claimants, should they return to Turkey, are at risk at the hands of the Turkish government by reason of Mr. and Mrs. XXXXs involvement in the Hizmet movement.\nIdentity\n[10] The panel is satisfied that the claimants are citizens of Turkey based on copies of their passports.3\n[11] The panel is satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant's husband is Mr. XXXX and that they are the parents of the minor claimant, based on a copy of the minor claimant's Birth Certificate.4\nCredibility\n[12] Before making its credibility finding, the panel has considered that the claimant testified she has 5 years of elementary education, not the 24 years indicated in error when she made her claim.5 The claimants were represented by counsel. The claimant's husband has already navigated the refugee claim process with the same counsel as the claimants and has been accepted as a refugee.\n[13] At the beginning of the hearing, the claimant affirmed that the BOCs were true, complete and correct.\n[14] \"A refugee claimant's sworn testimony is presumed to be true unless there are reasons to doubt its veracity. In assessing a refugee claimant's sworn testimony, the Board is entitled to consider its plausibility, and to apply common sense and rationality. Where the evidence before the Board is inconsistent with the claimant's sworn testimony, the presumption of truth is rebuttable.\"6\n[15] The panel finds that this presumption has been rebutted. The panel had credibility concerns with regard to the claimant's allegations that she is a member of the Hizmet movement or that she would be perceived to be one. The claimant failed to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that she is a member of the Hizmet movement or that she would be perceived to be one. Furthermore, the panel also finds that the claimants do not have a serious possibility of a forward-facing risk of persecution as a result of the claimant's husband. Based on the facts alleged by the claimants, this finding is determinative in this claim.\nThe claimant failed to establish that she is a member of the Hizmet movement or that she would be perceived to be one\n[16] The claimant testified that she became involved with the Hizmet movement after she got married in September 2014. She joined because she had a sense of thanks towards the movement because her husband had received bursaries to participate in extra-curricular school programs. She was involved with the movement by doing fundraising bake sales and participating in religious discussion groups with others.\n[17] She also testified that she was working at a non-Hizmet-affiliated school until about a week before she left Turkey, and that she donated the school to a charity prior to leaving Turkey.\n[18] She also testified that she and her husband spoke about sponsorship but it was going to take up to 9 months and she had concerns about being able to leave the country after XXXX XXXX, 2017, which is discussed in greater detail below.\n[19] The claimant also testified she currently keeps in touch with her family in Turkey about once or twice a week, and that her brother is taking care of her house.\n[20] The only corroborative evidence submitted was the claimant's husband's positive refugee decision,7 which is not binding upon the panel. The claimant's husband was not called as a witness and his claim file was not disclosed, although these were both reasonably available to the claimants.\n[21] The panel asked the claimant if she had any evidence of her involvement with the Hizmet movement, to which she testified \"no.\" When asked why not, the claimant testified \"because we trust each other, we feel closer to God, we do not feel need to document this, we did not ask for such a thing because we are volunteers.\" When asked if she thought about asking the other individuals who participated in the bake sales and religious discussion groups for letters confirming the claimant's involvement in these activities, she testified \"not at this time, no, because everyone is kind of under surveillance right now and there is some among them that have been arrested as well.\" When asked for an example, the claimant testified \"my husband's coworkers that were working at same school, they released his wife but she is not allowed to leave the country, she is banned from leaving the country.\"\n[22] The claimant also did not provide any corroboration of the police raid. When asked why she did not, she testified \"no, I did not even think of anything like that, I was afraid.\"\n[23] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has not provided a reasonable explanation for not having any documents to corroborate her involvement in the Hizmet movement.\n[24] The claimant knew she was leaving Turkey permanently to make a refugee claim in Canada. These intentions are confirmed by her actions of donating the school, having her brother look after her house, and deciding against sponsorship from her husband. The claimant also knew her husband had been accepted as a refugee in Canada, and as a result, she would be familiar with the process and the need for documents given the instructions on the BOC form. Therefore, the claimant had an opportunity and several months to collect any corroborative evidence prior to leaving Turkey. In the alternative, once in Canada, she was represented by counsel, and she had the opportunity to request such evidence be sent from Turkey; however, she made no effort to do so. Evidence with regard to the claimant's Hizmet involvement goes to the core of this claim. The instructions on the BOC form clearly indicate that claimants are responsible for obtaining and providing to the Board any documents that may support their claim. Although she testified that her husband's co-worker's wife had been arrested and released, this does not explain why the claimant did not attempt to obtain any evidence from those with whom she volunteered and attended religious discussion groups. She also did not reasonably explain why she did not obtain any evidence from her family, since her brother is looking after her home and she is in touch with her family weekly.\n[25] The claimant was also examined with regard to why she did not list her membership with the Hizmet movement in the Schedule A8 when she made her claim. The claimant was previously asked about another document9 completed when she made her claim in which her education was incorrectly listed as 24 years. The panel accepted the claimant's explanation that it may have been written incorrectly and that she was not given an opportunity to review the document prior to signing it. However, with regard to the Schedule A, the panel first asked the claimant whether she still considered herself to be a follower of the Hizmet movement when she left Turkey, she stated that she did. The panel then began searching for the relevant document in the file in order to ask the claimant another question. Prior to the panel asking a question, the claimant testified \"my English is limited and I do not know what I filled out.\" The claimant was then shown question 9 on page 2 of the Schedule A10 and asked why she did not list her membership with the Hizmet movement. The claimant testified that she did not know why as she had said yes to this question. The panel then asked what exactly the claimant had said about this question, to which she testified \"I gave same answer I gave to you that I have been part of it for 3 years and I told them what I did as a member.\"\n[26] Although the panel previously accepted that there was a discrepancy in the forms with regard to the claimant's level of education, the panel does not accept the claimant's explanation with regard to the Schedule A as reasonable, on a balance of probabilities. The claimant testified she said yes to question 9; however, it is not a yes or no question. The question asks details about the name of the organization, activities, and the timing of the claimant's involvement. Had the claimant provided all those details when this form was completed, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that at least some of that information would have been indicated on the form. Moreover, the claimant's allegation that she discussed her Hizmet involvement at the time she made her claim is not reflected in any of the interview transcripts or notes,11 which only indicate that she and her child are making a claim because the police were looking for her husband.\n[27] Therefore, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has failed to establish that she is a member of the Hizmet movement.\n[28] The panel acknowledges that the objective country conditions evidence indicates that individuals who are perceived to be Hizmet followers can also be targeted by the authorities.12\n[29] The claimant testified that prior to the police raid on August 10, 2016, there was no risk to her and that she was not wanted by the police. When the police came, they came with a search warrant. She testified she was not hurt by the police in any way. After the day of the raid, the police never returned, the claimant continued to go to work until about a week before she left Turkey, and she testified she had no problems or threats made against her between the date of the raid and when she and her daughter left Turkey in March 2017.\n[30] Based on the claimant's testimony, there is no evidence to suggest that she was or would be perceived to be a Hizmet follower. The agents of persecution have not acted towards her in a way that indicates that they perceive her to be a Hizmet follower.\n[31] Therefore, the claimant has failed to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that she is a member of the Hizmet movement, or that she would be perceived to be one, and she has failed to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that her activities would come to the attention of the authorities in Turkey. Therefore, the claimants have not established that they face a serious possibility of being targeted by the authorities if they returned to Turkey.\nThe claimants failed to establish that they have a forward-facing risk of persecution\n[32] The claimants fear that they would be arrested in Turkey because the claimant's husband is wanted due to his Hizmet involvement.\n[33] The claimants rely on what they have heard from others in Turkey with regard to family members of Hizmet followers being arrested when the wanted individual cannot be found. They also rely on the objective country conditions evidence which confirms that this has occurred.13\n[34] Specifically, the claimant believes she and her daughter are at risk due to the following factors: the police could come back at any time and arrest her when they do not find her husband; she was not permitted to renew her passport; she could be arrested at the airport upon arrival in Turkey.\n[35] The panel finds that the claimants do not face a serious possibility of persecution based on any of these factors.\n[36] With respect to the police arresting the claimant, the panel refers to paragraph 29 above. The police already allegedly came to her home once, with a search warrant, and the claimant was not arrested. Thereafter, she lived in Turkey, in her same house, without incident, for approximately 7 months.\n[37] The documentary evidence confirms that \"Turkey is a constitutional republic with a multiparty parliamentary system and a president\" and that there was an attempted coup in July 2016 for which the Turkish government has blamed the Hizmet movement.14\n[38] In the present case, the police conducted a search of the claimants' home with a search warrant. The police knocked on the door, which the claimant answered. The claimants were unharmed, though some of their belongings were seized or damaged. Despite the lack of corroborative evidence, the panel accepts, on a balance of probabilities, that the police search happened as alleged. However, the panel finds that the events as alleged fail to meet the threshold of persecution as there is no indication the claimants experienced a serious violation of their fundamental rights.15\n[39] Although there is some evidence to suggest that the police could come back and the claimants could be arrested when Mr. XXXX is not found, considering that this did not happen in the 7 months prior to the claimants' departure from Turkey, and considering that they continued to live in the same house, and the claimant did not alter her day-to-day activities as she continued to go to work, the panel does not find that there is a serious possibility that the police will come back and that the claimants will be arrested.\nThe claimant alleges she was not permitted to renew her passport and could be arrested at the airport upon arrival in Turkey\n[40] The claimant alleges that she was not permitted to renew her passport.\n[41] For the following reasons, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant failed to establish that she could not renew her passport.\n[42] When examined about renewing her passport she testified she was unable to do so, \"they made difficulties for me when I was trying to renew it.\" When asked to elaborate, the claimant testified that she was afraid to go to Turkey because of what she had heard could happen to her since the police did not find her husband. So instead, she tried to apply through the Turkish embassy in northern Cyprus, but when she went there they created difficulty for her by saying she had to go to Turkey, which she did not do because she was afraid of being arrested.\n[43] The claimant did not provide any corroborative evidence to support her allegation that she was not permitted to renew her passport.\n[44] The documentary evidence indicates that the Turkish government has canceled passports of suspects and their spouses.16\n[45] The panel has already found that the claimant failed to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that she is a member of the Hizmet movement, or that she would be perceived to be one. The claimants were also able to exit Turkey on their own passports without any issues.17 Therefore, in light of the above, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the Turkish authorities have not demonstrated an interest in the claimants. Therefore, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has failed to establish that she could not renew her passport.\n[46] Finally, the claimant claims she can be arrested at the airport in Turkey. Again, the claimants were able to live safely in Turkey before and after the police searched their home, and they were able to exit Turkey on their own passports without incident. Therefore, the claimants' own experiences indicate that the Turkish government is not interested in them. Therefore, the panel does not find that there is a serious possibility that the claimants will be arrested at the airport upon arrival in Turkey. Therefore, the panel finds the claimants do not face a serious possibility of persecution in the future.\n[47] Having considered the totality of the evidence before it and given the concerns regarding the claimants' credibility and lack of forward-facing risk, assessed under both sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA, the panel finds that the claimant does not face a serious possibility of persecution in Turkey based on her political opinion and that the minor claimant does not face a serious possibility of persecution in Turkey based on her membership in a particular social group as her parents' child.\n[48] The panel therefore finds that there is insufficient credible or trustworthy evidence upon which to reach a positive determination under section 96 or subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\n[49] The claimants have therefore not satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, or that, on a balance of probabilities, they would be personally subjected to a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture upon return to Turkey.\nCONCLUSION\n[50] The panel concludes that the claimants are not Convention refugees and not persons in need of protection.\n[51] The claims are therefore rejected.\n(signed)\n\"I.

The claimant is 19 years of age and a citizen of Somalia. He left Somalia on XXXX XXXX, 2009 with his mother and siblings and went to Nairobi, living in XXXX refugee camp in Kenya. The claimant then moved to Nairobi to live with his cousin.\n[4] The claimant experienced discrimination as the people and the police in Kenya disliked Somali's due to Al Shabaab. In June 2014, someone stabbed the claimant in the thigh during a Kenyan anti-Somali refugee demonstration.\n[5] The claimant returned to Somalia on XXXX XXXX, 2015 to join his family. The claimant lived in XXXX and met up with friends. He told his friends of the problems he had due to Al Shabaab. The next day he received a telephone call from an unknown person who threatened him if he continued to talk about Al-Shabaab. The claimant returned to Kenya on XXXX XXXX, 2015. While in Kenya, he heard that the Kenyan government was planning to return persons to Somali. Fearing he was unsafe in Kenya, the claimant obtained a false passport and travelled to the U.S.A.\n[6] Due to Trump's ban on refugees and fearing he will be deported back to Somalia, the claimant travelled to Canada via Emerson on XXXX, 2017.\nANALYSIS\n[7] The determinative issues are credibility, identity and internal flight alternative.\nIdentity\n[8] The panel has considered the claimant's age, the difficulties for the claimant in having to utilize the services of an interpreter when considering the evidence. The panel finds that identity and credibility are linked.\n[9] The panel accepts that the claimant ethnically is Somalia, however the panel finds the claimant has not established that he has not obtained another nationality, such as Kenyan.\nSomalia\n[10] The panel finds the claimant lacks credibility as to the incident in 2015, allegedly that someone from Al Shabaab contacted him by telephone and threatened that he was acting as a spy for the Somali or Kenyan governments. The panel finds the claimant's statements of what occurred lack credibility and plausibility.\n[11] The claimant testified that he returned on XXXX XXXX, 2015 to Somalia on the fraudulently obtained passport. That he went out with some people he knew as a child, spoke negatively about Al Shabaab in Kenya to these friends and then was called a day later with a threat. First, the claimant's BOC narrative lacked details as to what occurred. He did not name the individual in the BOC but provided their names at the hearing. There was very little information other than he was considered a spy by the caller and thus would be killed.\n[12] The panel notes the claimant indicated in the BOC narrative that after he received the threats he decided to return to Kenya. At the hearing he testified that the elders told him that these individuals were the wrong individuals to speak with, the claimant also spoke with his mother and her friends about what occurred. The panel notes the BOC narrative is absent any information about speaking with other individuals. When asked about this, the claimant testified perhaps it is the way the story was put, it was in a different manner. The panel does not find this credible, as the instructions are clear to provide details. The fact that the elders told him that he spoke with those who are believed to be the \"wrong\" people is an important factor, particularly as the claimant alleges the call came from Al Shabaab. There was nothing provided by his mother or any of the people he allegedly conferred with as it relates to this incident. In light that the claimant had fled Kenya due in part to a fear of deportation and went to the U.S.A. months prior to this entry into Canada, the lack of corroborating information is not credible.\n[13] The panel finds the claimant embellished the information so that his claim would have merit. The panel does not find that the incident in November 2015 occurred.\nIdentity\n[14] Section 106 of the Act imposes a duty on the claimant to provide acceptable documents establishing the claimant's identity, including documents the claimant does not possess but can reasonably obtain. The claimant was given ample notice and opportunity to provide proper identity documents to establish his claim.\n[15] The Refugee Protection Division must take into account, with respect to the credibility of a claimant, whether the claimant possesses acceptable documentation establishing identity, and if not, whether they have provided a reasonable explanation for the lack of documentation or have taken reasonable steps to obtain the documentation.3\n[16] The claimant indicates he is from a noble clan, Hawiye, and is solely a citizen of Somalia, that he is not a citizen of Kenya, nor does he have the right of return to Somalia. The panel has considered the claimant's testimony and evidence, this include's Counsel's submission, however, the panel finds that the claimant has not established that he has obtained another nationality. The panel accepts that the claimant lived in Kenya prior to his entry into the U.S.A.\nPOE claim Canada\n[17] The claimant testified that he travelled to the U.S.A. on a fraudulently obtained Kenyan passport. In support of his identity as a Somali citizen he presented a letter from a relative and his mother's relative, whom he refers to as \"uncle\" who appeared as a witness.\n[18] At the port of entry the claimant made a claim against both Kenya and Somalia. When asked \"what country are you a citizen of\" his response was \"Somalia, Kenya.\"4 Further, when asked \"have you been recognized as a convention refugee in another country\" the claimant responded \"Kenya.\"5 When asked about the information, the claimant testified what he meant was that he was a citizen of Somalia but used Kenya documentation. The panel does not find this credible, the panel recognizes the claimant had entered Canada at Emerson, and that the interview was stressful but it is apparent that everything was explained to him. The panel makes a negative inference.\n[19] During the testimony the claimant asked for clarification in English to the question by the panel about his convention refugee status, he was cautioned to wait for the interpretation; the panel had to caution the claimant several times to wait for interpretation. This is an indication that he understood English; he further testified that the education he received in Kenya included the languages of Swahili and English. The panel notes that at the interview with Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), it appears the claimant told the officer he did not know what status he had while in Kenya, that he lived in the refugee camp, and that he did not think he had status in Kenya. The panel does not find the claimant credible about this lack of knowledge, he allegedly lived and went to school in Kenya, though a child when he entered, he had the ability to seek information prior to his departure and did not.\nKenya\n[20] The claimant states he lived in Kenya from 2009 and provided a written letter from \"XXXX XXXX XXXX School\" stating that XXXX XXXX XXXX was a pupil there from 2010 to 2015.6 The panel does not accept this letter as evidence of the claimant's nationality, it lacks details or a descriptor, the panel notes that the school letter makes no mention of the claimant's address, his citizenship, or even a school identification number. The claimant provided a picture of himself in a school uniform but this does not establish his nationality, only that he was attending school. The panel grants no weight to this letter.\n[21] The letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX identifies that he\/she was a cousin of the claimant who lived in Kenya, related to the claimant by his mother. The letter also states the claimant was living in Kenya from 2010 to 2016.7 The panel notes no identification was given by the affiant, nor was there identification. The panel notes the spelling error by the commissioner, with the word \"oaths\" misspelt. The panel does not accept this letter as evidence of the claimant's nationality.\n[22] The claimant was asked what documentation he had while living with his cousin in XXXX, he testified that he had a card from there but no one asked him for any documentation. When asked if he did not have documents issued from the refugee camp in 2009, the claimant testified no one asked him for any documents. The claimant alleges he is not a citizen of Kenya. The claimant was asked what his status was in Kenya and he testified that he did not know what his status was in Kenya as he travelled there when he was young. The panel accepts this explanation if the claimant had travelled to Kenya from XXXX and is the age he alleges, because then he would have been very young. However, he was an adult when he left Kenya, he was able to get letters from the school and his cousin The claimant could have sought information from his mother about their status in Kenya, whom he had visited in Somalia in 2015, or from the Kenyan authorities but he did not. The panel makes a negative inference.\n[23] The panel notes that after the claimant made the claim in Canada he was provided a claimant's kit with the following instructions in the claimant's guide:\nYou must give the RPD documents that support your claim. Therefore, you should begin gathering evidence to support your claim as soon as possible.\nYou must show the RPD evidence of who you are by giving the RPD official documents with your name and date of birth on them (\"identity documents\"). For example, you can give a passport, national identity card, birth certificate, school certificate, driver's licence, military document, and professional or religious membership card.\nAlong with identity documents, you can submit other documents that you feel are relevant to your claim, including proof of membership in political organizations, medical or psychological reports, police documents, business records, news clippings, visas, and travel documents (airplane, train or bus tickets).\nIf you do not provide identity documents or other documents in support of your claim, you will have to explain at your hearing why you do not have them and show that you did everything to try to get them.\nYou are responsible for obtaining and providing any documents that may support your protection claim. You must make arrangements now to get these supporting documents without delay.\n[24] The panel finds not only was the claimant advised of the need to produce identity and other documents, certain requirements were outlined in bold letters. It was clear to the claimant that he was required to satisfy the board as to his identity, and the claimant failed to do so.\nXXXX XXXX\n[25] The claimant provided a letter from XXXX XXXX (Somali Multi-Service Centre). Dr. XXXX XXXX, Executive Director, writes this letter.8 In part, Dr. Gilao states that refugee claimants referred to them undergo a rigorous community verification assessment to verify their nationality and citizenship. This includes a written questionnaire in Somali and as an oral interview assessing language, background, geography, history, heritage and culture. Following the assessment, Dr. XXXX wrote \"Mr. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX DOB (XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX) he is Citizen of Somalia.\"9 [their emphasis].\n[26] The panel does not accept the claimant's identity based on the assessment of Dr. Gilao. While Dr. XXXX states that there is a rigorous assessment process before attesting to a client's identity, such as nationality and citizenship, he does not provide details of how he came to his conclusion. Having knowledge of a country's language, history, geography, etc., does not establish a person's identity or nationality. There are many people in Canada and elsewhere in the world who speak Somali, have knowledge of the history of Somalia and may even know districts in cities and towns in the country; but they are citizens of various countries including Canada and not nationals or citizens of Somalia.\n[27] Furthermore, having knowledge of such information does not establish the personal identity of a claimant, nor does it establish that the claimant does not have another nationality. Dr. XXXX does not indicate how he confirmed or verified the claimant's name or date of birth. He also makes no statement to indicate that there was any independent interview with anyone to confirm the facts as told by the claimant. While the panel can accept the claimant's ethnicity could be Somali, this letter does not establish his personal identity, nor does it establish his nationality, on a balance of probabilities.\nWitness\n[28] The identity witness, the claimant identified as his uncle, XXXX XXXX XXXX testified he met the claimant twice, both times in Kenya.10 The first time he met the claimant was in 2014, then again in 2016. The witness provided evidence he was in Kenya in 2016.11 The claimant knew the witness' wife who was living in Nairobi at the time. The claimant contacted the witness' wife while she lived in Nairobi. The witness made some errors, for example, he knew the claimant's father had died but indicated that he died in November 2015; the claimant indicated his father died in February 2015.12 However, the panel will accept that the witness met the claimant in 2016. However, the information provided by the witness does not lead to the conclusion that the claimant has not obtained another nationality, namely Kenyan. The details he provides are limited to the information provided by the claimant; he did not even know the claimant was in the U.S.A. from XXXX 2016. The panel does not find the witness to have sufficient knowledge of what status the claimant had or obtained while in Kenya.\nU.S.A.\n[29] Subjective fear is a necessary component of having a well-founded fear of persecution.13 A lack of the subjective element is in itself sufficient for a claim to fail according to several cases.14 The Supreme Court of Canada has established that both the subjective and objective components must be met.15\n[30] The claimant's explanation of fearing Donald Trump as the reason why he did not make claim in the U.S.A.. The panel does not find the claimant's explanation for not seeking protection reasonable. Failing to apply for refugee status or asylum where he could have is relevant to an assessment of his subjective fear and leads me to draw a negative inference. The reason he was fleeing Kenya was a fear of deportation, and although Trump had been elected, nothing had been established that he could not have sought asylum when he arrived in the U.S.A.. The panel makes a negative inference.\n[31] Further, the claimant alleges he travelled to the U.S.A. on a Kenyan passport, a fraudulent passport. He was granted entry on this passport and did not make an asylum claim there. When the claimant was asked for this passport, he testified that he destroyed it. When asked why he destroyed the passport, his explanation is not credible. He testified that he had seen others coming to Canada destroying their documents he did so himself prior to his entry into Canada. The panel does not find this explanation credible; the claimant had lived in the U.S.A. for several months and had no way of knowing that he would have made his way into Canada. The fact he destroyed the passport as he saw others doing it is not credible, particularly as the claimant alleges he obtained this passport in 2014, years before his travel to Canada or the U.S.A. The panel makes a negative inference.\n[32] The claimant alleges he stayed in New York for four days then travelled to Minneapolis and went to a mall. That he used the Wi-Fi connection in the mall to contacted to a friend that he went to school with in Kenya. This friend had left Kenya in 2012 and resettled in the U.S.A. The claimant had no idea that his status was in the U.S.A. The claimant contacted this person while at the mall, telling him he is in Minneapolis, this friend alleged picked him up at the mall and the claimant stayed there for several months. The claimant provided nothing from this friend to support this statement. The panel does not find the claimant credible as it relates to his travel to the U.S.A. and connecting with a schoolmate while in Minneapolis. When asked why he travelled to Minneapolis, the claimant testified it had a large population of Somalis and expected someone to help him. The panel finds the lack of detail about how he was able to locate the friend to lack credibility.\n[33] The panel finds that the claimant's failure to seek refugee protection in the U.S.A. goes to his subjective fear. The claimant arrived sometime in XXXX 2016 but did not come to Canada until XXXX 2017. The panel recognizes that the claimant allegedly had family in Canada and none in the U.S.A., but he delayed in coming to Canada and instead he remained in the U.S.A. until XXXX 2017, not having made a claim and allegedly on a fraudulent passport. The panel does not find these actions credible.\n[34] The panel finds these actions belie the claimant's stated fear of persecution, this greatly lessen his overall credibility. He was safe in the U.S.A. but he took no actions to seek protection for herself, nor did he immediately come to Canada. In the Ilie decision, the Federal Court held:\nThe tribunal was entitled to consider the applicant's failure to claim refugee status in other countries, and to consider how the applicant's evidence was to be weighed in light of that failure16\n[35] Similarly, in the Case of Assadi, the Court held:\nFailure to immediately seek protection can impugn the claimant's credibility, including his or her testimony about events in his country of origin.17\n[36]\nThe Court has found that failure to claim in the U.S.A., even if one were only to visit for a short period, suggests a lack of subjective fear. It is open to the panel to reject the witness's explanations for not claiming asylum in the U.S.A.18 A lack of evidence going to the subjective element of the claim is in itself sufficient for the claim to fail.19 The panel finds it reasonable for the claimant to have sought the protection of the U.S.A. if he genuinely feared for his life as he alleges and he went to the U.S.A. fearing for his life.\n[37] Identity was identified at the outset as a critical issue in the hearing. Identity is a determinative issue. The onus is on a claimant to prove his identity. This claimant has failed to establish his identity and failed to produce his passport. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that it does not establish his personal identity, nor his identity as a citizen of Somalia. The panel finds that the claimant has not established, on a balance of probabilities, that he is not a citizen of Kenya.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[38] In the alternative, if the panel were to accept the claimant is solely a citizen of Somalia, the panel does not find that the claimant would be at risk if he were to return to Somalia and live in XXXX. The concept of internal flight alternative (IFA) is premised on the principle that international protection is intended to benefit only those persons who are deprived of the protection against persecution normally expected from their own country. A claimant may have a well-founded fear of persecution for one of the relevant grounds in one part of the country. However, if there were another place, within that country, where they would have no such fear, it would be reasonable to expect them to relocate there.\n[39] In assessing whether a viable IFA exists, the Board is guided by the principles established by the Federal Court. If there is a safe haven within his homeland where the claimant could live without facing a risk under section 97 of the Act, there is an expectation that he should move there before seeking refuge in Canada. The only exception to this would be if the claimant can show that it is objectively unreasonable to do so.20 The IFA must be realistic, attainable and accessible and must not expose the claimant to greater danger or undue hardship. The claimant may not reject an IFA for frivolous reasons, for not having family there, or for being unable to find work in that city.21 By definition, if a viable IFA exists, the claimant is not a refugee or a person in need of protection.\n[40] The leading case on IFA directs the Board to use a two-pronged test when considering an IFA.22 First, the Board must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that no serious possibility of persecution exists, or, in this case, that the claimant would not be subjected personally, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture, in the part of the country where the IFA exists.23 Secondly, the Board must be satisfied that it is not objectively unreasonable, considering all of the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for the claimant to seek refuge there. The claimant bears the burden of proof to show that, on a balance of probabilities, the harm under section 97 would exist throughout the country and specifically in a named IFA.24\n[41] As noted above, the panel does not find the incident of November 2015 occurred. Thus, the panel does not find that Al Shabaab would be actively seeking him as he alleged. The panel notes the claimant is of the noble clan, Hawiye. Nothing was adduced to indicate that the claimant would experience persecution due to his clan status. The panel does not find that the claimant would be persecuted in XXXX as he alleged.\n[42] The panel notes the claimant and his witness testified that the claimant has family living in XXXX, with the uncle allegedly returning to Somalia for months at end. The claimant has the minimum of his mother and siblings living in XXXX. Nothing was adduced from his family members to indicate they have been a target of Al Shabaab or other issues related to security in XXXX.\n[43] The panel notes that Al Shabaab does not have control of the XXXX area, and that they operate clandestinely, however the panel also notes that Al Shabaab in XXXX does not generally target the general population but targets politicians, journalist, police and security forces.25 While the claimant alleges he would be perceived as being anti-Al Shabaab, the documentary evidence does not support that he would be, particularly as the panel does not find the claimant credible as it relates to the alleged threats by Al Shabaab. Thus, the only thing is that the claimant lived outside of Somalia could be perceived as westernized. Again, the documents indicate that in Al Shabaab controlled areas this would be a problem, however this is not the issue in XXXX. Thus, the panel finds the claimant would not be targeted either by Al Shabaab as a \"government spy\" as he alleged or for other reasons, such as being \"westernized\" or a youth.\n[44] As a majority clan member with family in XXXX, the panel finds the claimant could return and live in XXXX with his family, his mother and siblings. He could seek protection from not just his immediate family, but due to his clan membership, he could seek the protection of the clan. The panel notes his witness testified to returning to Somalia, to XXXX, on a Canadian passport and residing there for months. Nothing indicated that he had any difficulties or threats while in Somalia.\n[45] Nothing was presented to indicate that the claimant could not seek employment or does not speak the language. Given the fact that his family appears to reside there, the panel does not find that the claimant has established that he could not find employment or housing XXXX. I note that the claimant was young when he left Somalia to travel to Kenya but he is no longer a child and would have the support of his family if he so needed it. There would be many job opportunities especially as the claimant now has experience of education abroad, and seems to be multi-lingual. He has demonstrated he is independent and resourceful by his moving to another culturally diverse country. Furthermore, the panel does not find it would be objectively unreasonable or unduly harsh to expect the claimant to return to XXXX.\n[46]\nBased on the evidence before the panel, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that those he fears do not have the interest, motivation means or resources to pursue him in Somalia. I find that those whom he fears would not spend the time, energy and resources for the fruitless surveillance in search of him.\n[47] The panel concludes that there is no a serious possibility of persecution in Somalia, or, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant would face a risk to life, or a risk of cruel or unusual treatment or punishment in Somalia today. Further, the panel is satisfied that it would not be unreasonable, in all of the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for him to seek refuge in Mogadishu. The finding regarding IFA is applicable to both sections 96 and 97(1) of the Act.\nCONCLUSION\n[48] Having considered all the evidence in this case, and based on the foregoing analysis, the panel concludes the claimant not to be a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. This claim is therefore rejected.\n(signed)\n\"B. Lloyd\"\nB.

She stated that she received a death threat in November 2015 from a person whose identity was unknown to her. She fears being killed by the person who threatened her. She fears being raped should she return to Haiti.\n[2] The claimant left Haiti on XXXX XXXX, 2016, to go to Florida in the United States. She arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2017, and she claimed protection at the port of entry. She stated that she would not receive her country's protection and that there is no safe place for her anywhere in Haiti.\nIDENTITY\n[3] The claimant's identity was established through her testimony and her Haitian passport.1 The panel is satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, as to the claimant's citizenship and identity.\nFEAR\n[4] The claimant fears people whose identity she does not know. The person who allegedly threatened her by telephone never repeated that threat in the 13 months, from November 2015 to December 2016, that the claimant apparently spent in Haiti after receiving that threat. On a balance of probabilities, the person who threatened the claimant did not know the claimant's address, as that person never went to the claimant's home to act on the threat or make another.\n[5] The risk that the claimant would face if she were to return tomorrow to Haiti is therefore, in her words, that she would be killed or sexually assaulted.\nCREDIBILITY\n[6] The claimant was always consistent in her testimony. According to both her Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form) and her testimony, she fears the threats uttered by strangers. The claimant's testimony lacked subjective fear.\nSUBJECTIVE FEAR\n[7] The claimant left Haiti on XXXX XXXX, 2016. The claimant stayed in the United States of America from XXXX XXXX, 2016, to XXXX XXXX, 2017, that is a period of 44 days.\n[8] The panel asked the claimant why she had not applied for protection in the United States. She explained that Canada is different from the United States and that Canada cares more about foreigners than the United States. No objective evidence was presented to substantiate these allegations. The claimant clearly stated that she imagined this was the case, without knowing whether her speculation was true or not. She feared that she could not stay in the United States when her visa expired in XXXX 2017. She agreed with the panel's suggestion that she could have stayed longer in the United States if she had submitted an application for asylum.\n[9] The designated representative, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, is also the claimant's aunt. The designated representative testified. The designated representative acknowledged that she played a part in the decision to have the claimant come to Canada from the United States. The panel asked her why the claimant had failed to apply for asylum in the United States. The designated representative stated that the United States does not grant asylum. That statement is completely false. The United States of America is one of the signatories of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees of 1951. The panel then asked what she was basing her opinion on. The designated representative acknowledged that she, herself, had been refused asylum in the United States and that her opinion was based on this sole incident. The panel drew a negative inference as to the designated representative's credibility.\n[10] Subjective fear is an essential element in establishing a well-founded fear of persecution. The purpose of the Geneva Convention is to help people who need protection and not to assist people who quite simply prefer applying for asylum in one country over another. The Convention and the Immigration Act must be interpreted with their genuine objective in mind.\n[11] It is reasonable to expect a person who fears for her life to obtain the appropriate information on the possibility of applying for asylum in the first safe country where she sets foot. Having failed to submit an application for asylum in the United States, the claimant then left the United States of America and came to Canada, a country for which she had no visa to enter or stay, after a delay of 44 days. It is not only the fact that she did not apply for asylum in the United States, which is determinative in the eyes of the panel, but also the fact that the claimant could not provide a satisfactory explanation for not requesting the protection of a country that had granted her a visa and where she had registered for school.\n[12] The panel appreciates that this is a young woman with an education that does not go beyond high school. This young woman relied on the counsel and advice of her cousin in Florida and her aunt in Canada.\n[13] Subjective and objective fear are crucial elements for a claim to have a positive outcome. In Kamana,2 Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer insisted on the subjective aspect of the fear:\n[10] The lack of evidence going to the subjective element of the claim is a fatal flaw which in and of itself warrants dismissal of the claim, since both elements of the refugee definition-subjective and objective-must be met.\n[14] In failing to submit an application for asylum in the United States, the claimant demonstrated, according to the panel, that she did not have a subjective fear. She allegedly learned that Canada accepted refugees; it can therefore be stated that she was asylum shopping rather than seeking emergency protection. Asylum shopping is incompatible with the surrogate dimension of international refugee protection.\nThe principal Applicant clearly testified that they had the option of seeking asylum in the United States, but chose not to do so because their chances of success were much greater in Canada. This testimony supports the finding that the Applicants' refugee claims are based on a desire to immigrate to Canada and not on a well-founded fear of persecution.3\n...the fact remains that the U.S. has ratified the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, and there is no reason to believe it does not abide by its obligations. The fact that the rate of successful applications may be lower there than in Canada does not justify the applicants' failure to seek refugee protection in the U.S. The Board could certainly take that factor into consideration in assessing [the claimant's] subjective fear4\n[15] The panel finds it is unreasonable that the claimant did not try to obtain asylum in the United States, knowing that she had no assurance that her claim would be allowed in Canada. A claimant who has an honest fear of returning to Haiti should have applied for protection in the United States, especially when, in this case, the claimant had a cousin in Florida who was prepared to take her in.\n[16] The claimant is unable to identify the person who threatened her by telephone, nor does she know the exact reason for the threat. The claimant is therefore unable to indicate which of the five Convention grounds on which her fear is based: race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. The panel will nevertheless proceed with the analysis related to membership in the particular social group of Haitian women likely to be sexually assaulted.\n[17] In Josile,5 Justice Martineau states that all factors relevant to the personal situation of claimants must be considered by the Board. In examining the documentary evidence on Haiti, it is clear that this country is still facing considerable difficulties in terms of the humanitarian situation, human rights and security.\n[18] A recent report from the Human Rights Center at the University of Berkeley reports the following:\nThe UN, US Institute of Peace, Human Rights Watch, and others attributed lack of security within camps to increasing women's vulnerability to sexual violence. Other factors increasing vulnerability include insufficient lighting, insecure housing, isolated bathrooms and showers, limited access to food and water, flimsy tent doors, separated families, anonymity among people in the camps, \"a lack of effective law enforcement, and limited knowledge of and access to health and economic services.\"6 [footnotes omitted]\n[19] Women for whom the risk of sexual assault is high include women who are homeless, alone, separated from their families and who have very little or no access to health care services. The claimant in this case was living safely with her grandparents, was the subject of an isolated threat, and did not lack the basic necessities.\n[20] Regarding the situation of women in Haiti, the panel finds that the Federal Court's principles in Dezameau apply in this case.\nThis is not to say that membership in a particular social group is sufficient to result in a finding of persecution. The evidence provided by the applicant must still satisfy the Board that there is a risk of harm that is sufficiently serious and whose occurrence is \"more than a mere possibility\". 7\n[21] In the claimant's case, the mere fact of being a young Haitian woman is not enough to satisfy the Board that her fear, thoroughly examined, passes the threshold of the mere possibility of violence by reason of the victim's gender.\n[22] The panel therefore concludes that the particular circumstances of the claimant would not result in more than a mere possibility of her being the victim of persecution in Haiti simply by virtue of the fact that she is a woman. These risks are instead inherent to women who are described as being more vulnerable, particularly those living in tents in camps.\n[23] The panel, which took into consideration Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution, is sensitive to the situation of women in Haiti and considered the recent case law from the Federal Court in Josile and Dezameau, as well as the documentary evidence on Haitian women. Rape is clearly an act in which acute physical and psychological pain and suffering are intentionally inflicted on a person. The rape of Haitian women is often a ground of discrimination against women.\n[24] The panel therefore concludes that the claimant is not in a personal situation that would put her at risk of persecution as a woman should she return to Haiti, in light of the case law and the documentary evidence, and therefore, there is no serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted owing to her membership in a particular social group, women, under section 96 of the Act.\n[25] The panel finds that the link between this anonymous statement and the assaults has not been credibly established. The panel therefore finds that the claimant is not a \"Convention refugee\" on the ground of her membership in the particular social group of women.\nAnalysis of risk under subsection 97(1) of the Act\n[26] In Portillo v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration),8 Madam Justice Gleason of the Federal Court rules as follows:\nIn my view, the essential starting point for the required analysis under section 97 of IRPA is to first appropriately determine the nature of the risk faced by the claimant. This requires an assessment of whether the claimant faces an ongoing or future risk (i.e. whether he or she continues to face a \"personalized risk\"), what the risk is, whether such risk is one of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment and the basis for the risk.\n[27] The panel finds that the risk that Ms. XXXX could face does not represent a significant personal risk. The panel is relying on the following facts:\n- the claimant does not know the name or identity of the person who threatened her;\n- the claimant was not threatened by someone who knew her name;\n- the claimant's grandparents, with whom the claimant lived, were never threatened;\n- the claimant never complained to her grandparents or to the Haitian police;\n- there was no additional contact with the claimant after the threat she received in November 2015, until her departure from Haiti in XXXX 2016.\n[28] Regarding paragraph 97(1)(b) of the Act, namely, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a risk to the claimant's life, the onus is on her to establish that the risk she faces is not a risk generally faced by other Haitians. However, she did not meet her burden in this respect. From the small amount of testimony that the claimant gave, the Board cannot conclude, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant would be subjected to a danger of torture, a risk to her life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if she had to return to her country.\nCOUNSEL'S SUBMISSIONS\n[29] Counsel argues in her submissions that there is a connection between the murder of the claimant's father, XXXX XXXX XXXX, in 2003, and the anonymous threat made against the claimant in 2015. Yet, it can be noted in the account that the statements made by the person who made the anonymous call made no reference to the murder of the claimant's father. It is mere speculation to try to establish a connection between a telephone call in 2015 and an incident that took place in 2003, without any supporting evidence.\n[30] In her submissions, counsel for the claimant wanted to refer to the document at Tab 6.3 of the National Documentation Package, which indicates that violence against women is systemic in Haiti. The document in question states that violence in Haiti is directed at bisexuals and lesbians in particular, but the document in question does not address the risks that exist for women in general.\n[31] In her submissions, counsel for the claimant tried to draw the comparison with other Haitian women who had allegedly received threatening texts. According to the World Organisation Against Torture, an assistant responsible for the R\u00e9seau national de d\u00e9fense des droits humains [national network for the defence of human rights] was allegedly targeted in March 2017.9 According to Amnesty International, members of the KOFAVIV organization allegedly received threatening messages by text and by telephone.10\n[32] What is missing in the submissions is a connection between these women and the claimant. In the cases cited, they involve women publicizing and defending women's rights in Haiti. The claimant cannot identify with those women, other than stating that she is of the female gender. The women cited in the articles are activists with a profile that would make them known, recognized and targeted because of their profile in Haiti. The claimant does not have a similar profile. The panel sought to compare the claimant with individuals in a situation similar to that of the claimant. The claimant was unable to provide a risk specific to her.\n[33] The panel also noted statements by the Supreme Court of Canada, set out in Ward, as follows:\nA further holding of the Ward decision is that a particular social group cannot be based solely on the common victimization of its members. A group is not defined solely by common victimization if the claimant's fear of persecution is also based on her gender, or on another innate or unchangeable characteristic of the claimant.11\n[34] In this case, the claimant was not threatened by individuals who were known to her. She was not living in a tent. She was not targeted by a gang of criminals, nor was she threatened with rape. Her fear of rape may be subjectively very strong, but the objective basis of her fear is weak and speculative.\n[35] Therefore, even though the claimant is a member of a particular social group, that of Haitian women at risk of rape, the claimant's case is one in which the occurrence of a risk of harm is a mere possibility. In other words, the claimant cannot cite by the mere fact of being a Haitian woman that she is likely to be the victim of future sexual assault or violence.12\nCONCLUSION\n[36] After analysis of all the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant did not meet her burden of establishing that there is a \"serious possibility\" that she would be persecuted on one of the Convention grounds. She also failed to demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that should she return to Haiti, she would be personally subjected to a danger of torture, a risk to her life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\n[37] For all these reasons, the panel determines that the claimant is not a Convention refugee, or a person in need of protection, and the Refugee Protection Division rejects her refugee protection claim.\n(signed)\nR.

They are both citizens of Mexico. They are seeking refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[2] The principle claimant served as the Designated Representative for the minor claimant.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The details of these claims are set out in the principle claimant's Basis of Claim form. To summarize, the minor claimant's father who is also the principle claimant's estranged husband worked as a taxi driver in Mexico. In September 2015, members of Los Zetas demanded that he work for them as a driver. They threatened that if he did not comply, they would harm his son and his estranged wife.\n[4] The principle claimant and her son fled Mexico in XXXX 2016. The principle claimant's estranged husband remains in Mexico. The claimants fear that should they return to Mexico, they would be kidnapped by Los Zetas due to the principle claimant's estranged husband's failure to comply with their demands.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] The panel finds that the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection pursuant to sections 96 or 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act for the following reasons.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[6] The claimants established their identities as citizens of Mexico by way of the certified true copies of their genuine Mexican passports.1\nCredibility\n[7] The principal claimant's testimony was at times indirect. She was reminded on a few occasions to answer the question that was posed to her. However, she made no apparent attempts to seriously embellish her testimony except when leading questions were asked by her counsel concerning internal flight alternative and state protection. There were no major inconsistencies or contradictions inherent in her testimony. The panel has no serious reason to doubt for the most part the truthful nature of the principle claimant's sworn testimony.\nSection 96 Analysis\n[8] With regard to nexus, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants' fear cannot be linked to one of the five Convention grounds. The claimants fear acts of criminality at the hands of a criminal gang. The panel finds that although these claimants may have been targeted because of their familial relationship to the primary target, the principle claimant's estranged husband, the primary target was not targeted for one of the five convention grounds. One might argue that the primary target's profession as a taxi driver places him in a particular social group however Ward is very clear that unless a person's profession in an integral part of their identity, it is reasonable to expect that they would leave that profession in order to avoid persecution. The panel does not find the primary target's profession as a taxi driver to be an integral part of his identity. In fact, the principle claimant testified that since July 2016, her estranged husband is no longer employed as a taxi driver but rather he does work as an electrician as he did possess skills in that trade.\n[9] As per case law in Zaidi,2 \"When the primary victim of persecution does not come within the definition of a \"Convention refugee,\" any derivative refugee claims based on family group cannot be sustained (Rodriguez v. M.C.I., [1997] F.C.J. No. 1246 (F.C.T.D.) ...\"\n[10] The panel finds that the primary victim of persecution (the principle claimant's estranged husband) was a victim of common or organized crime in Mexico. That being so, these derivative claims must fail under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act due to a lack of nexus and instead will be assessed under section 97.\nSection 97 Analysis (Generalized Risk)\n[11] In order to accept this claim under section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the panel must find that the claimants face a personalized risk in Mexico as opposed to a generalized risk.\n[12] Based on the documentary evidence,3 the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that there is a generalized risk of crime and violence in Mexico at the hands of criminal organizations. However, although there is no evidence to suggest that the principle claimant's estranged husband was initially targeted for an individualized reason, these claimants before me were specifically targeted because of his failure to comply with their demands. The panel finds that these particular claimants now face a personalized risk to their lives that is not faced generally by others in Mexico. As such, these claims do not fail based on generalized risk.\n[13] Whether assessed under section 96 or 97(1) these claims fail on the issues of state protection and internal flight alternative.\nSTATE PROTECTION\n[14] Refugee protection can only be properly sought after a claimant has first sought the protection of her own state. There is an underlying presumption that a state, unless in complete breakdown, can protect its citizens. It is however open to a claimant to rebut that presumption by presenting clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.\n[15] In this particular case, the principle claimant concedes that she did not go to the police in Mexico for protection before seeking international protection. She indicated that she did not believe that the police in Mexico could protect her from Los Zetas. She further stated that she spoke with a friend who works with those who have made reports to the police. She stated that she was told by her friend that although she could make a report to the police, there would be \"no guarantee\" that the police could provide her with security.\n[16] The Federal Court of Appeal in Villafranca held that the protection offered by a state to its citizens need not be perfect, but that the state must undertake serious efforts to protect its citizens. In other words, no state can guarantee protection. The state need only be willing and able to provide adequate and effective protection.\n[17] The principle claimant was asked what she thought would happen if she went to the police for help. She testified that she thought that for example, if she did not feel safe in her home, that the police would patrol the areas near her home. The panel finds that the principle claimant herself concedes that the police would have acted on a complaint had she made one.\n[18] The panel concedes that there is a high rate of crime in Mexico as previously stated. The panel also concedes as per the documentary evidence4 that corruption exists within the Mexican police force. However, the panel notes that the Mexican government is making serious efforts to punish and thus deter such corruption.\n[19] The documentary evidence talks extensively of police officers and other officials being punished for their involvement in acts of corruption. For example, between 2008 and 2011, 6,500 police officers were fired in the Federal District, 70 percent of them for acts related to corruption.5 The Mexican government introduced new legislation in January 2009 that created new procedures to investigate police personnel and to make it easier to fire corrupt officers.6\n[20] If a claimant does not approach the authorities in his or her country, it must be shown that it would have been objectively unreasonable for her do so. A claimant cannot rebut the presumption of state protection in a functioning democracy by asserting only a subjective reluctance to engage the state.\n[21] The 2016 U.S. DOS Report7 tells us that Mexico is a multiparty federal republic with an elected president and bicameral legislature. Civilian authorities generally maintained effective control over the security forces. The federal police, as well as state and municipal police, have primary responsibility for law enforcement and the maintenance of order. The panel finds that it was incumbent upon these claimants to seek local protection before seeking international protection.\n[22] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that these claimants have not rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence. The panel therefore finds that state protection would be available to these claimants should they return to Mexico and seek it.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[23] Alternatively, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that a viable internal flight alternative exists for these claimants in Cancun. In considering a potential IFA the panel must apply a two-pronged test. First, the panel must be satisfied that there is no serious possibility of persecution or risk of harm in the proposed IFA. Second, the panel must consider whether it would be reasonable, in all of the circumstances, for the claimants to seek refuge there.\n[24] With regard to the serious possibility of the claimants facing a risk in Cancun, the panel notes that the principle claimant's estranged husband, who is the primary target of Los Zetas, is currently residing in Cancun and has been residing there for over nine months, since July 2016. The principle claimant testified that no harm has come to him in Cancun. The primary target no longer works as a taxi driver as previously mentioned but does do work as an electrician. In addition, the principle claimant testified that her estranged husband sent documents to her by going to a public internet caf\u00e9 and asking those with computer knowledge to help him scan his letter outlining the problems he was having with Los Zetas to be emailed.\n[25] The panel finds that if Los Zetas were motivated to find and harm the primary target, they would have done so by now. The panel finds that Los Zetas either lack the means to find the primary target and hence these claimants in Cancun or lack the interest. The panel finds that there is no serious possibility that these claimants would face a risk in Cancun at the hands of Los Zetas.\n[26] With regard to the second prong of the test, in her submissions, counsel stated that as a single woman travelling alone with a child, it would be unreasonable for the principle claimant to relocate to Cancun. However, the panel notes that the principle claimant was a single woman alone in Veracruz. She worked to support herself and her child as a XXXX salesperson. Although she limited her activities after the threats were received, she continued to work until it was \"nearly time\" to leave Mexico. The principle claimant conceded that her profession as a XXXX salesperson is a profession that can be performed anywhere in Mexico.\n[27] The panel notes that the principle claimant's sister-in-law and aunt of the minor claimant resides in Cancun. The panel finds that the minor claimant can be registered in school in Cancun. As previously stated, there is no indication that Los Zetas are interested in harming these claimants as they have not shown an interest in harming the primary target who resides in Cancun today.\nCONCLUSION\n[28] The panel therefore finds that the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection pursuant to sections 96 or 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act as adequate state protection would be available to them in Mexico and a viable internal flight alternative exists for them in Cancun. The Refugee Protection Division therefore rejects these claims.\n(signed)\n\"M. Dookun\"\nM. Dookun\n\"May 12, 2017\"\nDate\n1 Exhibit 1.\n2 Zaidi, Syed Tabish Raza v. M.C.I. (F.C., no.

They seek refugee protection against Saudi Arabia pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nAllegations\n[2] This claim was based on the following allegations. The claimants are stateless Palestinians who have lived in Saudi Arabia their entire lives. The claimants are a family of three, a husband, wife, and daughter. The claimants allege persecution on two grounds. First, as stateless Palestinians in Saudi Arabia, the claimants face poor treatment and economic disadvantage. This was particularly demonstrated in respect of the husband's loss of his restaurant whereby a business partner named XXXX took advantage of the husband and expropriated his business. Secondly, the claimants are persecuted because on March 1, 2017, the wife was sexually assaulted by a police officer who thereafter threatened to kill her and her family. The claimants fled Saudi Arabia on XXXX XXXX, 2017 and entered the United States the next day. They entered Canada at Windsor on XXXX XXXX, 2017 and signed their Basis of Claim forms on May 5, 2017.\n[3] At the outset of this hearing, the claimants withdrew their claim for their daughter XXXX, who is an American citizen born XXXX XXXX, 2016.\n[4] The panel took into consideration The Chairperson's Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution when considering the process of the hearing and the facts in this case.1 All relevant factors, such as social and cultural context in which the principal claimant found herself, along with the issue of state protection and changing country conditions were examined with consideration of the Chairperson's Gender Guidelines.\nDetermination and Reasons\n[5] The identity of the claimants were established on the basis of their Palestinian Authority travel documents, the originals of which were seized by the Minister.\n[6] This claim is dismissed. This claim is not credible. The panel makes this determination for the following reasons:\na. The claimants failed to seek protection in the United States. This failure was not reasonably explained and demonstrated a lack of subjective fear, which is a determinative factor.\nb. The circumstances of the claimants' travel history and flight from Saudi Arabia further suggest that they were asylum shopping and that this claim was a long-premeditated plan to immigrate to Canada.\nc. The husband was not credible with respect to his termination from his employer.\nd. For these reasons, the panel does not find credible the claimants' allegations of risk owing to a rogue police officer, nor with respect to economic hardship as stateless Palestinians.\nAnalysis\n[7] The panel is satisfied that Saudi Arabia is the sole country of former habitual residence for these claimants, and therefore, the only country of reference for this claim.\n[8] The claimants failed to seek protection in the United States despite having a significant opportunity to do so, and despite their daughter being an American citizen.\n[9] In 2016, the claimants tried applying for Canadian visas (one was in March 2016, the other was in October 2016). One of those applications was at the beginning of 2016. The wife explained they were trying to come visit her maternal uncle. Those visa applications were unsuccessful. The claimants came to the United States in XXXX 2016. They testified that they were there for the purpose of vacation. They had no family in the United States. While they were in New York City, the wife gave birth to their daughter. The panel asked why the claimants would travel to the United States so close to giving birth. The wife explained it was not close to the due date. In fact, the child was premature by two months. The claimants returned to Saudi Arabia one week after the child's birth.\n[10] The claimants also explained that they sought protection in Canada because the wife's uncle lives in Canada.\n[11] The panel rejects these explanations. The circumstances strongly suggest that the claimants were in the United States for the sole purpose of securing western citizenship for their daughter. Their Canadian visa applications strongly suggest that they were trying to make Canada their daughter's place of birth. Given the medical complications that would likely arise from having a baby two months premature, it does not appear likely that the claimants could have returned to Saudi Arabia one week after the child was born. The panel has no medical records or evidence as to the child's condition or that she was premature, and without that evidence, the panel is not prepared to accept that the birth in the United States was an unexpected and unscheduled event as the claimants tried to convey. The balance of probabilities strongly suggests that these claimants' entry to Canada was a premeditated plan which had been planned many months in advance of this claim.\n[12] Further to that, the panel rejects the explanation that the claimants were in Canada because of the wife's uncle. The uncle lives in Montreal and the claimants are currently living in Mississauga. It makes little sense that they came to Canada to be with the wife's uncle if they are not residing anywhere close to him. The panel gives no weight, therefore, to the claimant's reasons for coming to Canada.\n[13] For these reasons, the panel finds that the claimants' failure to seek protection in the United States was not reasonable or credibly explained. The circumstances of their travel history to the United States and previous attempts to enter Canada undermine the integrity of this claim. The failure to seek protection in the United States is demonstrative of a lack of subjective fear, and the panel draws an adverse inference owing to that lack of fear.\n[14] Other circumstances surrounding the claimant's flight from Saudi Arabia further undermine these allegations.\n[15] For example, the alleged sexual assault occurred late in the evening of March 1, 2017, after the sun had gone down. The wife described that her husband was out of town, and it took him three hours to get home after he learned what happened. The husband's arrival home would likely have been in the early hours of March 2, if not extremely late on March 1.\n[16] Given these circumstances, the panel finds it lacks credibility, therefore, that the claimants' flight was booked on March 1, 2017. Much as the daughter's birth in the United States was no accident, the flight itself appears to have been a pre-meditated determination prior to the alleged incident.\n[17] The panel is further assured in that conclusion wherein the claimants had documentation issued prior to the alleged precipitating events. The wife obtained a letter from her University on February 21, 2017 confirming her attendance in 2012-2013. The wife explained that it was only issued recently because it takes time to process such things. The panel rejects this as an embellishment. Such an explanation might have an air of reality in respect of a diploma itself, but a letter is something that the wife would specifically request from the University. There is no apparent reason why the wife would have obtained such a confirmation letter from the University on that specific date except in anticipation of future use. It is an unlikely coincidence that the precipitating events for the flight arose only days later.\n[18] Further, the husband's narrative of his loss of employment is not credible. The claimants' re-entry visas to Saudi Arabia remain valid until 2018, and their residency permits remain valid until at least 2018. The husband provided no documentation to support that his employment has been terminated and that the family cannot return to Saudi Arabia. This is significant given that the husband worked in a sophisticated field for a sophisticated employer. He was an architectural engineer for a pharmacy company. (That was his main employment. His other business that had been expropriated was a restaurant). If the husband had been terminated from his employment, and his status in Saudi Arabia had been likewise terminated, therefore, the panel would reasonably expect to see proof of this. The panel draws an adverse inference owing to this lack of documentation.\n[19] For the reasons as outlined herein, the panel does not find that the claimants were reliable or credible witnesses. As outlined above, the panel finds there were significant embellishments, inconsistencies, and omissions in the evidence, which pervaded significant and central aspects of this claim. Given that, the panel places no weight in their testimony regarding the alleged sexual assault by a police officer. The panel finds that the credibility concerns outlined undermine the integrity of this narrative as a whole. The claimant's allegation that they were targeted by an agent of the state, a rogue police officer, is not credible.\n[20] On a balance of probabilities, the panel finds that the claimants do not face the harm that they allege, neither in respect of the police officer threatening to kill them, nor in respect of economic hardship as stateless Palestinians.\n[21] With respect to the expropriation of the husband's restaurant, the panel finds that this is an economic loss and would not form the basis of a refugee claim if it was found to be credible in any event. In respect that loss, there is no nexus to any Convention ground, nor is any person\/agent continuing to target or threaten harm such that section 97 of IRPA would be invoked.\nConclusion\n[22] For these reasons, the panel finds that the claimants fear is not well-founded. The claimants do not face a serious possibility of persecution in respect of their country of former habitual residence, being Saudi Arabia. The claimants are not Convention refugees. The claimants do not face a risk to their lives, nor a risk of cruel or unusual treatment or punishment, nor torture. The claimants are not persons in need of protection. This claim is dismissed.\n(signed)\n\"Daniel McKeown\"\nDaniel McKeown\nJuly 6, 2017\nDate\n1 Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution: Update, Guidelines Issued by the Chairperson Pursuant to Section 65(3) of the Immigration Act, IRB, Ottawa, November 25, 1996, as continued in effect by the Chairperson on June 28, 2002, under the authority found in section 159(1)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRPD.29.1 (August 31, 2012)\nRPD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SPR : TB7-08027\nTB7-08049 TB7-08060\n",

In sum, he alleges persecution in Sri Lanka as a result of his Tamil race.\nIDENTITY\nTHE CLAIMANT HAS ESTABLISHED HIS IDENTITY ON A BALANCE OF PROBABILITIES\n[3] I find that the Claimant has established his identity on a balance of probabilities based on the copy of his Sri Lankan passport on file forwarded to the Board by Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada, and based on the following original identity documents presented at the hearing: a Sri Lankan driver's licence, a Sri Lankan National Identity Card, a US Employment Authorization Card, a Californian driver's licence, a Californian Identification Card, and a US Social Security Card.\nDETERMINATION\nTHE CLAIMANT IS NEITHER A CONVENTION REFUGEE NOR A PERSON IN NEED OF PROTECTION\n[4] I find that the Claimant has not established that he faces a serious possibility of persecution in Sri Lanka as a result of his Tamil race because the evidence he presented that he will face this persecution is not credible. I also find that the Claimant has not established, on a balance of probabilities, that he would be subject to a danger of torture, or a risk to his life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment should he return to Sri Lanka because he has failed to present sufficient credible evidence to establish that he will face harm under section 97(1).\nDETERMINATIVE ISSUE\nCREDIBILITY\n[5] The determinative issue in this case is credibility, and delay and reavailment as it relates to credibility.\nANALYSIS\nInconsistent Evidence about how the Claimant Came to the Attention of Sri Lankan Authorities\n[6] The Claimant testified inconsistently about how he initially came to the attention of the police. When asked to explain this inconsistency, he was unable to provide a reasonable explanation. Instead, the Claimant gave ambiguous and convoluted answers. As a result, I draw a negative credibility inference regarding his allegation that he was persecuted in Sri Lanka.\n[7] He alleged that he first came to the attention of the police in 2013 because he helped relatives from the North resettle in Colombo. In particular, he was brought to the attention of the Sri Lankan authorities because of a man named \"XXXX\". According to the Claimant's Basis of Claim, he helped XXXX move from Jaffna to Colombo in 2009. In 2012-2013, while the Claimant was working on a ship, the Claimant's brother loaned XXXX a motorcycle, which XXXX took to Jaffna with him. On March 29, 2013, the police came to the Claimant's house to ask about XXXX and the motorcycle. The Claimant was then arrested and detained for three days. He alleges that during his detention, he was beaten and accused of being a member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).\n[8] The excerpt of the Basis of Claim relevant to helping XXXX move from Jaffna to Colombo reads:\nMost of my father's relatives have been [sic] living in the northern part of Sri Lanka. One of them is named XXXX XXXX After I was married, we became friends. He asked me to help him find accommodation for him and some of his family since living in Jaffna was dangerous. I found a house for them in Kotahena [Colombo]. I also helped them move in.\n[9] At the hearing, the Claimant stated that he did not help XXXX move from Jaffna to Colombo. Instead, he stated that he helped XXXX move within Colombo, from one neighbourhood to another. When asked about this inconsistency, the Claimant failed to provide a reasonable explanation and instead provided roundabout answers. The issue of XXXXs residence came up at the beginning of the hearing when the Claimant was explaining that he had tried to obtain identity documents for XXXX but could not. The Claimant stated that his family in Jaffna was asking around in Jaffna for XXXX's identity documents but could not find any. When asked why people would be looking in Jaffna for XXXX's identity documents when he lived in Colombo, the Claimant replied that he was told that XXXX was from Jaffna. When asked whether he helped XXXX move from Jaffna to Colombo, the Claimant stated that XXXX \"was already living in Colombo.\" When asked when XXXX moved from Jaffna to Colombo, the Claimant replied that he did not know but he met XXXX at his wedding. When asked why the Claimant testified that XXXX was already living in Colombo, the Claimant stated that XXXX was living in Belawatta, which is a neighbourhood of Colombo.\n[10] The Claimant alleged that his persecution began because of the help he gave to XXXX. I find that the Claimant failed to testify consistently about how he helped XXXX, and his failure to provide a reasonable explanation for this inconsistency negatively impacts the credibility of his allegation that he was persecuted in Sri Lanka.\n[11] I note that the Claimant's narrative from his I-589, Application for Asylum and Withholding of Removal from the United States presents a third version of these events. In his I-589, the Claimant stated that he helped one of XXXX's relatives to find housing in Colombo. The relevant excerpt reads:\nMost of my father's relatives have been [sic] living in the norther part of Sri Lanka. One of them is named XXXX. After I was married, we became friends. One day he asked me to give accommodations for one of his relatives to stay in Colombo, since living in Jaffna was dangerous.\nI found a house for them in Kotehena, Colombo. I also helped them move in.\nOmission of XXXX's Last Name from his Basis of Claim\n[12] The Claimant did not include XXXX's last name in his Basis of Claim. I find that this is a significant omission that detracts from the credibility of the Claimant. I find it significant because XXXX was the reason that the Claimant first came to the attention of the police. The Basis of Claim form clearly states that the Claimant should include dates, names and places wherever possible. The Claimant also had the benefit of experienced counsel's advice when preparing his Basis of Claim form. Moreover, I find that the Claimant's lack of reasonable explanation for why he omitted XXXX's last name detracts from the credibility of his allegation that he was persecuted in Sri Lanka.\n[13] At the hearing, the Claimant testified that XXXX's last name was XXXX. When asked why he did not include XXXX's last name in his Basis of Claim, the Claimant's responses were, once again, ambiguous and convoluted. At first, the Claimant responded that he only later came to know XXXX's last name. When asked for clarification, the Claimant stated that he learned XXXX's last name in 2013. Finally, the Claimant stated that he did not put XXXX's last name in his Basis of Claim by stating: \"Because of him I had all these troubles.\"\n[14] I find it unreasonable that the Claimant was not able to state clearly why he omitted XXXX's last name from his Basis of Claim. I also find his explanation that he omitted XXXX's name because he was the cause of the Claimant's troubles to be unreasonable. The fact that XXXX was the source of the Claimant's problems is the very reason that his full name should have been included in the Basis of Claim, not a reason for it to have been omitted.\nInconsistent Testimony about Fear of Persecution after his Second Arrest in June 2013\n[15] The Claimant testified inconsistently about his fear of persecution after his alleged second arrest in June 2013. In his Basis of Claim, the Claimant states that after his second arrest he went to work on a boat from XXXX XXXX, 2013 to XXXX 2014. He stated that when he returned in XXXX 2014, he went to live in Gampola because he was afraid the police were looking for him. At the hearing, when asked if he was afraid to encounter problems after his second arrest, he stated that he was worried about encountering problems at the airport upon his return to Sri Lanka in XXXX 2014. He later stated that he went to live with his uncle in Gampola after his return in XXXX 2014 because he thought his problems were over. When asked why he went to live in Gampola if he thought his problems were over, he stated he thought he might encounter problems. When asked why he just said he thought his problems were over, he stated that he thought his problems were over after his wife paid a bribe in June of 2013.\n[16] I find that the Claimant's ambiguous and roundabout answers to my questions regarding his fear of persecution after his second arrest undermine the credibility of his allegation that he fears persecution in Sri Lanka. I find that his lack of reasonable explanation for his inconsistent evidence regarding whether he was afraid of persecution after his second arrest and why he went to live in Gampola detracts from the credibility of his allegation that he was persecuted in Sri Lanka.\nImplausible Account of Arrest on October 11, 2014\n[17] The Claimant alleges that he was arrested at either the \"shipping ministry\" as it was described in his Basis of Claim form, or in the \"shipping centre\" as he described it during the hearing. The Claimant explained that he was attending the shipping ministry or the shipping centre to look for a job. During the hearing, the Claimant described that he would go to the shipping centre to look for jobs and that the whole process of looking for a job at the shipping centre took an hour at the longest, depending on whether a Crew Handling Manager was available to meet with him immediately or not. The Claimant testified that the place where he went to seek out jobs was a private company. The Claimant stated that while he was at the shipping centre on XXXX XXXX, 2014, four police came in, asked his name and then asked him to get in a Jeep. The Claimant stated that he did not know how the police knew he was there at the time.\n[18] I find this account of his arrest implausible. I find that there is no reasonable way for the police to know that the Claimant was at the shipping centre at the time that he was. The Claimant presented no evidence about how the authorities might have known that he was at the shipping centre at that time or why they would choose to apprehend him while he was there. I find that this account of his third arrest negatively impacts the credibility of his allegation that he was persecuted in Sri Lanka.\nDelay in Sri Lanka and Reavailment to Sri Lanka\n[19] The Claimant testified that he decided to leave Sri Lanka because of his persecution in 2014 after his third run-in with Sri Lankan authorities. However, he returned to Sri Lanka in June 2015 after six months of working on a boat. When asked why he returned to Sri Lanka, he stated that he did not have the facilities to go anywhere else and he did not know where to go. However, he had a valid visa to the United States since 2010. When he did leave Sri Lanka permanently in 2015, he first went to the United States. When asked why he did not go to the United States in 2014, he stated that it was because the Captain of his ship held his passport. The fact that his Captain withheld is passport is beside the point. I do not find that this is a reasonable explanation for his delay. In 2015, the Claimant stated that he found an agent to get him passage to the United States. There was no evidence presented as to why he could not have found an agent in 2014 to help him leave Sri Lanka. I find that the Claimant's reavailment inconsistent with a genuine fear of persecution in Sri Lanka and that it undermines the credibility of his allegation that he was being persecuted.\n[20] With respect to the issues of delay and reavailament, the Claimant also gave inconsistent testimony. The Claimant gave a second reason for returning to Sri Lanka in 2014. He stated that he did not want to live anywhere illegally. However, in 2015 he went to live in the United States illegally. I find that this further undermines the credibility of his allegation that he has a genuine fear of persecution in Sri Lanka.\nDelay in the United States\n[21] I find that the Claimant's delay in claiming refugee status in the United States undermines the credibility of his allegation that he fears persecution in Sri Lanka. The Claimant stated that he made plans to leave Sri Lanka because of his fear of persecution. The Claimant arrived in the United States in early XXXX 2015. He met the friend who told him about the refugee system the same month. However, the Claimant only signed his application for asylum at the end of March 2016.\n[22] I find this delay inconsistent with a genuine fear of persecution in Sri Lanka. The Claimant alleged that he had an intention not to return to Sri Lanka. By failing to claim refugee status, the Claimant chose to risk being deported back to Sri Lanka. I find that the Claimant's delay in the United States in claiming refugee status is inconsistent with a subjective fear of returning to Sri Lanka and that it undermines his allegation that he fears persecution in Sri Lanka.\nForward-Facing Risk\n[23] The Claimant alleges that if he returns to Sri Lanka, he will be stopped at or right outside the airport and put in jail or asked questions. However, he presented no evidence of why he believed this might be the case. To the contrary, the Claimant testified that the police have only come to search for him once, either after his first arrest in March 2013 or in 2014 (his testimony on this issue was inconsistent). As there is no evidence that the Claimant has been wanted by the police since 2014, I find that he is not wanted by the police should he return to Sri Lanka.\nRESIDUAL PROFILE\n[24] Having found that the Claimant is not credible regarding his past persecution, I must now consider whether the Claimant will face a serious possibility of persecution should he return to Sri Lanka because of his profile as a young Tamil male who has been living abroad and is returning as a failed refugee claimant.\n[25] I find that the Claimant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution simply on the basis of his profile as a young Tamil male who has been living abroad and is returning as a failed refugee claimant.\n[26] The evidence in the National Documentation Package on Sri Lanka is mixed regarding the treatment of returning Tamils. I find that the most reliable evidence on the subject comes from the United Nations High Commission on Refugees (UNHCR) because it is an international organization responsible for supporting and protecting refugees. The UNHCR has also been assisting the Sri Lankan and Indian governments in a program to resettle Tamil refugees in Sri Lanka as well as monitoring their resettlement in Sri Lanka and conducting studies on the reintegration of Tamils into Sri Lanka.2 I find that this evidence is also more reliable than the country conditions articles filed by the Claimant for the same reasons.\n[27] The UNHCR Guidelines indicate that the risk profile for people with suspected links to the LTTE does not include every Tamil or even every individual who may be suspected of links to the LTTE. The Guidelines state:\nAt the height of its influence in Sri Lanka in 2000-2001, the LTTE controlled and administered 76% of what are now the northern and eastern provinces of Sri Lanka.[citation omitted] Therefore, all persons living those areas, and at the outer fringes of the areas under LTTE control, necessarily had contact with the LTTE and its civilian administration in their daily lives. Originating from an area that was previously controlled by the LTTE does not in itself result in a need for international refugee protection in the sense of the 1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol.\nHowever, previous (real or perceived) links that go beyond prior residency within an area controlled by the LTTE continue to expose individuals to treatment which may give rise to a need for international refugee protection, depending on the specifics of the individual case. The nature of these more elaborate links to the LTTE can vary, but may include people with the following profiles:\n1) Persons who held senior positions with considerable authority in the LTTE civilian administration, when the LTTE was in control of large parts of what are now the northern and eastern provinces of Sri Lanka;\n2) Former LTTE combatants or \"cadres\";\n3) Former LTTE combatants or \"cadres\" who, due to injury or other reason, were employed by the LTTE in functions within the administration, intelligence, \"computer branch\" or media (newspaper and radio);\n4) Former LTTE supporters who may never have undergone military training, but were involved in sheltering or transporting LTTE personnel, or the supply and transportation of goods for the LTTE;\n5) LTTE fundraisers and propaganda activists and those with, or perceived as having had, links to the Sri Lankan diaspora that provided funding and other support to the LTTE;\n6) Persons with family links or who are dependent on or otherwise closely related to the persons with the above profiles.[citation omitted]3\n[28] I find that based on this evidence, merely being a young Tamil male does not expose one to a serious possibility of persecution in Sri Lanka. Rather, in order to be subject to persecution, one has to have been actively and formally involved in the LTTE, or a close relation of those actively and formally involved in the LTTE. The Claimant alleged that he had no such links to the LTTE. As a result, I find that he does not face a serious possibility of persecution simply because he is a young Tamil male returning as a failed refugee.\n[29] I find that the Claimant has not established that he will face a serious possibility of persecution simply on the basis that he is a young Tamil male returning as a failed refugee claimant.\nTHE CLAIMANT IS NOT A PERSON IN NEED OF PROTECTION\n[30] As the Claimant has failed to provide sufficient credible evidence to establish that he faces a serious possibility of persecution, I find that he has also failed to present sufficient credible evidence to meet the higher threshold test to establish that he is a person in need of protection.\nCONCLUSION\nTHE CLAIM IS REJECTED\n[31] Having considered all the evidence, I find that the Claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\n\"A.

The principal claimant was appointed to be the Designated Representative of the minor claimant. In addition, he bases his claim on membership in a particular social group, namely stateless Palestinians who are deprived to the right to a nationality and consequently subjected to mistreatment by the KSA government. The female claimants seek protection on the basis of membership in a particulart social group of women who are subject to gender based persecution and as women who do not subscribe to the wearing of the niqab or abaya in public.\nHISTORY OF THESE CLAIMS\n[3] The principal claimant and his spouse were born, educated, worked and lived in Gaza, Palestine. They have seven sons and four daughters. Five children were born in Gaza, Palestine and six were born in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n[4] The principal claimant has lived and worked in Saudi Arabia since 1984. He initially was sponsored by the Ministry of Health to be employed as a nurse in a medical clinic. His wife and five children joined him in Saudi Arabia in 1987. He was able to obtain Iqamas for his family based on his employment with the Saudi government. Subsequently, six additional children were born in Saudi Arabia. All eleven children received their elementary and high school education in Riyahd. Some of the children attended university outside of Saudi Arabia and some attended the Arab Open University in Riyahd.\n[5] The family has visited Gaza on several occasions over the years, the last trip being in 2001. Some of the children studies in Palestine after their secondary educated was completed in Saudi Arabia. The family travelled on Egyptian Travel Documents for Palestinian Refugees.3 The family still has relatives living in Gaza.\n[6] The principal claimant alleged that his contract with the Ministry XXXX XXXX was allegedly terminated in 2005-2006. As a result, he started an investment company called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. This was a small company that hired two foreign employees and two Saudi nationals. The latter was required by the government. The principal claimant asserted that he required a sponsor who was a Saudi national to be the head of his company and this person is referred to as XXXX XXXX XXXX (commonly referred to as \"XXXX\"). The family iqamas were renewed regularly based on the business.\n[7] In 2014, the principal claimant was advised by XXXX that he would need a new sponsor. In addition, the licence fee for the business increased from 2,000 Riyal to 60,000 Riyal. As a result, he stopped his business activities and began to take steps to close the business which was a multi-year process.4\n[8] In 2016, the principal claimant received a letter ordering him to close his company. He was able to renew the iqamas by signing an undertaking that he was looking for a new sponsor. In 2017 he was able to renew the iqamas by allowing a grace period to find a new sponsor. He then applied to the U.S.A. Embassy for visas that were issued on XXXX XXXX, 2017. On XXXX XXXX, 2017, they travelled to New York and then to Buffalo, where they took a taxi to the Canadian border. They were met by their son, XXXX XXXX, who was a refugee claimant. They entered Canada subject to the safe third country exception.\nISSUES\n[9] The issues in these claims are identity, country of habitual residency, and credibility including failure to claim in the USA.\nIDENTITY\n[10] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants are stateless Palestinians based on information contained in the certified true copies of their Palestinian passports and Egyptian travel documents.5\nCOUNTRY OF FORMER HABITUAL RESIDENCY\n[11] The claimants are stateless Palestinians. They have lived for a long time in the KSA from the 1980s to 2017. They have produced travel documents issued by Egypt and, the claimants allege that they do not have a country of nationality. The claimants allege that they cannot return to and remain in Egypt and their Egyptian travel documents do not grant them rights akin to citizenship there. Given the claimants' testimony and neutral evidence in this case, the panel accepts this allegation and finds that they do not possess the right to live in Egypt. They are not nationals of Egypt. They are all stateless Palestinians who travelled on Egypt Travel Documents issued to them.\n[12] The claimants further indicate that they have no right to return to or remain in Gaza (despite the principal claimant and his spouse being born there). Given the claimants' testimony and the objective evidence, the panel accepts that the claimants cannot return to and remain in Gaza and do not possess rights akin to citizenship in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n[13] The panel finds that the claimants are stateless Palestinians and that the sole country of reference for these claims is the KSA, which is their country of former habitual residence (\"FHR\"). FHR implies the situation where a stateless person was admitted to a country with a view to enjoying a period of continuing residence of some duration. A claimant does not have to be legally able to return to a country of FHR for it to be so described. A claimant must, however, have established a significant period of de facto residence in the country in question, which these claimants have done.\n[14] Statelessness per se does not give rise to a claim to refugee status: A claimant must demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution based on a Convention ground. A stateless claimant must show that, on a balance of probabilities, he or she would suffer persecution in their country of FHR, and that he or she cannot return to their country of FHR. The panel then assessed the claimants' fear vis-\u00e0-vis their FHR.\nCREDIBILITY\n[15] Credibility was a potential issue at the beginning of the hearing and it remained so at the conclusion. The panel took into consideration the principal claimant`s profile, cultural norms, education, age and the fact that evidence is obtained through an interpreter.\n[16] The following examples are some of the negative credibility findings. The Federal Court of Appeal stated in Maldonado6 that when a claimant swears that certain facts are true; this creates a presumption that they are true unless this is a valid reason to doubt their truthfulness.\n[17] The Federal Court of Appeal stated, in Orelien7 that \"One cannot be satisfied that the evidence is credible or trustworthy, unless satisfied that it is probably so, not just possibly so.\"\nLack of original documents or certified copies of original documents\n[18] The claimant presented original documents of birth certificates and his marriage certificate. There were some photocopies of documents or photocopies of scanned documents but there was a significant lack of documents to support the claim considering that the claimant's evidence was that many documents are in Saudi Arabia.\nOriginal documents\n[19] According to Rule 42 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules:\n(1) A party who has provided a copy of a document to the Division must provide the original document to the Division;\n(a) without delay, on the written request of the Division; or\n(b) if the Division does not make a request, no later than at the beginning of the\nproceeding at which the document will be used.\n[20] The principal claimant narrated a story surrounding the termination of his position as a XXXX with the Ministry XXXX XXXX of the KSA government around 2005-2006. When asked by the panel, the location of the termination letter, he said he gave it to the government department that handles companies and sponsorships when he formed a company. He did not provide a reasonable explanation for not having any documentation to support his employment with the Ministry XXXX XXXX for over 20 years.\n[21] As a result, the principal claimant alleged that he formed and registered with the government, a company with a partner who was a national of Saudi Arabia. This company provided the basis for renewals of the iqamas for the claimant and his family members. The licence and iqamas were allegedly renewed until 2014 when he was informed by letter8 that he needed a new sponsor and this must be obtained by the end of June 2015. When asked what experience he possessed to operate a construction company, he said \"ideas\". When asked if he registered the company, he said yes. When asked the location of the business registration form, he said in Riyhad. When asked the location of the original letter9 from the General Investment Authority that stated the licence would not be renewed, he said it is with XXXX, the Saudi representative of the company.\n[22] The principal claimant has not given a reasonable explanation for not presenting original documents or certified copies of originals with respect to his employment and termination with the Ministry XXXX XXXX of KSA. He has also not given any reasonable explanation for not presenting any originals or certified true copies of original documents pertaining to his business that he operated with a Saudi national who was either a partner investor or a sponsor.\n[23] One of the documents referred to by counsel in his submissions10 is the letter signed by the Manager of Employee Services of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. (the principal claimant's alleged company). This is a photocopy of a document. The letter is dated 15\/06\/2014 and notes in the upper right hand corner that this is an employee notification, not a letter to one of the owners. The letter states that he is to find another sponsor by the end of 2015. The panel notes that there is no follow up letter dated in 2015 or any time afterwards. There is no documentation to substantiate that the claimants iqamas were reissued on the basis of signing an agreement to obtain a new sponsor nor is there any documentation to support the allegation that he was given a grace period in 2017. The principal claimant alleged that he looked for employment before coming to Canada, but he provided no documentation in support of this fact. Further, that the Applicants' Iqamas were valid until the end of the year which strongly suggested that the Applicants could return to Saudi Arabia.\n[24] The onus is on the claimant to provide supporting documentation. The panel refers to Case Law11 wherein it is stated:\nSubsection 100(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act provides in part that \"the claimant must produce al documents and information as required by the rules of the Board\". Rule 7 (currently Rule 11) of the Refugee Protection Division Rules, SOR\/2012-256, requires a claimant to provide acceptable documents establishing the elements of his claim. If such documents are not provided, then the claimant must explain why they were unable to obtain such document and the efforts made to obtain them. Where a claimant's story is found to be implausible or otherwise lacking in credibility, a lack of documentary corroboration can be a valid consideration for the purposes of assessing credibility. A lack of acceptable documents without a reasonable explanation, or failure to take reasonable steps to obtain them, is a significant factor in assessing credibility (Byaje v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2010 FC 90 at paras 26-27 [Byaje]; Ortiz Juarez v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FC 288 at paras 7-9 [Ortiz Juarez]).\n[25] According to the principal claimant, the business closed in 2014 and the principal claimant continued with a handyman type of business that he conducted through telephone calls and emails until he left in 2017. The licence was not renewed. On the other hand, the claimants presented their Saudi Arabia Identity cards12 that have been reissued since the alleged closing of the business in 2014. These cards are valid until May 2018. This strongly suggested that the family could return to Saudi Arabia, which meant that the right of return was not relevant. The claimants had exit and entrance visa that expired in XXXX 2017. The principal claimant has not provided a reasonable explanation as to how he was able to maintain the status of the family iqamas and yet not have valid employment in Saudi Arabia. In addition, the claimants applied for and received visas to the U.S.A. in XXXX 2017.13 It is reasonable to conclude that these visas and the exit visas were issued on the basis of the principal claimant's employment. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants were residing in Saudi Arabia with valid iqamas based on the legitimate employment of the principal claimant. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant acquired new employment sometime in or around 2014-2015.\nFear in Saudi Arabia\n[26] The principal claimant was asked why his son came to Canada and he said that his sponsorship was finished and he could not find a new one. When asked what his son feared, he said finding a sponsor and racial discrimination. When asked if he personally was having difficulties in Saudi Arabia, he said yes but he thought it would get better. When asked why he did not leave Saudi Arabia, he said because his daughter was getting married. He said XXXX's school was far away. Again, there are no education documents for XXXX. The principal claimant said the documents are at the school which was closed. He said he feared for his children's future and safety. When asked what he meant by safety, he said his daughter has to take the bus.\n[27] The female claimant agreed with the evidence of the principal claimant. In addition, she said her daughters are married and some of the boys are working and others are applying for jobs. The adult children are educated in the fields of engineering, accounting and administration. Some were educated outside Saudi Arabia. She said that the services required in Saudi Arabia are expensive and referred to discrimination. When questioned by counsel, she had difficulty obtaining medical care because of a lack of insurance. When asked why they had no insurance, she said just for small things. She was able to obtain a private doctor and paid for cancer treatment. She referred to wearing the hijab, abaya and niqab.\n[28] The oldest son said that his concern was getting an education in order to get a job. He attended a private university where non-Saudis were accepted. He said he was not able to afford to be educated outside Saudi Arabia.\n[29] The daughter, who is 19 years of age, was asked if she ever asked her siblings for assistance with her education and she said no, because you can't go alone. When it was pointed out by the panel that it is understood that a woman has to be accompanied by a male relative when travelling in Saudi Arabia, there is no law that states the male relative has to accompany the woman when she is studying in Jordan or Egypt for example. She said she was not aware of the situation. She also commented on travelling to and from school with her father or a brother. She also commented on wearing the niqab.\nDISCRIMINATION v. PERSECUTION\nDo the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution in Saudi Arabia?\n[30] The principal claimant stated that as stateless Palestinians they have no rights; stateless Palestinians have no right to citizenship and are deprived of services, such as access to free education and medical care. Further, as women, the female claimant faced discrimination. They were not permitted to drive for instance.\nRight to Citizenship\n[31] The principal claimant and his spouse were born in Palestine and have no right to citizenship in Saudi Arabia. The children, in spite of being born in Saudi Arabia, have no right to citizenship and this is supported by the objective documentary evidence.14 Non-nationals, however, have \"residency\" rights provided they remain in good standing.15\n[32] The panel acknowledges that even though the claimants were born in Saudi Arabia they are not entitled to citizenship. However, the law denying the claimants citizenship affects all those who were born in Saudi Arabia to fathers who are not Saudi nationals, not just the claimants.16 The panel does not consider this to be discrimination, but rather the consequence of a law of general application. The panel finds that Saudi Arabia is a sovereign nation with the ability to make regulations regarding who enters and stays within its borders, and consequently to whom it grants citizenship. The panel finds that the claimants face no discrimination on this basis.\nRight to services provided\n[33] In terms of services provided by the government free of charge, the documentary evidence indicates that \"only citizens have rights pertaining to access to education, health care, employment and other social services and that it is therefore unlikely that a non-citizen born in Saudi Arabia to non-citizen Saudi-born parents would be able to obtain such rights.\"17\nEducation\n[34] The information before the panel on whether children born in Saudi Arabia to non-citizens have access to free education is mixed. One source indicates that they have access to \"free education up to ... high school.\"18 However, it is also reported that non-citizens who attend public schools have to pay for their elementary and high school education.19\n[35] Again, the panel finds that such restrictions are the result of laws of general application. The government of Saudi Arabia, as do other foreign governments, has the right to enact laws benefiting citizens of that country and to put in place rules regulating services. The panel finds that the claimants do not face discrimination amounting to persecution in Saudi Arabia, as alleged, given the lack of access to free education, health care or other social services.\n[36] The panel finds that the children were not denied access to education in Saudi Arabia on account of any of the five grounds in the Refugee Convention.\nMedical care\n[37] The principal claimant alleges that they face discrimination in Saudi Arabia because the government does not cover the costs of treatment for foreigners who become ill, whereas Saudi citizens have access to free health care.\n[38] The female claimant's testimony is consistent with the objective documentary evidence, which indicates that non-citizens in Saudi Arabia do not have \"free health care privileges\" and are expected to pay for medical care, normally through medical insurance coverage.20 It is also known that many non-Saudis are provided with health insurance as part of their employment contract.\n[38] The panel finds that the claimants were not discriminated against in Saudi Arabia on the basis that they did not have access to free medical care. Saudi Arabia, like many countries in the world, including Canada, does not provide access to free medical care for non-citizens. In fact, some countries do not provide their own citizens with access to free health care. The panel finds that the government of Saudi Arabia is entitled to legislate as it sees fit in this area and provide free health care privileges to citizens only. This is not discriminatory by any means.\n[39] According to the documentary evidence before the panel, non-citizens born in Saudi Arabia to non-citizen Saudi-born parents can be \"employed as non-citizens,\" provided they secure a sponsor.21 The fact that a person would have to find an employer who could sponsor his or her residency permit does not constitute persecution. This is merely a condition imposed by the government of Saudi Arabia for non-citizens who seek to remain in the country as workers. This law does not breach any of the claimants' fundamental rights. As a sovereign entity, the government of Saudi Arabia can impose such restrictions in its efforts to regulate the job market and make rules on how foreigners enter and\/or leave its territory. As such, the panel does not find that the conditions imposed by the Saudi government to regulate the job market are persecutory in nature. The panel acknowledges, however, as the documentary evidence cited below shows, women face particular problems accessing the labor market because of their gender.\n[40] The panel acknowledges that non-citizens in Saudi Arabia are treated differently; persons born in the country to non-national fathers have no path to citizenship, non-citizens do not have access to free services, such as education and health care, and non-citizens must secure an employment sponsor to legally remain in the country. However, the panel does not find the laws in place discriminatory. Further, each claim must be assessed individually based on the circumstances of the claimant. After examining the objective documentary evidence and linking it with the specific circumstances of the claimants, the panel finds that their personal experiences, and the alleged discrimination they face in Saudi Arabia do not rise to the level of persecution.\nGender-related persecution suffered by the claimants\n[41] The principal claimant's spouse testified that while in Saudi Arabia, both she and her daughters suffered gender-related discrimination. She said the system is difficult, education and services needed are expensive. In response to counsel's question, she said that the Saudi dress code for women was imposed upon them. Her daughter who is 19 years of age said she suffered discrimination because of not being able to study or work and she had to wear niqab. She said her education at public school was free and she attended a mixed school where girls were from Egypt, Jordan and there was one Saudi girl. She said she knew of one girl who applied to law school and was refused.\n[42] The documentary evidence does not state that women are forced to wear the niqab, the garment that covers the face. It is often worn for cultural reasons. The standard dress is the hijab, the covering for the head including hair, and the abaya, a long cloak that flows to the floor and covers street clothes. The photos of the female claimants shown in their passports indicate they they wear hijabs. With respect to the male guardian, women are required to travel within Saudi Arabia with a male guardian. There is no reliable evidence that the male guardian has to remain with the female relative while she is studying abroad. Women in the workforce has increased in Saudi Arabia, although not to the extent as in western countries. Enrollment of women in universities has increased to over 50 percent, although segregated education through university level was the norm. The only exceptions to segregation in higher education were medical schools at the undergraduate level and the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, a graduate-level research university, where women worked jointly with men, were not required to wear a veil, and drove cars on campus. Other universities, such as al-Faisal University in Riyadh, offered partially segregated classes with students receiving instruction from the same teacher and able to participate together in class discussion, but with the women and men physically separated by dividers. Women in medical schools mix with men in classes and even drive automobiles.22 The panel finds that what the female claimants experienced amounts to discrimination, not persecution.\n[43] The panel is guided by the reasoning of the Federal Court Decision of Madam Justice Strickland, wherein she states:\nIn any event, the evidence was clear that the Applicants cannot meet the definition of Convention refugees or persons in need of protection and, therefore, the RPD's decision was ultimately reasonable. Put in the context of s 96(b), they are not persons who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion, are outside their country of former habitual residence, Saudi Arabia, and unable to return to that country. Importantly, because the Applicants did not leave Saudi Arabia as a result of a well-founded fear of persecution, the fact that they claim that they cannot return there is not, alone, sufficient to permit them to meet the Convention definition. Further, they explained why they cannot return, being that their Iqamas were rendered invalid because of the Principal Applicant's loss of employment. Thus, even if the Iqamas are not valid, their revocation was not, nor did the Applicants assert, in and of itself, an act of persecution. Nor does the jurisprudence support such a position (Daghmash at paras 9 and 11; Marchoud at paras 16-17).\nCONCLUSION\n[44] Having considered all the evidence and based on the above analysis, the panel finds the claimants are not Convention refugees, as the claimants have not established that there is a reasonable chance or serious possibility that they will face persecution for a Convention ground or that they will face a risk to their lives or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture should they return to Saudi Arabia.\n[45] Therefore, the panel rejects these claims, pursuant to both sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n(signed)\n\"Martin Wakim\"\nMartin Wakim\n\"December 22, 2017\"\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended.\n3 Exhibit 1.\n4 Exhibit 2, BOC narrative, lines 116 to 126.\n5 Exhibit 2.\n6 Maldonado v.

As a result, she experienced mental pressure and sleeping problems. Medical treatment did not help and a friend recommended Falun Gong.\niii) The claimant was worried about her safety as she was aware that the practice was banned. However, she was told that her friend's practice group had safety precautions and there had been no trouble. She therefore decided to go with her friend as a last resort.\niv) The claimant began practising with her friend in November 2010, and subsequently joined a practice group. On October 16, 2011, the PSB raided the group. The claimant escaped to an aunt's house.\nv) On October 19, 2011, her parents called and informed her aunt that the PSB came to her house looking for her. Her parents were told that three co-practitioners had been arrested and they told the PSB that she was a participant. The PSB left a summons. The PSB returned looking for her.\nvi) A smuggler was found and the claimant and her two children left China.\nADMINISTRATIVE ISSUE\n[4] The claimant was provided an opportunity to tender documentary evidence post hearing to corroborate her allegation that resident identity cards cannot be sent out of the country by mail. Counsel was to provide the additional documentation by September 25, 2017. No documents were received and no explanation was provided. As a result, the panel made its determination on the basis of the evidence tendered.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] The panel finds that the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. The reasons follow.\nANALYSIS\n[6] The determinative issue in these claims is the claimant's personal identity and residence in China, and the credibility of the claimant's allegations that she was a Falun Gong practitioner in China who is being pursued by the PSB. The panel finds, on a balance of probability, that the claimant has not been a credible witness in this regard.\nIdentity\nResident Identity Card (RIC)\n[7] The claimant did not disclose a RIC. Rather she tendered a copy of a post office letter1 indicating that the RIC had been seized because it was being mailed out of the country. The claimant provided no corroboration that it is illegal to send a RIC out of the country. The panel has reviewed the Board's national documentation package and found no evidence supporting the claimant's allegation that a RIC could not be mailed outside the country.\n[8] The RIC is a national document and the post office is a national institution. The panel has reviewed in particular the Law of the People's Republic of China on Resident Identity Cards,2 and finds no indication that it is illegal to mail a RIC outside the country. The panel notes that while there are regional differences in the implementation of laws and regulations in China, the Chinese Government appears to be rigorous in legislating laws and regulations concerning national issues. The panel finds it reasonable to assume that if there is a regulation prohibiting the mailing of a RIC it would have been indicated in the document cited above and specifically cited in the post office document.\n[9] The panel questioned the claimant as to the process for applying for a second generation RIC. The claimant provided some correct information but she failed to mention that a fee was charged. In addition, she testified that the new RIC would be mailed to her rather than the requirement that she return to the PSB office and hand in her former RIC before picking up the second generation document.3\n[10] As noted above, the panel provided the claimant an opportunity to disclose post hearing corroboration of her allegation that a RIC could not be mailed outside China. No documentation was provided in this regard.\n[11] The panel therefore finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant's testimony concerning her alleged RIC is not credible.\nHukou\n[12] The claimant tendered a hukou4 indicating that she was the head of the family and including information on her children, the two minor claimants. Unlike the RIC, the hukou lacks security elements and the panel finds it is insufficient documentation to confirm identity of a national of China.\n[13] The panel questioned the claimant in regard to this document and noted that the divorce certificate5 indicated that there was no property to divide as the claimant and her husband lived in her parents' home. The claimant explained that after the divorce her father gave her a house and it was registered in her name.\n[14] The panel notes the claimant testified that her new house was located some distance from her parents' home even though her mother helped to care for her children. In the context of the claimant's indication in her PIF narrative that the restaurant which she ran with her husband had been doing poorly and she had little money left at the time of the divorce in August 2007, the panel finds it doubtful that the claimant would move into her own home a few month later. The panel noted in the hearing that the claimant's hukou indicated that her occupation was farming rather than the owner and operator of a restaurant. The claimant explained that the house belonged to her father. The panel finds this is not a credible explanation for a new hukou not to state the claimant's correct occupation.\n[15] Country document evidence indicates that the hukou is particularly susceptible to fraud.6 A professor of law at George Washington University, who specializes in the Chinese legal system stated that \"just about any document can be forged in China, and many are.\"7 In addition, a professor of international affairs at Georgia Institute of Technology, who has published on the hukou system in China, stated that \"both hukou forgery and acquiring a genuine hukou by fraudulent means 'have been observed for a long time' in China.\"8\n[16] The panel acknowledges Federal Court jurisprudence indicating that merely because fraudulent documentation is available in China does not mean all documents are fraudulent. However, in the context of the incorrect occupation in the hukou disclosed by the claimant, the panel's finding above regarding the absence of a RIC, the panel's finding below regarding the fraudulent nature of the \"summons\" document disclosed by the claimant, and also the claimant's indication that she was willing to access and use fraudulent passports, the panel gives the hukou little weight in corroborating the claimant's residency in China at the material time.\nThe chuanpiao (subpoena)\n[17] The claimant indicated in her PIF narrative that the PSB informed her parents that three of her alleged co-practitioners had been arrested and they informed the PSB that the claimant was a practitioner. At the same time the PSB left a subpoena9 requiring the claimant to attend court as a witness. The subpoena disclosed by the claimant requires her to appear in court on a certain date. It notes in addition that the claimant must arrive on time and must bring the document with her as an entry certificate. This is consistent with a chuanpiao which is described as a subpoena issued to a witness.10\n[18] The panel finds, in the circumstances, it is reasonable to assume a criminal summons or coercive summons would have been issued by the PSB, compelling the claimant to appear for interrogation and investigation by the PSB. The document disclosed by the claimant is inconsistent with her PIF narrative and oral testimony. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the chuanpiao is a fraudulent document.\n[19] The panel asked the claimant if the PSB returned to her home again after their first return noted in her oral testimony. The claimant responded that the PSB returned on multiple occasions, including once or twice in each of the last two years.\n[20] The claimant was asked if the PSB left a coercive summons when she did not respond to the subpoena. The claimant said no. The panel finds, in the context of the multiple return visits of the PSB, the claimant's residence in Guangzhou City, the capital of Guangdong province, and also the arrests of alleged co-practitioners and the identification of the claimant as a practitioner, that a coercive summons would have been left with the claimant's parents. Country document evidence confirms this finding.11\n[21] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is not being pursued by the PSB as a Falun Gong practitioner, that the claimant was not a Falun Gong practitioner in China and that she made a fraudulent claim when she entered Canada in 2012.\n[22] While the chuanpiao is not an identity document, it is a document identified with the claimant and is therefore relevant to her identity.\n[23] In assessing the claimant's identity documents, the panel is guided by the Federal Court decision in Sertkaya,12 which states that it is open for the Board to consider the authenticity of documentary evidence, and the ability of the claimant to obtain and use fraudulent documents. In addition, the Court's decision in Kazadi,13 states that if there are significant irregularities with the claimant's identity documents, the Board is not obliged to seek an expert assessment of the documents as to their probative value. In addition, the panel is guided by section 106 of the IRPA which states:\nThe Refugee Protection Division must take into account with respect to the credibility of a claimant, whether the claimant possesses acceptable documentation establishing identity, and if not, whether they have provided a reasonable explanation for lack of documentation or have taken reasonable steps to obtain the documentation.\n[24] As well, Rule 7 of the RPD Rules states that a claimant must provide acceptable documents establishing identity and other elements of the claim. A claimant who does not provide acceptable documents must explain why they were not provided and what steps were taken to obtain them.\nCONCLUSION\n[25] The claimant has failed to establish her identity as a national of China or provide a credible explanation as to why she has not done so. Therefore the panel finds that her claim and that of the minor claimants, whose claims are dependent on the claim of the principal claimant, must fail. The panel finds the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n(signed)\n\"Milton Israel\"\nMilton Israel\nOctober 3, 2017\nDate\n1 Exhibit 8, Identity Documentation, pp.16-17.\n2 Exhibit 6, National Documentation Package (NDP) for China ( July 29, 2011), item 3.12.\n3 Ibid., item 3.14..\n4 Exhibit 8, Identity Documentation, pp. 1-7.\n5 Exhibit 8, Identity Documentation, pp. 8-9.\n6 Exhibit 6, NDP for China (July 29, 2011), item 3.9.\n7 Ibid., item 3.17.\n8 Ibid.\n9 Exhibit 8, Identity Documentation, pp. 22-23.\n10 Exhibit 5, NDP for China (July 20, 2017), item 9.22.\n11 Ibid., item 9.10, refers to item 9.22, CHN104188.\n12 Sertkaya, Ismail v.

They state that they left Iraq in 2007 as a result of threats against them and the killing of the principal claimant's spouse (father to the other claimants), first to Turkey and then to Canada, where they entered claims in 2012.\nDECISION\n[3] For the following reasons, the panel finds the claimants have not established their personal identities and nationalities.\nANALYSIS\n[4] Section 106 of IRPA states:\n\"The Refugee Protection Division must take into account, with respect to the credibility of a claimant, whether the claimant possesses acceptable documentation establishing identity, and if not, whether they have provided a reasonable explanation for the lack of documentation or have taken reasonable steps to obtain the documentation.\"1\n[5] I find that the claimants' identities are not established as there was no persuasive evidence establishing their identity.\nDocuments provided are not reliable.\n[6] The claimants provided the following documents to establish their identity: national identification cards, birth\/baptism confirmations issued by their church in Iraq, and identity documents of the principal claimant's mother, who was accepted as a refugee in Canada in 2010.\nIdentity Cards\n[7] The claimant was asked about the identification cards provided2. Initially, she stated that she had brought them with her when she left Iraq in 2007. She later stated that the cards were sent to her after she left Iraq. When asked about this she suggested she made a mistake.\n[8] The panel then asked about how the identity documents were provided to her. She stated that the person she was renting from in Turkey went back and forth to Baghdad and brought them. The panel found the explanation for how the cards were obtained confusing. She indicated that he got them from his mother's aunt in XXXX, who got them from friends, who got them from her mother and father in law. She then stated that her in-laws brought it to her mother's aunt in XXXX and then friends brought them from XXXX to Baghdad, where the landlord retrieved them. The panel found the claimant's explanation of how the identity cards travelled through Iraq to be confusing and internally inconsistent.\n[9] The claimant was then asked where the ID cards were when they left for Turkey, and she stated they were in the north (XXXX) with her mother and father-in-law. She said next they were taken to the mother's aunt, from whom the landlord retrieved them. She stated that the mother's Aunt is in XXXX XXXX, and that the landlord retrieved from her the same cards the claimants left behind when they went to Turkey. The panel noted that the document was issued in 2008, and so the claimant's statement that she left the cards behind in Iraq in 2007 could not have been truthful. She then amended her testimony to state that there were old cards left behind that needed to be renewed. As her husband was from Basra, her father-in-law took care of getting them renewed. The renewal was delayed due to the security situation in the country.\n[10] When asked about why she had stated on multiple occasions that she had these ID documents when she left Iraq and had left them behind, she stated that it was an oversight or mistake. The panel rejects her explanation. The claimant gave detailed (albeit confusing) testimony about the path these cards took after she left Iraq, never once mentioning them being in Basra waiting to be renewed. It was not until she was faced with the fact that what she stated could not be true on the face of the documents that the testimony was amended. The panel finds it more likely that the claimant could not tell the panel how the documents were obtained because they were not obtained in a regular or legal fashion and are unreliable.\n[11] The claimant was asked about how her father-in-law obtained the ID cards on her behalf in Basra. She stated they applied to renew them before she left the country, at the beginning of 2007. The cards were not issued until November, 2008. This delay was because it was unsafe to travel to Basra in this time. The panel notes that 2006-2008 was a particularly violent time in Iraq and travel was likely unsafe in this period. However, this is insufficient to overcome the significant fact that the claimant failed to mention this at any time when being asked in detail about these documents, until faced with the inconsistency between her testimony and the details on the document itself.\n[12] The panel notes that the documentary evidence establishes that these identity cards are known to be available in both false and fraudulently obtained format3, and can be issued by proxy4, such that persons do not even have to be in Iraq or only holding Iraqi citizenship in order for them to be issued.\n[13] As the claimant could not provide clear and consistent testimony about the primary identity document she has provided for herself and her children, and the documents are themselves subject to concerns related to their reliability, the panel finds they are not reliable, and cannot be given sufficient weight such that they establish the claimants' identities.\nBirth\/Baptism certificates\n[14] The claimant provided birth\/baptism certificates for herself and the other two claimants5. These documents have no security features, are not issued by a state authority, and do not include photos. As such the panel finds that, even if there were no concerns with the documents, they could be given only very limited weight towards establishing identity. However, the panel does have concerns with the validity of these documents.\n[15] The panel asked the claimant about her sons' certificates. She stated they were provided to her maybe a month after their respective baptisms in 2002 and 2004. The panel noted to the claimant that the documents had issuance dates of 2005 and 2006 respectively, two years after she states they were provided to her. She explained that she forgot because it was years ago, and stated that she has memory problems. The panel finds that the claimant's testimony regarding how these documents were obtained is not reliable, as her statements do not match the information on the certificate itself. The allegation that this inconsistency is due to memory-loss is not supported by documentation such as a medical report.\n[16] The panel further noted that the register number on both of the children's certificates is not entered. The claimant could not explain why this would be.\n[17] The panel also noted that, despite being issued a year apart, the signature block on both of the children's documents is identical - when held over each other, the signatures are identical in form, placement, and size. The claimant suggested that they may use the same forms with the signature block pre-populated. The panel does not have evidence to suggest that this would be done. The panel finds it more likely, given the other concerns noted, that the signature blocks are identical because the forms are not genuine, but were rather produced for the purposes of the claim.\n[18] The panel notes the claimant also provided a baptism certificate for her, which does not have the same signature and does contain a register number. However, this form suffers from the same inherent lack of reliability noted, and, as the claimant provided the exact same document for the two minor claimants that, in the panel's view, is likely fraudulent, if follows that the panel cannot rely on the mirror document for the principal claimant. Finally, this states it was issued in 1999, and as such does not provide evidence or proof to establish the whereabouts, identity, or citizenship of the principal claimant in the intervening years.\nMother's documents\n[19] The panel considered the identity documents of the principal claimant's mother. According to the documents before the panel, these consist of the same two documents provided for these claimants - an identity card and birth\/baptism certificate6. First, these do not establish the identity of the claimants themselves. The claimants have not provided reliable evidence to establish their familial relationship to this person. Secondly, these documents are the same type as and not inherently more reliable than that which the claimants are attempting to use to establish their identities - the panel does not have before it details about how these documents were assessed such that they were found to be reliable by the last panel, for instance.\n[20] And, while these documents were accepted by a previous panel, that panel did not have the same evidence which is before this one (that includes problematic testimony and inconsistencies on the face of the documents). As such, the panel comes to a different conclusion - that the combination of these two documents, in the case of the claimant's before it, is insufficient to establish identity.\nLack of additional documents or evidence\n[21] The claimants stated they lived in Turkey from 2007-2012. They have provided no evidence to establish this. The claimants had apparently fled Iraq to Turkey, but did not register with the United Nations (UN) as refugees. The panel asked why they had not done this, given their situation, and the principal claimant stated she was afraid to do so because she had travelled to the country illegally. She could not, however, explain why that would cause her to fear approaching and registering with the UN authorities in the country. The panel sees no evidence that registering with the U.N. in Turkey leads to expulsion from the country, and rather would expect that it would assist with staying in the country as a U.N. recognized refugee awaiting resettlement.\n[22] The claimant provided no documentation related to her stay in Turkey. No school, medical, work, or other records, stating that she and her children did not participate in schooling or work, and she did not have medical records available. She did not have any photos or other evidence of living there. She did not provide evidence from her long-time landlord in the country. She did not provide evidence from two Canadians who she states saw her in Turkey in 2012. She did not provide evidence from any church or other organization she may have attended. The complete paucity of any evidence of having resided in Turkey leads the panel to find the claimant is likely being less than forthcoming about her whereabouts, as the panel would expect someone living in a country with two children for many years would have some record of this available. The panel notes the claimant was specifically asked to provide such evidence. It rejects her explanation that there is no evidence available that could establish the whereabouts of herself and the minor claimants for such a long period of time, as this belies belief on its face and is not supported by the evidence that she had a landlord, had persons who saw her there, and raised and cared for two small children.\n[23] The panel does note that the claimant did approach Turkish authorities in Canada in an attempt to furnish them with her fingerprints to see if there was a record for her there, but they were unable to proceed with such a request. The panel finds this does not rectify the lack of evidence about the claimant's whereabouts - according to the claimant, they were never legally granted entry to the country.\n[24] The panel also notes that the principal claimant's mother stated that the claimants were in Turkey in her PIF in 2008. The panel notes that this is consistent with the claimant's evidence. However, the panel finds this one consistency is insufficient to offset the entire lack of any evidence of residence for the approximately five years prior to arrival in Canada. The panel notes that according to the claimant, her and her mother had no contact between 2008 and 2012 (despite the claimant having lived in the same location in Turkey throughout this time, a place the claimant's mother lived as well prior to coming to Canada and that was owned by a person in contact with family members still in Iraq, as he was allegedly involved in obtaining the claimant's identity documents from them). As such, the claimant's mother cannot provide details or evidence as to their whereabouts during these years.\nUnable to provide details of travel to Canada\n[25] When the principal claimant was asked about how she was able to travel to Canada with two children, she stated that the smuggler was with her and did everything. She was unable to state what travel documents were used, what was said to authorities, or which countries she transited. The claimant then stated when she arrived in the U.S.A., she believed for some time she was in Canada, including throughout the customs and immigration process, again managed entirely by the smuggler. She has no record of her travel. The claimant was asked if she did not notice any sign that she was in the U.S.A., such as U.S.A. flags hanging in the airport or elsewhere or on uniforms, and stated she was too afraid and not paying attention. The panel finds it unlikely the claimant could have flown on a plane for many hours, and then passed through international customs and through a U.S.A. airport without noticing anything that would indicate she was in that country. The claimant states she lived in Iraq until 2007, through years of the U.S.A. led war in the country, and so would likely be familiar with the flag and other symbols of that country. The panel believes the claimant is deliberately obfuscating the route by which she went to the U.S.A. in order to hide her and her children's true identities. The panel notes that a request through the U.S.A. to determine if a match of her fingerprints existed in their records was non-resultant7, and so unable to confirm her statements regarding how she entered that country.\nCONCLUSION\n[26] The claimants have failed to provide credible and reliable personal identity documents, have failed to provide other documentation that the panel finds could reasonably have been available and that could help establish their identity and residence history, and have failed to provide credible evidence to establish how they travelled to Canada. As such, the panel finds the claimants have not established their personal or national identities.\n[27] In order to find someone to be a Convention refugee or person in need of protection, it must be determined what their country or countries of nationality are so that the claim can be assessed against those countries. Having failed to show, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants are Iraqi, I find they are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection as they have not established a country or countries of nationality on which to determine if they face more than a mere possibility of persecution or a likely danger of torture, risk to life, or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\n[28] The claims are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"K.

Whitelock\nConseil du (de la) ministre\nApplication to Vacate - Demande d'annulation\nPrivate Proceeding \/ Huis clos\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX (The Respondent) is a citizen of Poland. He received a positive determination in his refugee claim on January 18, 20011. On July 23, 2012 the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) received an application by the Minister to vacate2 Mr. XXXX Convention refugee status pursuant to section 109 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act3 (IRPA).\nLegislative Framework\n(1) The Refugee Protection Division may, on application by the Minister, vacate a decision to allow a claim for refugee protection, if it finds that the decision was obtained as a result of directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts relating to a relevant matter.\nRejection of application\n(2) The Refugee Protection Division may reject the application if it is satisfied that other sufficient evidence was considered at the time of the first determination to justify refugee protection\nAllowance of application\n(3) If the application is allowed, the claim of the person is deemed to be rejected and the decision that led to the conferral of refugee protection is nullified.\nHistory of application\n[2] The history of this file and application includes a significant number of delays which I believe are important to enumerate. After a number of delays in scheduling, a date was set to hear the vacation application on February 7, 2014.\n[3] On January 28, 2014 counsel sent in a request for a postponement due to the Respondent's medical condition of \"congestive heart failure\". The medical note asked for a 5 month delay which was granted.\n[4] August 29, 2014 another postponement request from counsel was received by the Board due to the Respondent's medical condition deeming him \"medically unfit\" until March 2015.\n[5] August 6, 2015 another medical note was received by the Board that the Respondent suffers from major depression and panic attacks. Due to delays attributed to the Respondent's medical condition the Minister requested on August 10, 2015 that a Designated Representative be appointed in order for the application to proceed.\n[6] On September 1, 2015 the RPD designates a Designated Representative (DR).\n[7] On September 10, 2015 Counsel for the Respondent objects to the use of a DR and asks for the DR to be removed. This application is dismissed by a Coordinating Member of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD).\n[8] On May 10, 2016 a second application to remove the DR is made by Counsel. And, again it is dismissed by a Coordinating Member on May 16, 2016.\n[9] A date for the hearing is set for December 21, 2016 and counsel requests a new date. A new date is set for January 12, 2017.\n[10] At the January 12, 2017 hearing date the Member assigned agreed at that date that the Respondent is a Vulnerable Person as per Guideline 8 of the Chairpersons' guidelines4. It was also agreed at this hearing that the Respondent would like to continue with a Designated Representative (DR). At the preliminary hearing counsel requests more time to get further medical evidence and a mutually agreed upon date is set for January 26, 2017.\n[11] On January 26, 2017 the IRB received further correspondence from counsel that the physician for the Respondent needs 60 to 90 additional days to complete an assessment. This request is objected to by the Minister and finally a date is set for the hearing to take place on March 30, 2017.\n[12] On March 24, 2017 the RPD receives a medical letter requesting a Change in Date and Time (CDT) due to the mental health of the Respondent. This application is denied.\n[13] At the March 30, 2017 hearing date this panel heard two preliminary applications, one from the Respondent's counsel and one from the DR requesting a CDT. These applications were both denied and reasons were given orally.\n[14] A hearing proceeded on March 30, 2017 attended by all parties. A second hearing was held on May 19, 2017. At that hearing the DR did not appear. A break was taken in order to attempt to reach the DR, the panel directed a case officer to call the DR and counsel was also asked to try to reach the DR. No response from the DR was received. The panel decided to postpone the hearing pending further outreach to the DR. Multiple attempts to reach the DR were made by the Division with no response.\n[15] On May 31, 2017 this panel member de-designated the DR and written reasons were provided to all parties5. The Respondent is advised to bring a support person.\n[16] At the June 2, 2017 hearing the panel asked all parties if there were any issues with respect to the decision on de-designation and there were none. During the hearing counsel for the Respondent made a motion of bias, counsel was directed to provide a written application.\n[17] An application for recusal was received June 9, 2017 and the Minister's response was received June 13, 2017.\n[18] Final submissions on this application were received from the Minister on June 21, 2017 and from counsel on July 4, 2017.\nAPPLICATION OF BIAS\n[19] The application for vacation was heard over three sittings, March 30, 2017, May 19, 2017 and June 2, 2017. On June 2, 2017 counsel for the Respondent (Mr. XXXX) made an oral application that was followed by a written one on June 9, 2017 pursuant to Rule 50(1) of the RPD Rules that the Member recuse herself from the proceedings and that the matter be heard by another member of the RPD. The ground for the application was a charge of failure of natural justice and procedural fairness, based upon a reasonable apprehension of bias.\n[20] In deciding this application I am first guided by the jurisprudence on the issue of bias. Mr. Justice Shore made the following comments in Zhu:6\nThe test for reasonable apprehension of bias, as articulated by Justice Louis-Philippe de Grandpr\u00e9 in the often cited case of Committee for Justice and Liberty v Canada (National Energy Board), [1978] 1 SCR 369:\n...the apprehension of bias must be a reasonable one held by reasonable and right-minded persons, applying themselves to the question and obtaining thereon the required information... [T]hat test is \"what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically -- and having thought the matter through -- conclude. Would he think that it is more likely than not that [the decision-maker], whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly.\nAn applicant alleging bias must meet a very high threshold. He or she must provide \"cogent evidence\" demonstrating that something a Refugee Protection Division [RPD] member has done gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias (R v RDS, [1997] 3 SCR 484 at para 116-117). As stated in Arthur v Canada (Attorney General), 2001 FCA 223, allegations of bias cannot be done lightly:\n... An allegation of bias, especially actual and not simply apprehended bias, against a tribunal is a serious allegation. It challenges the integrity of the tribunal and of its members who participated in the impugned decision. It cannot be done lightly. It cannot rest on mere suspicion, pure conjecture, insinuations or mere impressions of an applicant or his counsel. It must be supported by material evidence demonstrating conduct that derogates from the standard ...\n[21] The Federal Court echoed these comments in Brahim,7 Dang,8 and Maklakov,9 affirming that allegations of bias are serious and should be made with caution. In Brahim and Dang, the Federal Court dealt with similar allegations of bias, namely those based on a tribunal's decisions rather than their conduct. In Dang, the Court ruled that the tribunal's negative finding regarding wedding attire did not raise an apprehension of bias, even though the Court then went on to reject that finding as unreasonable.10 In Brahim, the Court stated it even more succinctly:\n[16] In this case, the applicants crafted their allegations of \"bias\" primarily on the basis of the RPD's findings. They allege, inter alia, that the RPD failed to mention medical evidence regarding the minor female applicant as well as problems she and her mother purportedly experienced at school. The Court is of the view that this is not a matter of \"bias,\" but rather one that is related to the reasonableness of the decision. The same holds true for comments made by the RPD with respect to secularism in Quebec.\n[22] In this case counsel for the Respondent made a number of arguments to support her application. However I find that the issues counsel raises predominantly relate to a number of interlocutory decisions that were made in the process of deciding a Vacation Application. I find the allegations of bias are based upon decisions made rather than conduct and therefore do not necessarily related to bias. It not appropriate nor necessary to defend each interlocutory decision, which is what the counsel is addressing in her application. Nonetheless I have addressed each of the issues she raises.\nThe panel member took over a seized case from another assigned member.\n[23] The first relates to this panel \"taking over\" the hearing from another member who she argues was seized on the case. To support this allegation counsel included a transcript of the first hearing that was held before another panel member11. While it is correct that the hearing for this case was scheduled to proceed on January 12, 2017 before another panel member, the record, included by counsel, shows that this hearing was in the form of a pre-hearing conference where the issues of whether the Respondent continues to require a Designated Representative and whether he should be designated as a Vulnerable Person were discussed. Such conferences are allowed by RPD rule 24 (1) The Division may require the parties to participate at a conference to fix a date for a proceeding or to discuss issues, relevant facts and any other matter to make the proceedings fairer and more efficient. No special notice is required to conduct such a conference. The submission from the Minister also corroborates this panel's reading of the transcript; that the proceeding did not go beyond a pre-hearing conference.\n[24] The second point on this issue is that it is within the power of the Division to administratively assign matters within its jurisdiction. In this case following the pre-hearing conference a new panel member was assigned by the Division.\n162 (1) Each Division of the Board has, in respect of proceedings brought before it under this Act, sole and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all questions of law and fact, including questions of jurisdiction.\n(2) Each Division shall deal with all proceedings before it as informally and quickly as the circumstances and the considerations of fairness and natural justice permit.12\n[25] The panel finds the counsel's allegation of bias in this respect is without merit as it is clear that member assignment is within the jurisdiction of the Division and there is no evidence to indicate that the first assigned member was seized on the matter. There is no reasonable apprehension of bias when the Division re-assigns a case following a pre-hearing conference.\nDe-designation of the Designated Representative.\n[26] Counsel for the Respondent alleges that there was bias in coming to the decision of de-designating the DR. The use of a DR is addressed in the legislation. Section 167(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) states; If a person who is the subject of proceedings is under 18 years of age or unable, in the opinion of the applicable Division, to appreciate the nature of the proceedings, the Division shall designate a person to represent the person. In this case the original intent of the DR was to ensure that the case proceeded as it became clear that the Respondent was not in suitable medical or psychological health to proceed. An application was originally received by the Division from the Minister in August 2015 as there had already been 3 years of delays due to the Respondent's medical needs. In the transcript of the pre-hearing conference provided by counsel13 it indicates that the previous member asked the Respondent a number of questions to \"gauge his capacity to appreciate the nature of the proceedings.\"14 At this preliminary hearing it was agreed that the Respondent appears to be \"perfectly capable15\" of appreciating the nature of the proceedings but due to his changing mental health situation the Respondent would like the use of the DR acting as a \"helper\" or support person. This was agreed to at the time.\n[27] When it became clear that the DR was unresponsive after the first sitting, not appearing at the second sitting and not returning calls, it was necessary to de-designate Mr. XXXX. The other aspect of the decision to de-designate was made based upon the Respondents ability to understand the nature of the proceedings as determined by this member, his current state of functioning that has enabled him to attend the hearing, and the fact that the DR was providing only a supportive role. The Respondent maintained his Vulnerable Person designation. This panel member also provided reasons16 regarding the de-designation in advance of the last sitting and all parties were given the full opportunity to respond to this decision. At the outset of the June 2, 2017 hearing all parties were asked if they had any questions or concerns related to the de-designation and none were raised. Given the transparent decision-making regarding the use of the DR I find counsel's allegations of bias are without merit.\nCurtailing of evidence.\n[28] Counsel alleges that the member displayed bias when she refused to personally inspect the Respondent's purported scars. At the third and final sitting for this application the Respondent alleged that he had been a victim of physical and sexual violence in Poland during his incarceration. Counsel for the Respondent requested that the Respondent remove his clothing to show the panel member his scars. I refused this evidence for several reasons. The Respondent had been designated vulnerable and has extensive medical evidence to show he suffers from serious mental health problems17. Accommodations were made throughout this hearing to minimize the trauma and impact of the proceedings on the Respondent, recognizing his vulnerability. Requesting an individual remove their clothing after a spontaneous disclosure of rape and torture is in the panel's view not only exacerbating the very factors that make the respondent vulnerable but re-traumatizing to an individual. Furthermore, as indicated in the hearing, the panel does not possess the expertise to determine the nature and cause of scars based upon a cursory viewing in the course of a hearing. Counsel has represented the Respondent for five years and should be aware of the many ways to elicit such evidence including through medical documentation.\n[29] Third, and finally, this hearing is a vacation hearing and therefore requires a finding under the analysis of section 109. The newly disclosed allegations of rape and torture do not relate to the question of whether the original RPD decision was obtained as a result of misrepresentation or withholding of material facts relating to a relevant matter. Introduction of new evidence or persecution is not relevant to the consideration of section 109(2). There is no opportunity to present a \"corrected version\" of the events leading to a misrepresentation18 and the motives, intention, negligence and mens rea are not relevant.19\n[30] In protecting the Respondent's dignity in the hearing room I find that, contrary to counsel's allegation of bias, this refusal to physically examine the Respondent was acting in his best interest. This is no basis for a bias motion.\nBias due to haste.\n[31] Counsel makes a general reference in her application to the Member exhibiting bias due to the haste at which the matter was dealt with. The panel finds this allegation without merit. Based upon the above enumeration of delays over the course of 5 years (see History of Delays) the pace at which the matter was eventually dealt with demonstrates that there has been no undue haste in resolving the matter. On the contrary the application was delayed years due to the Respondents medical needs, refusal to accept a DR, and numerous requests for postponements to gather medial evidence regarding his current functioning. The mandate of the IRB is to make well-reasoned decisions on immigration and refugee matters, efficiently, fairly and in accordance with the law. In this case the mandate of efficiency was balanced with fairness and natural justice to ensure the Respondent was able to proceed with the vacation application. There is no evidence to conclude that the pace of this panel's efforts to conclude this application in the last 5 months demonstrates any manner of real or perceived bias.\n[32] In conclusion, I find that the application for recusal due to an apprehension of bias is without merit and the motion for recusal is dismissed.\nVACATION APPLICATION\nMinister's Allegations\n[33] In the Minister's original application the Minister states that the Respondent XXXX XXXX XXXX received a decision on January 22, 2001 allowing a claim for Refugee protection. This was obtained as a result of the Respondent directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts related to a relevant matter.\n[34] The facts, based upon the evidence on the file, are that the Respondent entered Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX at Lester B. Pearson Airport on a fraudulent or improperly obtained Italian passport. On June 27 2000 he made an inland claim for refugee protection when he attended the Offices of Citizenship and Immigration Canada in Ottawa. His case was shortly thereafter referred to the Immigration and Refugee Board.20\n[35] The Respondent's claim was joined with the earlier claims of his wife and three minor children. Their claims were heard together and they were all found to be Convention refugees in a decision dated January 22, 2001.21\n[36] The basis for their claim for refugee protection related to the Respondent being Roma and being the subject of racism, discrimination, and persecution.22 He enumerates in his PIF numerous instances of violence beginning in 1992.23\n[37] The Respondent became a Permanent Resident of Canada July 27 200524.\n[38] The Minister was informed by INTERPOL Ottawa that a European Arrest Warrant had been issued by Poland in respect of the Respondent on December 8 200625. The Warrant for the Respondent relates to two judgements; one from the regional court in Szezecin, January 26, 1993 changed by the judgement of the Court of Appeal in Paznan on July 1 1993; and the second from the District Court in Szezecin on February 11, 1993. The warrant indicates the length of custodial sentence imposed as a result of these judgements collectively as 4 years imprisonment, of which 2 years and 7 months has yet to be served by the Respondent26.\n[39] The Minister in his application27 provides the details of the Respondent's criminal history which is summarized here:\n* The Respondent had been sentenced by the District Court of Swinoujscie by judgement dated January 13 1989 to 3 months imprisonment under article 236 of the Polish Penal Code ( insult a public functionary in connection with the performance of his duties) and under Art. 235 and Art 152(2) of the Polish Penal Code (using violence or illegal threat with the purpose of forcing a public functionary to abstain from lawful official activity) and was sentenced to 1 year and 10 months imprisonment which was served from February 14 1988 to September 18 1989.\n* December 18 1989 the Respondent received a judgement sentencing him to two years imprisonment, served from September 18 1989 to February 20 1991 for an offence under Article 208 of the Polish Penal Code for break and enter.\n* September 21 1991 while under this previous sentence, committed an assault on XXXX XXXX by hitting her in the face with his fist and \"stupefying her with tear gas\", the Respondent and an accomplice appropriated her money and jewelry worth \" at least 3,500,00 old zlotys\".28\n* October 22 1991 The Respondent committed an assault on police officers using \"incapacitating gas\" causing injury.\n* January 26 1993 The Respondent was sentenced to a penalty of 4 years imprisonment, with the inclusion of the period of temporary arrest of 2 years in the term. During this sentence the Respondent received a leave from the penitentiary, did not return, and has remained in hiding \"from the judiciary authorities.\"\n[40] The warrant includes an Order from the Court of Appeal in Paznan where the sentence appealed was upheld and the Respondent was ordered to pay 1,020,000 Polish Zlotys in legal costs.\n[41] The Minister submits that the Respondent made material misrepresentations when, at the time of making his refugee claim, stated to the Interviewing officer that he had never committed, been arrested, charged, or convicted of a criminal offense in any place and had not been detained or jailed at any time.29\n[42] The Minister has asked therefore that that decision be vacated and that the Respondent's refugee status be nullified.\nDETERMINATION\n[43] The application is allowed.\nANALYSIS\n[44] The Respondent was questioned by the Minister regarding his history of criminal convictions at the first hearing for this application. The Respondent admitted that he knowingly concealed and withheld his history of criminal activity and convictions in Poland when he first made his claim for Refugee protection. He also testified that he did not reveal this history in his refugee hearing. The Respondent specifically stated \"I didn't want to disclose this information because I was afraid for my life.\"\n[45] While the Respondent disputed some of the elements of the criminal convictions that were provided by the Minister, I find that the evidence from the Polish courts outweigh the Respondents testimony regarding the events that took place in Poland that he never disclosed to the Canadian authorities.\n[46] When he made his claim for refugee protection in Canada and during the course of his refugee claim, he knowingly concealed and failed to disclose to the RPD the facts related to his criminal history. I find that the Minister has made a prima facie case that precluded the examination of section 98 of IRPA an Article 1F(B) exclusion analysis at the first RPD hearing .\n[47] The offenses enumerated above would likely fall under a number of offenses in the Criminal Code. These include Section 344 (4) related to robbery that carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment; Section 270.01 related to the assault of a peace or pubic officer with a weapon or causing bodily harm and 270.02, where the harm inflicted \"maims, disfigures or endangers the life of the complainant\" which carries sentences of up to 10 to 14 years respectively30.\n[48] The Minister's burden of proof in an exclusion analysis is merely to demonstrate \"serious reasons for considering\" that the claimant committed such acts.31 In this case there is undisputed evidence that criminal acts have taken place. The objectives of the Exclusion clause are referred to in the jurisprudence including Chan, which refers to the seriousness of the crime as one in which a sentence of at least ten years imprisonment could have been imposed if the crime had been committed in Canada. 32 More recent case law has examined the issue of seriousness and refers to the ten-year rule as one that should not be \"applied in a mechanistic, decontextualized, or unjust manner\"33 and that is rebuttable.34 The panel has applied such considerations to the evidence adduced in this claim and finds that there is sufficient evidence to support the vacation application that the withholding of the criminal history relates to relevant matter, that of exclusion.\n[49] The offences in evidence are presumptively serious non-political offences within the meaning of Article 1(F)(b) of the Convention, in accordance with the judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal in Jayasekara35 . Despite the Respondent, upon questioning by his counsel, disclosing new evidence that occurred during his incarceration, I find that none of the circumstances surrounding or related to his foreign convictions displace that presumption. Had he disclosed the facts in the Minister's evidence at the time he made his claim for refugee protection during the course of his refugee hearing, he could have been found to have been excluded by the RPD pursuant to Article 1(F)(b) of the Convention and his claim would have been rejected.\n[50] While counsel for the Respondent submits that the offenses committed by the Respondent are not \"serious\" in nature due to the context of the Respondent as a Roma facing discrimination or persecution, this is not the evidence to analyze in a Vacation application. The arguments made by the counsel in her submissions36 relate to a line of argument and analysis that should have been before the first panel during a refugee hearing. The omission of criminal evidence in this application does not require a contextualized approach to the convictions rather, the question is only merely whether there has been a misrepresentation leading to a possible exclusion. In this case the evidence supports that the Respondent could have been excluded under Article 1F(b) of the Convention by the original decision maker had the evidence been before him. For this reason, I find that the Respondent's claim for refugee protection granted on January 22, 2001 is nullified, and the application for Vacation is allowed.\nCONCLUSION\n[51] I therefore find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Respondent's Convention refugee decision was obtained as the result of misrepresentations and the withholding of material facts relating to a relevant matter, and as that matter relates to exclusion, I am not required to consider any other remaining evidence that would have been sufficient to sustain the claim. The Minister's application is therefore allowed.\n(signed)\n\"Nadra Qadeer\"\nNadra Qadeer\nJuly 26, 2017\nDate\n1 Exhibit 1.\n2 Exhibit 2.\n3 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended.\n4 Chairperson's Guideline 8, Guideline On Procedures With Respect To Vulnerable Persons Appearing Before The IRB.

They claim to be nationals of China. They claim to be Convention refugees and persons in need of protection.\n[2] The Principal Claimant was appointed as the designated representative for the minor claimants.\n[3] The Minister participated in these proceedings by appearing in person and submitting documents. After the final sitting of the oral hearing, the matter was adjourned for written submissions. The Minister's representative wrote in to notify the Panel that the Minister is not pursuing a 1F(b) exclusion. It then fell to the Claimants' counsel to make submissions on inclusion. He requested, and received, an extension of the deadline to do so and then filed his submissions. No responsive submissions were received from the Minister's representative, but since some confusion about the deadlines may have arisen from the Claimants' counsel's deadline extension, the Panel wrote to both representatives and provided new deadlines for the Minister's response and the Claimants' final reply. The Minister still provided no submissions or any communication whatsoever. This lack of attention to the matter on the part of the Minister's representative is unfortunate. However, the Panel must make a decision on credibility and inclusion, and the Minister's evidence is relevant. The Minister also made some written submissions with their disclosures. The Panel has therefore considered the Minister's disclosure and their written submissions.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The Principal Claimant alleges that she is at risk of persecution because she has violated China's family planning policies. She was allowed to have a second child because she is registered as a rural resident. After her second child was born she was trusted to handle her own birth control, but she became pregnant in mid-2012. Not wanting to lose this child to an abortion, she went into hiding at the home of a relative, leaving her husband at their registered address. The Principal Claimant's husband would receive notices for her to appear for family planning check-ups and he attended these appointments on her behalf, telling the authorities that she was at a job away from the area. Eventually the family planning authorities asked the Principal Claimant's husband to affirm in writing that he would accept the consequences if it were found that the Principal Claimant was avoiding examination because of a pregnancy.\n[5] The Principal Claimant's third child was born in XXXX, 2016 and the hospital informed the family planning authorities. The Principal Claimant was fined RMB120,000 and was forced to wear an IUD. The authorities told the Principal Claimant that if she were to become pregnant again she would be sterilized. The Principal Claimant had to attend family planning check-ups.\n[6] The Principal Claimant became pregnant again in XXXX, 2015. She went into hiding in XXXX to avoid her next scheduled checkup. The family planning authorities visited the Principal Claimant's husband and told him that if she is pregnant, an abortion and sterilization will be performed, and her other three children will be expelled from school. The Principal Claimant and her husband decided that she and the three children would leave China. They hired a smuggler who provided them with photo-substituted Canadian passports and traveled with them to Canada on April 4, 2015. They were admitted to Canada based on these false documents and later made inland refugee claims which were referred to this Division on April 23, 2015.\n[7] The Principal Claimant gave birth to her fourth child in Canada.1\nANALYSIS\n[8] The Principal Claimant provided a Chinese resident identity card for herself and a birth certificate for each of her three children.2\n[9] The Panel asked the Principal Claimant questions about her entry to Canada. The Panel asked her if she can remember the name that was in her Canadian passport. She testified that it was in English and that she cannot remember. The Panel asked her to clarify if she could read and understand the name at the time she used the passport, and she testified that she could not read it because it was in English. The Panel asked her if anyone told her the name verbally. She testified that the smuggler told her that the name was \"XXXX\" or \"XXXX\" but that she cannot remember. She also testified that she cannot remember if this was the first or last name, but she thinks it was the last name. She testified that she cannot remember what the first name was but that the smuggler told her at the time and it was an English name.\n[10] The Panel asked the Principal Claimant if she knows what names were in the passports used for her children. She testified that the smugger told her that they are English names. After being asked further clarifying questions, she testified that the smuggler told her the English names in the passports used for her children, but that she has no capability in English. The Panel asked her if the smuggler told her the family names in her children's passports and she testified that she cannot recall. She also testified that the smuggler's accent made it difficult to understand him.\n[11] The Principal Claimant testified that on entry to Canada she was not asked any questions by the immigration officer. She testified that she was prepared to pretend that the smuggler is her husband. The Panel asked her if she knows how she was able to enter Canada without being asked any questions and she testified that the smuggler handled it. The Panel asked her if the smuggler prepared her with any information in case she were to be asked more questions and the testified that he did not. The Panel asked her if, at the time, she wondered about how she would get through controls if she were asked any questions beyond her name and her assumed relationship with the smuggler. She testified that at that moment she forced herself to remember. Asked what specific information she forced herself to remember at the time, she testified that she remembered her assumed name and assumed relationship with the smugger. The Panel asked her if she wondered what she would say if she were asked her children's assumed names or her assumed husband's name. She testified that at the time she recalled her children's assumed names. The Panel found this confusing as she had earlier testified that the smuggler's accent made it difficult to understand her children's assumed names when he told her. The Panel asked her to clarify and then testified that a friend introduced her to the smuggler. She testified that her friend and the smuggler were from the same area and spoke the same dialect, so her friend helped her understand and memorize the names in her children's passports.\n[12] One of the screening forms that the Principal Claimant completed asks her to detail all of the travel documents used by the Claimants to travel to Canada. She noted four non-genuine Canadian passports with the names \"XXXX XXXX\" for one of them, and \"XXXX XXXX\" for the other three.3 The Panel informed the Principal Claimant about these forms and asked if she remembers what she wrote about these passports. Once it was made clear which forms the Panel was talking about, she testified that the \"consultant\" filled out the form. The Panel informed her that her responses on the form indicate that her children traveled on passports with the name \"XXXX\". The Panel asked her if her children traveled on passports with that name. She testified that because of the smuggler's accent he said \"XXXX\" or \"XXXX\". The Panel asked her if she recalls filling out a screening form and putting down the names that were in her children's passports. She testified that she does not remember doing this. The Panel asked her if she recalls if someone helped her complete such a form, to which she responded \"maybe.\" The Panel informed the Claimant that it was finding her evidence confusing, given that she first testified that she had trouble understanding the names because the smuggler had a strong accent, and then testified that her friend told her what the names were. The Panel showed her the form in question and asked her how the names were put on the form. She testified that the smuggler's accent was hard to hear, and that he speaks a different dialect. She testified that she had to put a name on the form so she used her understanding to put a name on the form.\n[13] The Principal Claimant wrote on the screening form that the Canadian passports are with the agent.\n[14] The Minister disclosed evidence showing that while six female adults entered Canada on April 4, 2015 at Pearson Airport with the surname \"XXXX\", no minors with the surname \"XXXX\" entered on that day.4 Needless to say, this contradicts the Principal Claimant's clear written statements of the names her children used to enter Canada.\n[15] In the Panel's view the Principal Claimant's evidence in this area is problematic for two reasons. First, the Panel finds her evidence about her use of false names and her entry into Canada to be not credible. The Federal Court has recognized that this Division can apply common sense and rationality in assessing the plausibility of a claimant's story.5 The Federal Court has also ruled consistently that this Division has the expertise and competence to assess the plausibility of the actions of both claimants' and their alleged smugglers during their travel to Canada.6 The Federal Court has upheld findings that a person using a false identity to transit border controls would learn this identity.7 The Federal Court has found it reasonable to believe that a smuggler would tell their client the name being advanced on their behalf.8 The Federal Court has found it reasonable to expect that a smuggler and client would have a contingency plan in case something goes wrong with their assumed identities in transit.9 The Federal Court has found it reasonable that a person cannot enter Canada without being asked any questions.10\n[16] The Panel finds the Principal Claimant's testimony regarding the assumed identities to be confusing. It was never clear whether she ever knew the names in her children's passports. At first it was only the smuggler telling her the assumed names, but the Principal Claimant then testified that her friend was the one who told her the assumed names. It is clear that at the time the Principal Claimant completed her screening forms she knew at least the family name (XXXX) used in her children's passports. The Principal Claimant appeared reluctant to even acknowledge that she gave this information on the form. The Panel also does not find it credible that the Principal Claimant would know the name when she completed the form but not know it at the hearing. In the Panel's view, this vagueness is an effort to deflect the Minister's evidence which shows that the Principal Claimant's original account of the names used to enter Canada is false.\n[17] In addition, the Panel rejects the Principal Claimant's evidence that she was able to enter Canada without being asked a single question, especially when traveling on a Canadian passport. As acknowledged by the Federal Court, it is reasonable to find this implausible. Finally, even if every part of the Principal Claimant's evolving story were believed, it appears from her evidence that she never knew the name being used by the smuggler, whose wife she was pretending to be. The Panel does not accept that the smuggler would not tell her this, and in failing to do so, make it so easy for them to be caught if they were asked even basic questions on entry to Canada. The Panel draws a negative inference.\n[18] The second broad reason to rejects the Principal Claimant's evidence about her travel to Canada relates to her failure to provide any evidence of her journey. She alleges that the smuggler kept the passports and she retained no evidence of this journey, such as boarding passes, an itinerary, or luggage tags. In Elazi, Mr. Justice Nadon, sitting at the time with the Federal Court, emphasized the importance of travel documents and tickets used to travel to Canada:\n17 I take this opportunity to add that it is entirely reasonable for the Refugee Division to attach great importance to a claimant's passport and his air ticket. In my opinion, these documents are essential to establish the claimant's identity and his journey to come to Canada. Unless it can be assumed that a refugee status claimant is actually a refugee, it seems unreasonable to me to ignore the loss of these documents without a valid explanation. In my view, it is too easy for a claimant to simply state that he has lost these documents or the facilitator has taken them. If the Refugee Division insists on these documents being produced, the facilitators may have to change their methods.\n18 Minimizing the importance of the passport and air ticket as documents to be produced or ignoring their non-submission for all sorts of reasons in my opinion only serves to encourage all those whose only purpose is to take advantage of a system which is intended solely to enable genuine refugees to come to Canada. 11\n[19] In Kaur, Mr. Justice Shore interpreted Elazi as follows:\n14 ... [Elazi] signifies that the Board is warranted in drawing a negative inference if the claimant does not present any of the travel documents which would assist in confirming the travel itinerary of the claimant.12\n[20] The Federal Court has applied Elazi in numerous similar cases, and has upheld negative inferences drawn by members of this division from claimants' failure to provide evidence of their travel to Canada.13 For this reason, the Panel draws a further negative inference.\n[21] The Federal Court has ruled in Joseph that a non-credible account of traveling to Canada can negatively affect a person's allegations as to their presence in, and departure from, their alleged country of nationality.14\n[22] As noted above, the Principal Claimant alleges that the family planning authorities asked the Principal Claimant's husband to affirm in writing that he would accept the consequences if it were found that the Principal Claimant was avoiding examination because of a pregnancy. The Principal Claimant provided this written declaration as evidence.15 The very idea of such a letter strikes the Panel as unusual. The Panel is familiar with the conditions in China and the brutal actions of the family planning authorities. China does not appear to be a place where the authorities would need such a letter in order to hold a person accountable for a breach of the family planning rules. The Panel put this to the Principal Claimant and asked her if she can explain why the authorities would have her husband agree to being held responsible when they clearly do not need his agreement. She testified that at the time she had the freedom to choose her contraception measures, and that the officials had them write the letter so they could show their supervisor in order to shift their responsibility. The Panel does not find this explanation to address the issue, which is that in China the authorities to not ask for consent in order to enforce the law. They simply enforce the law, and brutally so. Therefore, the Panel finds that this letter was fraudulently produced to be used as evidence in these claims. The Panel draws a negative inference.\n[23] The Principal Claimant produced a document called \"Proof of House Pledged as Collateral.\" It is a loan agreement wherein her husband borrows 20,000USD for the express purpose of helping the Principal Claimant to go abroad. The Principal Claimant also provided the land use document concerning the land in question.16 However, it indicates that the Principal Claimant's husband has a right to use the land but that he does not own it. The Panel asked the Principal Claimant how he can borrow against land he does not own. She testified that in China land use can transfer from one generation to the next, and that in the terms of use the property can be bought or sold. No objective evidence was furnished to corroborate this unusual practice. In the Panel's view, it is simply contradictory that a person living on borrowed property could borrow against that property. In addition, the Panel asked the Principal Claimant if she knows why her father would admit in writing that he is helping his daughter leave China at a time when she is avoiding the authorities. Despite being asked this question twice, she did not provide a responsive answer. The Panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the loan document was fraudulently produced to be used as evidence in these claims. The Panel draws a negative inference.\n[24] The Minister undertook forensic examination of the birth certificates provided for the Minor Claimants.17 The report is signed by an examining officer and a reviewing officer. The examining officer compared the birth certificates to reference materials. They found that the birth certificates do not display the security features that they should display, or that their security features are poorly reproduced. On the basis of these findings, the examining officer found that the birth certificates are \"probably counterfeit.\" The Principal Claimant was asked if she has any explanation for the forensic findings. She testified that she cannot explain the findings, and she affirmed that the documents were genuinely issued.\n[25] The Panel does not find it necessary to review each and every way in which the birth certificates' security features are deficient. The Panel trusts that as a CBSA document examiner, the examining officer would have access to reference materials that would show the correct security features to be found on a genuine document. The Panel agrees that the deficiencies identified by the examining officer justify a conclusion that the birth certificates are, on a balance of probabilities, counterfeit. The Panel so finds. A negative inference results.\n[26] The Panel acknowledges that the Principal Claimant provided DNA evidence proving that she is the biological mother of the minor claimants.18\n[27] After carefully assessing all of the evidence, the Panel finds that the Minor Claimants have failed to establish their identity on a balance of probabilities with credible or trustworthy evidence. Their primary identity documents are their birth certificates, which have been found to be counterfeit. In addition, the evidence about their travel and entry to Canada, which the Panel has found not credible, casts doubt on their credibility. The Panel has also drawn other negative inferences in respect of the Principal Claimant, who is the person who furnished the Minor Claimants' birth certificates. She has provided other fraudulent documents as described above. The Panel acknowledges that the Minor Claimants are also mentioned in the household registry booklet (the \"Hukou\"), and that this document has not been specifically impugned.19 However, there is consistent jurisprudence that when there are significant lapses in credibility along with the use of other fraudulent documents, a claimant's remaining documents may be rejected or given no weight.20 According to further jurisprudence, this is especially the case where there is evidence that fraudulent documents are available in the claimant's country.21 Fraudulent documents, including Hukous, are readily available in China.22\n[28] As noted by Mr. Justice Harrington in Farooqi:\n[10] As far as I am concerned, once the identity documents which were offered as being real were found to be fake, the matter came to an end. There was no duty on the part of the Board to submit other documents for analysis. A legitimate claimant might well have reason to carry fake identification, but no reason to proffer that fake identification as real. Was the next set of documents better fakes? The Board should not be treated as a training school in which counterfeiters can practice their craft.23\n[Emphasis added]\n[29] Chief Justice Crampton arrived at a similar conclusion in Teweldebrhan:\n[15] In my view, a valid reason for doubting the authenticity of an applicant's foreign identity documents is that other identity documents provided by the applicant have been established to be fraudulent or otherwise inauthentic. Another such valid reason is where the RPD has a reasonable basis for rejecting the credibility of explanations offered by an applicant with respect to one or more of his or her identity documents.\n[16] Stated differently, where the RPD is satisfied one or more of an applicant's identity documents have been fraudulently obtained or are otherwise inauthentic, the presumption that the applicant's remaining identity documents are valid can no longer be maintained. This is because the foundation for that presumption has been eroded.24\n[30] Mr. Justice Russell recently arrived at a similar conclusion in Wang.25\n[31] For these reasons the Hukou is given no weight.\n[32] As for the Principal Claimant, the Panel notes that the Minister did not take any issue with the genuineness of her identity card. Indeed, the Panel examined it and did not identify any deficiencies. The Panel is therefore prepared to accept that the Principal Claimant's identity is established. However, the Panel finds that she is not credible. She has supplied fraudulent documents for herself and her children. Her story about arriving in Canada is not credible and, pursuant to Elazi, Kaur, Joseph, and the other cases cited above, this negatively impacts her credibility and her allegation of residing in China. The Panel acknowledges that the Principal Claimant provided some other documents, such as medical reports, a fertility service card, and an invoice for a fine.26 However, these documents are given no weight because of the Principal Claimant's lack of credibility, the fact that she submitted fraudulent documents, and the availability of fraudulent documents in China. The Panel also notes that the Principal Claimant's claim is based entirely on the existence of her children, whose identity has not been established. It is true that they are her biological children, but given that the evidence she provided of their birth in China is fraudulent, the Panel does not believe the Principal Claimant's allegations of running afoul of the family planning authorities in that country. The Panel is not prepared to make the great leap to find that the Principal Claimant is still a refugee for the mere fact that she is a Chinese national who now has four biological children. Without the whereabouts of their birth and their nationality established, the Principal Claimant cannot establish that she faces a serious possibility of persecution, or a section 97 risk, in China.\n[33] For these reasons, the Panel finds that the Claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n[34] Pursuant to section 107.1 of the Act, the Panel also finds that these claims are clearly fraudulent, and therefore manifestly unfounded. There is little jurisprudence on this relatively new provision, but the Panel finds two Federal Court decisions to be instructive. In Wang, Justice Russell reviewed a decision where the RPD's credibility concerns were summarized thus:\n[15] The use of blank medical documents and a fraudulent marriage license to support the Applicant's claim seriously damaged his credibility, such that the Board could not rely on other documents provided or his testimony, particularly given that the very reason why the Applicant says he joined an illegal church was because of his medical issues. The Board reasoned that if the Applicant is willing to obtain false documents to support his claim, he is likely willing to provide false testimony and take part in Church activities to further support it. This issue was deemed egregious enough to dispose of the claim.27\n[35] The RPD found that this was sufficient to find that the claim was manifestly unfounded. Justice Russell upheld this decision.\n[36] In Warsame, Justice Roy conducted a thorough analysis, the seminal parts of which are reproduced here, with the Panel's emphasis:\n[27] Parliament chose to require that the claim be \"clearly fraudulent\" for particular consequences to flow. That would entail that it is the claim itself that is assessed as being fraudulent, and not the fact that the applicant would have used, for instance, fraudulent documents to get out of the country of origin or to gain access to Canada. However, once making a claim for refugee protection, the applicant would have to operate with clean hands and statements in support of the claim have to be accurate or they could be held against the claimant. In other words, the claimant would be attempting to gain refugee protection through falsehoods that may make the claim fraudulent. It is the claim that must be fraudulent.\n...\n[30] For a claim to be fraudulent, it would be required that a situation be represented of being of a certain character when it is not. But not any misstatement or falsehood would make a refugee claim fraudulent. It must be that the dishonest representations, the deceit, the falsehood, go to an important part of the refugee claim for the claim to be fraudulent, such that the determination of the claim would be influenced in a material way. It seems to me that a claim cannot be fraudulent if the dishonesty is not material concerning the determination of the claim.\n[31] If the word \"fraudulent\" signals the need for a misrepresentation of the truth or a concealment of a material fact for the purpose of getting another party to act to its detriment, I would have thought that the word \"clearly\" would go to how firm the finding is. For instance, Black's Law Dictionary (West Group, 7th Ed) defines \"clearly erroneous standard\" as \"a judgment is reversible if the appellate court is left with the firm conviction that an error has been committed.\" Similarly, clearly fraudulent would in my view signal the requirement that the decision maker has the firm conviction that refugee protection is sought through fraudulent means, such as falsehoods or dishonest conduct that go to the determination of whether or not refugee protection will be granted. Falsehoods that are merely marginal or are antecedent to the refugee claim would not qualify.\n[32] Without being binding on this Court, the UNHCR's Position on Manifestly Unfounded Applications for Asylum would offer some guidance given that the language used is similar to that found in s 107.1 IRPA. The applicant argues that the passage establishes that only in the clearest of cases can there be a conclusion that the claim for refugee status is clearly fraudulent. The relevant passage is reproduced at paragraph 19 of these reasons for judgment. The guidance is however of limited assistance to the applicant. It supports the contention that to be clearly fraudulent, there must be an attempt to deceive in a substantial or material manner with respect to the determination of the status. Though the use of forged documents to gain access to a country of refuge may be acceptable, that is not the case when relying on forged documents to obtain refugee status. The argument that only in the clearest of cases can a finding of \"clearly fraudulent\" be made is not supported by the very authority offered by the applicant.\n...\n[36] Here, this applicant was actively trying to portray himself as a refugee by dishonest means, including deceit, going so far as using birth and marriage certificates that were in the reasonable view of the RPD manifestly forged. Not every case where a story is not believed could be reasonably said to be clearly fraudulent. On the facts of this case, it was certainly reasonable for the RPD to reach that conclusion in view of a narrative that could reasonably be found to be deceitful in order to induce a course of action, and the use of forged documents. It was reasonable in this regard to have the firm conviction that fraudulent means were being used.\n...\nV. CONCLUSION\n[41] The narrow issue that must be decided in this case is whether the finding of \"manifestly unfounded\" is reasonable. The evidence in this case is so overwhelming that it does not test the limits of the meaning of \"clearly fraudulent.\" It was reasonable for the RPD to conclude that the applicant actively sought to obtain refugee status by fraudulent means, including falsehoods that go to the determination of the status. It was open to the RPD to find the narrative in support of the claim to be false.28\n[37] The Panel has found the Principal Claimant not credible. However, in addition to that she has attempted to use fraudulent birth certificates and other fraudulent documents to establish her claim and the claims of her children. In the Panel's view, this meets the requirements set out in the jurisprudence for these claims to be found clearly fraudulent. The Minor Claimants' identities go to the very core of all four claims. The genuineness of their primary identity documents is not a marginal or antecedent matter. These claims are therefore manifestly unfounded.\n[38] The claims are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"K.

They claim to be Convention refugees and persons in need of protection.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] The Panel determines that the Principal Claimant is a Convention refugee. The Panel determines that the Associate Claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The Principal Claimant alleges that she is a member of the XXXX XXXX XXXX, which used to govern Georgia but which is now in opposition. She alleges that her activities have resulted in several assaults from people acting at the behest of the XXXX XXXX XXXX, which is now in government. She has also been detained and threatened by government security forces on one occasion.\nIDENTITY\n[4] The Claimants presented their passports when they made their claims at the Canada-USA border on February 3, 2016. Based on these passports, the Panel is satisfied that the Claimants are who they say they are, and that they are nationals of Georgia.\nCREDIBILITY\n[5] The Panel finds the Claimants credible on a balance of probabilities. The Principal Claimant's testimony was reasonably consistent with the allegations she wrote in her Basis of Claim Form (BOC.) When the Associate Claimants testified, their evidence was reasonably consistent as well. The Principal Claimant provided a number of documents such as medical reports from her injuries and letters from the XXXX and a Georgian politician corroborating her involvement.1 She also provided a video of herself being interviewed on XXXX XXXX in Georgia speaking about her opposition to some government activities.2 No issues with implausibility arise in the Claimants' evidence. The Panel accepts the Claimants' allegations as true on a balance of probabilities.\nWELL-FOUNDEDNESS\n[6] In order to meet the definition of a Convention refugee, a claimant must establish on a forward looking basis that there is more than a mere possibility that they will be persecuted if they return to their country of nationality. In order to meet the definition of a person in need of protection, a claimant must establish that returning to their country of nationality would expose them, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture. The Panel finds that the Principal Claimant has established that she would face more than a mere possibility of persecution in Georgia on grounds of political opinion. There is objective evidence that perceived opponents of the current regime in Georgia are subjected to persecutory treatment, such as arbitrary detention and serious assaults.\n[7] However, the Panel finds that the Associate Claimants have failed to establish that their claims are objectively well-founded. Neither alleges any political involvement or political aspirations that would put them at risk. Neither alleges to have been subjected to any mistreatment as a result of the Principal Claimant's political opinions or activities. Counsel submitted that it is reasonable to conclude that if the Principal Claimant is attacked in the company of the Associate Claimants they may suffer as well. Counsel pointed out that the agents of persecution have demonstrated themselves to be violent and aggressive.\n[8] The Panel respectfully disagrees with these submissions. It is the repetitive nature of the harm to the Principal Claimant that makes it persecution. A single assault would not be persecution, nor would a single incident of detention. The possibility that a family member may be present for an incident does not satisfy the requisite threshold of a serious possibility of persecution. The Panel notes that there is no objective evidence that family members are targeted by government authorities in Georgia. The Panel also notes that despite the Principal Claimant being assaulted several times, threatened several times, and detained once, neither of the Associate Claimants has ever been assaulted, threatened, or detained a single time. For these reasons, the Panel finds that the Associate Claimants do not face a serious possibility of persecution in Georgia. For the same reasons, the Panel finds that returning to Georgia would not expose them, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture.\nCONCLUSION\n[9] The claim of XXXX XXXX is accepted.\n[10] The claim of XXXX XXXX is rejected.\n[11] The claim of XXXX XXXX is rejected.\n(signed)\n\"K.

The claimant used to play online games and became friends with two other players a few years ago. Eventually, the three men began sharing messages and posts through their social media profiles, discussing the unfair policies of the Chinese government and the illegal expropriation of people's land. In XXXX 2016, the claimant started forwarding these posts and commenting about the topic on discussion boards, as one of his relatives had his land expropriated recently. He discovered that his online accounts on the websites he visited were deactivated later that month.\n[4] On XXXX XXXX, 2016, the claimant's mother called to tell him that members of the Public Security Bureau (PSB) came to their home and accused him of forwarding anti-government messages online. The claimant later found out that his two friends, the online gamers, had been arrested. He confided in another friend who put him in touch with a smuggler. The claimant remained in hiding for two months while the smuggler made travel arrangements on his behalf. On June 19, 2016, the claimant travelled from China to Vancouver using his passport which contained a visa improperly obtained by the smuggler. The claimant made his claim for Canada's protection at the port of entry on June 20, 2016.\n[5] The claimant seeks protection because of fear of persecution on the grounds of political opinion as a result of his public stance against the government's land expropriation policy, among others, in China.\nANALYSIS\n[6] The determinative issue in this case is credibility.\nIdentity\n[7] In addition to his People's Republic of China Resident Identity Card (RIC),4 the original of which was seized by the Vancouver airport CBSA office, the claimant provided a copy of the family household register, or hukou,5 in support of his personal and national identity. Based on his testimony and the personal documentation submitted, the panel finds that the claimant provided sufficient credible evidence to establish, on a balance of probabilities, his identity as a national of China.\n[8] The claimant did not submit the passport on which he travelled from China to Canada into evidence as part of his claim. The lack of travel documentation, except for a boarding pass and luggage tags6 seized by CBSA at the port of entry, will be addressed by the panel separately as part of the credibility assessment.\nCredibility\n[9] While statements given under oath are presumed to be true, that presumption can be rebutted by contradictions or inconsistencies in the evidence.7 In assessing the claimant's credibility, the panel considered the decision in Orelien8 wherein the Federal Court of Appeal held that it is necessary for the claimant to establish that his evidence is probably credible or trustworthy, not just possibly so. The panel took into consideration the various factors that could affect oral testimony, including the milieu of the hearing room and the claimant's anxiety, cultural differences, level of education and sophistication, and the use of an interpreter.9\n[10] The panel \"also is entitled, in assessing credibility, to rely on criteria such as rationality and common sense.\"10 The onus is on the person making a refugee claim to present evidence that is credible on a balance of probabilities to support the allegations which form the basis of the claim. In this case the panel finds that the claimant has not met that onus.\n[11] While not every piece of evidence will be referred to in these reasons, the panel carefully considered the entirety of the evidence in reaching its decision.11\nClaimant's passport\n[12] The claimant did not submit the passport he used to travel to Canada into evidence. He testified that the passport was genuine and that he obtained it when he was sixteen years old, or some ten or more years ago. When the panel pointed out to him that the passport would have been about to expire in mid-2016, around the time that the smuggler was allegedly able to obtain a visa issued on it, the claimant stated that the passport was a replacement for an earlier one that had been misplaced. This response does not clarify whether the passport in question was issued ten years ago or more recently. Furthermore, the lack of a passport is a significant issue in this particular case, in that there is no record of a Temporary Resident Visa (TRV) application submitted under the claimant's personal identity, and no additional information was provided by the Minister, according to a CBSA response12 to an RPD inquiry under Rule 27.\n[13] The claimant testified that he left his passport in the garbage container on the plane upon landing at Vancouver airport, because he was afraid that he may be returned to China by Canadian immigration authorities if found with it in his possession. When questioned by counsel, the claimant stated that he was speculating that the PSB might have informed Canadian officials that they were seeking to arrest him. The panel rejects this explanation as internally inconsistent with the claimant's testimony about being able to exit China undetected while using his own passport thanks to the arrangements made by the smuggler.\n[14] The failure to provide a valid passport is an important matter in assessing the credibility of a claim. In addition to confirming a claimant's nationality and identity, a passport provides evidence of the route taken to Canada as well as previous travel, and therefore the claimant's location during the events that allegedly gave rise to the fear that forms the basis of a claim. The panel's view is supported by Mr. Justice Nadon's ruling in Elazi.13\n[15] The panel finds that the failure to provide his passport without a reasonable explanation, in addition to the other credibility concerns, impugns the claimant's overall credibility.\nSummons\n[16] When asked by the panel whether the PSB produced a summons when they informed his mother that he was charged with disturbing social order and spreading rumours, the claimant responded that as far as he knew, they showed the arrest warrant to his mother but did not leave it with her. He testified that the PSB would continue to make 2-3 visits a week to his home, recently reducing the frequency to about twice weekly.\n[17] The panel has before it country documentation which indicates that a summons may be left with an adult family member if the person being sought is absent.14 The panel accepts variations in police practices from one locality to the next and that authorities may not always leave documentation of their visit or that a person is wanted. However, as the PSB demonstrated a sustained interest in the claimant over a period of some fifteen months to date, seeking him at his home on a regular and frequent basis, and having arrested his two online contacts for the same activity, the panel finds that the PSB would have left a summons in the circumstances as described by the claimant if he were indeed wanted by the authorities.\n[18] The panel's conclusion is supported by the Federal Court decision of Zhang which upheld such a finding as reasonable in circumstances similar to this matter.15\nTravel on own passport while of interest to the PSB\n[19] The claimant testified that his exit from China on June 19, 2016 was facilitated by the smuggler. When questioned by the panel about passing through passport control at the airport when leaving China, the claimant responded that he was directed by the smuggler to line up at a particular kiosk. The claimant was able to recall at least two separate points of contact with customs officials, and that his passport was stamped when he showed it to the border official at Guangzhou. He stated that the smuggler did not provide many details on how he was able to arrange for the claimant to get a visa and exit the country undetected, only that he had seen a Canadian visa in his passport and was told to line up in front of a specific window, or kiosk, for check-in.\n[20] Here the panel notes the availability of documentary evidence concerning the efficiency of Chinese authorities and the presence of the Golden Shield Project.16 The panel finds that if the claimant were being sought by authorities for distributing anti-government messages online, thereby slandering state officials and disturbing social order, he would have been wanted for arrest regardless of whether or not a summons was issued against him, and would have then been identified while attempting to exit China on June 19, 2016 using his own passport and a visa issued in his own name, as he testified that he did.\n[21] Documentary evidence states that authorities control the exits of citizens and that travellers wanted by PSB are flagged in Policenet, the national computer network of policing to which airport authorities are also connected:\n[A]irport security officials have access to the Public Security Bureau of China's online database of citizens who have been convicted of crimes or are wanted by the authorities [also known as Policenet or the Golden Shield] ...\n... [Furthermore] the Chinese government checks the passports of citizens attempting to leave the country in order to ensure that they are suitable for foreign travel. Customs officials stamp the passports of citizens approved for foreign travel. Public security officials often confiscate passports held by individuals deemed unsuitable for foreign travel.17 [emphasis added]\n[22] The panel considered the claimant's testimony that the smuggler arranged his passage through customs undetected in light of the substantial documentary evidence which indicates that citizens' exits from China are closely monitored, as noted below:\nPolicenet, a component of the Golden Shield, stores a wealth of information on Chinese citizens and connects the various agencies and levels of command within the public security apparatus. This integrated system enables Chinese public security forces to effectively target and neutralize political dissidents.\nIn partial corroboration, the Chinese economist writing in Open Magazine affirms that \"Cisco's Policenet has been helping the [Chinese Communist Party]'s public security organs to ferret out political dissidents ... for years.\"18 [emphasis added]\n[23] The panel also acknowledges that there is systematic corruption in China,19 airport officials can be bribed, and regulations are not always applied evenly or consistently. The panel finds, however, that the substantial majority of the documentary evidence before it does state that authorities at airports conduct thorough screening of passengers, including evidence that passenger manifests are provided to the authorities in advance of flights departing China.20 The claimant testified that he exited China using a genuine passport validly issued to him in his own name. The panel finds that if the claimant were sought by the PSB, he would have been identified in the Golden Shield database and on the passenger manifests while attempting to exit China using his own passport, and concludes that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant is not wanted by PSB. The panel therefore draws a negative inference regarding the claimant's overall credibility.\n[24] The panel's finding is supported by case law: in Zeng, Su, and Cao,21 the Federal Court has supported findings that proceeding unimpeded through Chinese exit controls is inconsistent with being wanted by Chinese authorities. In addition, as the panel finds that the claimant exited China on his own identity documents, thus confirming that the authorities were not concerned with him, the panel finds that the claimant's identity as a person who publicly protested against the Chinese government, specifically against its land expropriation policy, online and is now wanted by the PSB as a result is undermined. This finding thus undermines the claimant's credibility as a person who fears persecution based on his alleged profile as an anti-government protestor.\n[25] The foregoing findings lead the panel to conclude that the claimant's allegations that he posted comments online and shared messages critical of the Chinese government, and is of interest to the PSB as a result, are not credible.\nDocuments issued after claimant sought by the PSB\n[26] The panel asked the claimant about the circumstances of obtaining his Resident Identity Card (RIC), which was issued on June 7, 2016,22 or while the claimant was in hiding from the PSB following their first visit to his home on April 15, 2016. The claimant testified that he had completed the application for the RIC at the public security office in person prior to being wanted, and that it was his friend who picked it up for him at a later date when it was ready.\n[27] The panel rejects this explanation as inconsistent with the country conditions evidence23 before it regarding the document issuance procedures in Fujian, the claimant's home province:\nApplicants first get their photographs taken at a spot set up by the public security authority in the area in which their household is registered. To get their picture taken, they are required to bring their household registration (hukou) booklet and their first-generation RIC... [Once the application is verified and the fee paid, the resident] is issued a receipt and a \"Resident Identity Card Pick-Up Voucher.\" After 30 working days, applicants go to a designated location to pick up their second-generation RIC and hand in their former RIC.24 [citations omitted]\n[28] The panel notes that, according to the country conditions information above, a resident must attend the local public security organ to submit an application as well as to pick up the newly issued RIC in person. The claimant later stated that his friend picked up his newly issued RIC from his home after it was mailed there from the local public security office. The panel rejects this explanation as well, as it is inconsistent with the issuance procedures referenced above.\n[29] In light of the claimant's ability to obtain a newly issued RIC from the local PSB office while allegedly wanted for arrest by the same local PSB authorities, and in light of a lack of a consistent and reasonable explanation for this ability, the panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant is not wanted by the PSB as a result of his online activities speaking out against the government's land expropriation policy.\n[30] The panel draws a negative inference to the claimant's overall credibility as a witness as a result of the above inconsistencies for which he was not able to provide satisfactory, reasonable explanations.\nSupporting documentation\n[31] The claimant submitted a dismissal notice from his employer25 and a letter26 from his uncle in support of the allegations of the claim. While the dismissal letter refers to the PSB accusations against the claimant, the reason for his dismissal appears to be an accumulation of unexplained absences, pending a written explanation from the claimant received by the company within three days.27 In addition, the document is a single page with black print and an ink stamp as its only, rather rudimentary, security feature, and therefore easily produced by anyone.\n[32] The hand-written letter from the uncle indicates that the claimant had been a frequent visitor at the writer's home until it was expropriated and demolished by the government, but makes no reference to the claimant's online activity or his pursuit by the PSB.28 The panel therefore assigns no evidentiary weight to the dismissal notice and the letter as documents corroborating the claimant's allegations.\n[33] Taking into consideration the lack of credible and reliable documentation in support of the allegations and the above credibility findings, the panel finds that the claimant failed to establish the material aspects of his claim: that he is sought by the authorities for taking part in posting and sharing online messages that were critical of the government's policies in China.\n[34] Based on the failure to document a link between the claimant's profile as an online poster who shared several articles critical of the Chinese government, and on the lack of a summons in light of the claimant's testimony that the PSB have vigorously been attending his home two to three times a week for the past year-and-a-half, the panel finds that the claimant is not wanted by the authorities.\n[35] The panel has drawn negative credibility inferences on the claimant's evidence regarding being sought by the PSBs and his online anti-government activity, central aspects of the claim. As per Sheikh,29 the panel finds that the cumulative effect of the negative inferences and findings on these central aspects undermines the claimant's overall credibility as a witness.\nCONCLUSION\n[36] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant has not satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, or that, on a balance of probabilities, he would be personally subjected to a danger of torture, or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, if he were to return to China.\n[37] The panel therefore determines that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee under section 96 nor a person in need of protection under subsection 97(1) of IRPA and rejects the claim.\n[38] The panel also finds that pursuant to subsection 107(2) of IRPA, the claimant provided no credible or trustworthy evidence on which a favourable decision could be made, and therefore there is no credible basis for the claim.\n(signed)\n\"M.

The claimants are citizens of Nigeria.\n[2] As three of the claimants are minors, the female claimant was appointed as the designated representative for the minor claimants.\n[3] The claimants alleged that both the principal claimant and the female claimant are bisexual, that this bisexuality was exposed and as such they fled to Canada. They further allege that since they have been in Canada the principal claimant is now at risk based upon past political involvement with his local government council.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] The panel finds that the claimants are not Convention refuges pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act nor persons in need of protection pursuant to section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[5] The panel finds that the claimants have not established, on a balance of probabilities, that either the principal claimant or the female claimant are bisexual and as such, they would not face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, nor a risk to life or of torture or cruel and unusual treatment, on a balance of probabilities.\n[6] Furthermore with regard to the principal claimant's alleged political activities, the panel finds that the claimants have a viable Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) in Lagos.\nISSUES\n[7] The determinative issues in this claim are credibility and Internal Flight Alternative.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[8] The Panel finds that the claimants have established their personal identities and their identities as citizens of Nigeria based upon their Nigerian passports, copies of which were provided to the Board by the Minister.1\nCREDIBILITY - THE CLAIMANTS HAVE NOT CREDIBLY ESTABLISHED ON A BALANCE OF PROBABILITIES THAT EITHER ADULT CLAIMANT IS BISEXUAL\n[9] The panel is aware that the sworn testimony of a claimant is presumed to be true unless there are reasons to doubt it. In this instance the panel finds that there are significant reasons to doubt the testimony of both adult claimants including inconsistencies, omissions and a failure to establish subjective fear. These will be discussed in turn.\nThe claimants' sexual orientation claim is internally inconsistent with their political opinion claim\n[10] The claimants' allege that both adults are bisexual and that their sexual orientation was exposed in XXXX of 2016.2 The principal claimant further alleges that he previously held a position as XXXX to a XXXX XXXX and was shot as a result. Thereafter he decreased or stopped his XXXX XXXX, but in early 2017 local youths began to call for him to return to XXXX XXXX and as a result his family was threatened and harmed in order to attempt to stop him from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.3 The panel finds that these two claims are inconsistent.\n[11] The panel asked the principal claimant about where his political involvement took place. He testified that the local government was in XXXX a city about two hours away from his ancestral home of XXXX. The panel asked the principal claimant where the youths were who wanted him to run for local government and he said it was a collective association of youths from XXXX and XXXX. The panel also asked the principal claimant about his allegation that his and his wife's sexual orientation had been exposed. He testified that both he and his wife's sexual orientation is widely exposed and that the community in XXXX, XXXX and even XXXX City (where he resided) knew. The panel also asked the principal claimant about his political party, which he identified as the XXXX XXXX of Nigeria, now the XXXX XXXX XXXX. He testified that his party, and all parties in Nigeria are opposed to homosexuality. Accordingly, the panel finds that it is inconsistent that on the one hand the principal claimant alleges that he and his wife have been exposed as bisexual and on the other hand there is a large outpouring of public support that the principal claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[12] The panel asked the principal claimant whether people would want him to run if they knew he was bisexual and he said he guessed not. The panel then put to the principal claimant that he had testified that everybody in XXXX and XXXX knew about his sexual orientation. The principal claimant then testified that perhaps the call for him to run again was just a ploy to get him to come back to Nigeria.\n[13] The panel does not find this explanation to be reasonable for several reasons. First, the principal claimant did not include this information in his BOC, which he amended with regard to his political claim.4 When this was put to the principal claimant he responded with a nonsensical answer about how his situation was a keg of gunpowder. The panel finds his answer was evasive. Moreover, the claimant was asked at length about what the political situation was currently and what he was being asked to do, and he testified he was being asked to come and contest the seat for local government. He did not mention that this might be a ploy until the panel put to him that it was inconsistent with his sexual orientation being exposed.\n[14] Given that the claimants submitted an article from the XXXX XXXX titled \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\" dated XXXX XXXX, 2017, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities the community does want him to run for local government, and therefore, the claimants' allegations about their sexual orientation being exposed are not credible on a balance of probabilities.\nSimilarities between the female claimant's BOC and the BOC in another claim undermine her allegation that she is bisexual and undermine her credibility\n[15] The central elements of the female claimant's narrative are substantively similar to that of the narrative presented in claim TB6-09447. So much so that the Board disclosed the narrative in that claim to the claimants prior to their hearing. The female claimant provided no reasonable explanation for this at her hearing. Furthermore, there were discrepancies in female claimant's testimony which closely aligned to the narrative in TB6-09447 which were not reasonably explained. For the following reasons, the panel finds that the similarities between the two claims were not reasonably explained and that this undermines the female claimant's allegation that she is bisexual and her credibility overall.\n[16] The female claimant and the claimant from TB6-09447 both allege that they became aware of their sexual orientation in their teenage years when they began to receive (or exchange) love notes with a female friend who eventually told them about same sex relationships as a way to avoid pregnancies. Both claimants later had a same sex partner with a cousin who knew about the relationship. Both claimants later discovered that the cousin of their former partner had now become the fianc\u00e9 of their brother-in-law. Both claimants told their husbands that they did not approve of the fianc\u00e9, which led to both brothers-in-law breaking off the engagement. Both fianc\u00e9s then exposed both claimants as a means of revenge or to repair their relationship with their future spouses. In both cases this is the reason that the claimants brought their claims.\n[17] The panel asked the female claimant about the similarities between her BOC and the BOC in TB6-09447. The female claimant testified that she wrote out her narrative and gave it to her former counsel and someone at her office typed it and gave her a typed one. She testified that when she first learned about the similarities between the two BOCs she asked her counsel if she gave the story to anyone and she did not get an answer. She also testified that the other person came after her. The panel asked whether the claimants were pursuing any allegation of incompetence against their former counsel and the claimant's said she could not say. Counsel then stated that he was not pursuing any complaint but he left it to the claimants to do so if they wished.\n[18] The panel does not find the female claimant's response reasonable. It is unreasonable for the female claimant to imply that her former counsel had something to do with the similar BOCs when she has taken no steps to complain about counsel. The Federal Court and the Board have set out procedures for dealing with allegations of incompetent counsel, and at the core of these procedures they involve notifying counsel of the allegation.5 The claimants, who are represented by new counsel, have not done this. Counsel stated that there was nothing on record, he had not pursued any complaint and he would let the claimants do so. They did not. Accordingly, the panel puts no weight in the allegation that former counsel was involved in the similarities between the BOCs. The panel finds that the lack of a reasonable explanation for the similarities in the BOCs undermines the female claimant's allegation that she is bisexual and undermines her credibility on the whole.\n[19] Moreover, there were inconsistencies with regard to the similar events which undermine the female claimant's assertion that the events happened to her. For example, the female claimant's BOC states that her relationship with her first same sex partner started after her friend cared for her during her menstruation and as a result the female claimant told her friend that she loved her and then \"small notes started between us.\"6 At the hearing the female claimant testified that after her menstruation she wrote a note to her friend saying thank you for caring for me and her friend wrote back saying she loved the female claimant. The panel put to the female claimant that her testimony was inconsistent with her BOC and she stated that she said she loved her friend for taking care of her so she was first. The panel then put to the claimant that this was different from her earlier testimony and the female claimant testified again she said she loved her friend. The panel finds this evasive.\n[20] Furthermore, this is similar to the BOC in TB6-09447 which states that the first same sex partner \"would tell me she loves me and drop me some notes.\"7 When the panel put this to the female claimant she again said that this is a problem with former counsel. As discussed above, the panel does not find this reasonable.\n[21] When the panel takes all these facts together: that the female claimant provided no reasonable explanation for the similarities between the two BOCs; that she gave inconsistent testimony about how her first relationship started and; that the inconsistency more closely resembles the narrative in the other BOC the panel finds that the similarity of the two BOCs undermines the female claimant's allegation that she is bisexual and undermines her credibility on the whole.\nThe claimants submitted documents which the panel finds on a balance of probabilities to be not genuine\n[22] The claimants submitted a number of documents which are unaccompanied by government ID, are written in the same unusual font and contain the same wording. They provided no reasonable explanation for these similarities, and for these reasons the panel finds that on a balance of probabilities they are not genuine documents.\n[23] The claimants provided two letters from the principal claimant's alleged same sex partners (XXXX and XXXX), which were written in the same font as a letter from the claimants' sister-in-law XXXX.8 None of these documents contained any government ID from the senders, but rather contained work ID cards for the senders. Moreover, two of the work ID cards (XXXX and XXXX) indicated that each worked at either XXXX XXXX XXXX, or XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.9 The claimant's said they had no comment as to these similarities and did not know why they occurred.\n[24] Moreover, the panel noted that the letter from XXXX used the phrase \"I use this medium to apologise...\" which was similar to a phrase in another document from a friend, in the United States, XXXX who stated \"I use this medium to appeal. . .\"10 The same phrase appeared in a letter written by the claimants to the board, who stated \"we use this medium once again to give...\"11 when the panel asked the claimants about this the answer was it is a coincidence. The panel finds this unreasonable.\n[25] Any one of these similarities could be a coincidence. However, when the panel takes the totality of these issues together the panel finds that on a balance of probabilities the above mentioned documents are not genuine. This is particularly so given the similarity in language between two of the letters and the claimants' own language. The panel finds that this further undermines the claimants' credibility and undermines their allegations that they are bisexual or that this bisexuality was exposed, on a balance of probabilities. This is particularly so as these letters come from alleged former same sex partners, the people who allegedly exposed the sexual orientation and the person who allegedly assisted the claimants in the United States.\nThe adult claimants' subjective fear and credibility is undermined by their previous failure to claim in the United States of America\n[26] Both adult claimants traveled to the United States in 2015 and stayed for three weeks. They did not file a claim for protection. The female claimant testified that this was because it was just a vacation. The principal claimant testified that he was scared of many things he did not know the outcome of the upcoming election and it was just a visit, he was comfortable. However both adult claimants testified that they were bisexual at the time of the trip and both knew about the risk or danger in being bisexual.\n[27] The panel finds that the adult claimants have not provided a reasonable explanation for their failure to seek protection when they had the opportunity to do so. Although the claimants might have been comfortable or just on vacation, they were aware of the persecution and risk to life that sexual minorities face in Nigeria. However, despite alleging to be bisexual and secretly having same sex partners, neither adult claimant made any attempts to take the opportunity for protection against the persecution they could face and the opportunity to openly live as bisexuals when it was readily available to them.\n[28] The panel finds it reasonable to expect that a person who is a genuine sexual minority would take steps to protect his or her life from future risk of harm and persecution if they were a national of a country where sexual minorities face such consequences, when such opportunities became available to them. The panel finds that adult claimants' failure to claim in the United States undermines their subjective fear and their credibility, with respect to their allegations that they are sexual minorities.\nThe principal claimant's testimony regarding his conduct of same sex relationships is internally inconsistent and implausible\n[29] For the following reasons the panel finds that the principal claimant's testimony regarding his conduct of same sex relationships is internally inconsistent and implausible.\n[30] The principal claimant testified that he did not have any evidence of his same sex relationships which pre-dated his refugee claim because he was extremely careful to hide his relationships. He testified that he destroyed cards he was given did not send text messages, did not take photos or keep them because he was scared particularly due to his political profile. However, on the other hand he told his wife, his friend XXXX his relative XXXX and his brother all that he was bisexual or had same sex relations. The panel asked the principal claimant why he would tell all these people if he was so scared about his sexual orientation being made public and he testified that these were people he trusted.\n[31] The panel finds the principal claimant's behaviour internally inconsistent and lacking in plausibility. On the one hand the principal claimant was so careful about hiding his relationships, and on the other hand he told at least four people about his sexual orientation. The panel finds this is lacking plausibility and undermines the principal claimant's allegations that he is bisexual. Moreover, when the panel asked about the friend \"XXXX\" who the principal claimant allegedly told his orientation to the principal claimant could not even remember XXXX full name. The panel finds that this further render's the principal claimant's testimony implausible. It is implausible that XXXX is someone he trusted enough to tell his secret to yet he could not remember his full name.\n[32] The panel is mindful of the fact that plausibility findings are to be made only in the clearest of cases and were this the only issue the panel could give the principal claimant the benefit of the doubt. However, given the other significant credibility concerns outlined above the panel finds that this implausibility further undermines the principal claimant's allegation that he is bisexual.\nConclusion Regarding Credibility of the Adult Claimants and their sexual orientation\n[33] Based upon the issues in the adult claimants' testimony and evidence the panel finds that neither adult claimant is a credible witness and therefore finds that neither adult claimant has established on a balance of probabilities that they are bisexual. The panel further finds that the remainder of the claimants' evidence is insufficient to ground this aspect of the claim.\n[34] First, the claimants submitted a number of documents which are not probative of the allegations in this claim. These include photographs, some of which allegedly include the female claimant's former partners, but which are not probative of any relationship between them.12 These documents also include birth certificates and attestations, marriage and business licenses and employment documents, none of which are probative.13 Finally, they include documents which confirm the principal claimant's uncle died and that XXXX and XXXX were married but are not probative to the allegations in the claim.14 The panel finds that as none of these documents are probative they do not establish the allegations in the claim on a balance of probabilities.\n[35] The claimants also provided a number of documents confirming their involvement in the LGBT community in Toronto. The panel gives these no weight as these organizations do not require an individual to be a member of the LGBT community to participate.15\n[36] The claimants also provided documentation from a lawyer, XXXX, who the principal claimant alleges is a long time close friend who assisted the family in escaping.16 The panel gives these documents no weight as the principal claimant could not recall Mr. XXXX name at the hearing. He could recall XXXX, but not that his first name is XXXX or that he also uses the name XXXX. The panel asked the principal claimant what Mr. XXXX full name was and he said \"Barrister XXXX\" referring to the profession of Mr. XXXX. Then the panel asked if Mr. XXXX had more than one name and he said yes, and that his name was XXXX XXXX. He then paused for a long time and stated he could not remember his other name. The panel finds this unreasonable given that the claimants and Mr. XXXX allege that they have had a relationship dating back years. Mr. XXXX documents name him as XXXX XXXX XXXX. Based on this issue the panel gives the documents from XXXX no weight.\n[37] The adult claimants also provided letters from family and friends who know about their alleged sexual orientation and from alleged former partners.17 The panel gives these documents no weight for two reasons. First, these documents include the documents discussed above which the panel has found to be not genuine on a balance of probabilities. Second as the Federal Court has confirmed it is a general principle that when there are significant reasons to doubt credibility, a claimant's corroborative documents may be given little weight.18 This is particularly so where there are indications of manipulation of documentary evidence, as is the case here. Accordingly, the panel gives these letters no weight and finds they are insufficient to overcome the credibility concerns noted above.\n[38] Finally the adult claimants provided the report of a psychotherapist which diagnoses the adult female claimant with symptoms consistent with PTSD, GAD and MDD, and a letter confirming the adult claimants have received counselling at XXXX XXXX XXXX.19 The panel does not take issue with the reported symptoms, however, the panel does not find these documents remedy the significant credibility issues discussed above. The panel notes that the claimants were given instructions to state if they could not understand a question or could not remember an answer. The adult claimants were both given opportunities for breaks and also told they could ask for breaks if they needed them. Counsel did not make any application to have either claimant designated as vulnerable. Accordingly, the panel finds that given the efforts made by the panel to assist the claimants in conjunction with the guidance of the claimants' counsel throughout the claimants' refugee process and the lack of initiative on the claimants' part to request any particular accommodations, the panel finds the credibility concerns that arose cannot be set aside and dismissed based on the psychological report.\n[39] Furthermore, the Federal Court has held that a psychiatric report cannot serve as a cure-all for any and all deficiencies in a claimant's testimony.20 As the panel has found the adult claimants to be lacking in credibility with respect to their allegations and as the psychotherapist's assessment is based upon those same allegations as recounted by the adult claimants, the panel gives the documents no probative weight in terms of establishing, on a balance of probabilities, the allegations in this claim or in overcoming the significant credibility concerns which arose.\nINTERNAL FLIGHT ALTERNATIVE\n[40] The second aspect of the claimants' claim is political. As discussed above, they allege that the principal claimant has recently been called on to run for local government and as a result his family has been harmed, threatened by the principal claimant's opponents that he should \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\"21 With regard to this aspect of the claim the panel finds the claimants have a viable Internal Flight Alternative in Lagos.\n[41] The panel has considered the totality of the evidence and finds that there is not a serious possibility of persecution for all claimants in Lagos, nor is it unreasonable for the claimants to relocate there.\n[42] The test to be applied in determining whether there is a viable IFA is two-pronged and both prongs must be satisfied for a finding that a claimant has a viable IFA. First, the panel must find that there is no serious possibility of the claimants being persecuted nor risk to life, danger of torture or of cruel and unusual treatment, on a balance of probabilities, in the suggested IFA. The claimant bears the burden of proof to show that there is a reasonable chance that persecution will occur in the entire country and specifically in the suggested potential IFA. Secondly, the panel must be satisfied that conditions in the suggested IFA are not such that it would be objectively unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimants, to relocate and reside there. The panel is satisfied that both prongs of the test are met in the proposed IFA location of Lagos.\nThe Claimants Would Not Face a Risk in Lagos\n[43] For the following reasons, the panel finds that there is not a serious possibility of the claimants being persecuted nor risk to life, danger of torture or of cruel and unusual treatment, on a balance of probabilities, in Lagos.\n[44] The panel finds that the principal claimant's testimony about the risk he would face in Lagos lacks credibility. The panel asked the principal claimant how he would be at risk in Lagos and he testified that he has to pay party dues which could allow him to be tracked because he has enemies in his party and because such dues might be public knowledge (i.e. available on the internet). The panel asked why this information was not in the principal claimant's BOC or any of his amended BOCs. He stated he could not put in everything he knew. The panel finds this unreasonable. The principal claimant was represented by counsel throughout the process, he provided a BOC and three amendments to his BOC and never added this information.22 The BOC includes the instructions to \"include everything that is important for your claim.\"23 The principal claimant is university educated. Accordingly, the panel finds it unreasonable that this information was omitted from the principal claimant's BOC and amendments. The panel finds that this omission undermines the credibility of the allegation that the principal claimant could be tracked through his party dues.\n[45] Moreover, the panel notes that the claimant was involved in local politics and that he acknowledged that the local government is entirely different in Lagos. The principal claimant testified, in questioning from his counsel, that if he was involved in local politics in another city then his political enemies would be able to find him because of the publicity in that. However, the panel does not find this exposes the claimants to more than a mere possibility of persecution or to a risk to life, risk of torture or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment on a balance of probabilities. According to the principal claimant's BOC the risk is based on his opponents' desire that he not be involved in local politics in XXXX region.24 This is because they desire that the PDP linked candidate, XXXX should have control of the region. Accordingly, the panel finds it is not in line with the evidence for the principal claimant to state that involvement in Lagos would expose him to a risk.\n[46] Therefore, for these reasons the panel finds that the claimants would not face a serious possibility of the claimants being persecuted nor risk to life, danger of torture or of cruel and unusual treatment, on a balance of probabilities, in Lagos.\nIt is not unreasonable for the claimants to relocate to Lagos\n[47] For the following reason the panel finds that it is not unreasonable for the claimants to relocate to Lagos.\n[48] While the panel acknowledges that relocation is difficult and that there is some discrimination in Nigeria against non-indigenous persons, the panel finds that given the adult claimants' profiles it is not unreasonable for them to relocate. Both adult claimants are university educated, they both have employment histories, and the principal claimant has even owned his own business.25 Both adult claimants speak English well enough to complete their basis of claim forms in English and to testify (for the most part) in English. English is the de facto national language of Nigeria.26 The claimants clearly have some financial resources, as the principal claimant testified he had a compound in XXXX and a home in XXXX City. They have demonstrated their resourcefulness in relocating first to the United States and then to Canada. Accordingly, the panel does not find it unreasonable for the claimants to relocate to Lagos.\n[49] The principal claimant did testify that he would not have the same political influence in Lagos as he would have in his own area. He testified that his value would not be felt in another area and it would be difficult to have any import in another place because he is not well known and therefore it would be difficult. The panel does not find this would render it unreasonable for the claimants to relocate. While the panel acknowledges that the principal claimant might not have the influence in Lagos he did in his home area the panel finds that this is not the principal claimant's fundamental right. His right is to be politically active and to be able to support the party of his choice. The principal claimant testified that his party is present across Nigeria and the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, there is no reason that the principal claimant cannot support his party in the local government in Lagos.\n[50] The Federal Court has held that the threshold for the 'objectively unreasonable' standard is very high and requires, at a minimum, the proof of adverse conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of the claimants in relocating to a safe area, and that the claimants are required to produce actual and concrete evidence of such conditions.27 The panel finds that the claimants have not provided such evidence. Accordingly, the panel finds that it would not be unreasonable for the claimants to relocate to Lagos.\nTHE MINOR CLAIMANTS' CLAIMS ARE BASED UPON THE ALLEGATIONS OF THE ADULT CLAIMANTS AND THEREFORE MUST FAIL\n[51] The panel has considered the claims of the three minor claimants. However, as their claims are based upon the allegations of their parents, and as the panel has found the adult claimants in this claim to be lacking credibility, and to have an IFA, the panel finds that the minor claimants have not established any allegations on a balance of probabilities which would found a claim for protection. The panel notes that the oldest minor claimant did provide brief testimony at the outset of the hearing, but finds that his testimony is not sufficient to overcome the issues raised above.\nCONCLUSION\n[52] For the foregoing reasons, the panel concludes that the claimants would not face a serious possibility of persecution, throughout Nigeria, on a Convention ground should they return to Nigeria.\n[53] For the same reasons, the panel concludes that the claimants would not personally face a risk to life, a risk of torture, or a risk of cruel and unusual punishment, on a balance of probabilities, throughout Nigeria, should they be returned to Nigeria. Accordingly, the claims are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Erin Bobkin\"\nErin Bobkin\nApril 11, 2017\nDate\n1 Exhibit 1\n2 Exhibit 2\n3 Exhibit 14\n4 Exhibit 14 and Exhibit 18\n5 March 7, 2014, Procedural Protocol, Re Allegations Against Counsel or Other Authorized Representative in Citizenship, Immigration and Protected Person Cases before the Federal Court and Guide to Proceedings Before the Immigration Division - Chapter 8: Right to Counsel\n6 Exhibit 2\n7 Exhibit 13\n8 Exhibit 10 pages 20. 25 and 29\n9 Exhibit 10 pages 21 and 29\n10 Exhibit 10 pages 29 and 30\n11 Exhibit 16\n12 Exhibit 8 Item 3\n13 Exhibit 10 item 15, Ex 10 Item 17, Ex 15 Item 31, Ex 15 Item 32\n14 Exhibit 10 Item 16, Ex 10 item 18\n15 Exhibit 8 item 2, Ex 10 item 14\n16 Exhibit 10 Item 10, and Ex 19 Item 36, Ex 10 Item 13\n17 Exhibit 8 Item 1, Ex 10 Item 4 Ex10 Item 6, Ex 10 Item 12, Ex 10 item 5, Ex 10 Item 7, Ex 10 Item 8, Ex 10 item 11, Ex 10 Item 9, and Ex 20 item 41\n18 Diaz v.

In XXXX 2016, he was threatened by members of the XXXX at his place of work. Approximately six days later, the claimant went to the police station to try to obtain protection. The claimants did not believe the police were interested in the case.\n[4] On XXXX XXXX, 2016, the claimants travelled to Miami, United States (U.S.). The claimants had previously obtained visas because they were planning on taking a vacation.\n[5] On September 12, 2016, the principal claimant travelled to Canada and initiated this claim for protection alleging a fear of persecution by the XXXX for failing to cooperate with them.\n[6] The female claimant had returned to Colombia. She travelled back to the U.S. on XXXX XXXX, 2016. On October 31, 2016, she initiated this claim for protection at the Canadian border.\nDETERMINATION\n[7] The panel finds the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. The issues include credibility, lack of nexus, generalized risk, and state protection.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[8] The claimants established their identities as nationals of Colombia through testimony and the documentation filed, including copies of their Colombian passports and visas to the U.S.4\nCredibility\n[9] The onus is on the claimants to establish their claim for refugee protection. The panel did not find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants provided sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence in support of their allegations of persecution in Colombia.\n[10] While answers given in a BOC may be brief, they should be complete with all of the relevant facts. It is not enough for a claimant to say that his oral testimony is an elaboration; all relevant and important facts should be contained in the BOC, and the oral evidence should go on to explain that information. In this case, the panel found the claimants' testimony and allegations to be very vague and evasive. For example, the panel repeatedly had to ask follow up questions requesting the claimants to elaborate and provide specific details as to the allegations and timeline of events, including the claimants' travel plans to leave the country. These issues added to the panel's concerns with the credibility of the allegations of persecution.\nFailure to Claim in the United States\n[11] The panel asked the claimants to explain why they did not seek asylum in the U.S. The principal claimant responded they do not have any relatives in the United States. The panel did not find this explanation to be reasonable under the circumstances, especially for someone alleging a fear of persecution and possibly death. The panel finds it is reasonable to expect a claimant under these circumstances to seek protection without delay and at their first available opportunity, particularly for someone alleging a risk to their life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. The panel notes the adult claimants are not unsophisticated people. They are well-educated and had already obtained valid visas to travel to the U.S. Accordingly, while not determinative on its own, the claimants' failure to seek protection in the U.S. (and\/or to even enquire about seeking asylum), and the corresponding response for not doing so, added to the panel's concerns with the credibility of the claimants' allegations of persecution.\nRe-Availment Back to Colombia\n[12] The female claimant returned to Colombia in XXXX 2016. She testified she did so because she was working on a big project for work that she needed to complete. The panel did not find this to be a reasonable explanation under the circumstances. The claimants are alleging a fear of persecution and possibly death if returned to their country. The female claimant's return back to Colombia primarily for work purposes added to the panel's concerns with the credibility of the claimants' allegations of persecution.\nTimeline of Events\n[13] The panel had other concerns as to the credibility of the claimants' story, including the timeline of events. The claimants were issued visas to travel to the U.S. on XXXX XXXX, 2016. The alleged incidents involving the XXXX occurred in XXXX 2016. The claimants left Colombia in XXXX 2016. The panel asked the claimants to explain the timeline of alleged incidents coinciding with their travel plans. The principal claimant simply responded the timing was a \"coincidence\". His explanation did not have a ring of truth. This added to the panel's concerns with the credibility of the allegations of persecution.\n[14] The claimants allege a fear of the XXXX. The problems with the XXXX occurred on XXXX XXXX and XXXX, 2016. There were no prior incidents and no other XXXX at the principal claimant's workplace were targeted. The panel found the allegations involving the XXXX to be very vague and based upon very limited interactions -at best. Further, there were no written threats from the XXXX. The panel therefore also carefully considered the country documents, particularly regarding the XXXX. The documents describe the \"significant progress\" of the government's peace negotiations with the XXXX, including an agreement on transitional justice and a timeline for the disarmament etc.5 The panel accordingly asked the claimants to further explain why they would be of any current interest to the XXXX. The principal claimant responded, \"primarily because of my profession as a XXXX\". The panel asked the claimant again to explain why the XXXX would be interested in him. He responded because he refused to work for them. The panel did not find the claimant's response to be persuasive under the circumstances. As indicated, the panel also considered the country documents, including descriptions of person of interest and\/or \"targets\" of the XXXX. For example, the country documents describe, the \"most common\" reason a person is declared a \"military objective\" to the XXXX is to \"eliminate the presence of a leader or prominent person in the community.\"6 The panel gives more weight to this objective country documentation as compared to the vague testimony and letters sent from Colombia, including from the female claimants' parents, in terms of establishing the allegations of persecution by the XXXX. The claimants similarly failed to establish they are leaders or prominent in the community and therefore targeted by the XXXX.\n[15] Upon a review of the evidence, the panel accepts the principal claimant was a XXXX in his country. However, the panel does not find the claimants provided sufficient trustworthy and credible evidence to establish their allegations of persecution, including their allegation of being threatened and targeted by the XXXX due to the principal claimant being a XXXX or otherwise.\nNo Nexus - Section 96 of the Act\n[16] Even if the panel had accepted the claimants' allegations, the panel does not find the claimants established having a nexus to a Convention refugee ground, including any political element - imputed or otherwise. The claimants suggested they were targeted so the XXXX could transport illicit goods, such as drugs. Even if the panel accepted this allegation, the claimants' fear of harm is that of a crime and does not meet the definition of a Convention refugee. The claimants also failed to establish falling into any risk profile group, including as XXXX. Finally, simply being fearful of gangs or groups such as the XXXX does not meet the established criteria to be considered a member of a 'particular social group'.\n\"Generalized Risk\" Exception - subparagraph 97(1)(b)(ii) of the Act\n[17] Similarly, the panel finds the claimants failed to establish that the risk of crime they face is not one \"faced generally by other individuals in or from that country.\" The panel finds the claimants' risk is a general risk of crime faced generally by other persons in Colombia. In this regard, the panel carefully reviewed the country documents. There is clearly a widespread risk of crime and extortion in Colombia. As the jurisprudence indicates, in a country such as Colombia where crime is widespread, the claimants may face a generalized risk of harm even though they may have been repeatedly victimized and faced escalating violence; continued to be pursued after not complying with the demands of the criminals; and face reprisals for not complying with the demands of the criminals or after reporting them to the police. For example, the claimants in the case of E.A.D.S. v. M.C.I7 were successful business owners targeted for extortion by a criminal gang. On one occasion, the female claimant was robbed and raped. The Court held the Board was correct to conclude the rape was an act of violence that flowed from the generalized criminality experienced by those being targeted by criminal gangs.\n[18] The court also upheld the Board's finding of generalized risk in Flores Romero, Damian v. M.C.I.8 The claimant had been extorted by police officers who turned out to be members of the organized crime group, Los Zetas. The claimant continued to face extortion threats after he reported the group to police and refused their extortion demands. The claimant was beaten, hit by a van, and his family was threatened with death. The Court held:\n[c]ounsel, creatively, argues that the fact that the applicant sought to resist the extortion by reporting it to the police makes him unique, or brings him within a unique or discreet sub-group of the general population and hence within subsection 97(1)(b)(ii). In my view, the risk or threat of reprisal cannot be parsed or severed from the demand for payment. The act of criminality is established on the demand of payment and implicit or explicit threat of reprisal for failure to pay. The fact that the threat is implemented or the victim reports the extortion does not bring them outside of the operative words of subsection 97(1)(b)(ii), namely whether the threat they face is generalized.9\n[19] In light of the foregoing, the panel concludes the risk the claimants face is not different than the generalized risk of violence and extortion faced by all citizens in Colombia, including XXXX, as well as those perceived to be wealthy.10 Therefore, pursuant to subparagraph 97(1)(b)(ii) of the Act, which excludes a risk that is \"faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,\" the panel determines the claimants are not persons in need of protection.\n[20] Finally, even if the panel's assessment of credibility, lack of nexus, and generalized risk are found unreasonable, the panel finds that state protection would be available to the claimants should they return to Colombia and be threatened in any way. State protection is determinative under both sections 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Act.\nState Protection\n[21] The burden of proof to establish the absence of state protection is directly proportional to the level of democracy in the state in question.\"11 A claimant from a democratic country has a heavy burden when attempting to show that they should not have been required to exhaust all of the recourses available to them domestically before claiming refugee status.12 The country documents clearly indicate Colombia is a democracy, including having free elections.13\n[22] While the claimants submitted there is no state protection available in their country and the principal claimant complained he was not provided with two or three police officers to escort him at all times, the panel gives more weight to the country documentation as outlined below. The panel notes the standard of state protection to be considered - adequate protection - is not the same as a guarantee of perfect protection. No state can guarantee perfect protection, much less provide two or three police bodyguards. State protection does not have to be perfect, with the applicable standard being whether the police make serious efforts to protect its citizens and that such measures have been implemented and shown to be effective.14 In this regard, the panel carefully reviewed the claimants' country documents and the documentation in the Board's National Documentation Package (NDP), including the recent Response to Information Requests (RIR) provided to the Board on the subject of state protection in Colombia.15 The NDP information is drawn from a wide range of objective governmental and non-governmental sources. The Board recognizes there are some inconsistencies among sources within the documentary evidence, however, the preponderance of the objective evidence suggests that, although not perfect, there is adequate state protection in Colombia for victims of crime, including victims facing threats by criminal groups and that Colombia is making serious efforts to address the problem of criminality and that those measures have resulted in adequate protection.\n[23] The country documents describe the government of Colombia continues to make serious efforts to improve state protection in the country, including improving human rights and addressing issues such as corruption, including prosecuting and punishing officials who committed abuses, although some impunity persisted. For example, the United Kingdom Foreign & Commonwealth Office described in a recent report published in March 2015:\nPresident Santos began his second term on 7 August, and displayed a strong commitment to addressing human rights. His new cabinet included a new Ministry for Postconflict, Security and Human Rights within the Presidency, headed by General Oscar Naranjo, former Chief of Police in Colombia. The conversion of the Presidential Programme of Human Rights into a High Advisory Office within the Presidency also raised the status of the issue. Guillermo Rivera, coauthor of the Victims and Land Restitution Law which deals with reparations to victims of the conflict, was appointed as Presidential Advisor on Human Rights. These institutional changes have made human rights a priority issue across the Colombian government, and demonstrated the real political will to improve the current situation...16\n[24] There are several government agencies and programs currently available to those seeking state protection in Colombia, such as the National Police of Colombia, the Administrative Department of Security, and the Corps of Technical Investigators (CTI) of the Office of the Attorney General.17 These agencies receive complaints of crimes including threats, harassment, extortion, terrorism, and kidnapping. The government also increased the resources of the Prosecutor General's Office and created the Protection and Assistance Program for Victims and Witnesses. The National Protection Unit also provides protection measures and relocation assistance for victims and witnesses of crime. Colombia also has mechanisms specifically aimed at combating kidnapping, including the Anti-kidnapping and Anti-extortion Directorate, and the National Kidnapping and Extortion Unit of the Office of the Attorney General. The Unified Action Groups for Personal Freedom (GAULA) encompasses a collaborative unit comprised of personnel from the CTI, the Office of the Attorney General, the Armed Forces, and the Administrative Department of Security. The claimants made no efforts to seek access to any of these government agencies and programs other than one report to the police. The panel notes the Colombian army also shares responsibility for law enforcement in the country, as well as providing logistical support and security for criminal investigators to collect evidence in high-conflict or hard-to-reach areas.18\n[25] The claimants made one report to the police then they simply left the country within days. As stated by the Court in Montemayer Romero, the claimant must give the authorities sufficient opportunity to respond to the request for assistance.19 Further, the police cannot be faulted for not offering protection when crimes are not reported to them and\/or full details are withheld from them. In this case, the claimants simply left the country within days of making their report. Moreover, the claimants had already applied for and acquired visas to travel to the U.S. The panel has already outlined its concerns about the credibility of these alleged incidents having taken place, including the plausibility of the timing of the alleged incidents and the claimants' planned vacation to the U.S. coinciding being just a coincidence.\n[26] In light of the foregoing, on the totality of the evidence, and after considering the entire body of documentary and oral evidence, the panel finds that the claimants have not provided clear and convincing evidence that Colombia would not be reasonably forthcoming with adequate protection to protect them.\nCONCLUSION\n[27] Thus, the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n[28] The claims are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"D.

Sullivan\nConseil du (de la) ministre\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nINTRODUCTION AND ALLEGATIONS\n[1] The claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is a XXXX-year-old stateless Palestinian who lived in Biet Oula in the West Bank of the Palestinian Authority lands from 2009 until her departure on XXXX XXXX, 2016. Before that she lived in Israel, where she was born, with her parents who now like the claimants also live in Biet Oula along with her older brother and two sisters. The claimant said she is not an Israeli citizen, like her father who is also not a citizen of Israel and is likewise a stateless Palestinian. She said that between 2006 and 2009 she had to renew her residency status every six months. Her mother and sister are Israeli citizens. However, since 1980 children of stateless Palestinians are not permitted to obtain citizenship in Israel, even if the mother is an Israeli citizen.1 Both minor claimants were born in Biet Oula and never lived in Israel.\n[2] The claimant's husband obtained Permanent Residency status in Canada through his father in 2011. He travelled back and forth multiple times between the West Bank and Canada from 2011 and 2016 until finally settling in Canada in April 2016. The claimant and the two minor claimants stayed behind all this time in the West Bank. The claimant did not allege that her husband was targeted, or that he experienced harassment or discrimination in the nature of persecution during his time in the West Bank.\n[3] The claimant said she first experienced problems outside of Biet Oula on XXXX XXXX, 2016, when she was going shopping with the minor claimants. She said she was stopped at a military checkpoint by Israeli soldiers and harassed and delayed for three hours. The claimant knew of a Palestinian woman who was shot and injured at a checkpoint and later jailed after a XXXX 2015 incident. The claimant said in another incident when she went to drop off one of the minor claimants at school in XXXX 2016 she was frightened at a checkpoint by Israeli soldiers and settlers.\n[4] The claimant said that due to lengthy and expensive Canadian immigration conditions such as the need for the establishment of employment for one year by her husband, he could not sponsor the claimants. The claimants left the West Bank on XXXX XXXX, 2016, and three days before their departure a Palestinian resident of Biet Oula was killed by Israeli soldiers and settlers. She said another Palestinian resident was also killed by the same parties in XXXX 2016.\n[5] The minister's representative alleged in written comments before the hearing that the claimant's husband obtained Canadian residency status in 2011 and married the claimant on XXXX XXXX, 2009, which was not disclosed at the time of the 2011 application.2 He alleged that the claimant's husband returned to and remained in Palestine after sustaining workplace injuries in Canada earlier in 2012. The minister alleges that the claimant has not provided a legitimate explanation why her spouse never attempted to sponsor her. He added that the claimant's spouse came to Canada shortly before his Permanent Resident card expired on XXXX XXXX, 2016. The minister alleges that the claimant is using the refugee system for the sole intent of securing permanent residency status in Canada and is undermining the integrity of the refugee protection system.\n[6] Counsel in his written submissions stated that the minister's representative's comments were about a third party and not relevant to the proceedings and beyond the mandate of the Refugee Protection Division. He added that the claims had to be considered on their own merits.\n[7] The claimant said she and the minor claimants fear returning to the Occupied Territories because of being previously stopped at checkpoints and the possibility of ongoing violence affecting Palestinians like her and the minor claimants. The claimant also said she cannot return to Israel because after she left there she married a Palestinian and became like him a stateless Palestinian. The claimant and the minor claimants all claim refugee protection pursuant to subsections 96 (b) and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.3\nDETERMINATION\n[8] I find that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection for the reasons that follow. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX acted as designated representative for the two minor claimants.\nIdentity\n[9] The claimant's identity was established by her testimony and personal documentation.4\nThe minor claimants' identities were established by the claimant's testimony and personal documentation.5\nCountries of reference\n[10] Applying Maarouf,6 the countries of former habitual residence of the claimant are the West Bank in the Occupied Territories and Israel. The claimant has lived in the West Bank from 2009 until 2016 and she was born in Israel and lived there as a stateless Palestinian: her father is a stateless Palestinian like her.\n[11] For additional reasons to follow, I find that the claimant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution in the Palestinian Authority lands in the West Bank where she most recently lived for seven years. I also find that she cannot return to Israel according to her testimony corroborated by the documentary evidence and considering counsel's submissions. Her ties with Israel are now terminated. However, the latter is a moot point since the claimant has not fully met the test set out in Thabet,7 namely, in the case of multiple countries of former habitual residence, to also demonstrate a reasonable chance of persecution in one country of former habitual residence (the West Bank of the Palestinian Occupied Territories) in addition to her inability to return to her other country of former habitual residence (Israel).\n[12] The minor claimants have lived only in the West Bank and it is therefore their only country of reference, as their country of former habitual residence. For reasons that follow, I also find the minor claimants do not have a well-founded fear of persecution in the Palestinian Authority lands in the West Bank.\nANALYSIS\n[13] I concur with counsel that these claims have to be considered on their own merits despite what may or may not have been the claimant's husband's intentions or motives to do an end run around Canada's immigration regulations.\n[14] The overall documentation on the Palestinian community in the West Bank demonstrates documented instances of discrimination and harassment by the occupying Israeli government soldiers and settlers coupled with retaliation from Palestinian militants. This wave of violence disproportionately affects Palestinians but violence emanates from both factions. For example:\n\"Since 1 October 2015, Israel and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, have witnessed the most significant wave of violence since the end of the second intifada in 2005. More than 225 Palestinians and three foreign nationals were killed by Israeli forces over the past year, most of them during suspected, attempted or actual attacks against Israeli soldiers, police and civilians. At least 35 Israelis and two foreign nationals were killed in the same period by Palestinian attackers.\"8\n[15] I conclude the overall evidence on country conditions does not on a balance of probabilities represent a systemic persecution of all Palestinians in the West Bank and in this case I must examine the particular circumstances of the claimants.9\n[16] Moreover, I must also assess the particular profiles of these claimants before me. I find this claimant through her particular profile, which was submitted post-hearing as being a woman without a male protector, has not established a well-founded fear of persecution based on her specific circumstances. I find she experienced some harassment and discrimination (for example, being stopped, inconvenienced and frightened at checkpoints for several hours). However, I find that such incidents do not amount to persecution, even when considered cumulatively and in the context of her ability to have lived for seven years in Biet Oula from 2009 and 2016 with the minor claimants and for the most part with her husband without incident until 2016. I find that she experienced delays at checkpoints but overall was not denied the ability for her to work if she wished, or for the minor claimants to go to school, access medical care or have shelter. She noted several Palestinians who had been killed or jailed in her village. However, I find these persons were not similarly situated and the examples given are of the nature of random and ongoing acts of general unrest and violence in the area unconnected to her particular situation.\n[17] The claimant said her situation changed after her husband left and she took a more active role in her family's affairs and counsel submitted she became a woman without a male protector who is now more vulnerable at checkpoints and when going out. In this regard I have considered the Chairperson's Guidelines for Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution10 and how it relates to the claimant who counsel submitted was without a male protector.\n[18] The claimant said after her spouse left permanently in XXXX 2016 before his Canadian residency permit expired she took a more active family role and that is when she experienced her problems. Counsel also raised in his post-hearing written submissions that the claimants have no \"mashram\" or male family member to protect them.11 However, neither counsel nor the claimant addressed or presented evidence on the fact that according to the claimant's own amended Basis of Claim form the claimant's father and older brother live in the same village as the claimant.12 The onus is on the claimants through counsel to present their case. Moreover, for the reasons provided, I have concluded that after her husband left the claimant did not experience discrimination and harassment amounting to persecution when the incidents are considered individually or cumulatively.\n[19] I conclude this finding also pertains to the minor claimants whose claims are totally dependent on the claimant. The claimant said they had experienced bad dreams because of what they had witnessed and they had all been inconvenienced at checkpoints. However, I conclude that these experiences although regrettable do not amount to discrimination or harassment amounting to persecution even on a cumulative basis.\n[20] I conclude there is no serious possibility of persecution should the claimants return to the West Bank of the Palestinian Authority lands. Likewise, I have concluded on a balance of probabilities that the claimants would not be subjected personally to a danger of torture or to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment upon their return respectively to Palestinian Authority lands.\nCONCLUSION\n[21] For all of these above reasons I conclude that the claimant and minor claimants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. I find that they have not established a well-founded fear of persecution or that they would be subjected personally to a danger of torture or to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\n[22] The claims of the claimant and the minor claimants are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"L.

The claimants are citizens of Turkey and are claiming refugee protection to ss. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act1 (IRPA).\n[2] These claims were heard jointly pursuant to Rule 552 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules.\n[3] In accordance with s.167(2)3 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the Refugee Protection Division designated the principle claimant to be the representative for the minor claimant for the purpose of this refugee claim.\n[4] In deciding this claim, the panel considered the Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender Related Persecution.4\nDETERMINATION\n[5] The panel finds that the claimants have not established that there is a serious possibility on a Convention ground or that on a balance of probabilities, they would personally be subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if they were to return to Turkey today.\n[6] The determinative issue in this case is credibility.\nALLEGATIONS\n[7] Regarding the allegations, these are noted in the claimants' Basis of Claim forms (BOC).5 The following is a summary.\n[8] The claimants are a mother and son from Maras. They are Kurdish and Alevi. The principle claimant is XXXX years old and the minor claimant is XXXX. The claimants' husband\/father is already living in Canada having made a claim for protection in 2011.\n[9] When the principle claimant was two years old there was a massacre of Kurdish-Alevis in Maras. Since this time the principle claimant has lived in fear of being massacred. The principle claimant lost faith in the Alevi association in Turkey because they are mostly controlled by people with ties to the anti-Alevi government.\n[10] The claimant took a stance against religions and contributed to the plight of the Kurds and Alevis from a leftist point of view. The claimant contributed to the Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) and later the People's Democracy Party (HDP). The claimant coordinated volunteers working within the BDP and the HDP.\n[11] In XXXX 2013 the principle claimant was beaten by XXXX while participating in the Gezi Park protests.\n[12] In XXXX2015 XXXX put the principle claimant into a car by force while she was leading a group engaged in propaganda on behalf of the HDP. The principle claimant and her group were also harassed by religious fundamentalists. The principle claimant was grabbed and slapped and kicked. The principle claimant also was hit and had her hair pulled by XXXX. The XXXX ordered the claimant to stop working for a separatist party. The XXXX seized campaign donations the principle claimant had collected.\n[13] On XXXX XXXX, 2015 XXXX pulled the principle claimant into a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX shop. A group of XXXX ordered the principle claimant to take off her clothes for a strip search. The principle claimant refused. The principle claimant was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and was threatened and insulted. The XXXX seized the principle claimant's election materials and donation money.\n[14] The principle claimant made a complaint to the XXXX office with officials from the HDP party. The principle claimant was refused a copy of the registered complaint. No action was taken in regards to this complaint.\n[15] On XXXX XXXX, 2016 the XXXX detained the principle claimant. The principle claimant was gagged and had a gun held to her head. XXXX took pictures and XXXX and the principle claimant was taken to the XXXX XXXX XXXX branch. The principle claimant rejected the allegations against her. The principle claimant was threatened and subjected to sexual harassment. The principle claimant was released after XXXX hours. The principle claimant was threatened that if she did not cooperate she would be captured again and made to disappear. The principle claimant was ordered to report once a week to XXXX.\n[16] The claimants went into hiding. The claimants left Turkey with the help of a smuggler. The principle claimant fears further persecution if she returns to Turkey today. The claimants left Turkey on XXXX XXXX, 2016.\nIDENTITY\n[17] The claimants' identities as nationals of Turkey was established by their testimony and by the supporting documents filed, such as their Turkish passports.6 The principle claimant's political profile was not established. The claimants' Kurdish and Alevi identity was not established the analysis follows.\nCREDIBLITY\n[18] In assessing credibility, the panel was mindful of the claimants' education, age, and background. The panel is also cognizant of the many difficulties faced by claimants in establishing a claim, including cultural factors, the milieu of the hearing room, and the stress inherent in responding to oral questions through an interpreter and nervousness. However, the panel finds the principle claimant's testimony not to be credible with respect to the central allegations of the claims.\n[19] The principle claimant said that she was required to XXXX XXXX XXXX regularly after her release from detention in XXXX, 2016. The principle claimant was required to XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2016. As well the claimant had to sign a statement before she was released from custody. However the claimant does not have any proof or record of her detention and\/or her requirement to report regularly to XXXX. In the panel's view if the claimant was put on a reporting schedule it is reasonable to expect that there would be a record of this. The panel is aware that sometimes XXXX in Turkey XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. However in the case of reporting, if there is no record the XXXX would not be able to keep track of persons that are released on conditions. Further the claimant did not try and get a record of her reporting requirements while preparing for her claim in Canada. In response the claimant said she was not given anything by XXXX she was just told to report and that when she was released she was too scared because of the threats. The panel does not accept this explanation as reasonable. If the claimant was released on conditions to report in Turkey it is reasonable to expect that the claimant would have been given a copy of her reporting conditions. As such the panel is drawing a negative inference regarding the claimant's credibility.\n[20] The claimant said she went into hiding in Istanbul on XXXX XXXX, 2016. However in the forms she completed when she first made her claim in Canada the principle claimant notes that she was living in Maras at her home address up until she left Turkey in XXXX 2016.7 In response the claimant said she thought she was being asked about her legal address in Turkey. The claimant also explained that the reason she noted that she was still living in Maras in XXXX 2016 was because she left Turkey in XXXX. The panel does not accept this explanation as reasonable. In the panel's view if the claimant left her home address in XXXX this would be noted in the forms. The question asks the claimant to list where she has resided and when. The question does not ask for her legal address. As well if the claimant left this address in XXXX it is reasonable she would not have shown that she was still at this home address in XXXX. As such the panel is drawing a negative inference regarding the claimant's credibility. This is central to the claim as the claimant alleges that she was in hiding during this period of time.\n[21] The claimant states the HDP was started in 2014. The claimant confirmed that the HDP did not exist prior to 2014. However the HDP stamp on her letter states 2012. The claimant could not provide any explanation as to why she thinks the HDP was created in 2014 but the party letter shows a date of 2012. In the panel's view if the claimant was involved with the HDP from its inception it is reasonable to expect that the claimant would know when the party was established and why the stamp refers to 2012. The claimant said the government opened the court case to close the BDP and then the foundation was laid for the HDP. It took some time and the HDP was established in 2014. In the panel's view this does not explain the claimant's lack of knowledge regarding the 2012 date on the letterhead. As well the objective evidence states the HDP was created in 2013.8 As such the panel is drawing negative inference regarding the claimant's credibility.\n[22] The claimant provides a letter from the HDP in support of her claim.9 The claimant also provided copies of her application forms for the BDP and the HDP.10 The letter states that the principle claimant became a member of the BDP and then became a member of the HDP.11 However the claimant does not mention in either her intake forms12 or in her BOC13 that she ever became a member of either party. In her BOC she says she contributed to the party and that she organized volunteers and that she was affiliated with the party but she does not say that she became a member in 2008 of the BDP and that she became a member of the HDP in 2014. In response the claimant said she could not recall why she did not mention in her BOC that she was a member of the BDP and the HDP. The panel does not find this explanation reasonable. In the panel's view if a claim is based in part on political opinion and the fear is based on a political profile it is reasonable to expect that the claimant would mention that she was a member of the BDP and then the HDP in her BOC. This is central to the claim as the claim is based largely on the principle claimant's political profile. As such the panel is drawing negative inference regarding the claimant's credibility.\n[23] In response to why the claimant does not mention her membership in the BDP or the HDP in her intake forms14 the claimant said she was having problems understanding the interpreter and she thought she was being asked about terrorist groups only when she was asked about organizations. The panel does not accept this explanation as reasonable. The intake forms do ask the claimant about terrorist organizations at question 6 of schedule A. The claimant answered no. Question 9 asks, \"What organizations have you supported been a member of or been associated with? Include any political, social, youth or student organization, trade unions and professional association.\" The claimant said she was confused because the Turkish word for organization is \"orgut\" and this is the only word that she heard in regards to question 9 and she believed this was in reference to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The claimant said that the interpreter was not ethnically Turkish and he was speaking fast. In the panel's view even if the interpreter was speaking quickly it is not reasonable that question 9 would be understood as only one word, organization. This does not make sense when question 6 already asked about organizations that would cover the PKK. The panel does not accept that the immigration officer completing the forms with the assistance of the interpreter would not realize that question 9 was not being asked as indicated in the form. It is the officer's duty to consider a claimant's eligibility in order to have the claim referred to the RPD. Therefore it is reasonable to expect that this question would have been asked in its entirety and not simply as are you associated or a member of any organization. In the panel's view if the claimant was a member or was associated with the BDP or the HDP this would be noted in the intake forms.15 As such the panel is drawing a negative inference regarding the claimant's credibility.\n[24] The claimant was able to provide basic information regarding the HDP. In the panel's view the claimant's basic knowledge of the HDP does not overcome the serious credibility concerns noted above.\n[25] The claimant states in her BOC that she was detained three times in Turkey.16 Each detention was connected to her political activities. However in her intake forms the claimant answers at question 6 at Schedule A, \"I was detained for 5 hours once because of being an Alevi, I was released after 5 hours.\"17 The claimant answered yes to the question of whether she had been detained, incarcerated or put in jail. In response to this inconsistency the claimant said it was due to the interpreter. He was speaking fast, he was not from Turkey and she had to ask the interpreter to repeat the question. The claimant also said when she tried to tell of her other detentions the interpreter held up his hand and told her she could explain the details later on. The claimant was told to give brief answers. The panel does not accept this explanation as reasonable. Again this question is central to the immigration officer's determination that a claimant is eligible to move forward with a refugee claim. It does not make sense that anyone processing refugee claims would indicate that a claimant should not answer whether or not she had been detained or incarcerated. This is the immigration officer's duty. In this case there is nothing before the panel to suggest that the officer was trying to avoid his or her responsibilities. As well the claimant's explanation that she was having trouble with the interpreter does not explain the inconsistency because it is apparent the claimant understood the question as she answered about one detention. As such the panel is drawing a negative inference regarding the claimant's credibility.\n[26] The claimant also said she was in a fragile state when she was at the border making her claim. She also said that she was not comfortable speaking to the immigration officer as he was like the police. In the panel's view, even if the claimant was fragile it is reasonable to expect that the questions would be asked in full and that the claimant would be able to respond to the questions as the questions are not complex.\n[27] The claimant alleges that she is Alevi however the principle claimant has not provided any supporting documentation from the Alevi association here in Toronto nor has she provided any documentation from her Alevi community in Turkey. Rule 11 of the RPD rules states that claimants should provide supporting documentation when it is possible. The claimant admits that she does not practice her religion. The claimant was able to provide some basic knowledge of the Alevi religion. However given credibility concerns and the lack of documentation, the panel finds that the claimant is not Alevi. Even if the panel found that the principle claimant was Alevi, the panel finds that as an Alevi the claimant would not face persecution if she returned to Turkey today. The claimant admits that she did not have any concerns living in Turkey prior to her trip to Germany in June 2015. The claimant states that her problems were related to her political profile.\n[28] Although the claimant's husband and minor claimant's father was found to be Alevi by a member of the IRB in Canada, the panel is not bound by this decision. Further, the panel was not provided with any of the evidence used to establish the minor claimant's father's religious profile. Similarly even if the minor claimant is part Alevi from his father's side, the panel notes that there is no evidence which indicates that the minor claimant has faced persecution or that he would face persecution if he was to return to Turkey today. The claim is based on the principle claimant's political profile. The panel has considered the documentary evidence and finds that although there is discrimination in Turkey towards the Alevi community, this does not amount to persecution.\n[29] The claimants have provided an affidavit from XXXX XXXX.18 He is the principle claimant's husband and the minor claimant's father. However the panel is giving this affidavit little weight in regards to the claimants fear of returning to Turkey due to serious credibility concerns. As well Mr. XXXX did not appear as a witness and he has been living in Canada for several years and was not in Turkey to witness any of the events as alleged during the time period of XXXX 2015 to XXXX 2016. Before this period of time the principle claimant confirmed that she had no problems living in Turkey.\n[30] The claimant provided her husband's positive decision and narrative.19 The panel gives these documents no weight in establishing the principle claimant's profile. The narrative does not mention the principle claimant. As well, just because her husband is Kurdish and Alevi does not mean that the principle claimant is Kurdish and Alevi. It is possible that this is a mixed marriage although the minor claimant would be part Kurdish by birth, however as noted above, due to serious credibility concerns the panel has found that the claimants have not established that they are Kurdish or that they are Alevi. The onus is on the claimant to establish the claim. The panel was not provided any of the evidence that was relied upon by the previous panel in order to establish religion and or ethnicity. As well the panel is not bound by a previous decision by the RPD.\n[31] Even if the panel had found that the minor claimant is part Kurdish due to his father's successful refugee claim, the documentary evidence does not support that a part Kurdish child is at risk of persecution in Turkey today.\n[32] The principle claimant states that she is Kurdish. However the principle claimant, given that she does not speak Kurdish, did not provide a letter from the Kurdish association here in Toronto to verify her ethnicity. The panel advised the claimant that due to having heard many claims on this issue, the panel is aware of the Kurdish association in Toronto. In response the claimant said she went to the Kurdish association here in Toronto but they demanded two witnesses. The claimant said they were not friendly and she did not have two witnesses. The panel does not accept this explanation as reasonable. If the claimant was Kurdish it is reasonable to expect that she would be able to establish this fact with the Kurdish association in Toronto. As such the panel is drawing negative inference regarding the claimants' credibility.\n[33] Given serious credibility concerns, the panel finds the claimants are not at risk in Turkey due to the principle claimant's political profile. The panel find the principle claimant is not Kurdish, she is not Alevi and she was not a member of the BDP or the HDP. The panel also finds that the principle claimant was not detained in Turkey due to her association with either of these parties or due to her religious or ethnic profile.\nCONCLUSION\n[34] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel determines that there is not a serious possibility that the claimants would be persecuted in their country, or that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimants would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in their country.\n[35] The panel concludes that the claimants are not Convention refugees, nor are they persons in need of protection. The claims are rejected.\n(signed)\nC. Gibbs\nC.

They are claiming refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.1\n[2] The claimants were all afforded an opportunity to testify at the hearing, which was held in two sittings. The claimants allege that they have faced discrimination amounting to persecution in Saudi Arabia, which is their only country of former habitual residence.\n[3] The claimants left Saudi Arabia in XXXX 2016, using passports issued by the Palestinian Authority containing visitor visas for the United States. They made their claims for refugee protection at the border of Canada a few days later.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] I find that the claimants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. I make this determination having considered the totality of the evidence, including the claimants' testimonies, their personal documents, the country condition evidence, and the submissions of their counsel.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity and country of reference\n[5] The claimants have all only ever lived in Saudi Arabia. The principal claimant testified that his father originally went to live there over 70 years ago, but was never able to become a citizen.\n[6] The principal claimant testified that he and his children are holders of Egyptian travel documents, as his father also had this type of document, but that these documents do not allow them the ability to live in Egypt. The principal claimant and his three children, the younger claimants, are also in possession of passports issued by the Palestinian Authority in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Both sets of travel documents were presented at the port of entry.2\n[7] The female claimant holds a passport from Jordan which was issued for a period of two years, and which she alleges does not entitle her to reside in Jordan.3 She stated that she has continued to obtain a temporary Jordanian passport as her late father was a holder of this type of passport, which is only provided to Palestinian nationals.\n[8] The female claimant's parents and her younger siblings went to live in the Gaza Strip approximately 15-17 years ago, according to her testimony, but she has never visited them there. The principal claimant also stated that he has a sister now living in Gaza, but that he has only visited Gaza on one occasion, many decades ago.\n[9] The female claimant testified that she has never lived in or visited Jordan and that none of her family members have ever lived there. I had earlier pointed out to the principal claimant that his wife's Basis of Claim form (\"BOC\") indicated that she did have a brother residing there;4 however, the claimants now allege that this brother was only visiting Jordan for a short period of time.\n[10] I have reviewed the country condition evidence in the National Documentation Packages (NDPs) for both Egypt and Jordan.5 I find that the claimants' allegations that they do not have residence rights in either of those countries despite holding valid travel documents are corroborated by the objective documentary evidence. Therefore, I accept counsel's submission that the claimants' only country of former habitual residence is Saudi Arabia.\n[11] The issue of Palestinian holders of Jordanian passports is addressed in a Response to Information Request (RIR) in the NDP, which confirms that \"Jordanian passports issued to stateless Palestinians do not bestow Jordanian citizenship rights and act only as travel documents ... in order to be recognized as a Jordanian citizen, a person must have a national identity number\".6\n[12] Therefore, I find that the female claimant's possession of a Jordanian passport does not mean that she is entitled to any rights or citizenship in Jordan, as the claimants have alleged. Rather, it appears to fall into the category of passports held by those Palestinians considered by Jordanian authorities as \"Gazans\", which are issued for two years and do not give them access to services as citizens.7\n[13] A RIR in the NDP on Egypt sets out that Egyptian travel documents issued to Palestinians also do not afford them any rights to residence or citizenship in Egypt. It states the following:\n[T]ens of thousands of Palestinians from Gaza and their descendants hold Egyptian travel documents for Palestinian refugees, although they lack residency rights in Egypt ... these documents were initially provided to Gazan residents during the time when Gaza was under Egyptian control and were used by thousands of Gazans who migrated to Gulf countries and elsewhere for employment.8\n[14] I also note that this Egyptian travel document states on its face that \"[i]t ... does not allow its bearer to enter A.R.E[.] or to do transit through it unless he\/she gained an entry, transit or return visa\" (A.R.E. meaning the Arab Republic of Egypt).9 The principal claimant testified that he had never applied for such a visa, as he believed he would be rejected, and that he has never traveled or lived in Egypt.\n[15] The claimants also allege that they would not be able to live in or even enter the Palestinian territory of Gaza as they do not have Israeli identity cards allowing them to reside there. According to country condition documents, Palestinians require Israeli-issued IDs in order to enter Palestine, and \" 'being Palestinian' does not mean that Israel will grant the person access to Palestine.\"10 Also, \"Israeli authorities did not permit Palestinians [who were] abroad during the 1967 War, or whose residence permits the Israeli government subsequently withdrew, to reside permanently in the occupied territories.\"11\n[16] Therefore, I find that the claimants have established their identities as stateless Palestinians, on a balance of probabilities. I find that the country of reference for these claims is the only country of former habitual residence for these claimants, which is Saudi Arabia.\nThe claimants' evidence about their status in Saudi Arabia\n[17] The principal claimant was the main witness on behalf of the claimants. I found his evidence regarding the family's status in Saudi Arabia to be somewhat evasive and not corroborated by reliable documentary evidence.\n[18] The claimants allege that they no longer have valid resident status in Saudi Arabia, as the principal claimant was dismissed from his employment by his sponsor on XXXX XXXX, 2016. The principal claimant testified that his resident permit, known as an iqama, had expired one month after he left Saudi Arabia.\n[19] The principal claimant's testimony on the issue of how and what documents he used to leave Saudi Arabia was problematic. The principal claimant testified that the claimants only had stamps in their passports to show when they had left Saudi Arabia.\n[20] At the initial sitting of the hearing, the claimants did not provide any official documents confirming their alleged loss of resident status in Saudi Arabia. When asked whether he had any official proof that they were no longer entitled to reside in Saudi Arabia, the principal claimant stated that as a foreigner he was not allowed to even approach Saudi authorities to request any documents.\n[21] The panel asked the principal claimant how he had obtained birth certificates for his children, which are in evidence.12 He conceded that he was allowed to obtain those documents, but in order to make any changes to those documents, for example, he would need a Saudi to act as a proxy.\n[22] The principal claimant also testified that his former sponsor had kept their resident permit cards or iqamas when handing over their passports because \"that is the way it works back there\", although I did not note any country condition evidence to support that this is common practice in Saudi Arabia.\n[23] A recent RIR for Saudi Arabia on \"[e]xit procedures and documents required for resident foreigners who leave the country\" states that they must have either an exit\/re-entry visa or a final exit visa in order to leave the country.13 When asked about this, the principal claimant stated only that this was \"something between the Saudis and sponsor, they will not give us a copy\", which I did not find to be a credible response.\n[24] The principal claimant testified that he had said that he was only going on a holiday at the time the family left Saudi Arabia in order to get their passports back from their sponsor, but also has alleged that he only began to make arrangements to leave Saudi Arabia after his employment was terminated in XXXX XXXX, 2016.\n[25] The principal claimant was asked to explain why he had testified that he had allegedly requested vacation time in order to get the passports back when his employment had already ended. He responded that he had sent his wife and daughters to plead with his sponsor, who was a female, to extend their resident status for six months so that they could make plans to leave Saudi Arabia.\n[26] At the second sitting of the hearing, the claimants provided a copy of a \"Single Exit Reentry Visa\" in the principal claimant's name from the Saudi Arabian General Directorate of Passports, stating that it was valid until XXXX XXXX, 2016, and good for return to Saudi Arabia before XXXX XXXX, 2016.14 They also provided another Saudi Arabian document stating that the date of expiry of the principal claimant's residency was XXXX XXXX, 2017.15 The principal claimant testified that these were obtained by his son in Saudi Arabia with the assistance of a Saudi citizen.\n[27] I find that the principal claimant's failure to provide any official documents regarding his status in Saudi Arabia until specifically asked why he had not done so, and his unsatisfactory explanations for this failure, detract from his credibility as a witness. I find that in considering the country condition evidence, it seems more likely than not that the principal claimant and likely his family members were in fact provided with exit re-entry visas, which have not been presented to Canadian authorities.\n[28] The principal claimant has testified that when he left Saudi Arabia he had no intention to return. I note that the family's residency status was still valid in Saudi Arabia at the time they entered Canada and made their claims for refugee protection.\n[29] However, I note that even though the claimants may no longer be allowed to return to Saudi Arabia now, according to the evidence, it is still a valid country of reference for their claims. There is no requirement in the jurisprudence that a claimant must be legally allowed to return to a country of former habitual residence, as set out in the Maarouf decision of the Federal Court of Appeal.16\n[30] I also note that jurisprudence requires that the Refugee Protection Division consider whether or not a denial of a right to return to a country of former habitual residence constitutes an act of persecution by the state in question.17 I find that there was no evidence before me that the claimants' inability to return to reside in Saudi Arabia is based on a Convention ground, but is rather the consequence of the normal operation of law in Saudi Arabia, as they did not return during the time period allowed on the re-entry visa.\nHave the claimants faced discrimination amounting to persecution in Saudi Arabia?\n[31] The fact that the claimants are stateless is not sufficient to ground a claim for refugee protection. Claimants must provide sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence that they are outside their country of former habitual residence for the reasons listed in the Convention refugee definition.18\n[32] The claimants allege that they faced discrimination amounting to persecution in Saudi Arabia due to their Palestinian nationality. The principal claimant described that his loss of employment was due to hostility towards him as a resident foreigner and Palestinian from his sponsor's son, and that he was unable to get approval to transfer his sponsorship to another employer due to this hostility.\n[33] I note that the principal claimant has not corroborated his allegations that he was treated particularly unfairly by his employer in this or any other regard due to his Palestinian background with any documentary evidence. The claimants provided a translation of the termination letter from the principal claimant's employer dated XXXX XXXX, 2016, which gives the reason for his dismissal as \"[d]ue to the decrease in the work volume and restructuring the departments\".19\n[34] I find that the claimants have not provided sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to establish that they have faced any discriminatory measures which do not also apply to other non-citizens in Saudi Arabia for a Convention reason, namely for the reason of their Palestinian nationality, as they have alleged.\n[35] The claimants allege that their access to health care, post-secondary education and employment is restricted in Saudi Arabia, and that the younger female claimants were unable to work. The female claimant testified that Palestinians have almost no rights and that they are treated as \"third-class citizens\". She stated that her children were unable to attend university or find employment in Saudi Arabia.\n[36] However, I find that the claimants' evidence was not consistent on the issue of the ability of their children to obtain employment in Saudi Arabia. The panel notes that the family has another, older son who remains in Saudi Arabia. When asked about his situation, the female claimant testified that \"he has work, he has a sponsor, he is okay over there\".\n[37] The younger male claimant testified that his employment was also with his father's sponsor and that it ended when his father's employment was terminated. However, he was unable to explain why there was another stamp in Arabic in his passport, which was only interpreted at the hearing at the request of the panel, and which seemed to pertain to work with a different sponsor at a warehouse. I find that his vague testimony also detracts from the claimants' allegations about their difficulties in obtaining employment in Saudi Arabia.\n[38] The claimants have not also provided any documents from Saudi Arabia which would support the statement made in the principal claimant's BOC narrative that his daughters are not authorized to work in Saudi Arabia, such as their resident permit cards, or any other official document pertaining to the rights or status of any of the family members in Saudi Arabia, other than the principal claimant.\n[39] I find that there is no objective evidence in the country condition documents which would corroborate that non-citizen women are not able to work in Saudi Arabia, although it is clear that even women who are Saudi citizens face numerous hurdles in obtaining employment there.20\n[40] The country condition evidence on Saudi Arabia in the RIR on the rights of non-citizens born to non-citizen Saudi-born parents in Saudi Arabia confirms that non-citizens do not have free health care privileges and that they do have access to free education up to high school, but are not permitted to attend university in Saudi Arabia.21\n[41] One source in the document also states that these non-citizens have the \"right of employment in the private sector\".22 However, there was no persuasive evidence in the country condition documents that Palestinians faced any greater restrictions or discriminatory treatment than other non-citizens in Saudi Arabia.\n[42] The principal claimant had testified that Palestinians were discriminated against in not being allowed to attend university, and he resented that his children were denied this opportunity. However, he also confirmed that the prohibition against attending university applies to all non-citizens in Saudi Arabia, not just Palestinians, although there were sometimes exceptions made.\n[43] The principal claimant and female claimant were both asked why they believed that they were particularly discriminated against as Palestinians. The principal claimant testified that the situation of Palestinians in Saudi Arabia had deteriorated after the Gulf War and that as a Palestinian he was disadvantaged compared to other resident foreigners, since \"I don't have a country to go back to\".\n[44] However, the stateless situation of the claimants appears to have made it less likely that they would have faced removal from Saudi Arabia than other resident foreigners, as they have no residence rights in any other country to which they could be returned by Saudi Arabian authorities. The principal claimant testified that he had never had any desire to live in Gaza as he did not agree with the hard-line Islamic outlook of the Hamas party in control there, and he also stated that he was never concerned about the possibility of being removed to Gaza.\n[45] The female claimant was asked if there were any specific incidents or ways in which she felt discriminated against as a Palestinian, but she only mentioned the difficulties she had sometimes had registering her children in school once it was discovered that they were not Saudi citizens. She did not provide testimony that their Palestinian nationality had ever posed any particular problems for her or her children.\n[46] The claimants have also alleged that the female members of the family have been harassed by members of the religious police known as the CPVPV in Saudi Arabia for not complying with the strict Islamic dress code for women enforced there. However, I again do not find persuasive evidence that these provisions are more strictly applied to Palestinian nationals or other foreign residents or that such harassment would constitute persecution.\n[47] Women in Saudi Arabia face systemic discrimination and limits on their personal freedoms, and this situation is amply described in the NDP on Saudi Arabia.23 While it is reprehensible that women in Saudi Arabia must travel with a male guardian, do not receive equal status to men in marriage, employment and in court, and are subject to dress requirements, I find that this does not amount to a substantial denial of basic human rights for the female claimants, even taking into consideration that they were further prevented from accessing an university education as non-citizens.\nCONCLUSION\n[48] I find that the claimants have not shown that they have faced discriminatory measures which would amount to persecution even when considered cumulatively, i.e. leading to consequences of a \"substantially prejudicial nature\", such as restrictions on the right to earn a livelihood or practice religion or access normally available educational facilities.\n[49] Therefore, I find that the claimants have not provided sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence that they have experienced discrimination amounting to persecution for a Convention ground as Palestinians, or in the case of the female claimants, also as women, in Saudi Arabia, or that they would face a serious possibility of harm amounting to persecution in this country of former habitual residence, which I have found to be the only country of reference for these claims.\n[50] Furthermore, I find that they have not shown on a balance of probabilities that they would be personally subjected to a risk to life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture in Saudi Arabia.\n[51] For all of the above reasons, the Refugee Protection Division rejects these claims.\n(signed)\n\"Maureen Carty\"\nMaureen Carty\nApril 4, 2017\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 as amended\n2 Exhibit 1\n3 Ibid.\n4 Exhibit 3\n5 Exhibit 9, NDP for Egypt (31 August 2016), and Exhibit 10, NDP for Jordan (31 August 2016)\n6 Exhibit 10, NDP for Jordan (31 August 2016), item 3.8\n7 Ibid.\n8 Exhibit 9, NDP for Egypt (31 August 2016), item 3.4\n9 Exhibit 1\n10 Exhibit 7, NDP for Palestine (22 December 2016), item 14.9\n11 Exhibit 7, NDP for Palestine (22 December 2016), item 2.1\n12 Exhibit 11\n13 Exhibit 8, NDP for Saudi Arabia (30 November 2016), item 14.1\n14 Exhibit 14\n15 Exhibit 14\n16 Maarouf v.

He fears such a possibility as he was previously a holder of an Iraqi travel document for Palestinians, and because his father is a Palestinian born in Iraq who also previously held this type of travel document.\n[4] The claimant also fears the possibility of being returned to the Occupied Territory of Palestine (OPT), as he currently holds a Palestinian Authority passport, and where he alleges he would be at risk from Israeli authorities and settlers.\n[5] The claimant was in possession of a United States (US) visitor visa, and made his claim at the border on November 15, 2016.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] The panel finds the claimant not to be a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\n[7] The panel makes this determination after considering the totality of the evidence, including the claimant's testimony, personal documents and country condition documents, as well as counsel's submissions and relevant jurisprudence.\nISSUES AND ANALYSIS\n[8] The determinative issues in this claim were the claimant's identity and the country or countries of reference for the claim, and whether or not he has provided sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish that he is now outside any country of reference as a result of a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason, and if so, if there are any other countries of reference to which he could return.\n[9] The panel also considered whether or not the claimant would be personally subjected to a risk to life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture, on a balance of probabilities, in any or all of the possible countries of reference.\nIdentity and residence evidence\n[10] The claimant presented his current Palestinian Authority passport containing an unexpired UAE resident visa, his expired Palestinian Authority passport, and a Republic of Iraq 'Travel Document for Palestinians', which was valid until XXXX, 2006, at the port of entry.1\n[11] The claimant has also presented other personal identity documents, partial copies of several Republic of Iraq 'Travel document for Palestinians' issued to his father over the years, and a copy of a 'Palestinian's document' issued to him by the Residency Directorate in Baghdad in 1997.2\n[12] The panel accepts the claimant's identity as a stateless Palestinian who was formerly resident in the UAE, on a balance of probabilities.\n[13] The claimant is an only child, according to his Basis of claim form (BOC).3 In his written narrative, as amended, he states that his father was born in Iraq, after his family had fled Haifa in 1948, and that his mother was born in Lebanon.4 This is corroborated by a partial copy of her Lebanese passport.5\n[14] The claimant also states therein that both his parents have resided in the UAE for many years, his father since sometime in the 1970s. The claimant testified that he has never resided in any country other than the UAE, other than a brief sojourn in Canada as a student from 2002 until 2004.\n[15] The claimant testified that he has never visited the OPT, and has no family connections there currently. According to country condition documents, Palestinians require Israeli-issued IDs in order to enter Palestine, and that 'being Palestinian' does not mean that Israel will grant the person access to Palestine.6 The claimant has apparently never been issued with an Israeli identification card permitting him to reside in either Gaza or the West Bank.\n[16] The claimant has visited Iraq and Lebanon, accompanying his parents on his family visits, and has also traveled to the US previously. The claimant traveled to Iraq in 1997 and 2001, according to his testimony, and stated that neither or he nor his father have been able to renew or obtain new Iraq travel documents since approximately 2006.\n[17] The claimant also testified that he believes that he would be unable to reside in Lebanon, his mother's country of birth and citizenship, as he would be unable to obtain citizenship or any type of status there, other than as a visitor. A document in the National Documentation Package (NDP) on Lebanon confirms that Lebanese women married to foreign men are unable to pass their nationality to their children. 7\n[18] The claimant's UAE resident visa in his current Palestinian Authority passport and his UAE resident identity card, which was also presented at the port of entry, both have an expiry date of XXXX, 2018.8 The claimant has also provided a copy of an employment contract and a termination letter, dated XXXX XXXX, 2016 from a company called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which is indicated as his sponsor on his UAE resident visa.9\nCountry of reference for this claim\n[19] The panel has carefully reviewed the evidence on the claimant's identity and residence, as summarized above, the counsel's submissions and disclosure packages, as well as the relevant jurisprudence and country condition documents in the NDPs in assessing the potential countries of reference for this claim.\n[20] The panel finds that the UAE is the claimant's only country of former habitual residence, and that the UAE is therefore the only country of reference for his claim for refugee protection.\n[21] The claimant was born in the UAE, and has lived there for his entire life other than for brief visits elsewhere, mostly recently to the US in 2015, after which he always returned to the UAE. The claimant alleges that his resident status in the UAE is no longer valid, since he has been terminated from his employment there, although he has not provided any documents from UAE authorities to confirm this.\n[22] Given the above-stated evidence with respect to the OPT and Lebanon, the panel finds that neither of these countries can be considered to be countries of former habitual residence for the claimant. Although he has some family ties to Lebanon, the claimant has made only brief visits and has never had status there other than as a visitor. The claimant has presented his previous Palestinian Authority passport with a visitor visa issued by the Lebanese consulate and several entry and exit stamps from Lebanon.10\n[23] Counsel for the claimant has submitted that the claimant has at least two countries of former habitual residence: the UAE and Iraq.\n[24] However, the panel is not persuaded that the claimant's possession of an identity card issued in 1997, and two now-expired travel documents issued by the Republic of Iraq, even in conjunction with the fact of the claimant's father's birth in Iraq in 1951 and his statement that he has two paternal aunts still residing there, mean that Iraq can be considered as a country of former habitual residence for the claimant.\n[25] The Federal Court decision in Maarouf states that the definition of a country of former habitual residence should not be \"unduly restrictive,\" and does not require that a person should be legally able to return there. However, it also states that the claimant \"must have established a significant period of de facto residence in the country in question.\" 11\n[26] The Federal Court considered a similar fact situation in Kadoura, where the individual held a Lebanese travel document but had never lived there, and upheld the Board's finding that Lebanon was not a country of former habitual residence.12\n[27] Counsel for the claimant has submitted that the jurisprudence suggests that the interpretation of country of former habitual residence (CFHR) should be liberal and not restrictive, and that the actual amount of time spent there matters less than other considerations, such as family ties. Counsel has pointed to a recent Federal Court decision in Al Khateeb where Gaza was found to be a CFHR for a stateless Palestinian although the applicant had only lived there for six months before relocating with his family to Qatar.13\n[28] However, the panel notes that in that case the six-month period included the applicant's birth and infancy. Justice Simpson stated that the RAD failed to appreciate that 'the applicant's birth in Gaza gives him status akin to nationality; his rights of return and residence are also akin to the rights associated with citizenship'. The Federal Court in Maarouf also stated not only that the concept of a CFHR is broadly comparable to the relationship between a citizen and his or her country of nationality, but that it implies a situation where a stateless person was admitted to a given country with a view to a 'continuing residence of some duration'.\n[29] The claimant stated in his amended BOC that he had obtained his Palestinian identity card in Iraq during a visit in 1997 to see his grandparents, and returned again for a visit in 2001 to renew his travel document.14 He testified in response to counsel's questions that there was no limit to how long he could stay in Iraq, and he agreed when asked by counsel if he could have stayed there indefinitely, because it was 'as if you are going to your own country'.\n[30] However, the panel notes that the claimant was not an adult during either of those trips, and that he also stated that he had no current knowledge of whether or not the identity card he was issued in 1997 is still valid, although it does not have an expiry date on its face.\n[31] The claimant has apparently not had any contact with Iraqi authorities since he last renewed his travel document at the Embassy of Iraq in Abu Dhabi in 2005.15 The claimant testified that neither he nor his father have contemplated returning to Iraq since 2001 and he stated in his BOC that the situation for Palestinians in Iraq changed dramatically after the fall of the Saddam regime.16 The panel finds that there is no persuasive evidence that the claimant was ever admitted to Iraq for a 'continuing residence of some duration', or that he has ever had the rights or status akin to a national there, as he has never actually resided in Iraq.\n[32] There is evidence that the claimant's father spent his early life in Iraq, received a university education there, and renewed his travel document over a period of some decades.17 The panel notes that if the claimant's father were making a claim for refugee protection, Iraq may well be considered to be a CFHR for his claim.\n[33] However, having assessed the evidence before it and relevant jurisprudence, the panel finds that Iraq cannot be found to be a country of former habitual residence for this claimant, and is therefore not a country of reference for his claim.\nThe claimant's allegations against the UAE\n[34] The panel has therefore carefully considered the credibility of the claimant's allegations against the UAE, which it has determined to be the only country of reference for this claim. The claimant testified in a forthright manner generally and there were no apparent significant inconsistencies between his testimony and the statements in his BOC.\n[35] However, the panel finds that the claimant's allegations have not been satisfactorily corroborated by reliable documentary evidence which was provided, or which could reasonably have been provided, in the circumstances.\n[36] The claimant has alleged that his resident status in the UAE is no longer valid, as he is no longer employed by his sponsor indicated on the resident visa in his passport. The claimant gave a lengthy and indefinite response when asked whether or not he could still use this UAE resident visa to re-enter the UAE.\n[37] The claimant testified that the employer\/sponsor was supposed to have asked for his passport in order to invalidate the visa when his employment ended but did not do so, at his request. He also stated that the company had a legal responsibility to invalidate his residence visa at some point, but that he did not know whether or not the company had ever gone through the process. He further testified that even if they had not done so, the company would be notified upon his return to the UAE and would then invalidate the visa, thereby cancelling his resident status.\n[38] The panel notes that the company had assisted the claimant in obtaining a new residence visa in XXXX, 2016, when they had allegedly already informed him that his employment was in jeopardy, according to his testimony. The panel finds it difficult to understand why the claimant would not be better informed as to whether or not his residence visa had actually been cancelled or not by his employer with UAE authorities.\n[39] The panel notes that the termination letter received by the claimant states that he was entitled to an 'End of Service Gratuity' for his XXXX years' employment, which according to UAE Labor Law 'will only be released upon the cancellation of your residence visa.'18 It seems therefore that the claimant would also have had a financial incentive to clarify this matter, if he was as certain as he alleges that his resident status in the UAE is no longer valid.\n[40] The panel finds that the claimant has not provided sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to establish that his resident status in the UAE is in fact no longer valid, even considering the country condition evidence which indicates that resident status in the UAE is dependent upon a foreigner having ongoing employment and sponsorship.19 The claimant has testified that his father has been able to make an arrangement with a friend to act as his sponsor, even though he is not employed by this individual.\n[41] The panel also finds that the claimant's assertion that he would be detained, possibly indefinitely, were he to return to the UAE without valid resident status, is not supported by reliable documentary evidence. The claimant was asked why he feared indefinite detention in the UAE, and he replied that since he is a stateless Palestinian, the UAE authorities would take time to search for a country to accept him.\n[42] Counsel for the claimant has submitted that 'the Emirati government has been known to detain indefinitely persons in his circumstances - namely, stateless persons, including Palestinians, or persons for whom the Emirati government faces challenges in carrying out a deportation order'. However, the panel finds that the two examples of individuals counsel has pointed to in the documentary evidence in support of this submission are not actually similarly-situated persons.\n[43] An individual who was removed from the UAE to Thailand, despite having no connections there, was actually a stateless Bidoon who was an activist on behalf of his fellow Bidoons.20 The other individual is described as a prominent Palestinian blogger who characterized his removal, eventually to Malaysia, and similar instances, \"not as a 'deportation' as the regime likes to phrase them, but repressive measures designed to silence criticism and dissent.\" 21\n[44] This individual further reported having been told directly by an official that his removal \"isn't an immigration matter, its higher order and will have to be carried out regardless of your visa's status.\" The same individual described that he had encountered Palestinians who were being kept for \"open periods of time\" as the authorities did not know where to deport them.22 However, the panel finds that such a practice by UAE authorities is not corroborated by documentary evidence from other objective or reliable sources.\n[45] The panel notes that both counsel's disclosure and the NDP on UAE contain numerous reports on the human rights situation in the UAE, especially with regard to its very high population of migrant and foreign resident workers.23 It therefore seems reasonable that if the practice which the claimant alleges to fear was actually occurring in the UAE, i.e. that Palestinian long-term residents are being indefinitely detained for having lost their employment and subsequently their residency, there would be some mention of such occurrences in the country condition documents.\n[46] The claimant also alleges to fear that the UAE authorities would seek to remove him to Iraq, the country which previously issued him with travel documents, where he would face harm amounting to persecution.\n[47] The claimant testified that UAE authorities have been known to make 'side-deals' with countries to accept stateless individuals. He has provided an article discussing the arrangements which authorities in the UAE and other Gulf countries have tried to make for 'economic citizenship' for their stateless Bidoons with the tiny African country of Comoros.24 The 2015 US Department of State Country report for Human Rights Practices for the UAE also discusses this treatment of Bidoons, but makes no mention of such human rights abuses being directed towards stateless Palestinians.25\n[48] There is also no persuasive evidence before the panel that Palestinian long-term residents have been deported from the UAE to Iraq in similar circumstances. A recent article entitled \"UAE deports hundreds of Iraqis, mostly Shias\", refers to citizens of Iraq only.26 The panel finds that the allegation that UAE authorities would seek to remove the claimant to Iraq is purely speculative, and that the likelihood of this occurring is undermined by a review of the country condition evidence in the NDP in Iraq.\n[49] The panel notes that there are few references to the situation of Palestinians in Iraq in any of the documents before the panel, either in counsel's disclosure or in the NDP.27 A 2013 report from the Institute for International Law and Human Rights sets out that Palestinians living in Iraq are issued travel documents but that Iraqi diplomatic missions abroad do not presently issue such documents. It also states that holders of such documents must provide proof to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that they are not in possession of a Palestinian Authority passport.28\n[50] This document also states that since 2003 the numbers of Palestinians living in Iraq has declined dramatically and that \"the economic, social and cultural rights of Palestinians in Iraq have precipitously declined ... under the Saddam Hussein regime, though Palestinians were never formally granted refugee status, they were granted residency documents and travel documents with a five-year validity.\" Its description of the current situation in Iraq is one in which Palestinian refugees are subject to \"onerous registration and residency requirements\". Many Palestinians have sought to leave Iraq, and few who have left have sought to return, according to this document.29\n[51] Therefore, the panel finds that in these circumstances, there would not be more than a mere possibility that UAE authorities would be successful in obtaining the permission of the Iraq regime to accept a Palestinian returnee, especially one who has never lived in Iraq and is in possession of a Palestinian authority passport. The panel has already found that the preponderance of the reliable objective evidence does not support the claimant's allegation that UAE authorities actively seek to detain and deport stateless Palestinians in the claimant's circumstances.\nCONCLUSION\n[52] The panel finds that the UAE is the only country of reference for this claim for refugee protection.\n[53] The panel finds that the claimant has not provided sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to establish that he would face a serious possibility of harm amounting to persecution in the UAE, or that he would be personally subjected to a risk to life or of cruel or unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture in the UAE, on a balance of probabilities.\n[54] Therefore, the RPD rejects the claim for refugee protection made by XXXX XXXX XXXX, for the above-stated reasons.\n(signed)\n\"Maureen Carty\"\nMaureen Carty\nApril 13, 2017\nDate\n1 Exhibit 1\n2 Exhibit 6\n3 Exhibit 2\n4 Exhibit 2A\n5 Exhibit 6\n6 Exhibit 3, item 14.9\n7 Exhibit 12, item 3.4\n8 Exhibit 1\n9 Exhibits 10 and 6, p.14\n10 Exhibit 1\n11 Maarouf v.

Campbell\nConseil du (de la) ministre\n[1] XXXX XXXX XXXX (claimant) alleges she is a citizen of Somalia. She claims refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant alleged in her Basis of Claim Form (BOC)1 that she was a citizen of Somalia and of no other country. She alleged that she belongs to the minority XXXX clan. In XXXX 1992, while living in XXXX where she was born, her father, four brothers and two sisters were killed when their home bombed. She and her mother's lives were spared because they were not home at the time. They fled to Mogadishu where they lived for a year; a year later, they returned XXXX. They fixed what they could of their home and resumed their lives.\n[3] The claimant alleged that she got married in XXXX 2005 and had two children; a son born in 2007 and a second son born in 2010. In XXXX 2016, while taking a shower, she heard a commotion. Men were demanding money and valuables; her husband was pleading with them saying he had neither. The claimant alleged she heard shooting; when she went out she discovered the dead bodies of her husband and sons. She was informed by a neighbour the men were members of the XXXX tribe connected to Al Shabaab. After the claimant's husband and sons were buried, the claimant fled to Kenya with her mother. The claimant could only gather enough money for her to make her way to Canada.\n[4] The claimant fears for her life because of her membership in the minority clan of XXXX. She fears the majority Hawiye and Darod clans. She also fears Al Shabaab who were responsible for killing her family.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] The panel finds that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. The claimant was neither a credible nor trustworthy witness. She provided false statements in her immigration documents, her BOC, and at her hearing despite making an affirmation to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. In addition, the claimant provided false statements in a sworn affidavit commissioned by her counsel.\nCONTINUATION OF HEARING\n[6] This hearing was held over two sittings. At issue was the claimant's denial that she had applied for a United States visa in Cairo, Egypt (further details will follow in the analysis). Although the sitting heard on January 20, 2017, did conclude, the panel allowed counsel to provide written submissions on late disclosure given to her on the day of the hearing regarding birth certificate issued in Mogadishu2. On February 3, 2017, she submitted an addendum to the BOC3. The claimant admitted she was indeed in Cairo but she failed to disclose that information on the advice of a friend. The claimant alleged that her friend advised her not to reveal to her counsel that she had been in Cairo, Egypt. In the light of the new information, counsel requested that the hearing be re-opened to allow the claimant to provide an explanation for her failure to admit she had been in Cairo and applied for a US visa. The application was granted and the hearing resumed April 3, 2017.\nMINISTER'S INTERVENTION\n[7] On December 22, 2016, the Division received notification that a biometric results4 from the US indicating that the claimant using the name XXXX XXXX XXXX was a visa applicant in Cairo on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX2009 (it is unclear whether the fingerprints were taken in XXXX or XXXX of 2009).\n[8] Under the circumstances, the Minister was notified of the biometric match. The Minister's Representative from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada intervened in the matter and presented the Division with a picture of the US visa applicant.5\n[9] The picture supplied by the Minister was a remarkable likeness to the picture supplied by the claimant when she made her refugee claim in Canada.6\n[10] The Minister submitted that the claimant failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish her identity on a balance of probabilities as required by section 106 of IRPA and Rule 11 of the RPD rules. The Minister also submitted that the claimant has not been forthcoming regarding her entry into Canada. The Minister is of the opinion that the claimant is purposely withholding material information from the Canadian immigration authorities that would be relevant to her claim. The Minister submitted that these omissions undermined the credibility, identity and authenticity of the claimant and her allegations.\nPRELIMINARY MATTERS\n[11] As noted above, the Division received notification of a biometric match on December 22, 2016. This notification was disclosed to counsel December 28, 2016. Shortly after the biometric match was received, the Minister was notified January 13, 2017.\n[12] In the meantime, upon learning of the biometric match, the claimant provided an affidavit7 and stated in part that she had never applied for a US immigrant visa and she never left Somalia until June 2016. She affirmed that her name was XXXX XXXX XXXX born on XXXX XXXX, 1985. The panel notes that the claimant affirmed the statements before her counsel on January 6, 2017.\n[13] The Division then received notification that the Minister intended to intervene in the matter. The Minister provided the Division and counsel with a picture; however, the picture was not clear because it had been faxed to the Division and counsel. The Minister provided a colour copy to the Division and the same was sent to counsel. On the day of the hearing, counsel had not received the colour photo. The panel provided the photo to the counsel at which time, counsel requested time to confer with the claimant. The claimant wished to proceed with the hearing.\nANALYSIS\n[14] The determinative issues in this matter are credibility and identity.\nThe claimant's testimony at the first sitting\n[15] The claimant was questioned about the information received by the Division and the information provided by the Minister. The claimant denied ever being in Cairo. She alleged that her husband was in detention and she had a young son at the time. The panel indicated that the evidence was persuasive; however, the claimant continued to deny that she had been in Cairo and applied for a US visa. Later, in questioning by counsel, the claimant continued to claim that she had never left Somalia and was in XXXX at the time caring for her son. Counsel pointedly asked the claimant whether the picture in question was her: she replied it was not. Despite being presented with a picture of an individual with a more than remarkable likeness to the claimant, taken by the US authorities at the time the visa application was submitted, the claimant denied it was her.\nThe claimant's addendum to her BOC\n[16] The claimant submitted an addendum to the BOC. In the addendum, she affirmed to the veracity of her statements in the affidavit. She declared that the contents were complete, true and correct. The same document stated: \"My declaration has the same force and effect as if made under oath\".\n[17] The claimant admitted in the addendum that she had indeed been in Cairo and applied for a US visa. She alleged that she went there in XXXX 2007. She was told by a friend that she could use the passport and apply for a visa to the US. She explained that the name in the passport was XXXX XXXX XXXX and the date of birth was XXXX XXXX, 1977. Her picture and fingerprints were taken at the time. The claimant explained in her affidavit that her friend advised her not to reveal to her lawyer that she had traveled to Cairo. When asked why she failed to disclose this fact to the panel at hearing, she replied that she was afraid. At this point in the resumption, she became very emotional and the hearing was recessed. The claimant appeared extremely upset and was crying. After a short recess, the claimant indicated she was capable of proceeding and the hearing continued.\n[18] The panel has difficulty in accepting anything the claimant alleged or stated to be the truthful. She has been deceitful under oath on more than one occasion. The first sitting of the hearing was on January 20, 2017. The duration of that hearing was close to three hours. She was also asked at the outset of the hearing if her BOC was complete, true and correct; to which she replied it was. The claimant had ample opportunity to admit during the course of the hearing that she had indeed been in Cairo and allegedly used a false passport and an assumed name. The panel further noted that prior to the first sitting of the hearing, she provided a sworn affidavit stating that she had never been in Cairo or applied for a US visa. Furthermore, nothing her in immigration documents indicated that she was ever in Cairo and applied for a US visa under an assumed name. This fact only came to light because of the results of the biometrics. Clearly, she never intended to reveal her time in Egypt and her deceit had nothing to do with the advice of someone who allegedly told her to hide the fact she had been there.\nThe claimant's witnesses\nXXXX XXXX\n[19] The claimant alleged that her mother and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX were friends in Somalia. The claimant alleged she last saw XXXX in Somalia in 1992, when she was seven (7) years old.\n[20] The claimant alleged that when she was at a mosque in Toronto, she overheard someone call the witness by name and alleged she recognized the name and approached XXXX to ask if she was the friend of her mother.\n[21] XXXX had not seen the claimant in over 24 years. The last time she allegedly saw the claimant, the claimant was just seven years old. In testimony of the witness, she readily admitted she did not recognize the claimant but remembers the name. She testified that the claimant looked like her mother who was the friend of the witness.\n[22] The panel finds that XXXX is not a suitable witness to establish the claimant's identity on a balance of probabilities. The claimant's account that she recognized the name from the age of seven is simply difficult to believe. The panel does not give the claimant the benefit of the doubt given her inclination to provide false information to suit her purposes. Furthermore, XXXX has had no contact the claimant or her mother in the last 24 years. The witness who herself did not recognize the claimant until the claimant told her who she was, is not reliable evidence to establish the claimant's alleged identity. The panel gives no weight to XXXX XXXX as an identity witness.\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\n[23] The claimant met her second witness while she residing in Kenya. XXXX traveled in Kenya for a visit in XXXX 2016. She met the claimant and her mother in XXXX; they were neighbours. The panel finds XXXX is also not a suitable witness. If the panel is to believe this witness, the only reliable information she can establish is that the claimant was in Kenya in XXXX 2016. XXXX testified that the claimant introduced herself as XXXX. The claimant provided a name to the witness; there was no reason for the witness to question or disbelieve it. In contrast, it is clear to the panel that there are sufficient reasons to disbelieve the claimant regarding her identity. The panel finds that XXXX testimony does not establish the identity or nationality of the claimant on a balance of probabilities. The panel gives no weight to the witness to establish the identity of the claimant.\nAffidavit from mother\n[24] The panel notes that the claimant provided an affidavit from her mother who is living in Kenya. While the statement has been notarized, the panel finds any weight given to the document is severely diminished as a result of the claimant's own lack of credibility. The document does nothing to address the claimant's lack of credibility. Moreover, the claimant's mother was not tendered as a witness so to test the veracity of the statements provided.\nThe claimant's birth certificate\n[25] The claimant provided a birth certificate that was allegedly issued in Somalia. The claimant alleged that her mother obtained the document for her. Prior to the commencement of the hearing, the panel disclosed two Response to Information Requests (RIRs).8 These documents provided information regarding the names of mayors in Mogadishu at the time the birth certificate was issued. The mayor's name on the claimant's birth certificate was not included in any of the RIRs. The claimant provided confusing and evolving testimony regarding when the document was obtained and the name of the current mayor of Mogadishu. It is not clear why the current mayor of Mogadishu would be named on a document that was allegedly issued in 1990. The panel gives no weight to the claimant's birth certificate to establish her identity.\n[26] The circular and evolving testimony regarding how the document was obtained also undermined the claimant's credibility. The panel notes that a forgery system for identity documents has flourished in Somalia for over two decades.9 Given the claimant's capacity to give false statements, the panel concludes that the document is neither reliable nor trustworthy. The panel finds it does not establish the claimant's identity on a balance of probabilities.\nLetter from XXXX XXXX\n[27] The claimant provided a letter dated January 5, 2017 from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX10 signed by Dr. XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX. In part, Dr. XXXX states that refugee claimants referred to them undergo a rigorous community verification assessment to verify nationality and citizenship. This includes a written questionnaire in Somali and as an oral interview assessing language, background, geography, history, heritage and culture. Following the assessment, Dr. XXXX wrote\" Ms. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX DOB (XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX1986) he is a Citizen and Nationality of Federal Republic of Somalia\". [sic]\n[28] The panel does not accept the claimant's identity based on the assessment of Dr. XXXX. While Dr. XXXX states that there is a rigorous assessment process before attesting to a client's identity, nationality and citizenship, he does not provide details of how he came to his conclusion. Having knowledge of a country's language, history, geography, etc., does not establish a person's identity or nationality. There are many people in Canada who speak Somali, have knowledge of the history of Somalia and may even know districts in Mogadishu; but they are Canadian citizens and not nationals or citizens of Somalia. Furthermore, having knowledge of such information does not establish the personal identity of a claimant. Dr. XXXX does not indicate how he confirmed or verified the claimant's name or date of birth. He also makes no statement to indicate that there was any independent interview with anyone to confirm the facts as told by the claimant. While the panel can accept the claimant's ethnicity could be Somali, this letter does not establish her personal identity nor does it establish her nationality on a balance of probabilities.\nMedical Assessment from XXXX XXXX, Registered Psychotherapist\n[29] The panel has considered the assessment provided by Ms. XXXX XXXX, a registered psychotherapist. While the panel notes that the Ms. XXXX may have found that the claimant is exhibiting symptoms consistent with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, generalized XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, the panel finds that this is not persuasive evidence for Ms. XXXX to state with any certainty that the claimant experienced what was alleged to the panel and in the circumstances as alleged. While Ms. XXXX noted no internal inconsistencies, it is now evident that the claimant has the capacity to be misleading.\n[30] As stated in Danailov11, with respect to the assessment of a physician's evidence and the question of the assessment of credibility, \"that opinion evidence is only as valid as the truth of the facts on which it is based.\" Ms. XXXX relied upon the information given to her by the claimant. While the panel does not dispute the opinion of Ms. XXXX, the reason for that finding was made from information provided by the claimant. Given that the panel has found the claimant not to credible in key areas of her claim, the panel assigns no weight to the assessment of Ms. XXXX.\nSubmissions from counsel\n[31] Counsel submitted that the claimant should have another opportunity to establish her identity and credibility. She also requested that the claimant's witness should have an opportunity to re-testify. The panel dismisses the request and will neither re-open the hearing nor allow XXXX to re-testify. It was open to the claimant and her counsel to submit an application for XXXX to be a witness at the second sitting on April 3, 2017. Both the claimant and the counsel were well aware of the identity issues in this claim. Moreover, given the panel found that XXXX was not a suitable witness for the claimant at the first sitting because she herself did not recognize the claimant and relied on information provided to her by the claimant, the panel finds that XXXX is unlikely to provide any information that will establish the claimant's identity on a balance of probabilities. XXXX has not seen the claimant in over 24 years; she did not recognize the claimant and under these circumstances, she cannot reasonably establish on a balance of probabilities that the claimant is who she says she is or establish she has not acquired nationality in any other country.\n[32] Counsel provided internet articles regarding the reliability of biometrics. As the claimant has now admitted to being in Cairo and having her fingerprints taken, the articles are moot and have no value.\n[33] Counsel submitted that the claimant deserved a full hearing to establish her identity and credibility. The claimant has been given ample opportunity to establish her identity with credible, reliable and trustworthy evidence. Having considered the evidence before the panel, the panel finds that the claimant has not done so with reliable and trustworthy.\n[34] It has been established that a claim for refugee protection must be rejected as soon as it has been determined that the claimant's identity has not been established.12 It has also been established that where, on the totality of the evidence, the claimant's identity has not been established, there is no need to go on to analyze the merits of the claim.13\n[35] Counsel citing Mohacsi v. Canada14 wherein the Federal Court stated that the Division should not be quick to apply North American logic and reasoning to the claimant's behaviour, claimant's age, education, cultural background, previous social experiences and psychological condition. Counsel submitted that the claimant is unsophisticated with little education. She points out that the claimant has only been in Canada since late 2016. Her limited English means she has to rely on the Somali community for assistance. Counsel submits that lack of sophistication should be considered when assessing the claimant's responses to questions posed to her.\n[36] The panel agrees it is true that a claimant's level of education and sophistication is a consideration when considering responses to certain questions. Not all questions posed to a claimant will necessarily be excused or explained by a claimant's level of education or sophistication. Furthermore, while some claimants may have a distrust of government authorities because of their experiences or where they are from, the panel notes that the claimant also mislead her counsel, who is not a person in government authority. This was evident in her affidavit that she was dishonest with her lawyer.15 Being unsophisticated or uneducated and being truthful is not mutually exclusive. Giving honest and true testimony is not excluded because one is uneducated or unsophisticated.\n[37] The claimant decided to \"come clean\" after the hearing. She explained that when you tell the truth people will trust you, she would not want to be lied to. This demonstrates she understands the difference between the truth and lying. This also demonstrates that she understood precisely what she was doing at her hearing. The claimant's actions demonstrate that she is neither trustworthy nor reliable.\n[38] The panel finds the principal claimant was neither a credible nor reliable witness. While the panel accepts she may be ethnically Somali, it does not preclude her from having obtained another nationality. The panel finds that the claimant has not established with reliable and trustworthy evidence who she is or where she is from.\nCONCLUSION\n[39] The panel finds that the claimant has failed to establish her personal or national identity on a balance of probabilities with credible or trustworthy evidence.\n[40] The panel finds that there is not a serious possibility of persecution and that the claimant would not be on a balance of probabilities, subjected personally to a risk to her life, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture. Accordingly, the claimant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\n[41] In order for the Division to consider the merits of any claim, and make a favourable decision, a claimant must establish their identity with credible or trustworthy evidence. Where a claimant fails to establish their identity, the Division has no credible or trustworthy evidence upon which it could make a favourable decision. The panel finds that, since the claimant failed to establish her identity, the Panel has no credible or trustworthy evidence upon which it could have made a favourable decision. Therefore, pursuant to s. 107(2) of the Act, the panel finds that this claim has no credible basis.\n[42] The claim is rejected.\n(signed)\n\"N. Stocks\"\nN.

Fraser\nConseil du (de la) ministre\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The claimant is XXXX XXXX. He seeks refugee protection against Mongolia pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nAllegations\n[2] This claim was based on the following allegations. The claimant alleges that he faces persecution in Mongolia because he is homosexual. The claimant knew he was homosexual by the time he was 14 years old. His first relationship was with a man named XXXX whom he is still in contact with today. In XXXX 2014, the claimant met a woman named XXXX (XXXX). Due to pressure from his family, the claimant agreed to marry XXXX despite his sexual orientation. In XXXX 2015, the claimant became secretly involved with a male coworker by the name of XXXX. In XXXX 2016, the claimant revealed to his wife that he was homosexual. XXXX reacted poorly and made attempts to embarrass and discredit the claimant before his coworkers and family. XXXX filed for a divorce. XXXX brother, XXXX, was a member of a Mongolian XXXX group that started to target and threaten the claimant. The claimant went into hiding, but XXXX found the claimant and tried to kill him. The claimant managed to escape and went into hiding again. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, the claimant left Mongolia and arrived in the U.S. The claimant went to Fort Erie on XXXX XXXX, 2016 and sought protection at the border, as his sister resided in Canada. The claimant signed his Basis of Claim on December 20, 2016.\n[3] The Minister intervened on the basis of credibility and appeared in person at the hearing.\nDetermination and Reasons\n[4] The identity of the claimant was established on the basis of his Mongolian passport, the original of which was seized by the Minister.\n[5] The panel took into consideration The Chairperson's Guidelines on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression when considering the process of the hearing and the assessment of evidence in this case.1\n[6] This claim is dismissed. For the following reasons, the panel finds that this claim is not credible. The panel makes this determination for the following reasons:\na) The claimant was not credible about his marriage to XXXX. The panel finds that it is unlikely there was a marriage.\nb) The claimant's narrative and allegations of precipitating events was predicated upon his marriage to XXXX. Whereas that marriage was not credible, critical parts of the narrative were not credible either.\nc) Significant elements of this narrative and claim demonstrated inconsistencies, embellishments, or otherwise a general lack of credibility. The claimant was not credible with respect to events involving XXXX, for example, nor was the claimant credible with respect to his relationship with his parents.\nd) There were significant omissions from the documentary evidence.\nAnalysis\n[7] For a number of reasons as follows, the panel does not believe that the claimant's narrative of events occurred in Mongolia as he described.\n[8] The panel will reserve its assessment of the evidence after the panel has outlined all of the evidence of concern.\nThe Claimant's Parents\n[9] For example, there were significant inconsistencies in the evidence about the claimant's relationship with his parents.\n[10] The Basis of Claim described the following:\nXXXX went to my parents and told them about me. My father was extremely mad. When I saw him he yelled, punched me and told me that I was a disgrace to my family. He told me that I was not his son any longer and I was not to enter his home ever again. My mother was crying when I left. (Para. 14).\n...\nMy mother received a message saying XXXX knew I was staying with a friend. ...\nI was depressed wondering why I had to live like this and why I could not be like other people. At this point, I was rejected from my own family ... (para. 21)\n[11] Further, at paragraph 23 of the BOC, the claimant stated he could not go to his parents for help. In his refugee intake interview, he stated that his parents hated him. In a letter of support, the claimant's sister writes that his father was unyielding in his view about homosexuals and that he considered the claimant was neither a son nor a daughter.\n[12] At the first session of this hearing, the claimant described that when XXXX told his parents on XXXX XXXX, 2016, the claimant's father said \"you're not my son anymore, I don't want to talk to you.\" His father punched him. The claimant's mother did not say anything, she was just crying. The claimant said that he does not talk to his father anymore, and only sometimes talks to his mother.\n[13] The Minister's evidence, on the other hand, consisted of Facebook pictures, which included the claimant together with his parents at the airport on the day he left Mongolia, on XXXX XXXX, 2016. This concerns the panel because it suggests that the claimant's relationship with his parents was not strained as he has tried to convey.\n[14] When asked about why his parents were at the airport to see him off, the claimant explained he was their only son and his mother pushed his father to go say goodbye. The claimant described that it was a difficult and uncomfortable situation. His mother said they should at least get a picture together. The claimant explained that it was likely his mother, not his father, that posted the pictures to his father's Facebook page, as he understood his father to be unfamiliar with Facebook. The claimant explained it was his mother that created his father's Facebook account. November 3, 2016 was the first time the claimant had seen his father since July 17, 2016.\nThe Date of Marriage\n[15] The claimant's evidence was inconsistent with respect to his date of marriage.\n[16] In the BOC narrative, the claimant stated that he met his wife in XXXX 2014 and married her a short time later. In the claimant's refugee intake forms, however, he declared that the date of marriage was XXXX XXXX, 2014. When first asked about the date of marriage, the claimant testified that the date was XXXX XXXX, 2015. The claimant explained that the incorrect date of marriage in the refugee intake form was probably his own mistake.\n[17] At the second session of this hearing, however, the claimant could not recall the date of his marriage. Further, in the divorce petition, which was authored by his wife, the date of co-habitation was stated as XXXX XXXX, 2015, and the date of marriage was stated as XXXX XXXX, 2015. The claimant testified that he lived with his wife starting on XXXX XXXX, 2015, and then was married roughly a week later.\n[18] When asked about the discrepancy, and why the wife wrote XXXX XXXX, 2015 as the date of marriage, the claimant said he did not know. He just went for the divorce, that's what she wrote, and the claimant did not look into the details. The claimant did not produce a marriage certificate and testified that he had to hand it in to authorities when they filed for divorce. The claimant testified that he never thought he would require a copy. He registered the marriage with local authorities, but never requested a copy for proof at this hearing.\n[19] The claimant further made submissions that proof of his marriage to XXXX was not specifically related to his persecution or his sexual orientation and as such he did not make efforts to obtain proof of the marriage until the second session of this hearing on August 17, 2017. Only after the panel asked about such proof did the claimant realize it would be helpful evidence.\nThe Claimant's U.S. Visa Application\n[20] The Minister also presented evidence of the claimant's U.S. visa application which was made in XXXX 2015, approximately one month after the date of marriage. The visa application contained a significant inconsistency.\n[21] The U.S. visa application stated that the claimant was married to a woman named XXXX XXXX, whose date of birth was XXXX XXXX, 1989. The claimant's evidence was that his real wife XXXX XXXX was 21 years older than himself and was born in 1967.\n[22] The claimant explained that the incorrect spouse's name on the visa application was due to an error by the agency that completed the application. The claimant had given the agency all of his personal information, and all other information in the visa application was correct including, for example, the information about the claimant's parents and the claimant's employment.\n[23] The claimant further explained that the purpose of the trip to the U.S. was for his honeymoon with XXXX. They were in the U.S. for 2 months, visiting Los Angeles and Las Vegas and basically having fun. The claimant had no pictures of this trip, nor any other pictures of himself with XXXX. The claimant explained that he had no pictures because he never posted anything publically and he was trying to keep his relationship out of the public for fear of what people might say. Pictures from the honeymoon were on an old phone that the claimant no longer had.\nXXXX, the Hotel, and XXXX\n[24] There were significant concerns with the claimant's evidence about XXXX brother, XXXX, the assault at the hotel, and the claimant's time in XXXX.\n[25] The BOC narrative described that the claimant lived at a hotel in XXXX from XXXX XXXX, 2016 until XXXX XXXX, 2016. July 17 was the date when the claimant told XXXX about his sexual orientation and she thereafter commenced a campaign of harassment and threats against him. XXXX XXXX, 2016 was the date that XXXX and two other men found the claimant and assaulted him at the hotel. The claimant described XXXX as a violent Mongolian XXXX. In the BOC, the claimant described him as \"basically a neo-Nazi.\" The claimant described that it was the goal of this nationalist group to eradicate homosexuals and foreigners and to keep the blood pure in Mongolia.\n[26] When the claimant was asked why he stayed at a hotel, the claimant replied that if he stayed at a hotel, nobody would figure out where he was. He wanted time to think and he did not immediately go to a friend's house.\n[27] The claimant had no explanation about how XXXX discovered that the claimant was staying at the hotel and was able to discover him there on XXXX XXXX, 2016. He speculated that XXXX may have followed him after the claimant went for a divorce, or may have had contacts with the police, because the nationalist groups in Mongolia are powerful.\n[28] The claimant described that he heard a knock at his hotel room door. He looked through the peep-hole and thought the person was housekeeping. He opened the door and XXXX and two other men entered the room. They beat him up and brought him up to the roof. They were going to throw him off the roof to make it look like a suicide. They were decisive and determined to kill him. The claimant managed to escape. The claimant could not elaborate or give any detail about how he managed to escape.\n[29] The claimant then fled to another town, XXXX, which was approximately 50 kilometers away. He stayed with a friend there named XXXX for another two months until he fled Mongolia on XXXX XXXX, 2016. XXXX again tracked him down. The claimant speculated that XXXX made a good guess as to where the claimant was that time, because XXXX was one of the claimant's only close friends.\n[30] The claimant produced a letter of support from XXXX.2 Contrary to the BOC narrative which conveyed that the claimant fled to XXXX after XXXX XXXX, 2016, and contrary to the claimant's own testimony that he did not immediately stay with a friend, XXXX letter described that the claimant had arrived in XXXX in XXXX 2016 and stayed with XXXX for four months. The letter described that the claimant was running from his ex-wife and her relatives, and he had been beaten. Nowhere did the claimant's evidence, however, describe that he had been beaten prior to XXXX XXXX, 2016.\n[31] The claimant then explained that sometimes he stayed with his friend, sometimes in the hotel. He was going in-between. The claimant explained that perhaps he was not clear originally in his BOC. He never said that he lived exclusively at one place or the other.\nOmissions from the Evidence\n[32] As the panel has described above, there were a number of documents absent from the evidence which the panel could have reasonably expected to be present such as the marriage certificate and pictures of the claimant and his wife together. The panel has reviewed the claimant's explanations for those absent documents above.\n[33] In addition to that, the panel notes an absence of the following additional documents.\n[34] The claimant alleged and testified that when XXXX began harassing the claimant, the claimant lost his employment. Despite this, the employer provided him with a reference. The claimant testified that he never kept a copy of the letter for himself.\n[35] With respect to the claimant's first relationship, XXXX, the claimant's earliest proof of this relationship were messages dated from XXXX XXXX, 2016, which coincidentally, was after the claimant had already arrived at Viva La Casa in preparation for his refugee claim in Canada. The claimant had no earlier proof of this relationship despite his allegations and testimony that he always kept in touch with XXXX over Facebook. The claimant described that he always destroyed evidence of his communication with XXXX.\nThe Panel's Findings\nThe Marriage to XXXX\n[36] With respect to the claimant's marriage to XXXX, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that there was no marriage.\n[37] The inconsistencies surrounding the date of marriage severely undermine the integrity of the narrative. The claimant's refugee intake forms, the claimant's own testimony, and the claimant's supporting documents (namely, the wife's divorce petition) are all inconsistent with one another with respect to the date of marriage. The panel finds that this would not be the case if the claimant had in fact been married to XXXX. The panel draws a negative inference against the claimant owing to these inconsistencies.\n[38] The U.S. visa application error is an especially critical flaw in the evidence which the panel finds is a key point adverse to the claimant. The panel finds it unlikely that the visa application would have named another spouse, especially when the claimant and XXXX were just married the previous month and were intending to travel together. The panel does not find it a reasonable explanation that the agency made such a glaring mistake about the spouse's name, given that the agency accurately reported every other piece of personal information on the application. Had the claimant genuinely been married to XXXX as alleged, XXXX likely would have been declared as the claimant's wife on his U.S. visa application. The panel draws a negative inference against the claimant owing to this inconsistency.\n[39] The absence of other documents such as pictures from the honeymoon and a marriage certificate further undermine the allegation of the claimant's marriage to XXXX. It is not a reasonable explanation that the claimant was trying to keep the marriage from public view. The claimant did not have to share pictures of his marriage with the public. The point is that this claimant was technologically knowledgeable and capable. The claimant had extensive pictures of his employment and his own family maintained pictures of the claimant. His family was looking forward to his marriage. The claimant and his family kept visual records of his life. If the claimant was married to XXXX, there would have been at least some pictures of it whether the claimant was keeping these from public view or not.\n[40] The absence of a marriage certificate is another notable omission given that the marriage was registered with local authorities and the claimant could have made reasonable steps to retrieve a copy. He made no such effort until after the hearing. The panel disagrees with the claimant's submissions that proof of the marriage is irrelevant to the claimant's persecution and sexual orientation. The entire narrative of the precipitating events were predicated upon the marriage to XXXX. The claimant engaged in the marriage to try and keep his sexual orientation concealed. The claimant presented the marriage as something he had to endure. It was an example of persecution in itself. It was, allegedly, evidence of the pressure he faced to conform in Mongolian society. Without the marriage, he would not have been terminated from his employment, nor rejected from his family. Without the marriage, there are no precipitating events leading to the claimant's allegations of persecution.\n[41] It is not a reasonable explanation that the claimant did not think proof of his marriage would be relevant. The marriage was the defining and key point in this narrative. In the claimant's submissions, it was indicated that the marriage certificate is currently en route from Mongolia via courier, but as of the date of this decision, it has not been received by this Board and no application has been made to admit it as post-hearing evidence.\n[42] Given the privacy controls available with a Facebook account, it lacks credibility that the claimant felt the need to delete evidence of his history and conversations with XXXX. The panel finds it to be a significant omission from the evidence that the claimant could not produce evidence of this relationship prior to the time that he made his refugee claim.\n[43] The panel draws a negative inference against the claimant owing to the omissions from the evidence.\nXXXX, the Hotel, and XXXX\n[44] The threat from XXXX is predicated on the claimant's marriage to XXXX, so given that the marriage to XXXX is not credible, neither is the narrative regarding XXXX. Given the panel's findings that the marriage to XXXX did not occur, the panel also finds that the events involving XXXX did not happen.\n[45] Even notwithstanding the panel's findings about the marriage to XXXX however, the evidence surrounding XXXX was not credible in itself. If the claimant was hiding in a hotel and was fearing for his life, he would not have opened the door for XXXX and he would have been suspicious about someone claiming to be \"room service.\" The claimant was vague and lacking detail about how he managed to escape a violent group of ultra-nationalist men who were determined to kill him, had him on the roof, and had already beaten him up. The claimant was vague over how he was able to escape, and the panel finds it notable that this issue was not dealt with in the claimant's submissions either. It was simply not a believable part of the narrative and this panel does not accept it.\n[46] It may be remotely plausible that XXXX was able to find the claimant at the hotel, but considering the totality of the evidence, the panel does not believe it happened. Plausibility does not mean probability. The totality of the narrative surrounding XXXX appears embellished and improvised.\n[47] The claimant's evidence was inconsistent about his travel between the hotel and XXXX, and his testimony to explain the inconsistencies was evolving.\n[48] Owing to these credibility concerns surrounding XXXX and XXXX, the panel draws a negative inference against the claimant.\nThe Claimant's Parents\n[49] Similar to the plausibility of XXXX finding the claimant at the hotel, likewise, the claimant's explanation for his father at the airport may have been plausible. However, plausibility does not make something credible on a balance of probabilities. A claimant's evidence is presumed to be truthful, but in this case, there is ample reason to find that it is not. There are far too many significant discrepancies and inconsistencies in the evidence as a whole for this panel to find that this narrative was credible or probable. The panel finds that the claimant's evidence has been embellished in significant respects, if not entirely misrepresented in other respects.\n[50] That is the case as well with respect to the claimant's parents. Given the claimant's allegations about his parents, the panel does not find it credible that the claimant's parents attended at the airport to see him off. Both the Minister and the claimant made extensive submissions about the claimant's father at the airport. The panel does find it unlikely that the claimant's father would have attended at the airport given the claimant's allegations about his father. However, the panel finds the evidence of the claimant's mother is perhaps even more revealing. In the claimant's allegations and in his refugee intake, he conveyed that both his parents hated him. He could not turn to either of them. In his testimony, however, the claimant tried to minimize and soften that evidence with respect to his mother.\n[51] The panel finds that the claimant's allegations did embellish or misrepresent the state of his relationship with his parents. Owing to this concern, the panel draws a negative inference against the claimant's narrative of events as alleged in Mongolia.\n[52] Given all of these findings and the panel's assessment of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant has not been subject to the risks that he has alleged in Mongolian society. The panel does not find his narrative is credible.\n[53] The panel has considered other evidence that the claimant presented in support of this claim including, for example, the letter of support from his former boyfriend XXXX, the police report, and post-hearing evidence from XXXX XXXX. The panel does not find that this evidence overcomes the credibility concerns that the panel has outlined above.\nThe National Documentation Package Evidence\n[54] The panel has reviewed the national documentation evidence with respect to LGBT persons in Mongolia. The United Nations and USAID, for example, report that the laws of Mongolia do not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, nor is sexual orientation criminalized. The government, moreover, is taking steps to reform existing laws to bring equity to the LGBT community.3 Most members of the LGBT community in Mongolia report having experienced some form of abuse by law enforcement, which in some cases has included blackmail and violence.4 Mongolian culture and society generally has been unwelcoming and not open to acceptance of the LGBT community. Social pressures cause LGBT persons to hide their sexual identities. There have been recorded instances of violence, stigma, and harassment by ultra-nationalist groups.5 LGBT persons face discrimination in relation to their employment, education, the health care system, family affairs, and in the media.6 The U.S. Department of State report largely concurs with these findings, but also notes that there is no specific prohibitions in the law against discrimination based on sexual orientation.7\n[55] The panel acknowledges the national documentation evidence which indicates that life in Mongolia may often be discriminatory and difficult for persons of the LGBT community. However, the panel cannot conclude that such discrimination and difficulty rises to persecution en masse against all persons of the LGBT community. The panel disagrees with the claimant's submission that the only issue is whether the claimant is homosexual. While the panel has considered the claimant's evidence of his involvement with the LGBTQ community here in Canada, the panel does not consider that sufficient to establish this claim. Upon the panel's review of the national documentation evidence for Mongolia, it is not sufficient for a person to demonstrate they are homosexual. This claimant has the onus of demonstrating how he fits the profile of a person affected and persecuted by his sexual orientation. He has not done so. His narrative in that respect was simply not credible for all of the reasons that this panel has outlined above.\nConclusion\n[56] For all of these reasons, the panel finds that this claim was not credible.\n[57] In respect of section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the panel finds that the claimant's fear is not well-founded. The claimant does not face a serious possibility of persecution if he returns to Mongolia, and the claimant is not a Convention refugee.\n[58] In respect of section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant does not face a risk of harm, nor a risk of cruel or unusual punishment, nor torture. The claimant is not a person in need of protection.\n[59] This claim is dismissed.\n(signed)\n\"Daniel McKeown\"\nDaniel McKeown\nSeptember 19, 2017\nDate\n1 http:\/\/www.irb-cisr.gc.ca\/Eng\/BoaCom\/references\/pol\/GuiDir\/Pages\/GuideDir09.aspx.\n2 Exhibit 8 at page 3.\n3 See NDP item 6.2 at page 8-9.\n4 NDP 6.2 at page 9.\n5 NDP 6.2 at page 9.\n6 NDP 6.2 at page 9-10.\n7 NDP 2.1 at pages 21-22.\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRPD.29.1 (August 31, 2012)\nRPD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SPR : TB6-18033\n",

Instead of returning to the PRC he found work for which he did not have proper authorization.\n[4] The claimant did not disclose to Canadian authorities that he was no longer a student and that he was working when he applied for an extension of his Student Visa.\n[5] He did not disclose to his parents that he was no longer attending school.\n[6] When his parents arrived in Canada at the end of 2015 and became aware that he was not attending school the relationship between himself and his parents became tense.\n[7] At a park near where he lived he saw Falun Gong practitioners and was receptive to an invitation to practice Falun Gong.\n[8] He fears returning to the PRC because Falun Gong is illegal in the PRC.\nANALYSIS\n[9] The determinative issue in this claim is credibility\nIdentity\n[10] The claimant's personal identity, as a national of the PRC, is established by way of a copy of his passport.3\nCredibility\n[11] The claimant was asked about his successful application to extend his student visa in 2013, when he was not a student but employed. He explained that when his initial student visa was coming to the end of its validity he contacted an agency to seek an extension. The claimant did not know the name of the school or the program that he was supposed to attend with the extended visa.\n[12] As the extended visa was set to expire again in 2016, the claimant arranged for the same agency to apply for an extension. His application was denied on September 16, 2016 because Canadian authorities had requested recent education transcripts that were not provided. He was advised that his temporary resident status in Canada was expired and he was required to leave Canada immediately. He waited more than two months to put forth a claim for protection.\n[13] The claimant's actions by not indicating to Canadian authorities that he had stopped attending school, had found work without proper authorization and continued to pursue extensions of his student visa while being fully aware that he was not planning to go to school and continuing to work without authorization is indicative of his willingness to be untruthful in order to achieve his objective to remain in Canada.\n[14] The panel makes a general finding that the claimant is not a credible and trustworthy witness.\n[15] The claimant testified that he became involved with Falun Gong in January\/February 2016. He was taught the fundamental teaching of Falun Gong as being Truth, Compassion, and Forbearance and became dedicated to the practice in February 2016.\n[16] He was asked to explain his actions of attempting to obtain an extension of his student visa in July 2016, knowing that he was not intending to continue his studies and not being truthful with Canadian authorities regarding working without being authorized to do so. He explained that the student visa would have allowed him to remain in Canada and continue to practice Falun Gong. His explanation is not satisfactory. It is reasonable to expect that if the claimant has embraced the fundamental tenets of Falun Gong; Truth, Compassion and Forbearance, he would be truthful with Canadian authorities.\n[17] The claimant identified that he read the main text of Falun Gong which he identified as \"Falun Dafa\" daily. Asked to provide further details regarding his readings he gave no answer. The claimant was referred to his BOC narrative where he wrote that the main text of Falun Gong is \"Zhuan Falun\" and asked why he did not know the name of the main text as indicated in his BOC. He explained that he was nervous and he forgot. His explanation is not satisfactory. It is reasonable to expect the claimant's testimony to be consistent with his oral testimony regarding the main text of Falun Gong. Further, given that he alleges that he has read the book daily, he should be able to provide further details regarding the main text.\n[18] It is difficult to make a determination based on the genuineness of one's Falun Gong practice however, in the particular circumstances of the claimant, in which he has shown a willingness to be untruthful prior to allegedly becoming a practitioner of Falun Gong and then after allegedly embracing the basic tenets of Truth, Compassion and Forbearance disregards the basic tenets by continuing to be untruthful with Canadian authorities by attempting to obtain a further extension to his student visa in July 2016, along with not knowing the name of the main text of Falun Gong and not being able to provide further details with regard to what he allegedly read on a daily basis, leads the panel to determine, based on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is not a genuine Falun Gong practitioner.\n[19] The panel further determines, based on his attempts to knowingly deceive Canadian authorities by attempting to obtain extensions of his student visa when he was not a student and to working without authorization, and the panel finding that he is not a credible and trustworthy witness, that his claim is manifestly unfounded.\n[20] Based on the totality of findings noted above, the panel determines that the claimant has not satisfied his burden of establishing a serious possibility that he would be persecuted or that he would be personally subjected to a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a risk of torture.\nConclusion\n[21] The claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. Therefore, the Refugee Protection Division rejects his claim.\n(signed)\n\"W. Kawun\"\nW.

The claimant fears that he will be persecuted because he offended XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, former director of BMPAD (Bureau de Mon\u00e9tisation des Programmes d'Aide au Development), an organization run by the government of Haiti. The claimant refused to participate in a bribe or kickback scheme, and he denounced the scheme to his supervisor. The person who was soliciting the kickback, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, was removed from his post and temporarily incarcerated, and he has threatened the claimant for exposing the kickback scheme.\n[2] The claimant arrived in Canada in August, 2016, and made a refugee claim at the port of entry. He alleges that the government of Haiti will not protect him, and that there is no safe place for him anywhere in Haiti.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[3] The claimant provided a certified copy of his passport1, his birth certificate2 and his driver's licence.3 He has also provided his marriage certificate4 and his education credentials.5 On a balance of probabilities, the claimant is a citizen of Haiti, and his identity is established.\nCredibility\n[4] Despite his advanced education at the university level, the claimant provided testimony that was vague and, at times, evasive. His oral testimony contradicted his written narrative in many respects. The claimant was seen to be inconsistent as between his oral testimony and his BOC (Basis of Claim form) on the question of what the bandits who attacked him had said to him, and what their connection may have been with the alleged persecutor, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\nSubjective fear\nFailure to claim elsewhere\n[5] The claimant was in the United States from August, 2016 to January, 2017. The claimant sojourned in the USA for more than four months. The panel asked the claimant for an explanation. The claimant was asked why he did not ask for protection in the United States. At first, the claimant said that he was thinking about what to do. Then, the claimant answered that he had to do research. He was asked what kind of research he had done prior to coming to Canada. He said that he researched the Internet. The claimant was asked what sites he had visited on the Internet that caused him to choose to seek protection in Canada. He said that he visited the site of the government of Canada. He was asked which government of Canada site he had visited, but he was unable to provide a more precise answer.\n[6] The claimant added that he chose Toronto, Canada because he has an aunt who lives in Toronto. The claimant failed to explain why he would choose to live near his aunt when two siblings residing in the United States.\n[7] In the Gomez Bedoya decision, the Federal Court held that:\nThe fact remains that the U.S. has ratified the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, and there is no reason to believe it does not abide by its obligations. The fact that the rate of successful applications may be lower there than in Canada does not justify the applicants' failure to seek refugee protection in the U.S. The Board could certainly take that factor into consideration in assessing Mrs. Bedoya's subjective fear: Breucop v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2004 FC 117; Pissareva v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2000] F.C.J. No. 2001 (F.C.T.D.).\n[8] The panel finds that it is unreasonable that the claimant made no attempts to try to file for asylum in the US when there was no guarantee that he would be granted refugee protection in Canada. If he were genuinely fleeing Haiti in fear of being persecuted, he could have and should have sought protection in the United States.\n[9] The fact that the claimant may have relatives in Canada is not an adequate explanation for failing to claim in a country which is a signatory to the Refugee Convention.6 The failure of the claimant to claim in the United States is an important factor in assessing the alleged subjective fear of the claimant. The claimant has shown a lack of subjective fear in his delay in leaving Haiti, in his more than four month delay in coming to Canada to claim, and in his failure to make a claim in the United States. The panel draws a negative inference as to the credibility of the claimant.\n[10] On that point, Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer said the following in Kamana v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] F.C.J. No. 1695 (QL), at paragraph 10:\n\"The lack of evidence going to the subjective element of the claim is a fatal flaw which in and of itself warrants dismissal of the claim, since both elements of the refugee definition-subjective and objective-must be met.\"\n[11] The claimant had ample opportunity to seek asylum in the US, but he chose not to. The panel finds that the claimant did not offer a reasonable explanation for why he did not apply for asylum in the US. It is reasonable to assume a person with a well-founded fear of persecution will attempt to apply for refugee protection without unreasonable delay. The claimant lacks subjective fear of being persecuted in Haiti. The panel finds that four months and a failure to claim in the US is not reasonable.\nCredibility\n[12] There is a presumption that the sworn testimony of a claimant is true unless there are reasons to doubt it. The claimant has provided numerous reasons to find that his testimony is lacking in truthfulness.\n[13] In paragraph 15 of his narrative, the claimant stated that he was receiving \"many threatening phone calls and text messages\". The BOC narrative states that he was threatened that \"I better behave and not interfere with what they were doing\". The claimant was asked at the hearing about the nature of the threats, and the claimant stated that the threatening messages told him that he would be killed if he did not remain quiet. The claimant was asked why he had not mentioned the death threats in his Basis of Claim form. The claimant said that he had omitted the death threat. The panel does not find it reasonable that a claimant would omit such an important detail as a death threat, and draws a negative inference as to the claimant's credibility due to this important omission.\n[14] At paragraphs 24 and 25 of the BOC narrative, the claimant stated that he was attacked by two men in August, 2016 while leaving work. He said that the attackers told him to keep his mouth shut. They also threatened his children, saying that they knew where his children went to school. The men also stole his work papers and money.\n[15] When asked to relate this conversation at the hearing, the claimant stated that the assailants told him that he was the cause of the assailants' boss losing his job. They also told the claimant that he was the reason their boss had spent time in jail. In other words, the oral testimony drew a direct link between the assault in August, 2016, and XXXX XXXX. XXXX, the alleged author of the claimant's difficulties and fears of remaining in Haiti.\n[16] The claimant was asked why he had not mentioned this aspect of the conversation in his narrative. He was unable to provide an explanation. This failure detracted from the credibility of the claimant.\n[17] The claimant produced a report7 from the office of the Justice of the Peace (Juge de Paix) reflecting a statement he made to the investigator with respect to the August 2016 assault. The claimant was asked why the investigator had not mentioned the death threats in the report. The claimant's explanation was that a Justice of the Peace would be circumspect about naming XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX or other high-ranking individuals in his report. It was pointed out to the claimant that Mr. XXXX XXXX XXXX could no longer be categorized as high-ranking, as he had lost his government position and had even spent time in jail. The claimant insisted that Mr. XXXX XXXX XXXX has great power and that he was a personal friend of the Minister of Finance, Winston Laleau.\n[18] It was pointed out to the claimant that Mr. Laleau was now the former Minister of Finance8, and therefore he did not wield the influence which the claimant attributed to him. The claimant stated that Mr. Laleau works in the Office of the new President of Haiti, Mr. Moise. While that may be true, the claimant nonetheless failed to produce evidence of the friendship of Mr. XXXX XXXX XXXX and Mr. Laleau, the former Minister of Finance. In addition, he was unable to refute a newspaper article9, which suggests that Mr. XXXX XXXX XXXX and Mr. Laleau are at loggerheads, having contradicted each other in their testimony before a Haitian government anti-corruption commission. The failure of the claimant to give a reasonable explanation as to how a former Minister of Finance, a man fired from his job because of corruption, could continue to pose a serious risk to the claimant undermined the claimant's credibility.\n[19] This claimant's testimony was lacking in credible and trustworthy evidence\nPersons in need of protection - Section 97\n[20] Having rejected the claim under Section 96, the panel must assess the claim on the basis of Section 97 of the Act. In order to establish their claim under Section 97, the claimant must establish that that there are substantial grounds to believe that he would be tortured, or at risk of losing his life or be subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he returned to his home country.\n[21] In light of the credibility concerns expressed above, the panel finds that the claimant has not established his claim under Section 97. The panel finds that the claimant has not provided sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that he would be tortured, or at risk of losing his life or be subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he returned to Haiti.\nCONCLUSION\n[22] The burden of establishing whether the claimant faces a serious possibility of being persecuted or is a person in need of protection lies upon the person asserting such allegations. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, and on the basis of the totality of documentary evidence disclosed, as well as on the basis of findings and negative inferences noted above, that the claimant has not provided credible and trustworthy evidence in support of his claim.\n[23] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel determines that the claimant has not established that there is a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground or that, on a balance of probabilities, he would personally be subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he were to return to Haiti.\n[24] The panel therefore concludes that the claimant XXXX XXXX is not a Convention refugee, nor is he a person in need of protection, and the Division rejects his claim.\n(signed)\n\"R.

The claimant's family has been a supporters of the opposition party Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) for many years. The claimant's older sisters and brother left Zimbabwe by the end of 2003. In December 2010, in his senior year of high school, the claimant and his friend put up posters for an upcoming MDC rally. In January 2011 the claimant and his friend attended the MDC rally. After the rally while trying to take the bus home, the claimant and his friend were detained by the police and taken to the Central police station. The claimant was slapped and asked questions. He was released a few hours later. In March 2011 the claimant attended a house party for MDC supporters. The police came to the party and told the attendees they had to leave or they would be arrested. The claimant ran out and was hit on the back as he ran out of the gate. The claimant left Zimbabwe in August 2011 to attend university in the USA. The claimant sent $100 through MoneyGram to his mother in June, July and August 2016 from the USA. His mother donated the money to the MDC on behalf of the claimant in Bulawayo. The police attended the claimant's parents' house looking for the claimant in September 2016 and seized the receipts of the MoneyGrams. The claimant's younger sister was treated harshly and his family was told that the claimant would be arrested if he returns to Zimbabwe. His parents and younger sister left for Botswana in September 2016. The claimant came to Canada from the USA in January 2017 and made a refugee claim at the border.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] After considering the totality of the evidence, I determine that the claimant is not a Convention refugee, pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA, nor is he a person in need of protection pursuant to section 97 of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\n[4] I am satisfied that the claimant has established his identity, on a balance of probabilities, as a citizen of Zimbabwe based on his testimony and his Zimbabwean passport seized by Immigration and Citizenship Canada at the border.3\n[5] The determinative issues in this claim were credibility, whether the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution based on his perceived political opinion, and whether the claimant would, more likely than not, be subjected personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, if he were to return to Zimbabwe.\nCredibility\n[6] After careful consideration of all the evidence and representations, I find that there is insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence with regards to pivotal areas of the claimant's testimony and the documentary evidence. The claimant was hesitant and questions were repeated and answers were prompted. The claimant is a young man with a university degree from the USA and the panel expected his oral evidence to be more forthcoming and articulate with regards to his political opinion. The core of the claim is that the claimant is a supporter of the MDC and that he sent money to his mother in the summer of 2016 in Zimbabwe and that his mother donated the money on his behalf to the MDC in Bulawayo. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is not known to the ZANU-PF as an MDC supporter or that the money he sent to his mother was given to the MDC as financial support. I also find that based on his testimony the claimant would not be perceived to be anti-government if he is to return to Zimbabwe presently. The following are some examples of the evidence I found to be not credible.\nClaimant's Alleged Political Profile\n[7] I find, based on the credibility concerns, that the claimant's political profile is not such to put him in danger of persecution. The counsel for the claimant submits that the claimant is credible because there were no major inconsistencies between his written and oral testimony. However, the claimant's oral testimony lacked credibility in that he was unable to describe his alleged political opinion with any clarity and coherence.\n[8] The claimant is not a member of the MDC but according to him, only a supporter of the MDC since December 2010. According to his testimony he did not join the youth committee of the MDC while in high school and did not know anyone in his high school that was a member of MDC. According to his viva voce evidence, the claimant was not politically active in Zimbabwe prior to leaving for the USA except when he posted a few posters up in his neighbourhood in December 2010 with his friend XXXX advertising a rally in January 2011, attending the rally in January 2011, and a party at an MDC supporter's house in March 2011. The claimant had no corroborating evidence from his friend XXXX who was allegedly with him at the rally and was detained with him. The claimant also had no idea what happened to the hosts at the party in March 2011, although he was in Zimbabwe until August 2011. The claimant's evasive testimony diminishes his credibility. I also find that these alleged events, even if they occurred, would not put the claimant in the radar of the authorities if he is to return to Zimbabwe.\n[9] The claimant stated at the Port of Entry (POE) that he attended \"rallies\" in Zimbabwe in opposition to the government4. His sister's letter5 also states that he attended rallies in Zimbabwe. However, according to his viva voce evidence and his BOC narrative6, the claimant only attended one rally in January 2011. I draw a negative credibility inference from the inconsistency in the claimant's evidence.\n[10] The claimant was 20 years old when he left Zimbabwe in August 2011 to attend University in the USA. The claimant alleges that although he is not a member of the MDC, he is a strong supporter of the MDC party. The claimant was questioned with regards to the structure of the MDC party, its organization, its history, and his knowledge of the MDC movement. The panel expects a MDC supporter to at least know when the MDC became part of the Unity government, what is the name of the two factions of MDC and the structure and the organization of the MDC. The claimant had minimal knowledge of the MDC.\n[11] The claimant was asked what the two factions of MDC are. He testified that there is MDC-T and after hesitating, he testified that the other faction is MDC- TB. When told by the panel that the other faction is not MDC-TB but MDC-N, he was silent. When asked who the leader of MDC-N faction is, the claimant was unable to answer the question. Most importantly, the claimant alleges that he is a follower of Morgan Tsvangirai, but did not know when Tsvangirai became the prime minister and for how long. He also did not know presently what factions are active in the MDC party and he knew nothing about MDC Youth Assembly. The claimant has never attended a meeting or gone to any rallies in North America in support of the MDC from 2011 until 2017. The claimant did not know anything about MDC chapters in North America. Lastly, the claimant could not provide a reasonable explanation, why he would not join the MDC outside of Zimbabwe if he is such a strong supporter once he left Zimbabwe. I find the claimant's political knowledge about opposition politics and his alleged support of MDC in Zimbabwe very poor to none-existent. Based on the claimant's evidence, I find that the claimant does not have a profile of a supporter of an opposition party in Zimbabwe.\n[12] The claimant testified that no one in his family except his brother, who lives in the USA since 2003, has ever been a member of the MDC but that his sisters and his parents are supporters of MDC. When asked whether he was harassed or persecuted when in Zimbabwe because of his brother's MDC connection he answered in the negative. The claimant testified that between 2011 and 2016 his parents and sister had no issues with the authorities. The claimant testified that his family's house was broken into several times after his older siblings left for the West sometime in 2003 and that his family were robbed a few times; and that when the police were called, they did not assist the claimant and his family or investigate the robberies properly. The claimant attributes the police incompetence to the well-known status of his family's support of the MDC. However, I do not find the police's incompetence of solving common criminality to be an indicia of political persecution in this particular case or that the police inaction is a rational or convincing evidence of the claimant's political profile as an MDC supporter.\n[13] The claimant also testified that his parents voted for the MDC in the 2013 elections and did not have any problems with the ZANU-PF. The panel expects that if the claimant's family is known as prominent MDC supporters, that around the time of the elections they would have some issues with harassment. Based on the claimant's evidence, I find that the claimant does not have a political profile of a member in the opposition who would be targeted if he is to return to Zimbabwe presently.\nClaimant's Financial Support of the MDC in Bulawayo in Summer of 2016\n[14] A central part of this claim is that the claimant sent $100 USD three times in the summer of 2016 to his mother through MoneyGram from the USA. The claimant testified that once his mother received the MoneyGram, she would go to the MDC chapter in Bulawayo and write down the claimant's name on a list of donors and give $100 on his behalf to the MDC party.\n[15] The test for plausibility is set in the leading case of Faryna v. Chorny:7\n....the real test of the truth of the story of a witness... must be its harmony with the preponderance of the probabilities which a practical and informed person would readily recognize as reasonable in that place and in those conditions.\n[16] I do not find the allegations of sending a MoneyGram to his mother for the purpose of supporting the MDC to be in harmony with the preponderance of probabilities. Firstly, when asked why the claimant did not directly send money to the MDC in USA, he testified he wanted to support the MDC in Bulawayo. When asked why then did he not send the money directly to the MDC in Bulawayo, but to his mother who then would go and take it to the MDC party and write down his name, the claimant had no explanation. The claimant's evidence concerning sending money through his mother to MDC party in Bulawayo lacks rationality and common sense.\n[17] The claimant provided a copy of a receipt of a MoneyGram8 dated June 11, 2016. However, there is no recipient name or destination on the receipt. I do not find the receipt of the MoneyGram to be a reliable corroborating evidence since there is no connection between this receipt and the claimant's allegations of sending financial support to the MDC in Bulawayo. I give little weight to this receipt as corroborating the claimant's allegations that he sent money to support the MDC in Bulawayo. Therefore, I find on a balance of probabilities, that although the claimant may have sent money to assist his family in Zimbabwe, that the money did not go to MDC party in Zimbabwe and that his name was not on a list of donors in Bulawayo chapter of MDC.\nThe Claimant's Evidence on Social Media Engagement Was Not Credible\n[18] The claimant testified at his hearing that he has engaged in opposition discussions on social media. He testified that he is aware of #This Flag Movement while in the USA and has commented on it on social media. The claimant had no explanation why he omitted this central piece of evidence from his narrative. He also testified that he has commented on twitter and WhatsApp on political issues, but did not have a print out or any corroborating evidence to indicate his alleged political profile on social media. I find that the claimant embellished his testimony and I draw a negative credibility inference from the claimant's omissions in his written evidence. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is not active on social media in opposition politics and that the authorities are not aware of the claimant's alleged political opinion.\nClaimant's Corroborative Evidence Was Not Reliable\n[19] The claimant provided a typed letter from his mother with the heading \"Affidavit of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\"9. This \"Affidavit\" does not include a notary seal and there is no indication that it was sworn in a legal chamber. The letter indicates that it was sworn in front of someone named XXXX XXXX, Commissioner of Oaths. The claimant did not provide any evidence that this typed letter actually came from Botswana. Further, there is no identity documents attached to the letter to show the writer is the claimant's mother or that she is in Botswana presently. The letter states that the parents are \"members and supporters\" of the MDC, in contradiction to the claimant's evidence that the only person in his family who is a member of MDC is his brother. I put little weight on the letter as corroborating the claimant's fear of persecution in Zimbabwe, since I cannot ascertain whether the letter is from Botswana or from his mother.\n[20] The claimant alleges that in September 2016 his younger sister was at home when the authorities came and looked for him and that his parents hid in the back yard. The claimant did not have a letter from his sister who was the person allegedly present when the police searched his home, but provided the above noted letter from his mother. When asked why there was no corroborating evidence from his sister who spoke to the authorities, the claimant testified that he thought his mother's letter would suffice. The panel does not find that to be a reasonable explanation and draws an adverse credibility inference from lack of corroborating evidence from the person who was allegedly present when the police came for the claimant, namely his sister.\n[21] The claimant also provided a letter from his brother in the USA and a letter from his sisters in Canada with identity documents attached10. The letters are is support of the claimant but these particular siblings were not in Zimbabwe at time of the claimant's departure or when he allegedly sent money to his mother. Furthermore, the letters do not confirm that they told the claimant in the USA or Canada to concentrate on his studies and not ask for protection when he first arrived in the USA or when he visited Canada 5 times before seeking protection in 2017. The panel puts little weight on these two letters as corroborating the claimant's allegations of persecution.\nDelay\n[22] Although the issue of delay is generally not determinative of a request for refugee protection, I have drawn a negative inference in this claim with respect to the claimant's failure to seek protection at the earliest opportunity in the USA or the five previous times the claimant entered Canada as a visitor. The claimant's action of coming into Canada from the USA to visit his sisters many times until coming in 2017 to ask for refugee claim, diminishes the claimant's credibility. When asked why he waited until January 2017 to ask for protection, the claimant testified that he was hoping that the situation in Zimbabwe would get better. I do not find the claimant's explanation reasonable because he did not demonstrate to me that he had any ongoing knowledge of what was happening over the years in the MDC party.\n[23] The claimant lived in the USA for over 5 years. The claimant lived with his brother the first year in the USA. The claimant's brother is a successful asylum seeker based on his political profile in Zimbabwe. The panel expects the claimant's brother would have told him that he has one year to apply for asylum upon entering the USA. Furthermore, the claimant's testimony that his brother told him to concentrate on his university studies instead of trying to guide him to ask for asylum based on his alleged fear of persecution lacks common sense and rationality. The claimant's explanation that he became afraid in September 2016 is inconsistent with his written evidence that he left Zimbabwe because he attended a rally and was at an MDC member's party in 2011. The claimant's failure to ask for protection in the USA significantly diminishes his credibility.\n[24] Lastly, the claimant's evidence demonstrates that he only began thinking of coming to Canada to seek protection when his American work visa was not renewed. According to the claimant's testimony, his work permit which was granted for one year post-graduation, was not going to be renewed in February 2017 because his employer would not sponsor him since he did not have five years or more experience in his field. The claimant's testimony was that he was told in September 2016 that the police are searching for him but he waited until January 2017 to come to Canada, one month prior to his work visa being terminated in the USA. I find that this demonstrates the claimant waited until he could not renew his work permit in the USA before entering Canada for the last time to seek protection. I draw a negative credibility inference from the delay from September 2016 until January 2017 in coming to Canada to seek protection.\nWell-founded Fear of Persecution\n[25] The central issue to be assessed in this case is whether the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution in his country of nationality by reason of one of the Convention grounds. In making this determination, the panel must assess whether the claimant has established that, on a balance of probabilities, he has a subjective fear and that this subjective fear, when objectively assessed in the context of country conditions, is one that is well-founded. As the definition of Convention refugee is forward looking, the claimant must establish that there is a \"serious possibility\" that he would be persecuted, if returned to Zimbabwe. It follows, therefore, that the fear of persecution is to be assessed at the time of the hearing. The claimant must establish that the fear is reasonable and justified, considering the objective situation in Zimbabwe. In other words, the claimant must establish that his fear of persecution has a valid basis. I find that the claimant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution based on the following analysis.\n[26] The claimant's political profile is not of someone who may reasonably be targeted as an opposition activist in Zimbabwe. The objective documentary evidence states that active and high ranking members of opposition parties, journalists, activists, and those in the front line of opposition are at risk of being persecuted. The claimant's assertions that he sent money to his mother and somehow this money was connected to the claimant by the Zanu-PF is not credible and does not raise his profile to such degree to bring him to the attention of the authorities.\n[27] Furthermore, the claimant did not provide objective documentary evidence such as news reports or any documents from the MDC that the Bulawayo MDC office was raided in September 2016 and therefore his name was discovered on a list of financial donors. Based on the lack of objective and subjective fear of persecution, I find that the claimant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution if he is to return to Zimbabwe presently.\n[28] Although not raised by the claimant or his counsel, I have also considered whether the claimant could have a sur place claim because of his alleged financial support of the MDC while he lived in the USA. I have looked to see whether the claimant's alleged action of sending money to Zimbabwe would result in the claimant coming to the attention of the Zanu-PF or the government authorities. However, since I find the claimant's evidence about the money sent to the MDC through his mother in Bulawayo in June, July and August 2016 to be untrustworthy and not credible, I also find that the claimant's sur place claim must fail.\n[29] Since I find that the core elements of the claim lacks credibility, I find that, more likely than not,11 the claimant will not face serious harm, should he return to Zimbabwe. Therefore, I conclude that the claimant is not a person in need of protection pursuant to sections 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b) of the IRPA, as there is no risk to life, or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture, upon returning to Zimbabwe.\nCONCLUSION\n[30] Based on the above analysis, I determine that the claimant is not a Convention refugee and not a person in need of protection in accordance with sections 96, 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b) of the IRPA and therefore, reject the claim.\n(signed)\n\"Sudabeh Mashkuri\"\nMarch 15, 2017\nDate\n1 As enacted by S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibit #2.\n3 Exhibit 1.\n4 Exhibit 1.\n5 Exhibit 5.\n6 Exhibit 2.\n7 Faryna v.

They are all of Tutsi ethnicity and were residing in the predominantly Tutsi neighbourhood of XXXX in Bujumbura.\n[7] The principal claimant took part in a women's protest against President Nkurunziza's third term in Burundi on May 13, 2015. On the same day, there was a failed attempt to overthrow the government, which authorities associated with the protest and as such, the protestors were considered by authorities to be coup plotters and accomplices. The claimants fled to Rwanda, however due to struggles there, they returned to Burundi a week later.\n[8] On August XXXX, 2015, the principal claimant was stopped by armed military, who physically and sexually assaulted her, saying they were \"putting Tutsi women in their place\". The principal claimant was detained for five weeks.\n[9] Upon her release, they moved neighbourhoods, and the principal claimant changed jobs. The principal claimant began experiencing problems at work from the executive director who was a Hutu.\n[10] The claimants travelled to the United States for vacation, and while there, the principal claimant's husband called to say that her close friend XXXX XXXX informed him that the National Intelligence Service are looking for the principal claimant as part of the reactivation of the manhunt for protestors during the May 2015 march.\n[11] The claimants made their claim for refugee protection as they fear arrest, detention, torture, and death at the hands of the authorities in Burundi due to their ethnicity and the principal claimant's participation in the May 2015 protest.\n[12] In addition, the principal claimant alleges that she cannot go to Guinea, where she has citizenship, due to her father being perceived as a traitor by the government.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[13] The panel is satisfied as to the personal identities of the claimants, as well as their identities as nationals of Burundi, based on their testimony and the documents filed, including certified true copies of their passports.3\nCountry of reference\n[14] The principal claimant was born in Guinea-Bissau to a father with Guinea-Conakry citizenship and a mother with Burundi citizenship.4\n[15] The panel finds that the principal claimant is a citizen of Burundi, as her mother was a citizen of Burundi at the time she was born.5 The panel finds the principal claimant's Burundi citizenship is confirmed by her passport.6 As such, the panel finds that Burundi is a country of reference for the principal claimant. In addition, given that the minor claimants have Burundi citizenship through their mother and as confirmed by their passports,7 the panel finds Burundi be a country of reference for the minor claimants as well.\n[16] The principal claimant testified that she has citizenship in Guinea. According to the Guinea civil code, a child born to a Guinean father is Guinean by birth, however Guinea does not allow dual citizenship.8 Given that her father is a Guinean national, the panel finds that the principal claimant either has or has access to Guinea citizenship. As such, the panel finds that Guinea-Conakry is a country of reference for the principal claimant.\n[17] The panel considered whether the minor claimants have access to Guinea citizenship. Both the Guinea Civil Code9 and the document submitted by counsel as post-hearing evidence10 indicate that citizenship is only passed through the mother in cases where the nationality of the father is unknown. Given that the two minor claimants are born to a father with Burundi citizenship,11 the panel finds they are not entitled to Guinean citizenship. Therefore, the panel finds Guinea-Conakry is not a country of reference for the minor claimants.\nRisk faced by the principal claimant in Guinea\n[18] The principal claimant alleges that her father, a national of Guinea-Conakry who currently resides in Burundi, has lived in exile since 1973. She alleges that due to his previous political activities, he is seen as a traitor by the Guinea government, and as such, she would face a serious possibility of persecution were she to return to Guinea.\n[19] In support of her allegations regarding the risk she would face in Guinea, the principal claimant provided a letter from her father, wherein he details his past history in Guinea and why he is considered a traitor there, as well as the risk that his daughter, the principal claimant, and her children, the minor claimants, would face should they go to Guinea.12\n[20] When asked who she feared in Guinea, the principal claimant testified that the names of those who fled Guinea, especially during Sekou Toure's time like her father, are recorded somewhere and passed down from fathers to sons. She testified that while she is not sure if it is the government or people outside of the government who would want to harm her based on her father's past actions, she believes that people in Guinea would want vengeance against her because of him. When asked how the alleged agents of persecution in Guinea would know that she had returned to Guinea, the principal claimant testified that they would know based on word of mouth and because she has the same last name as her father.\n[21] The panel noted claimant alleged in her narrative, that she was able to go to Guinea in 1993 for about six months.13 The principal claimant testified that she did not have any problems while there because of her father; however, she family members wanted to perform Female Genital Mutilation on her, which is why she and her mother left.\n[22] When asked if other family members of her father ever had problems with the authorities due to her father, the principal claimant testified that she did not know. The principal claimant submitted a letter from her father as post hearing evidence, wherein he indicates that his father died in 1958 prior to his problems in Guinea, his mother was a peasant who lived 350 km from Conakry and as such, was never interrogated; however, his younger brother was detained and tortured in 1973 for three months because of him.14\n[23] The panel noted that according to her allegations, her father was able to obtain for her a passport. When asked about this, the principal claimant testified that she does not know why or how he obtained the passport. In the letter from the principal claimant's father, submitted as post hearing evidence, he explains that a man named XXXX XXXX from a local non-governmental organization offered to get the Guinean passport for the principal claimant.15 Her father indicates in his letter that he is not sure how this man obtained the passport, and he does not know if this man told the Guinean authorities that the principal claimant was a national of Burundi.16\n[24] The panel finds that given the principal claimant's previous visit to Guinea, the passport that was issued in her name, and the letter from her father which does not indicate that his family mistreated by the Guinean authorities after 1974 due to his political activities, the panel finds that the principal claimant has not established that she would face a risk of harm on a forward looking basis, that is, a reasonable chance of persecution in regard to s. 96 of the IRPA, or, a likelihood of the harm that is set out in s. 97(1) of the IRPA, due to her father's political activities in Guinea.\nRisk faced by the minor claimants in Burundi\nCredibility of the principal claimant\n[25] The panel found the principal claimant to be a credible witness and therefore believes the allegations in support of the claim against Burundi. The principal claimant's testimony was straightforward, honest, and detailed regarding her participation in the women's march protesting against the third term of President Nkurunziza and her subsequent arrest and mistreatment at the hands of the authorities.\n[26] The panel asked the principal claimant about the time the claimants spent in Rwanda and their re-avilament to Burundi in July 2015. The principal claimant testified that she thought it would be better to die in Burundi, than to starve to death with her children in Rwanda. The panel notes that the two minor claimants were both fully dependent on their parents, financially and emotionally, and as such, the decision to return to Burundi was not theirs. In addition, given that the panel finds the claimants would be at risk in Burundi, based on their ethnicity and on the principal claimant's participation in the May 13, 2015 women's protest, the panel does not find their re-availment to be determinative to their claim.\n[27] The panel also notes that the claimants did not claim asylum in the United States, prior to coming to Canada. However, given that they have family in Canada, the panel notes that they have an exception to the safe third country agreement between Canada and the United States.\nSupporting documents\n[28] The claimants provided the following documents in support of their claim against Burundi: a letter from a woman who corroborates that the principal claimant attended the protest on May 15, 2015; letters from the principal claimant's husband which corroborate her allegations; and letters from XXXX and XXXX XXXX, corroborating that XXXX found out the principal claimant was on a list of people to be killed.17\nObjective country documentation on Burundi\n[29] In addition, the panel finds that the claimants' allegations are also corroborated by the objective country condition evidence regarding the treatment of protestors and Tutsis in Burundi.\n[30] The National Documentation Package indicates that protestors, civil society activists, and journalists were arrested by police and Imbonerakure, who often used excessive force and were responsible for unlawful killings, and there were reports of ill-treatment including torture of individuals while detained.18\n[31] Human Rights Watch's World Report 2016: Events of 2015 for Burundi (HRW Report) noted that following a failed coup d'\u00e9tat by a group of military officers on May 13, the government intensified its crackdown on protesters.19 This same HRW Report indicated that attacks by protesters against the police prompted police to seal or raid some neighborhoods of the capital; men in police uniforms then entered these areas, allegedly searching for weapons, and shot dead a number of unarmed residents, in some cases indiscriminately.20\n[32] According to a Response for Information Request (RIR) on the treatment of Tutsis, there were reports that Imbonerakure threatened Tutsis with death if they did not vote for Nkurunziza, and that Tutsis seen as being in opposition to President Nkurunziza were targeted.21 The same RIR indicated that people were not targeted based exclusively on ethnicity - rather they were also being targeted based on political affiliation.22\n[33] According to the HRW report, senior ruling party officials used inflammatory and apparently threatening language in public speeches and statements, and in a speech to local officials on October 29, Senate President R\u00e9v\u00e9rien Ndikuriyo repeatedly used the word \"gukora,\" which means \"to work\" in the Kirundi language, the same word was used to incite people to mass violence before and during the 1994 Rwandan genocide.23\n[34] Counsel also provided country documents, which support the principal claimant's allegations regarding the protest on May 13, 2015, the failed coup attempt the same day, and the treatment of those seen as opposing President Nkurunziza's third term.24\n[35] In light of the credible testimony of the principal claimant, the supporting documents provided, and the objective country conditions regarding the treatment of protestors and Tutsis in Burundi, the panel finds that the minor claimants would be at risk in Burundi, based on their ethnicity, and on the principal claimant's participation in the May 13, 2015 women's protest.\nState Protection\n[36] In this case, the agent of persecution is the state as the persecution faced by the minor claimants should they return to Burundi is at the hands of Burundi authorities who perceive their mother, the principal claimant, as being in opposition of the current government. Accordingly, the panel finds that there is no state protection available to the minor claimants.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[37] The panel has considered whether an IFA exists for the minor claimants in this case. Given that the Burundi authorities have control of and operate throughout the whole of Burundi, the panel finds that the minor claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution throughout the whole of Burundi. Accordingly, the panel finds that there is no viable IFA available to the minor claimants in this case.\nCONCLUSION\n[38] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel finds that there is not a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground in Guinea for the principal claimant, or that, on a balance of probabilities, she would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. The panel concludes that the principal claimant is not a Convention refugee or person in need of protection. Therefore, her claim is rejected.\n[39] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel finds that there is a serious possibility that the minor claimants would be persecuted should they return to Burundi. The panel finds that the minor claimants are Convention refugees and their claims are therefore accepted.\n(signed)\n\"Catherine Smith\"\nCatherine Smith\nMay 30, 2017\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act S.C.

Fraser\nConseil du (de la) ministre\n(by document only)\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] Ms. XXXX XXXX XXXX (\"the claimant\") makes a claim for refugee protection pursuant to s. 96 and s. 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant alleges that she is a citizen of Eritrea. She was born in Saudi Arabia and has resided in Saudi Arabia for most of her life, as a dependent of her father who is a temporary foreign worker. Despite possessing an Ethiopian passport, the claimant alleges that she is not Ethiopian and only obtained this passport through a bribe paid by her father. The claimant alleges that due to shifts in immigration policies in Saudi Arabia, she and her family members risk losing their status in Saudi Arabia and that they eventually risk being deported to Eritrea, which is their true country of nationality. The claimant fears that if she is deported to Eritrea, she would be forced to fulfill national service obligations for an indefinite period of time.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] I find that there is insufficient credible evidence to establish that the claimant is a citizen of Eritrea. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is a citizen of Ethiopia and that she is not a Convention refugee or person in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\n[4] The determinative issue in this claim is the claimant's nationality.\nProcedural Issues\n[5] It should be noted that the claimant is an unaccompanied minor. Her parents and minor brother all reside in Saudi Arabia. As such, the claimant's aunt, XXXX XXXX, was initially appointed as the claimant's Designated Representative.\n[6] However, on 09 March 2017, the claimant's counsel requested that Ms. XXXX designation be terminated, as she felt nervous about her responsibilities and her own ability to speak at the hearing. Counsel requested that the claimant's uncle, XXXX XXXX XXXX, be designated instead. Although Mr. XXXX resides in Regina, Saskatchewan, he agreed to act as the claimant's Designated Representative.\n[7] Given the late designation of her uncle as the Designated Representative, the panel questioned Mr. XXXX about his suitability at the outset of the proceedings. Mr. XXXX confirmed that he understood his responsibilities as Designated Representative. He confirmed that he had met with the claimant's counsel and understood the case that needed to be met. He confirmed that he had read the claimant's Basis of Claim form and considered what evidence she required for her case. He provided no reason to believe that he would be unable to fulfill his duties toward the claimant. To Mr. XXXX credit, despite the distance between Toronto and Regina, he traveled to Toronto on two different occasions in order to participate in the claimant's hearings.\n[8] The panel was especially concerned about the obstacles that the claimant could face as an unaccompanied minor and gave special consideration to the Chairperson's Guidelines on child refugee claimants and gender (Chairperson's Guidelines 3 and 4). Given some of the evidentiary challenges in this claim, the panel exercised its discretion on multiple occasions to admit late evidence.\n[9] Although the claimant was only 16 years old at the time of her first hearing, she presented as a mature, confident and capable young woman. Neither the claimant's counsel nor her Designated Representative objected to her ability to testify. The claimant gave testimony on a variety of issues and her testimony has been given the appropriate weight, in consideration of her age, experience, gender and cultural background. In particular, given her young age, I have not drawn any negative inferences in relation to the inconsistent evidence provided in the claimant's Generic Application Form (IMM 0008) and Schedule A (IMM 5669) form in relation to her citizenship as an Ethiopian and her mother's place of birth.\nMinister's Intervention\n[10] The Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (\"the Minister\") has intervened in this claim.1 The Minister has provided evidence that the claimant's parents submitted an application for Canadian permanent residence as overseas refugees. It would appear that the claimant's parents were undergoing a refugee sponsorship process. The information provided in that application and in the claimant's mother's interview with Canadian immigration authorities contradicts some of the information provided in the claimant's evidence.\n[11] The Minister submits that the discrepancies undermine the credibility of the claimant's allegations, including her allegation of being an Eritrean citizen. The Minister asks that the panel find that the claimant is not a Convention refugee or person in need of protection.\nNational Identity\n[12] The claimant presented a very difficult case. She claims that she is a citizen of Eritrea only but that she has never resided in Eritrea, nor has she ever possessed an Eritrean passport or any Eritrean identity documents. Rather, she was born in Saudi Arabia and lived her entire life as if she were a citizen of Ethiopia. She, along with her parents and brother, all possessed Ethiopian passports and presented themselves as Ethiopian citizens to the Saudi government. The claimant alleges that in fact her parents obtained their Ethiopian passports and renewed their passports through corruption and bribery in order to avoid being deported to Eritrea in the event that they lost their status in Saudi Arabia.\n[13] Although I accept that the claimant's family members are of Eritrean origin, I find that the claimant and her parents are citizens of Ethiopia, on a balance of probabilities. The claimant's father arrived in Saudi Arabia in 1990, prior to the referendum on Eritrean independence.2 The claimant's mother arrived in Saudi Arabia in 1998, according to the evidence in her overseas refugee application.3 I find that it is more likely than not that both of the claimant's parents arrived in Saudi Arabia as Ethiopian citizens and that they chose not to forfeit their Ethiopian citizenship. I find that it is more probable than not that they have therefore maintained their Ethiopian nationality throughout their many years in Saudi Arabia.\nNationality Laws and Policies in Ethiopia and Eritrea\n[14] The claimant's counsel submits that the claimant cannot be both a citizen of Ethiopia and Eritrea. I agree with this submission.\n[15] According to Eritrean nationality law, any person born to a father or mother of Eritrean origin in Eritrea or abroad is an Eritrean national by birth.4 However, according to Ethiopian nationality law, which was amended in 2003, any Ethiopian who voluntarily acquires another nationality shall be deemed to have voluntarily renounced their Ethiopian nationality.5 As dual nationality is not permitted, the claimant cannot be a national of both Ethiopia and Eritrea.\n[16] In the panel's view, it is important to understand the context of the developments affecting Ethiopian nationality policies.\n[17] In 1993, a referendum was held on the question of Eritrean independence, as Eritrea was at that time a province of Ethiopia. As described in a Human Rights Watch article submitted by counsel, there was no provision in Ethiopian law at that time that would have removed Ethiopian citizenship to those who voted in the referendum, as having done so would have marred the referendum by threatening to penalize voters who believed in an independent Eritrea.6\n[18] Even after the independence of Eritrea, the Ethiopian government did not impose any requirements for Ethiopian citizens of Eritrean origin to reaffirm their Ethiopian nationality.7 Although the nationality law at the time stated that an Ethiopian citizen who acquired another nationality in a sovereign state would lose their Ethiopian citizenship, the law allowed individuals to re-acquire the benefit of their Ethiopian nationality when they returned to reside in the country and apply for re-admission.8 In the years following Eritrean independence, the nationality of Ethiopians of Eritrean origin was increasingly challenged, such that the Ethiopian and Eritrean governments agreed in 1996 to settle the issue by asking Eritreans to choose their nationality and abide by their choice. However, this measure was postponed due to an unrelated trade issue.9 There remained many Ethiopians of Eritrean citizenship who had voted in favour of Eritrean independence but who nonetheless retained their Ethiopian citizenship and resided in Ethiopia.\n[19] Shortly after the outbreak of war in 1998 between Ethiopia and Eritrea, the Ethiopian government conducted mass expulsions and stripped the citizenship of many Ethiopian citizens of Eritrean origin who were residing in Ethiopia. It is estimated that approximately 75,000 Ethiopians of Eritrean origin were expelled.10 As Human Rights Watch describes, during the war period, the Ethiopian authorities' central argument on the nationality issue was the fact that thousands of Ethiopians of Eritrean origin had registered for and voted in the referendum on Eritrea's independence and that this was evidence that they had assumed Eritrean citizenship. By 2001, the deportation of Ethiopians of Eritrean origin had ceased.11\n[20] As there continued to be much confusion over the status of many Ethiopians of Eritrean origin who had continued to reside in Ethiopia following the independence of Eritrea, in 2004 the Ethiopian government introduced a directive to determine the residence status of Eritreans residing in Ethiopia. The scope of this directive is important, as it creates at least three different categories of individuals and affects the rights afforded to each. First, the directive did not apply to bearers of Eritrean passports or of any other document proving Eritrean citizenship, or those persons who had served in the Eritrean government. According to a news report, this category included also those individuals who had voted in favour of Eritrean independence. Those individuals were already considered to be Eritrean citizens. Secondly, the directive stated that those who did not choose Eritrean citizenship would be considered Ethiopian citizens. In other words, those who had not opted for Eritrean nationality and not obtained Eritrean citizenship documents, such as passports or national Identity cards, were deemed to be Ethiopian citizens. For a third set of individuals, namely ethnic Eritreans born in Ethiopia or Eritrea who were resident in Ethiopia prior to Eritrean independence and continuously until 2004 - procedures were established for them to apply to reacquire their Ethiopian nationality.12 That third category of individuals was required to register under the 2004 directive.\n[21] The claimant's counsel submits that since the claimant's parents possess Eritrean national identity cards and could not have availed themselves of the 2004 directive, the claimant's parents and the claimant herself are citizens of Eritrea. The claimant's counsel also relies on testimony and supporting identity evidence of various extended family members who are Eritrean citizens.\n[22] The difficulty, however, is that the evidence around the identity of the claimant's parents was fraught with inconsistencies and irregularities, which were not adequately explained by the claimant even though she was given ample opportunity to provide evidence on these matters. Ultimately, I am unable to accept, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant's parents are in possession of genuine Eritrean national identity cards. This distinguishes the facts of this case from the facts set out in the other Refugee Protection Division decisions upon which counsel relies, as well as the expert opinions provided by Dr. John Campbell in Exhibit 7.\n[23] Although this is a difficult matter to decide, the panel is ultimately faced with the fact that the claimant and her parents hold Ethiopian passports that would otherwise appear to be genuine; that they presented themselves as Ethiopian citizens for many years in Saudi Arabia; and returned to Ethiopia using those passports multiple times. When this is weighed against evidence about the identity of the claimant's parents that suffers from unexplained discrepancies, I am unable to find that the evidence of the claimant's Eritrean nationality is such that it can be determined on a balance of probabilities that the claimant's Ethiopian passport is fraudulent and that she is a citizen of Eritrea only.\n[24] I find that it is more probable than not that the claimant and her parents fall into the second category of individuals set out above, namely, of ethnic Eritreans who never forfeited their Ethiopian nationality, who did not choose to avail themselves of Eritrean citizenship. Such individuals would have been able to maintain their citizenship as Ethiopian nationals and I find that this would be supported by the claimant and her parents' ability to obtain Ethiopian passports and travel to Ethiopia without difficulty on multiple occasions.\nMother's Eritrean National Identity Card and Identity\n[25] Although the claimant provided original copies of her parents' Eritrean national identity cards, there were issues around their identities and particularly so with respect to the claimant's mother's identity that cause me to place little weight on the parents' Eritrean national identity cards.\n[26] I will first address the claimant's mother's Eritrean national identity card. The mother's card was allegedly issued in Asmara in 2011 and indicates that the claimant's mother was born on XXXX XXXX 1985.13\n[27] The first issue is with respect to the date of birth on the card. The difficulty is that the claimant's mother would appear to have multiple different dates of birth. In contrast with the Eritrean national identity card, the mother's Ethiopian passport contains a date of birth of XXXX XXXX 1972.14 A third date of birth is set out in the claimant's birth certificate, which indicates that her mother was born in 1975.15\n[28] The claimant was questioned about her mother's date of birth. She at first testified that she believed that her mother was born in 1985. However, the claimant very quickly contradicted herself, stating that the date of birth in her mother's Eritrean national identity card was false and that she learned through conversations with her mother that her mother had given a younger age to the Eritrean authorities in order to avoid paying taxes and fees. The claimant testified that in fact her mother's true date of birth is the one contained in her Ethiopian passport, which would be in 1972.\n[29] The explanation provided by the claimant's mother in her interview with a Canadian Immigration Officer in Riyadh contradicts the above account. The claimant's mother stated that in fact her true date of birth is XXXX XXXX 1985 and that she received a passport with an older date of birth in order to gain entry into Saudi Arabia.16 The claimant did not have knowledge of this interview and eventually denied having any knowledge of her own mother's date of birth.\n[30] The second issue with respect to the card relates to how it was obtained. Neither the claimant nor her Designated Representative had any knowledge as to how her mother obtained the Eritrean national identity card in 2011, what she did to obtain it, or why she applied for it. The claimant's Designated Representative speculated that the claimant's mother would not have had to go to Asmara in order to obtain the card, as the card would likely have been issued in Eritrea and sent to the Eritrean embassy or consulate in Saudi Arabia where it was given to the claimant's mother.\n[31] The claimant's inability to explain the provenance of this card is of great concern. Item 3.6 of Exhibit 4 indicates that indeed one can apply for an Eritrean national identity card through an Eritrean embassy or consulate abroad, however the applicant must pay fees and other taxes. There is no indication or evidence that the claimant's mother was registered as an Eritrean living abroad, or that she had paid the two-percent tax required of Eritreans residing abroad.17 It remains unclear as to how the claimant's mother obtained the card in 2011.\n[32] Although I recognize that the claimant is an unaccompanied minor, it is her Designated Representative's duty to assist her in obtaining evidence. The claimant was also represented by highly competent counsel. Even more than a month after the initial sitting of this claim, the claimant had failed to provide any evidence from her mother about how she had come to obtain her Eritrean national identity card. The issue remains that the claimant's mother's national identity card suffers from unexplained discrepancies. I find that the unexplained discrepancies with the mother's Eritrean national identity card significantly undermine the weight that can placed upon it.\nFather's Eritrean National Identity Card and Identity\n[33] The claimant also provided the original copy of her father's Eritrean national identity card.18 However, there were again issues with respect to her father's identity and the content of his national Identity card.\n[34] It is problematic that at least three dates of birth appear for the claimant's father across the identity evidence submitted for him. The father's Eritrean Identity card contains a date of birth of XXXX XXXX 1971.19 By contrast, his Ethiopian passport indicates that he was born on XXXX XXXX 1960.20 His Saudi resident card gives a date of birth of XXXX XXXX 1964.21 Finally, the claimant's birth certificate indicates that her father was born in 1964.22 When first asked about her father's date of birth, the claimant believed that it was on XXXX XXXX 1971.\n[35] The claimant believed that the date of birth in her father's passport was incorrect but did not know why an incorrect date of birth was used. She did not know why there were different dates of birth across each of the documents noted above. The claimant's Designated Representative was equally unable to explain these inconsistent dates of birth but speculated that perhaps the immigration official to who provided the Ethiopian passport to the claimant's father chose whatever date they preferred. There was no explanation as to how the claimant's father managed to update his Saudi residence permit in view of the fact that his Ethiopian passport and Saudi resident permit had different dates of birth.\n[36] Again, the claimant might have benefited from evidence from her father to explain these discrepancies. However, the letter provided from the claimant's father does not address this issue and no further evidence on this issue was submitted. In view of the discrepancies with regard to the claimant's father's identity and date of birth, I only give little weight to the Eritrean national Identity card that appears in the father's name.\nClaimant's ability to obtain Ethiopian passport and successful travel to Ethiopia\n[37] Generally-speaking, an original passport is strong evidence of an individual's nationality. In this instance, the claimant traveled to Canada on a valid Ethiopian passport, issued in her name with apparently the correct date of birth and biographical information.\n[38] The evidence would suggest that the claimant held at least two Ethiopian passports, one which was issued in or around March 2011 and the other which was issued in December 2015.23 The evidence, including the claimant's testimony, indicates that the claimant traveled to Ethiopia using these Ethiopian passports on at least three occasions: in 2012, 2015 and 2016. The claimant testified that in 2012, she traveled to Ethiopia with her mother in order to attend her aunt's wedding. In September 2015, according to her Basis of Claim form, the claimant along with her mother and brother, traveled to Ethiopia in order to relocate and try to live there in case they would be deported there later on. The claimant returned to Saudi Arabia from Ethiopia on XXXX December 2015 to XXXX January 2016 according to stamps in her passport. She then returned to Ethiopia in January 2016 and completed an entire school year in Ethiopia before returning to Saudi Arabia in September 2016. Moreover, as the claimant testified, her mother was not present in Ethiopia for the full time that she lived there but had to make additional trips back to Saudi Arabia at times.\n[39] Despite this information, the claimant insists that her own Ethiopian passport as well as the Ethiopian passports of her parents are documents obtained through fraud and that none of them are actually Ethiopian citizens.24 There were no reports from the claimant regarding any difficulties for herself or any of her family members in entering Ethiopia using their allegedly fraudulent passports.\n[40] Although the claimant's expert reports from Dr. John Campbell indicate that Ethiopian consulates in the Gulf region experienced serious internal disputes and quite possibly corruption in the 1990's and that it was quite possible that a bribe could be paid to acquire a passport, the reports also speak to the restrictions for the issuance of passports in more recent years. Dr. John Campbell indicates that Ethiopian immigration officials exercised their discretion in 2004 to refuse to renew some Ethiopian passports for individuals born in Asmara and that he had no reason to believe that the practice had changed.25 Dr. Campbell also states that after 2006, Ethiopian consulates and embassies required individuals to provide evidence of entitlement based on a certified birth certificate issued in Ethiopia by a kebele or the Ministry of Health.26\n[41] In the panel's view, if the claimant wishes to undermine the validity of the passports issued to her and her parents, the onus rests with her to adduce evidence to explain this matter, since the passports are documents upon which the panel would otherwise place great weight in establishing nationality. Although her Basis of Claim form states that her father obtained the Ethiopian passports through bribery, the letter submitted by the claimant's father fails to address this important issue.27 The panel has no information or evidence about what specific arrangements the claimant's father made in order to have these Ethiopian passports issued throughout the years; what was paid in order to obtain these passports; or what documents or process had to be followed for him to have the passports issued.\n[42] Moreover, it is notable that the claimant's most recent passport was issued on XXXX December 2015, when she was residing in Ethiopia without her father. The claimant used the passport to travel to Saudi Arabia from Ethiopia just three days after the passport was issued. However, the claimant testified that while she was living in Ethiopia, her father had never visited her. It remained most unclear as to how the claimant then managed to obtain an Ethiopian passport while she was residing in Ethiopia, whereas her father, who allegedly made the arrangements and paid the bribes for the family's fraudulent passports, was apparently residing in Saudi Arabia without her.\n[43] Understandably, the claimant had little knowledge about these matters. The Designated Representative also had little information about this matter. However, even after this issue was clearly raised at the first sitting of this claim, the claimant and her Designated Representative inexplicably failed to provide any further evidence on this issue. They did not provide any further letters from the claimant's father, nor was the father called as a witness by teleconference. In short, the claimant has had ample time to provide further evidence on this issue but for reasons that remain unclear, neither she nor her Designated Representative have provided further evidence for the panel to determine with any confidence that her Ethiopian passport was improperly-obtained.\n[44] In the absence of clear evidence from the claimant's father about how the family's Ethiopian passports were obtained over the years, I must assign very strong weight to the claimant's Ethiopian passport as evidence that she is a national of Ethiopia.\nOther Supporting Evidence\n[45] To her credit, the claimant provided numerous documents regarding the Eritrean origin and nationality of her extended family members.\n[46] These included:\n1) Documents from the claimant's paternal grandfather, including an Ethiopian Alien Passport, showing that he is an Eritrean national28, his Eritrean national Identity card29 and membership cards for the Eritrean Liberation Front and the Eritrean Nahda Party30.\n2) An Eritrean national Identity card belonging to the claimant's paternal grandmother.31\n3) An Eritrean national Identity card belonging to the claimant's maternal grandfather.32\n4) An Eritrean national Identity card for the claimant's paternal aunt, XXXX XXXX XXXX.33\n5) An Eritrean national Identity card and Eritrean Nahda Party membership card belonging to the claimant's paternal aunt, XXXX XXXX.34\n6) Eritrean passports for the claimant's maternal aunt, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and the claimant's maternal uncle, XXXX XXXX XXXX.35\n7) Eritrean passport belonging to the claimant's first cousin, XXXX XXXX XXXX and an Eritrean birth certificate belonging to another first cousin, XXXX XXXX XXXX.36\n[47] Although there were some discrepancies with respect to her paternal grandfather's identity documents, I agree that the above-noted documents are highly probative evidence that the claimant's extended family members are Eritrean or of Eritrean origin.\n[48] However, the above-noted documents are not determinative of the question of the claimant's own nationality. The claimant's father arrived in Saudi Arabia from Ethiopia in 1990, according to the father's letter.37 This was prior to the referendum on Eritrean independence. It is entirely possible for some of the claimant's extended family members to hold Eritrean citizenship while the claimant's parents do not. Indeed, the claimant had several maternal family members residing in Ethiopia, according to her mother's statements in her interview in Riyadh.38 It is entirely possible that the claimant's parents simply chose not to forfeit their Ethiopian citizenship and that they never opted for Eritrean citizenship throughout their many years in Saudi Arabia.\n[49] The panel is ultimately faced with the claimant's otherwise valid and genuine Ethiopian passport and the fact that she and her parents possessed multiple previous Ethiopian passports and presented themselves as Ethiopian citizens throughout many years in Saudi Arabia. On the other hand, I have been presented with some evidence of Eritrean nationality on the part of the claimant's parents and her extended family. The evidence about the identity of the claimant's parents suffers from numerous discrepancies and even though these discrepancies were brought to the claimant's attention and even though explanations could conceivably have been elicited from her parents, they remain unresolved to this day. The panel also has insufficient information about how the claimant's father managed to obtain multiple Ethiopian passports for each of his family members over the years.\n[50] Therefore, I place only little weight on the parents' Eritrean national Identity cards and I have ultimately placed far greater weight on the claimant's Ethiopian passport as evidence of her nationality. I find that it is more likely than not that the claimant and her parents have been able to successfully obtain Ethiopian passports over many years because Ethiopian immigration authorities recognize them as citizens of Ethiopia.\n[51] In my view, based on the evidence before me, neither the claimant nor her parents lost their Ethiopian nationality as a result of changes to the Ethiopian nationality law. Rather, it is more likely than not that they never availed themselves of Eritrean nationality in the first place and thus never lost their Ethiopian citizenship by acquiring another nationality. Although the claimant's father states in his letter that he voted in the referendum on Eritrean independence and that he is an Eritrean citizen, I find that when I weigh the entirety of the evidence, I am unable to accept these facts on a balance of probabilities.\n[52] The use of fraudulent Eritrean national identification cards is not an implausible scenario. I note that item 3.3 of Exhibit 4 indicates through multiple different sources that fraudulent Eritrean identity documents are prevalent.39 According to the United States Department of State's Country Reciprocity Schedule, Eritrean national Identity cards are \"easily alterable, making proof of Eritrean citizenship difficult to determine\". A researcher with Human Rights Watch also gave the opinion that there is an underground market for fraudulent Eritrean Identity cards in refugee communities abroad and that such markets were likely to exist in other countries, including Ethiopia. A professor of African studies and political science at Pennsylvania State University also stated that fake and fraudulent Eritrean identity documents are prevalent outside Eritrea.40\n[53] Based on the evidence before me, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is a citizen of Ethiopia and that the claimant's Ethiopian passport carries much greater weight than her parents' Eritrean national Identity cards.\nRefugee Claim based on Persecution in Ethiopia\n[54] As mentioned above, I do accept that the claimant's family members are of Eritrean origin. This is established by numerous identity documents provided in regard to family members on both the claimant's father's and mother's sides.41 Although there were issues with some of these documents, when they are weighed in their entirety, I find that I am able to accept on a balance of probabilities that the claimant's family is of Eritrean origin.\n[55] The question then remains as to whether the claimant's profile as an individual of Eritrean origin would be sufficient to ground a successful claim for refugee protection.\n[56] The claimant's Designated Representative gave testimony about the treatment of Eritreans by the Ethiopian government. He described the mass expulsions in 1998 and how members of his own family were deported to Eritrea during that period. In regard to the current situation, the Designated Representative gave the opinion that it is not safe for any Eritreans to live in Ethiopia and that recently people were told to leave the country. Although the Designated Representative has not lived in Ethiopia since 1988, he gave the opinion that if a person is Eritrean, their business would be set on fire and that they would be unable to live in Ethiopia.\n[57] The claimant herself gave some testimony about her family's treatment as Eritreans while they were living in Ethiopia from 2015 to 2016. She described that in school, she was teased because she could not speak their language and because she is not Ethiopian. The claimant's Basis of Claim form states that her neighbours knew that they were Eritrean and that they made them feel unsafe. She also describes that she was not allowed to go to public school and had to be sent to private school instead. The claimant also states that her mother was unable to obtain an identity card that was required to obtain access to services in Ethiopia. In her testimony, she described that her mother was unable to obtain a driver's license and other documents to access social services such as healthcare. The claimant gave the opinion that the government keeps a list of those who voted in the referendum and refuses services to those who voted.\nAbility to Access Services as an Ethiopian of Eritrean Origin\n[58] In my view, there is insufficient evidence to establish that the claimant would be unable to access public services due to her Eritrean origin. Despite the fact that it was the claimant's mother who personally underwent the process of applying for a kebele card and presumably also register the claimant and her brother in school, the claimant's mother did not provide any evidence about her various attempts. The panel had no direct information from the claimant's mother as to what happened in Ethiopia, what attempts she made to obtain a kebele card and access public services and what responses she received from public officials about these matters. It is possible that she was unable to access public services for reasons that are unrelated to the claimant's ethnic origin. When questioned about this matter, the Designated Representative stated that he did not know that the mother should be a witness. Neither the claimant, her Designated Representative, nor her counsel made any request to have the mother called as a witness by teleconference or for additional time to submit evidence in this regard. The panel was therefore unable to examine any reliable evidence to determine whether the refusal of Ethiopian identity documents was based on the family's Eritrean origin.\n[59] Although the claimant's counsel urged that the expert reports from Dr. Campbell addressed the very issue of the family's ability to access social services as ethnic Eritreans, having reviewed both of Dr. Campbell's reports, I am unable to find that this is directly addressed. Although Dr. Campbell refers to a United Kingdom tribunal decision on this issue, the facts in that decision related to ethnic Eritreans who had left Ethiopia during or in the immediate aftermath of the border war between Ethiopia and Eritrea and had subsequently lost their Ethiopian nationality. Those individuals would have difficulty re-acquiring their Ethiopian nationality, due to the 2003 proclamation on nationality in Ethiopia.42 However, in the present case, I have found that the claimant's parents never forfeited their Ethiopian nationality.\n[60] Dr. Campbell also refers in his report to the possibility of obtaining an Eritrean Origin Identity card, however this is of little importance. The key question is not whether the claimant's family could obtain Eritrean Origin Identity cards but rather kebele cards, as it is the kebele card that is used by Ethiopians to access services within their districts. As item 3.5 of Exhibit 14 indicates, the Ethiopian Origin Identity card is merely a document issued to foreign nationals of Ethiopian origin who have acquired foreign nationality. That card entitles the holder to various rights and privileges of Ethiopian nationals by lifting legal restrictions imposed on them when they have lost their Ethiopian nationality.43\n[61] The claimant's counsel also points to items 1.8, 3.5 and 3.6 in support of his submission that the claimant's Eritrean origin would make it impossible for her to obtain a kebele card and access the rights of a citizen in Ethiopia. The claimant's counsel relies on an excerpt from the Open Society Foundations report that is cited in item 1.8 at section 4.1.4. However, that excerpt merely refers to the situation of those of Eritrean descent who were not expelled and remained in Ethiopia but forfeited their Ethiopian nationality.44 There is no indication that this is relevant to the claimant's situation, whose parents have retained their Ethiopian citizenship. Items 3.5 and 3.6 do not address the situation of individuals of Eritrean origin who never forfeited or lost their Ethiopian nationality. Moreover, as alluded to further below, there is little evidence that Ethiopian citizens of Eritrean origin experience systematic discrimination in their ability to access public services. I find that it is more probable than not that such a situation, if it currently existed, would be documented in the country conditions evidence.\n[62] To summarize, I do not have sufficient evidence that an Ethiopian citizen of Eritrean origin would have difficulty accessing public services in Ethiopia. Although the claimant alleges that her mother had difficulty in this respect, given that the claimant is a minor and has little personal or direct knowledge about her mother's various attempts, I do not have a reliable basis upon which to find that the claimant would have difficulty accessing social services in Ethiopia based on her ethnic origin.\nDiscrimination against ethnic Eritreans in Ethiopia\n[63] After a review of the country conditions evidence, the panel is also unable to find that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution in Ethiopia based on her profile as an individual with Eritrean family origins.\n[64] Although the claimant and her Designated Representative described a dire situation for Ethiopians of Eritrean origin, the country conditions evidence does not support their account. The most serious human rights issues as they relate to Eritreans in Ethiopia stem from the period of border conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia from 1998 to 2000, when the Ethiopian government conducted mass expulsions of Ethiopians of Eritrean origin. Approximately 75,000 Ethiopians of Eritrean origin were deported and had their nationality stripped during that period.45 However, as mentioned further above, the Ethiopian government eventually introduced laws in 2003 and 2004 that regularized the status of many Ethiopians of Eritrean origin who remained in Ethiopia.46 Although Dr. John Campbell's reports in Exhibit 7 appear to dispute whether all Ethiopians of Eritrean origin were able to re-acquire their citizenship, according to many sources, deportations ceased within a few years of the conflict and few human rights issues remain with respect to Eritreans of Ethiopian origin.47 According to the UNHCR, as of January 2006, deportations from Ethiopia of persons of Eritrean origin had not happened since June 2001.48 Moreover, item 1.8 indicates that since 2003 and 2004, harassment by state authorities against individuals of Eritrean origin diminished.49\n[65] There is only vague mention in the documentary evidence about the mistreatment of Ethiopians of Eritrean origin in Ethiopia. Item 1.4 indicates that Eritreans with Ethiopian citizenship said that they felt compelled to conceal their background even among close friends; that they rarely congregated as a community; and that they were not politically engaged. The reasons for this sort of self-censorship were unclear. Some individuals spoke of employment discrimination, however details about such incidents was lacking.50 A 2009 article cited in item 1.8 also indicated that many individuals still concealed their Eritrea background for fear of discrimination and harassment.51 A report from the Dutch Council for Refugees similarly noted that there were some reports that Ethiopians of Eritrean origin tried to hide their origins, however there were no reports of any violence from state authorities, nor were there any reports about the treatment of Ethiopians of Eritrean origin by non-state actors.52 Though it notes that tensions remain high between Eritrea and Ethiopia, the U.K. Home Office concluded that there is no indication of any real risk for persons of Eritrean descent of deportation from Ethiopia to Eritrea upon return.\n[66] It is regrettable that some individuals of Eritrean origin feel the need to conceal their origins and it is possible that the claimant may face some limited degree of discrimination in Ethiopia based on her Eritrean family origins. However, I am unable to find based on the evidence before me that the treatment she might experience would amount to persecution. I am therefore unable to find that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution in Ethiopia. As she does not hold a well-founded fear of persecution in Ethiopia on any Convention ground, the claimant is not a Convention refugee.\nPerson in Need of Protection\n[67] The above analysis is also dispositive of the claimant's claim as a person in need of protection.\nCONCLUSION\n[68] For reasons provided above, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is not a citizen of Eritrea. I find instead that it is more probable than not that the claimant is a citizen of Ethiopia.\n[69] Having assessed the claimant's fears of return to Ethiopia, I find that she is not a Convention refugee, nor is she a person in need of protection. Therefore, this claim is rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Matthew Oh\"\nMatthew Oh\n\"June 8, 2017\"\nDate\n1 Exhibits 9 and 10.\n2 Exhibit 12, p. 5.\n3 Exhibit 10.\n4 Exhibit 4, item 3.1.\n5 Exhibit 14, item 3.7; and\nExhibit 7, pp. 4 and 5.\n6 Exhibit 7, p. 63.\n7 Ibid., p. 62.\n8 Ibid., p. 70.\n9 Exhibit 7, p. 71.\n10 Ibid., p. 73.\n11 Exhibit 14, item 1.4.\n12 Exhibit 7, pp. 5, 6, 93 and 94; and\nExhibit 14, item 1.8.\n13 Exhibit 8, pp. 11 to 13.\n14 Exhibit 12, p. 9.\n15 Ibid., pp. 3 and 4.\n16 Exhibit 10, p. 10.\n17 Exhibit 4, item 3.6.\n18 Exhibit 8, pp. 8 to 10.\n19 Ibid.\n20 Exhibit 12, p. 8.\n21 Exhibit 8, pp. 4 and 5\n22 Exhibit 13, pp. 3 and 4.\n23 Exhibits 1, 9 and 10.\n24 Exhibit 1; and\nExhibit 12, pp. 8 and 9.\n25 Exhibit 7, p. 4.\n26 Ibid.\n27 Exhibit 12, p. 5.\n28 Exhibit 8, pp. 19 to 22.\n29 Ibid., pp. 17 and 18.\n30 Exhibit 12, pp. 1 to 4.\n31 Ibid., p. 10.\n32 Exhibit 8, pp. 14 and 15.\n33 Exhibit 12, pp. 12 and 13.\n34 Exhibit 15, pp. 1 to 4.\n35 Exhibit 15, pp. 6 and 7.\n36 Ibid., pp. 8 and 9.\n37 Exhibit 12, p. 5.\n38 Exhibit 10.\n39 Exhibit 4, item 3.3.\n40 Ibid.\n41 Exhibit 8, pp. 14 to 19;\nExhibit 12, pp. 1 to 13;\nExhibit 13; and\nExhibit 15, pp. 1 to 9.\n42 Exhibit 7, pp. 13 and 14.\n43 Exhibit 14, item 3.5.\n44 Ibid., item 1.8.\n45 Exhibit 14, item 1.8.\n46 Ibid.\n47 Exhibit 14, items 1.4, 1.8 and 2.10.\n48 Exhibit 14, item 1.4.\n49 Exhibit 4, item 1.8.\n50 Ibid., item 1.4.\n51 Ibid., item 1.8.\n52 Exhibit 14, item 2.10.\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRPD.29.1 (August 31, 2012)\nRPD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SPR: TB7-01364\n",

The claimants were in their home along with one of the principal claimant's brothers, XXXX, when they let a young man into the house who was bloody and seeking help. Shortly after the young man was admitted into their home, Mara 18 members also came to her door and demanded entry. It is alleged that the young man must have been a rival gang member and the Mara 18 members were furious that the principal claimant and her brother were hiding the boy. The principal claimant and XXXX were hit several times and the principal claimant was sexually assaulted (the \"Attack\"). They were threatened with death, but ultimately told to leave and to never let the Mara's see them again. This incident motivated the claimants to flee El Salvador and they started their journey on XXXX XXXX, 2016, with the permission of the principal claimant's ex-common-law partner and father to the minor claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX (\"XXXX\"). However, since then, it is alleged that XXXX has become a member of the Mara 18 and told the principal claimant that he would kill her in order to move up the ranks of the Maras. The claimants fear returning to El Salvador due both to the gangs and XXXX threats.\n[7] The claimants were caught at the border between the United States and Mexico on XXXX XXXX, 2016. The claimants claimed asylum during their detention and were released on or about XXXX XXXX, 2016. The claimant had an ankle monitoring bracelet affixed which was removed on or about XXXX XXXX, 2016. The claimants then left the United States and entered Canada on or about XXXX XXXX, 2016 at the Fort Erie border crossing and made claims as refugees at that time.\nANALYSIS\n[8] The determinative issue in this case is credibility.\nNexus\n[9] The claimants testified that they fear gang violence in El Salvador. As such, the panel finds that the claimants are victims of crime or of a personal vendetta. The Federal Court has held that victims of crime, corruption or vendettas generally fail to establish a link between their fear of persecution and one of the Convention grounds in the definition of Convention refugee.7\n[10] However, the principal claimant has also alleged gender based violence from both the Mara 18 and XXXX. As such and pursuant to the Guidelines, the panel will consider the claimants' claims under both s.96 and s.97(1) of the IRPA.\nCredibility\n[11] Evidence given under oath or affirmation is presumed to be true, unless there is valid reason to find otherwise.8\n[12] I find that the presumption of truth of the principal claimant's affirmed evidence is rebutted by the following material credibility concerns which the principal claimant did not satisfactorily resolve. I find that the credibility concerns demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that: her account of having been sexually assaulted by a member of the Mara's is not true and further, that XXXX does not pose a threat to the claimants.\nInconsistencies regarding the Mara 18 and XXXX\n[13] The panel finds that the inconsistencies between the evidence provided in the principal claimant's XXXX XXXX, 2016 Credible Fear Interview9 in the United States and the evidence provided in her BOC, personal disclosure and testimony, materially undermine the credibility of the claimants and the credibility of their allegations.\n[14] The principal claimant alleged in her BOC and testimony that she started a common law relationship with XXXX in XXXX 2007 and that he started to become violent towards her in XXXX 2009 after he lost his job. She further alleged that he beat her and sexually abused her whenever he felt like it. However, the panel notes that in the Credible Fear Interview, the principal claimant was asked about XXXX and the length of their relationship, to which the principal claimant indicated that they lived together from \"...around 2009....\"10 The panel notes that this answer is inconsistent with the principal claimant testimony and BOC which alleges that they started living together in 2007. When asked to explain the discrepancy, she testified that she had been in a cold room they called the \"freezer\" for the first four days after the claimants were first detained on XXXX XXXX, 2016 and that because of this, she sometimes didn't know what was being asked of her. The panel finds that this explanation does not adequately explain the discrepancy because it was the claimants evidence that she was transferred from the first facility to a shelter after four days of detention. The panel finds that this means that when the Credible Fear Interview took place on XXXX XXXX, 2016 she had not been in the cold room for between 1-2 days. The panel therefore finds on a balance of probabilities that the principal claimant's stay in the cold room did not impact her sworn evidence during the XXXX XXXX, 2016 credible fear interview. As such, the panel finds that this discrepancy undermines the credibility of the principal claimant's allegations pertaining to her relationship with XXXX.\n[15] The claimant alleged that in XXXX 2013, after XXXX became violent and pushed her down the stairs with the minor claimant in her arms, she testified that she had enough and she moved out along with the minor claimant to live on her own. The panel expressly asked the principal claimant if there was any other reason why she left XXXX, to which she responded that his violence was the main reason, along with him becoming involved with gang members. This information was also contained in the claimant's Family Application filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on or about XXXX XXXX, 2017.11 The panel notes that in the credible fear interview, the principal claimant was asked about XXXX and she advised that their relationship ended in XXXX 2012, when they separated.12 The panel notes that this answer is inconsistent with the principal claimant testimony and BOC which alleges that they started living together in 2007 and separated in XXXX 2013. When this discrepancy was put to the principal claimant she testified that she does not know how that date got there and that maybe because of the pressure she was under, she answered without thinking. The panel does not accept this explanation as the principal claimant was facing potential deportation. The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the principle claimant would have reasonably known that her answers in the credible fear interview were very important and she would not have '...answered without thinking'. As such, the panel finds that this discrepancy undermines the claimant's allegations pertaining to her relationship with XXXX.\n[16] Additionally, when asked in the Credible Fear Interview why they separated, the principal claimant responded that \"[H]e had another woman and that's why we separated.\" The panel notes that the claimant testified that the only reasons she separated from XXXX was because of his violence and that he was associating with gangs. When these inconsistencies were put to the principal claimant she confirmed that XXXX did have another woman, but explained that she wasn't given time to expand on her answer in that interview (and presumably mention XXXX violence). The panel pointed out that during the interview with the US agent, she was able to expand on other questions. For example, when Officer XXXX asked for the name of the minor claimant's father, the principal claimant provided his full name, but then went on to expand upon the answer and provided the additional information regarding the length of the relationship as noted above. The panel asked why she could expand on the previous question but not on the question about why she left XXXX. The principal claimant then explained that it was difficult to not speak face to face with someone as she was behind a screen with a telephone. The panel finds that her explanation does not adequately explain the inconsistencies between the principal claimants BOC\/testimony and her credible fear interview because her explanation does not address how she was able to expand, unprompted, on one answer, but not another, particularly where further allegations of violence had the potential to assist her asylum claim. Likewise, the panel does not accept the explanation that not being face to face with someone impacted her answers as she was able to provide detailed and extensive answers elsewhere in her credible fear interview. As a result, the panel finds that this discrepancy undermines the claimant's allegations that XXXX was a violent person and that he was associating with gangs.\n[17] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant did not mention XXXX violence in the Credible Fear Interview as a reason for their split because the principal claimant has fabricated the domestic violence allegations against XXXX. The panel therefore finds that the late XXXX early XXXX 2013 incident with XXXX did not occur as alleged because the principal claimant stated during her credible fear interview that she had split up with XXXX in XXXX 2012, ten months prior to the events alleged in her BOC, testimony and personal disclosure. As a result, the panel finds that the above noted inconsistencies undermine the principal claimant's credibility and the credibility of the claimants' allegations in general, given that the panel has found that the principal claimant fabricated events in order to advance her Canadian refugee claim.\n[18] In claimants' counsel's submissions, she raised the issue that the panel should not place much evidentiary weight on the Credible Fear Interview notes as the interpreter was not in the room with her and the claimant was not afforded the benefit of reviewing an audio recording of her interview. A transcription of the interview was part of the CBSA package provided to the IRB and the claimant, at Exhibit 1. Prior to the interview the principal claimant swore under oath that the statements she would be making would \"...be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\" An interpreter was present, apparently via teleconference, and the interpreter affirmed that he would truthfully, literally and fully interpret the questions asked by Officer XXXX and the answers given by the principal claimant and that he would not change the matter to be interpreted. A paragraph was then read out to the principal claimant concerning the purpose of the interview and the importance of telling the truth during the interview. The paragraph also confirms that the statements she makes may be used in deciding her claim and in any future immigration proceedings. The principal claimant was also cautioned to advise the officer if she did not understand any of the questions being asked, in which case the officer would explain it to her. The principal claimant confirmed that she understood the purpose of the interview and that she had no questions about it. The panel finds that in this context, the principal claimant was aware of the purpose of the hearing, was cautioned about the importance of telling the truth and swore to tell the truth.\n[19] The panel acknowledges that principal claimant had no lawyer present during the interview, however, she did indicate during the interview that she spoke to an attorney prior to the interview and was prepared to proceed without an attorney being present. The interview indicates that the principal claimant was given information on May 31, 2016 that she was going to have the Credible Fear Interview the following day. The panel therefore finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant had time to think about and mentally prepare for the interview if she wished to do so. Further, at the conclusion of the credible fear interview, the principal claimant was asked how she and the minor claimant were being treated at the facility, to which she responded \"very good.\" The principal claimant had alleged that they had been in a cold room she described as like a freezer for the first four days after the claimants were first detained on XXXX XXXX, 2016, however, the claimants had been moved to a shelter in the day or two prior to the Credible Fear Interview. In conjunction with the principal claimant's positive response regarding the claimants' treatment at the facility, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that there were no immediate external issues that would have impacted her sworn evidence on June 1, 2016.\n[20] During the principal claimant's hearing before the panel, the principal claimant also testified to having some confusion about the order of interviews and the precise order of events during her detention in the US. The principal claimant also testified that she did not remember providing some of the answers contained in the transcribed interview notes or otherwise testified that she did not give the answers written down at all. The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the information contained in the credible fear interview transcription was accurate because the principal claimant was well aware of the importance of the interview and that she had been cautioned prior to the interview. Further, as the evidence given by the principal claimant was provided more contemporaneously in time to the alleged events which form the basis of the claimants' claims the panel finds that her memory would more be reliable as to the details of her allegations. Therefore, given the principal claimant's credibility issues arising from the discrepancies noted above the panel prefers the evidence given during the credible fear interview where it conflicts with the evidence provided in her BOC and the hearing.\n[21] With these issues in mind the panel finds the following inconsistency to be material to a central element of the claimants' claims. In the principal claimant's BOC and testimony she stated that it was her brother XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who was with her in her house when they admitted the young man into her home, just prior to the Attack. However, during the Credible Fear Interview, the principal claimant was asked \"[W]hat is your brother's name who was w\/you at the house when mara came?\" The principal claimant replied XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, born in El Salvador, I don't know his dob, he's 20 years old.\" When the inconsistency was put to the principal claimant she testified that she didn't know how that could have happened and that she would never have said it was Jose when it was XXXX. The principal claimant further explained that they (the US agents) must have put that name in there from when she provided the names of all her siblings during a different interview. The panel does not find this to be a reasonable explanation for the inconsistency between the principal claimant's testimony\/BOC in Canada and her credible fear interview in the USA, as the panel would not have reasonably expected there to have been such a major discrepancy surrounding such an allegedly traumatic event. Further, given that the claimants allege that they fled El Salvador with XXXX and they were separated during their journey approximately two weeks prior to the Credible Fear Interview, the panel cannot accept that naming XXXX instead of XXXX was an innocent error. Further, as the Credible Fear Interview was recorded and subsequently transcribed, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that there was no reason for the transcriber or US agent(s) to substitute the full name of XXXX for XXXX. The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant did in fact state that it was XXXX who was with her immediately prior to the Attack. As a result, the panel finds that this material inconsistency significantly undermines the principal claimant's credibility and the credibility of the claimants' allegations. As such, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the Attack did not occur and that the principal claimant fabricated the event to advance her asylum\/refugee claims. The panel therefore further finds that on a balance of probabilities the Mara's had no past or future interest in the claimants.\n[22] The claimants provided a support letter and a follow-up support letter from one of the principal claimant's brothers, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which speaks to him arriving in the aftermath of the Attack against the claimants and XXXX.13 The support letter from XXXX also alleges that the Mara's came to the market and spoke to him regarding trying to find the claimants and XXXX, because they believed that a complaint had been filed against one of the Mara's involved in the Attack, which led to the detention and prosecution of a Mara member. As a result the Mara's allegedly want \"to settle accounts.\" Even if the panel were to have accepted the claimants' allegations regarding the Attack, given the principal claimants evidence that she did not report the Attack to the police and that XXXX letter indicates that XXXX is in hiding and does not trust the police to protect him, there is no one left in the family to have reported the Attack. Additionally, as there are no witnesses upon which the police could base a prosecution for the alleged Attack upon the principal claimant, as the alleged victim of the attack is not in El Salvador and never went to the police in the first place, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the prosecution of a Mara member for the Attack is implausible. However, given the panel's finding that the Attack did not occur and the inherent implausibility of the allegations in XXXX support letter, the panel can place no weight on XXXX support letter.\n[23] With respect to the support letter from the principal claimant's mother,14 the panel likewise places no weight upon it, as the support letter is based on the allegation that the principal claimant and XXXX had been assaulted by Mara's and XXXX being a gang member (the panel's findings with respect to XXXX as a gang member are discussed below). As noted above (and below), the panel has found on a balance of probabilities that these allegations were fabricated.\n[24] The principal claimant alleges that her mother went to the house about 8 months after she left and removed some of the principle claimant's belongings and that this led to threats against her life by XXXX and by extension, the Mara's. In support of this allegation, the claimant testified that on the following day, XXXX contacted the principal claimant via phone message and was very angry because he wanted his things back. The principal claimant provided a translated transcription of two phone messages which are allegedly from XXXX.15 The messages are full of foul language and insults, but the main thrust of each message is that XXXX wanted his stuff back and that he didn't want to have anything else to do with the claimants. The demand for his stuff is repeated five times between the two messages, as are his statements that the claimants can then do what they want with their lives and he would forget them. The panel finds that XXXX is clearly very angry about the alleged taking of what he perceives to be his things, even though the principal claimant testified that her house contained nothing that was his. As a result of these messages the claimant made her mother return everything she took from the house to XXXX. The panel finds that while XXXX messages are aggressive, they also indicate over and over, that once he got his stuff back, he wanted nothing more to do with the claimants. The panel finds that there is no mention of gangs or that he wants to kill either claimant once he got his things back.\n[25] The principal claimant testified that XXXX had left other messages on her phone and Facebook where he threatened to kill her because it would help him move up the ranks. However, the principal claimant testified that she had erased these messages. Given the panel's credibility concerns with the principal claimant's evidence regarding XXXX and his gang ties, the panel gives little weight to the principal claimant's testimony regarding the alleged threats contained in XXXX Facebook messages. Rather, the panel finds that the only evidence it can consider on this issue is what is contained in the transcribed messages. As such the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the messages do not support or establish that XXXX is a member of the Mara's and those messages do not represent a present and ongoing threat to the claimants.\n[26] The principal claimant also provided before and after photographs of XXXX from when the claimants were still in El Salvador and photographs allegedly taken more recently to establish that XXXX is now a gang member.16 The old photographs allegedly show XXXX without tattoos on his chest and the more recent photographs show him with several tattoos on his chest. The principal claimant alleges that these tattoos are evidence that XXXX joined a gang, given that one of them is a XXXX and that his gang name is 'XXXX XXXX(XXXX XXXX). The panel has been provided with some documentary disclosure from counsel in the form of articles which contain photographs of members\/former members of the Mara 18 and the tattoos that they have on their bodies.17 The panel notes that the tattoos on XXXX appear rather innocuous and non-threatening - amongst the tattoos is a XXXX XXXX XXXX with the words 'XXXX XXXX underneath; a XXXX with the word 'XXXX written above it in English (rather than 'XXXX XXXX in Spanish); the minor claimant's XXXX and XXXX; and one bar of XXXX XXXX including a XXXX XXXX. The panel finds that none of XXXX tattoos resembles the gang tattoos contained in counsel's country condition package. The principal claimant testified that a friend of hers who is still in El Salvador said she saw a gang tattoo on XXXX back, however, the panel does not have the benefit of a photograph in this regard. The principal claimant has alleged that XXXX has been associated with Mara 18 prior to their separation. This would suggest that XXXX has been in associating with the Mara 18 for up to 6 years. The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the tattoos on XXXX body are not illustrative of gang membership. The panel finds that the principal claimant has not adduced sufficient credible or corroborative evidence to establish that XXXX is a member of the Mara 18 or that he poses a threat to the claimants of his own accord.\nThe Minor Claimant\n[27] The principal claimant alleged in her testimony that XXXX poses a threat to the minor claimant in that she fears XXXX would push the minor claimant to join the Mara 18 as he gets older. The panel is mindful of the country conditions in El Salvador and accepts that young men are at risk to be pressured to join gangs. However, at present, the minor claimant is six years old and the panel finds that the risk to the minor claimant of being forced to join a gang several years from now is speculative at best. Given the panel's findings that on a balance of probabilities XXXX is not a member of the Mara 18 and the Mara 18 is not actively searching for the claimants, the minor claimant's risk continues to be speculative and does not impute to him a personalized risk profile.\nCONCLUSION\n[28] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel finds that there is not a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground should the claimants return to El Salvador, or that, on a balance of probabilities, they would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\n[29] The panel concludes that the claimants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. Therefore, their claims are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Daniel Marcovitch\"\nDaniel Marcovitch\n\"May 19, 2017\"\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act S.C.

The claimant is a 33-year-old female and is a citizen of Turkey. She bases her claim on a well-founded fear of persecution on the grounds of her perceived political opinion as a leftist and her perceived religion as secular. The panel also examined whether the claimant would be subject to torture, or would face a risk to her life or would be subject to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Turkey.\nSPECIAL NOTE\n[2] The claimant's husband is a Canadian citizen and an Immigration consultant and member of the Immigration Consultants of Canada Regulatory Council (R508954). At the hearing he acted on behalf of the claimant.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] The panel finds the claimant not to be a Convention refugee or a person in danger of torture or a person who faces a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Turkey for the following reasons.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The claimant's allegations are detailed in her Basis of Claim Form1. In summary, she alleges that she was raised in a leftist secular family and is unable to return to Turkey because she has been threatened by Islamic extremists.\n[5] The claimant alleges that following the June 2015 general election in Turkey she began receiving threats from Islamic nationalists and that following the November 2015 election she was threatened to be killed.\n[6] The claimant further alleges that after the military coup of July 2016 the situation for her worsened.\n[7] The claimant, who is married to a Canadian citizen and has an 18 month old Canadian son, decided that the sponsorship proceedings from Turkey would take too long so on December XXXX, 2016, the claimant, along with her Canadian husband went to the United States where they intended to commence sponsorship proceedings. On being told that the process in the United States would take approximately one year they decided to proceed to Canada and make a refugee protection claim.\nISSUES\n[8] The determinative issues before the panel were the credibility of the claimant's testimony, the subjective component of the well-founded fear of persecution, a delay in leaving Turkey and making a claim and the objective component of her well-founded fear, notably whom the claimant fears would persecute her should she return to Turkey and the availability of an Internal Flight Alternative. The panel's analyses of these issues are as follows.\nANALYSIS\n[9] The determinative issue in this claim is the objective component of the well-founded fear of persecution, notably who the claimant fears would persecute her should she return to Turkey\n[10] Credibility was a key issue in this claim. The court ruled in Maldonado2 that the sworn testimony of the claimant is presumed to be true, unless there is a valid reason to doubt its truthfulness. It is to the claimant's credit that she did not attempt to embellish her claim, speaking only of verbal threats to herself and to physical attacks on others that she had read in the newspaper or heard through word of mouth. However some credibility concerns arose between the claimant's written and oral evidence that were not resolved in her favour. The claimant, in her narrative, describes being threatened by Islamic extremists and that her life was threatened. When queried on the specifics of these threats the claimant testified that threats were not from specific individuals but rather from some who objected to her not wearing a hijab. The claimant testified she was not able to go out and feel comfortable and that the situation was for all women and not just for her. The claimant was unable to provide a single incident of a threat to her life and during the course of questioning was provided more than one opportunity. The panel determines that the discriminatory incidents to which the claimant has testified are abhorrent but such acts of discrimination do not amount to persecution\n[11] According to section 97(1) of the Act3, a person in need of protection must show that her removal to that country, in this case Turkey, must subject the claimant personally to the harm feared. It is not sufficient for the claimant to establish that the harm is inflicted on others in her country. As well, according to Section 97(1)(b)(ii) of the Act, protection is limited to those who face a specific risk that is not faced generally by others in the country. Thus the risk must not be indiscriminate risk faced by the claimant and others.4 The claimant has not demonstrated that she would be persecuted or would be personally at risk should she return to Turkey.\n[12] In relation to the claimant's subjective fear, the claimant testified that she was in fear of living in Turkey specifically following the June and November 2015 elections but had run into an incident in 2013 when she attended a Gezi Park protest and was detained. The claimant, in spite of being married to a Canadian citizen since November 2014 and in spite of making sure her son had Canadian citizenship following his birth in July 2015, the claimant made no efforts to secure her own Canadian citizenship through sponsorship by her husband. Instead she waited until after the Coup in June 2016 before she decided she needed Canadian citizenship. Being refused a Canadian visa in August 2016 she travelled to the United States on a US multiple entry visa and on finding out sponsorship from the US could take up to a year came to Canada and made a refugee claim. The panel makes a negative inference from this behaviour that goes directly to the claimant's lack of subjective fear. It is expected that if this claimant's fear of persecution were well-founded she would have not delayed in leaving Turkey and would have used her opportunity for sponsorship to prepare leaving Turkey at her earliest opportunity.\n[13] The panel would expect that individuals who fear for their personal safety and their life would not only flee at the earliest opportunity but would seek refugee protection as soon as they are beyond the reach of their persecutors and it is reasonable to do so. The claimant did not do this, the claimant did not seek a way out of Turkey at her earliest opportunity and as such the panel makes a negative inference from these actions that go directly to the claimant's lack of subjective fear.\n[14] The final determinative issue in this claim is the availability of an IFA. The panel determines that even allowing the claimant would face more than a mere possibility of persecution at the hands of Islamic extremists, the panel determines that there is a viable IFA in all the claimant's particular circumstances.\n[15] The panel finds no serious possibility of persecution in the identified area of Izmir, a city where the claimant owns a home with her husband and where she has parents and a sister. The test with respect to an IFA is two pronged and is articulated in Rasaratnam5 and Thirunavukkarasu6.\n[16] The RPD must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of this claimant being persecuted in the proposed IFA and that in all the circumstances including the circumstances particular to this claimant, the conditions in the proposed IFA are such that it is not unreasonable for the claimant to seek refuge there.\n[17] The claimant testified that she would not be safe anywhere in Turkey. The panel notes that the claimant's mother and sister live there without any serious incident and this panel determined previously in this analysis that the incidents to which the claimant was subjected in Istanbul were discriminatory and not persecution. The claimant's husband did operate an office in Izmir where the claimant worked, there is nothing in evidence to indicate she encountered problems in that city at that time or that her family, who reside there, are in any danger. The claimant's sister, according to testimony teaches dance in Izmir. There is no evidence before the panel that the claimant will lack medical attention or face other physical hardship in Izmir.\n[18] The panel finds that the kind of hardship the claimant may face in moving to Izmir is the hardship associated with any relocation and dislocation and is not the kind of hardship that renders an IFA unreasonable. After all the claimant has lived and worked in the city before and, with her Canadian husband, owns a house. It would be reasonable to expect that the claimant can safely live there while her sponsorship application to reside in Canada is processed.\n[19] The documentary evidence provided by the RPD7 would support the contention that following the attempted coup of July 2016 to topple President Erdogen the unrest in Turkey was exacerbated, the Turkish government embarked on a massive purge to clean the state involving tens of thousands of state employees, banks and companies. According to the Turkish government in its quest to protect Turkish democracy by purging Gulenists who the government believes is at the heart of the failed coup.8 The documentary evidence9 would support the claimant's testimony that persons supporting illegal Kurdish, left wing or Islamic political parties can face persecution at the hands of Turkish authorities. However, simply being a supporter of the leftist cause does not by definition place a person at risk. There is nothing in evidence that would persuade this panel that on a balance of probabilities that this claimant's simply being a supporter of the leftist cause places her at risk.\n[20] I find the claimant's desire to seek refugee protection in Canada is not motivated by fear of extremists but by a wish to seek an alternate, faster way to enter Canada than waiting for her sponsorship to be finalized and while the panel can sympathize with her motive it is not a ground for refugee protection. The claimant's motives to live in Canada must be dealt with under immigration law and not refugee law.\n[21] The Federal Court pointed out in Urbanek10. The appellant's position is based on a fundamental misconception of Canada's refugee determination system; the purpose of that system is to provide safe haven to those who genuinely need it, not to give a quick and convenient route to landed status for immigrants who cannot or will not obtain it in the usual way.\nCONCLUSION\n[22] Based on the foregoing analysis, the panel does not accept that the evidence presented in this claim has established that there is a reasonable chance or serious possibility that this claimant would be persecuted for a Convention refugee ground or that she would be in danger of torture or that she would be put at risk to life or be subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment should he return to Turkey.\n[23] Accordingly the panel rejects the claim.\n(signed)\n\" Christine Lloyd\"\nCHRISTINE LLOYD\nApril 5, 2017\nDate\n1 Exhibit 2.\n2Maldonado v.

They say that they have been threatened by the Mara Salvatrucha 13 (MS-13) gang in their country. Allegedly, the Claimants were unable to obtain assistance from the police or other authorities, despite the Principal Claimant being a captain in the army's Presidential Security Battalion, commanding the detail that protects the Salvadoran President's daughter.\n[2] On that basis, the Claimants each2 seek refugee protection as a person described in section 96 or 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act3 (IRPA), with the Mother Claimant acting as the designated representative for her two minor children4.\n2 DETERMINATION:\nTHE CLAIMANTS HAVE ESTABLISHED THEIR IDENTITIES\nBUT ARE NOT CONVENTION REFUGEES OR PERSONS IN NEED OF PROTECTION\n[3] On a balance of probabilities, I find that the Claimants are nationals of El Salvador, based on their passports and the visas issued to them by the United States5. They have accordingly provided acceptable documentation under IRPA section 106.\n[4] I find, however, that the Claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n3 ANALYSIS:\nTHE PRINCIPAL CLAIMANT IS NOT EXCLUDED FOR 1F(A) OR (B) CRIMES\nBUT, BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT CREDIBLE, THE CLAIMANTS DO NOT FACE\nA RISK TO LIFE OR A RISK OF CRUEL AND UNUSUAL TREATMENT OF PUNISHMENT\n[5] The determinative issues are whether:\na. the persecution that the Claimants allegedly fear is for any of the reasons set out in IRPA section 96 (so as to have a nexus to one of the Convention grounds),\nb. there are serious grounds for considering that the Principal Claimant has committed:\ni. a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity (which would exclude him under Article 1F(a)), or\nii. a non-serious political crime outside Canada (which would exclude him under Article 1F(b)), and\nc. the Claimants' allegations are credible (including their assertion that the family of a military officer guarding the Salvadoran First Family could not receive protection).\n[6] I find that there is no nexus because the Claimants are not members of a \"particular social group\". I further find that the Principal Claimant is neither excluded under Article 1F(a), because his contribution to Salvadoran army abuses was not \"significant\", nor under Article 1F(b), because his supposed criminal wrongdoing in the El Salvador did not rise to the level of \"serious\". I find, however, that his allegations, as well as those of the other Claimants, are not credible.\n3.1 There is No Nexus to the Convention, so the IRPA s. 96 Claims Fail\n[7] To be a Convention refugee, a person must show a well-founded fear of persecution for one of five reasons: \"race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion\"6. The Claimants identified only \"membership in a particular social group\" as their nexus: for the Principal Claimant, \"the group in question is members of the security forces in El Salvador\", and for the others, \"their particular social group is family\"7.\n[8] I find that the Principal Claimant's service in the Salvadoran military does not make him a member of a \"particular social group\" under section 96 of IRPA. \"Occupation does not ordinarily constitute a nexus ... It relates to what one does rather than who one is.... Nor is a particular occupation so fundamental to human dignity that one should not be forced to forsake it\"8. \"[I]t would trivialize the notion of 'a particular social group' if one were to consider that vocational groups pertain to that concept. This would be inconsistent with the historical roots of that notion, incompatible with the analogous grounds approach developed in the context of anti-discrimination law, and inimical to the whole purpose of Convention refugee protection\"9. The Board has repeatedly held that membership in security forces does not fall within the notion of a section 96 \"particular social group\"10, that analysis has been upheld by the Federal Court11, and I find it compelling.\n[9] Because the Principal Claimant has not established that he is a member of a \"particular social group\", the other Claimants' section 96 claims necessarily also fail: \"When the primary victim of persecution does not come within the definition of a _Convention refugee_, any derivative refugee claims based on family group cannot be sustained\"12.\n[10] Accordingly, the Claimants must meet the higher test under IRPA section 97 for persons in need of protection, namely a danger of torture or risk to life or of cruel and unusual punishment on a balance of probabilities.\n3.2 Because He Did Not \"Significantly\" Contribute to Violations of\nHuman Rights, the Principal Claimant is Not Excluded Under Article 1F(a)\n[11] Section 98 of IRPA provides that a person referred to in Article 1F(a) is not a person in need of protection.\n[12] Article 1F(a) refers to persons for whom there are \"serious reasons for considering\" to have \"committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes\".\n[13] While \"serious reasons for considering\" requires more than \"mere suspicion\" and \"reasonable grounds for suspecting\", it sets a lower evidentiary standard than \"proof beyond a reasonable doubt [or even] the general civil standard of the balance of probabilities\"13.\n[14] The Salvadoran military has been involved in police duties for several years14. Its participation in escalating extrajudicial killings is manifested clearly in the country conditions evidence:\na. \"Sources report that members of the security forces ... have been accused of being involved in unlawful killings ... as of July 2014, the [Human Rights Ombudsperson] received 17 complaints of alleged unlawful killings committed by 'security, military, and other public officials' ... the majority of victims are young people accused of being gang members\"15,\nb. The Human Rights Ombudsperson \"reported that from June 2014 to May 2015 it received 2,202 complaints of human rights violations, 92% of which were allegedly committed by the police and\/or the military\"16,\nc. The Human Rights Ombudsperson later \"stated that, between June 2015 and May 2016, the PDDH received 1,883 complaints of human rights violations, 1,284 of which were reportedly committed by the [police] and the military\"17,\nd. \"As of October [2016] the attorney general was investigating 53 possible cases of extrajudicial killings. One took place in 2013, none in 2014, 11 in 2015, and 41 in 2016. ... As of March [2016] the [Human Rights Ombudsperson] had received 12 complaints of alleged unlawful killings committed by security, military, and other public officials and found substantial evidence in two cases. In September the [Human Rights Ombudsperson] stated that it was aware of approximately 50 cases involving potential extrajudicial killings\"18,\ne. The Human Rights Ombudsperson \"found indications that the [police] and the armed forces had committed extrajudicial killings during the March 2015 San Blas case (involving the killing of seven alleged gang members and one other person) and the August 2015 Pajales case (which involved the close-range killing of four unarmed gang members)\"19,\nf. \"The mortality rate of suspected gang members in confrontations with police during the first six months of the year was 109 percent higher (i.e., more than double) that the 2015 mortality rate, which was itself 41 percent higher than in 2014... [Expert analysis] concluded that the data demonstrated a pattern of abuse of lethal force by police authorities\"20,\ng. \"In a further escalation of the violence, the government also loosened up the rules of engagement for police and the army thus making it easier for them to use their weapons to 'defend themselves' against gangs. This unleashed an all-out war in which young police agents and army troops, and young gang-bangers are killing themselves.\"21,\nh. \"Witness testimonies state insistently that in many cases, groups of heavily armed men dressed in dark, similar to the clothing worn by the police and the army, used sledgehammers and verbal commands to forcibly enter homes and either take the victims outside to be killed or kill them inside their dwellings\"22,\n[15] When I asked about the violence, the Principal Claimant stated that the army had engaged in \"legitimate self-defense\". I find that the Salvadoran military has done more, and much worse, than that23.\n[16] When I asked whether he had any involvement with the army's anti-gang operations, the Principal Claimant answered that he not been participated \"directly\". There is no evidence of him personally \"carrying out extrajudicial massacres ...[or] brutalizing suspected gang members\"24. However, \"individuals may be complicit in international crimes without a link to a particular crime... where there are serious reasons for considering that an individual has voluntarily made a significant and knowing contribution to a group's crime or criminal purpose\"25.\n[17] In Ezokola, Supreme Court of Canada identified the following factors as a guide for assessing an individual's contribution to a crime or criminal purpose:\n\"(i) the size and nature of the organization;\n(ii) the part of the organization with which the refugee claimant was most directly concerned;\n(iii) the refugee claimant's duties and activities within the organization;\n(iv) the refugee claimant's position or rank in the organization;\n(v) the length of time the refugee claimant was in the organization, particularly after acquiring knowledge of the group's crime or criminal purpose; and\n(vi) the method by which the refugee claimant was recruited and the refugee claimant's opportunity to leave the organization\"26.\n[18] Applying those factors to the Principal Claimant:\na. Size and Nature: The Salvadoran military is relatively small, with total active armed forces numbering 15,30027. The army is only one component, and there is no evidence that the (smaller) navy and air force have participated in the extrajudicial killings28.\nb. Part of the Organization: The Principal Claimant's relevant service was in a unit of military engineers that provided logistical support to the soldiers on anti-gang patrols.\nc. Duties and Activities: The Principal Claimant gave evolving evidence about how he provided \"indirect\" support to his comrades in arms. For most of his career, though, he had no connection to anti-gang work, such as during his service outside El Salvador.\nd. Position or Rank: As a captain, the Principal Claimant commanded a unit of engineers.\ne. Length of Time: The Principal Claimant served from January 2000 until January 201729. Significantly, however, he transferred to the Presidential Security Battalion in May 2014.\nf. Recruitment: The Principal Claimant volunteered, dropping out of university to attend the military academy.\n[19] I find a serious possibility that the Principal Claimant's contribution to human rights abuses was \"knowing\". \"During El Salvador twelve-year internal armed conflict (1980-1992), the country developed a notorious reputation for extra-judicial killings, torture, disappearances, and paramilitary death squads that killed tens of thousands of people\"30. Additionally, \"[a]buses were common in the 2000s as successive ... governments launched aggressive \"mano-dura\" anti-gang policies\"31. Having relatives in the army, and serving for 17 years as an officer, the Principal Claimant would not be blind to what has happened.\n[20] I find a serious possibility that his contribution was also \"voluntary\". The Principal Claimant was not conscripted and did not resign in disgust. He did not seem at all ashamed of what his army has done: when asked about the Human Rights Ombudsperson reports, he dismissed the complainants as \"gang members\" and \"their relatives\".\n[21] I find, however, that there is not a serious possibility that Principal Claimant's contribution was \"significant\". He admitted that he commanded a unit that indirectly involved in the anti-gang campaign, providing logistical support to the soldiers on patrol, issuing fuel and food, and repairing their barracks. These are not insignificant activities, and could be an important \"link in a chain that led to human rights abuses\"32. Just as a \"battle is fought and decided by the quartermasters, long before the shooting begins\"33, crimes against humanity cannot be committed by perpetrators who are not fed, clothed, armed, and sheltered.\n[22] Nevertheless, the Principal Claimant transferred to the Presidential Security Battalion in mid-2014, before the extrajudicial killings accelerated. As a result, I find his contribution is not enough to exclude him under Article 1F(a).\n3.3 Because the Crime He Committed Aboard is Not \"Serious\",\nthe Principal Claimant is Not Excluded Under Article 1F(b)\n[23] Section 98 of IRPA further provides that a person referred to in Article 1F(b) is also not a person in need of protection.\n[24] Article 1F(b) states:\n\"The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:\n...\nhe has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refuge\"34.\n[25] \"[W]here a maximum sentence of ten years or more could have been imposed had the crime been committed in Canada, the crime will generally be considered serious\"35.\n[26] According to the Principal Claimant, he \"left [his] job with the military without resigning\" and is \"considered a deserter\"36. Had he committed those acts as a member of the Canadian Forces, he would be guilty of an offence under section 88 of the National Defence Act37 (NDA) and liable to imprisonment for life (if on active service) or a term of up to five years (in any other case).\n[27] The Principal Claimant submits that he was not on \"active service\"38. I disagree. The Salvadoran \"constitution separates public security and military functions, [but] allows the president to use the armed forces 'in exceptional circumstances' to maintain internal peace and public security 'when all other measures have been exhausted.'\"39 Such exceptional circumstances have been decreed, with the military now deployed and routinely patrolling Salvadoran cities40. Especially given the Principal Claimant's mission to guard the President's daughter, his status was analogous to \"active service\".\n[28] Nevertheless, I also do not find that that there are serious reasons for considering that he committed a serious crime outside Canada similar to NDA section 88 because, on a balance of probabilities, the non-political crime the Claimant allegedly committed in his country was not \"serious\". \"While consideration of whether a maximum sentence of ten years or more could have been imposed had the crime been committed in Canada is a useful guideline, and crimes attracting a maximum sentence of ten years or more in Canada will generally be sufficiently serious to warrant exclusion, the ten-year rule should not be applied in a mechanistic, decontextualized, or unjust manner\"41.\n[29] Binding authority requires that I take into account \"the wide Canadian sentencing range[s]\" for the analogous offence42, namely zero time to life imprisonment. The Principal Claimant's alleged crime would likely fall at the less serious end of the range43. Importantly, it would be non-violent, have no individual victim, and cause no meaningful harm to society44. All of this militates in favour of finding that it would not be \"serious\".\n[30] Accordingly, the Principal Claimant is not excluded under Article 1F(b), because there are not serious reasons for considering that he committed a serious non-political crime outside Canada. In any event, the problems with the Principal Claimant's calls into question whether he, in fact, actually deserted.\n3.4 On a Balance of Probabilities,\nBecause They Are Not Credible,\nThe Claimants Do Not Face a Danger of Torture, or\na Risk to Life, or a Risk of Cruel and Unusual Treatment of Punishment\n[31] The alleged threat from MS-13 cannot be \"torture\" under IRPA s. 97(1)(a), because violence from them would not be \"inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity\"45. Nevertheless, the gang could pose a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. El Salvador's \"principal human rights problems stem[] from widespread extortion and other crime in poor communities\"46. For most Salvadorans, the state does not provide effective protection: only \"5 to 7 percent of complaints lodged with authorities lead to sentences\"47, \"the majority of homicides are not investigated, nor go to trial\"48, and \"police officers often tell victims of extortion that 'it is better to pay the extortion than be killed'\"49. The police force is also corruption-ridden and \"has been infiltrated by criminal organizations\"50. Because those \"[g]angs exert their influence all over the country\"51, their victims often cannot find refuge anywhere within its borders (an internal flight alternative), particularly because the gangs scrutinize and may kill people transiting from territory they do not control52.\n[32] To be persons in need of protection, therefore, the Claimants must each show, \"on a balance of probabilities, that [her or] his removal to [El Salvador] would subject [her or] him personally, in every part of that country, to a risk to [her or] his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment that is not faced generally by other individuals in or from [El Salvador]\"53. Because people in general face criminal violence throughout El Salvador, the determinative issue is consequently whether the Claimants are \"personally subject to a risk that is not faced generally by the other individuals from or living in that country\"54.\n[33] I find that, on a balance of probabilities, the Claimants are not subject to such a risk and will not be personally targeted in El Salvador. I make that finding because I find that the Claimants are, also on a balance of probabilities, not credible in their allegations about having been so threatened previously.\n[34] \"A refugee claimant's sworn testimony is presumed to be true unless there are reasons to doubt its veracity. In assessing a refugee claimant's sworn testimony, the Board is entitled to consider its plausibility, and to apply common sense and rationality. Where the evidence before the Board is inconsistent with the claimant's sworn testimony, the presumption of truth is rebuttable\"55. In this case, the presumption was rebutted:\na. The Principal Claimant's testimony contradicted his Basis of Claim narrative,\nb. The narrative omitted key information,\nc. The Claimants' documents either diminish their trustworthiness or are unpersuasive, and, significantly,\nd. Given the Principal Claimant's circumstances, his purported response to the MS-13 threats is simply implausible.\n3.4.1 The Principal Claimant is Inconsistent about Reporting the Alleged Threats\n[35] In the Basis of Claim, the Principal Claimant states that, after receiving a threatening call from MS-13 in February 2014, he wrote a letter to his commanding officer56. Although the Claimants provided a copy of a subsequent letter reporting gang harassment, the first missive was not produced. At the hearing, the Principal Claimant stated that his first report was oral. When asked why his narrative instead makes clear that the first report was written, the Principal Claimant testified that maybe he had been confused.\n[36] I do not accept that answer as reasonable. If forgetful when completing the form, the Principal Claimant could have amended it to clarify that his report was oral, but did not do so57. He is well educated58 and he declared that he \"fully understood\" the form59, which was interpreted to him60. He also prepare his Basis of Claim with the assistance of an experienced lawyer61. That lawyer would have been aware that the form is the \"foundational document on which the application was considered and entitlement and credibility assessed\", and that \"omissions could result in adverse credibility findings against the [C]laimant\" 62. He would have had to interview the Claimants \"extensively to prepare a narrative that detailed all of the incidents of persecution\" that they experienced, which would require him to \"probe\" and \"dig for more\"63. Because counsel would have been alive to the critical need to demonstrate that there was no effective state protection, despite the Principal Claimant guarding the President's daughter, I find the inconsistency undercuts that allegation.\n3.4.2 The Narrative Omits the Name of the Other Adult Claimant's Supposed Saviour\n[37] The Other Adult Claimant was allegedly attacked by MS-13 members in December 2016, escaping death only because of the fortuitous arrival of a friend. Although that attack was the event that supposedly precipitated the Claimants' flight, the friend's name was not provided in the narrative. Moreover, the Basis of Claim instructed the Claimants, in bold font and capital letters, to include everything that is important for their claim, including names wherever possible64. On the document itself65, and at the beginning of their testimony, the Claimants confirmed that their Basis of Claim were \"complete\".\n[38] When asked about the omission, the Principal Claimant stated that he was instructed when entering Canada to be direct, and that he had forgotten many details. When I observed that he had completed his narrative a significant time after crossing the border, the Principal Claimant then said that the name did not seem important because it was not part of the attack on his family and if he had given the name, he would need to prove it. The Board's principal means of testing credibility is by examining a claimant's story for inconsistencies that cannot be reasonably explained. Claimants are expressly asked to provide names. Given the critical role the friend supposedly played, and the fact he supposedly provided a letter for the hearing, I find that the omission is more than mere details or elaborations66, and that it weighs against finding these Claimants trustworthy.\n3.4.3 The Claimants' Documents are Unpersuasive\n[39] The Claimants' documents are insufficient to rehabilitate their credibility. A number actually diminish it, given that they are flawed on their face:\na. Although the Principal Claimant acknowledged that the army had official forms for providing reports, he supposedly told the army about threats to him in 2016 through a private letter67. When I asked why, he said that forms were for official information, not personal. I do not accept that explanation as credible, on a balance of probabilities: the Salvadoran army is fighting MS-13, and any threats to a soldier would effectively be military intelligence. The Principal Claimant's explanation of why he waited until December to report threats from the end of September also detracts from his trustworthiness: as long-serving officer, he would not need to research to whom to report.\nb. A letter of recommendation from his commanding officer provides a Hotmail email address, rather than an army or even government one68. Additionally, despite testifying that he did not tell the author that he was leaving the army (and allegedly deserting), the letter wishes the Principal Claimant \"success at whatever new profession he chooses to pursue\".\nc. Although the Basis of Claim says that the Principal Claimant's father had been served with a letter about his son's alleged desertion, the document itself states that it was received by the Principal Claimant's aunt69. The Principal Claimant's attempted explanation, namely that his father was ill and so was not informed, confuses the matter further.\n[40] Many of the other documents are of limited probative value. The alleged police reports70, if genuine, record only what the Principal Claimant and Other Adult Claimant told officers. There is limited basis to believe that an attack on the President's daughter's home, described in another letter71, is related to MS-13 targeting the Claimants. The omission of the Other Adult Claimant's rescuer's name from the Basis of Claim reduces the weight of an affidavit ostensibly from that friend. As a result, I find that the documentary evidence is insufficient to allay the problems with the Claimants' credibility.\n3.4.4 The Principal Claimant's Alleged Response to the Threats is Implausible\n[41] While I can only make implausibility findings \"in the clearest of cases\"72, I have concluded this is such a claim. Many claimants respond (or fail to respond) to threats in ways that could appear irrational, but the Board understands fear and a dissimilar cultural milieu can provide a very good explanation of what at first glance looks improbable. The Principal Claimant's circumstances make this case different:\na. He is a decorated and much commended officer, with an education that has continued long since leaving university and his military academy. He was a palpably intelligent witness.\nb. He has served outside of El Salvador in Lebanon, Chile, Haiti, the United States, Spain, and Paraguay73, to documented acclaim. He projected an aura of professionalism and competence in the hearing room.\nc. He was at the very centre of power in his country, his chain of command passing through only a Lieutenant Colonel and a Colonel, and then directly to the President. Only three other officers were in positions like his, equivalent posts so sensitive that he was not told what they were.\nd. Most importantly, he commanded the unit that guarded the President's daughter. He personified \"effective state protection\".\n[42] The President who the Principal Claimant served has pressed ahead with using the military to fight the gangs74. While I note that in some cases gang members have threatened military members into collaborating with them75, it is obvious that a Presidential Security Battalion that can be intimidated cannot provide presidential security. Unlike most Salvadorans, the Principal Claimant was in a position to get effective assistance. As a result, I find the Claimants' allegation that they could not get effective state protection, and that their alleged problems with MS-13 were an embarrassment, implausible.\n[43] Buttressing that finding are the Principal Claimant's unsatisfactory explanations for his alleged responses to the gang's threats:\na. If his family had found safety by moving to a relative's home in 2014, why did he not try that again when threatened in 2016? His explanation, that the house was small, is incongruous with fearing for the lives of his loved ones.\nb. Why did he not report the 2014 threats to the police? He stated that he did not have confidence in them then, but that jars with his making a report in 2016, when police corruption and gang-infiltration had, if anything, gotten worse.\nc. Why did he not report the threats to any other authorities? Given his long and successful career, the Principal Claimant would have, on a balance of probabilities, contacts and friends throughout the security forces (and he cited relatives in the military as inspiration for his enlistment). His assertion that he did not know what to do or had to research his options is in stark contrast to the marked capability demonstrated in his military endeavours.\n4 CONCLUSION:\nTHE CLAIMS FOR REFUGEE PROTECTION ARE REJECTED\n[44] Because of their lack of credibility, I find on a balance of probabilities that the Claimants' allegations of having been previously threatened personally in El Salvador are untrue. As a result, I find that, more likely than not, they do not face such a risk in the future. Accordingly, they have failed to meet the test for persons in need of protection, namely a danger of torture or risk to life or of cruel and unusual punishment on a balance of probabilities.\n[45] Under section 107(1) of IRPA, I am accordingly required to reject their claims for refugee protection76.\n(signed)\n\"J.

The panel also finds that the claimant has not established she is a person in need of protection, in that her removal to Kosovo will not subject her personally to a risk to life, to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or that she would be unable or unwilling to avail herself of the protection of that country. There are not substantial grounds to believe that her removal to Kosovo will subject the claimant personally to a danger of torture for the reasons that follow.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The following is a brief synopsis of the allegations that the claimant put forth in the personal information form (PIF) and in her amending narrative.2 The claimant submits that after her separation and eventual divorce in 2010 from her husband that she will continue to face serious mistreatment and potentially be murdered by her elder brother, in an effort to restore the honour of the family in her failure to marry his proposed husband in 2012.\n[4] The claimant's immigration history is irregular and did impact the claimant's credibility for immigration authorities. This included the numerous applications to come to Canada that were clearly fraudulent and admitted to by the claimant in her hearings.3 Her children arrived in XXXX 2012, after being sponsored by their father. They arrived in XXXX 2012, and the claimant followed shortly afterwards on a fraudulent passport. The claimant was informed, was picked up and detained by immigration authorities. She subsequently made her claim for protection. The claimant has remained in XXXX XXXX with sole custody of her children. She testified that she remains there due to the support she receives from a family friend, XXXX.\n[5] The claimant's initial hearing was held and a decision determining that the claimant would receive adequate state protection in Kosovo was decided on May 20, 2014. The decision was granted leave and was returned to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (the \"Board\") for a de novo hearing on consent. The claimant submitted an amended narrative and pages four and seven of her Personal Information Form (PIF).4 In these amended forms, she amended her work history to align with her application and documents submitted with her work permit applications.5\n[6] A second hearing was held; however, due to interpretation problems, the proceeding was set de novo.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[7] The panel is satisfied on a balance of probabilities in the claimant's identity, including her nationality, considering the certified copy of her Kosovan passport.6\nCredibility\n[8] There are a number of credibility issues surrounding the claimant's numerous attempts at entering Canada. Although these are present, it is clear and agreed to that the claimant did submit fraudulent documentation and applications in order to leave Kosovo. The claimant submits that her brother XXXX was the person who had submitted the documentation she merely signed. Although the claimant may have had little to do with the application, she is ultimately responsible for the applications made in her name. It is likely that she would have also had to have had some knowledge of the contents if she were called for an interview, or had to speak to the information when entering Canada. The claimant would have reasonably known that she would be untruthful with Canadian authorities in making these applications. Although the claimant was clearly not credible and had been fraudulent in her applications, these applications were allegedly completed to assist the claimant in escaping an intolerable situation in Kosovo. There is a negligible negative inference that can be taken against the claimant's central issue before this panel on whether she had faced gender-based persecution in Kosovo.\n[9] The visa office had significant doubts regarding the genuineness of the divorce granted to the claimant in 2010.7 At the time of this proceeding, the claimant's ex-husband remains married to his second wife, although they have no kids. The claimant and their children live in XXXX XXXX, and the ex-husband lives in the same city assisting in some child care. The children are now 12 and 15 years of age and having been sponsored by their father, they arrived in Canada in XXXX 2012. The claimant followed shortly afterwards on a fraudulent passport. The claimant was informed, picked up and detained by immigration authorities. She subsequently made her claim for protection.\nState Protection\n[10] The determinative issue in the case is the presumption that countries are capable of protecting their citizens. Further to this is the principle that international protection is to be used only when a refugee claimant has no other nationally available recourse. The Immigration and Refugee Board is not obliged to prove that Kosovan authorities can offer the claimant effective state protection; rather, the claimant bears the legal burden of rebutting the presumption that adequate state protection exists by adducing clear and convincing evidence that is reliable and probative, which satisfies the Board on a balance of probabilities. I have taken into account the gender Guidelines8 that particularly apply to the analysis of state protection in this case.\n[11] State protection is determinative in this case. I do note that Kosovo is a relatively new country, having been established in 2008 with independence in 2014. The international community determines that Kosovo is democratic, and the last elections were considered free and fair. Further, the civilian authorities maintained effective control of its territory.9 Kosovo is a reported democracy and is a functioning democracy, but a particularized assessment of the mechanisms, laws and institutions in place for responding to domestic violence against women is necessary to determine whether there is effective state protection for similarly situated persons to the claimant.\n[12] The situation of the claimant returning to Kosovo after a significant period of time, more than five years have passed, would mean that she would be returning without her immediate family headed by her elder brother. He effectively isolated her, including that she had not spoken to her mother up until her death. However, she has maintained relationships with other siblings and friends of the family since leaving Kosovo in 2012. The claimant has alleged that she fears her personal safety is at risk, given the threats her elder brother has raised in the past against her.\n[13] In review of the numerous documentation and reporting on Kosovo's state following 2008, I am persuaded that the claimant would receive adequate protection. It would be objectively reasonable for her to approach authorities in Kosovo for protection if she were to return to Kosovo.\n[14] Kosovo has enacted laws regarding domestic violence according to the 2015 report by the Kosova Women's Network:\nThe legal framework related to domestic violence has improved substantially since 2008. Various international conventions and national laws are applicable. The Law on Protection against Domestic Violence (2008) has taken the place of the prior United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) regulation. The Kosovo Programme and Action Plan against Domestic Violence 2011-2014 set actions for institutions to address domestic violence. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) detail the roles and responsibilities of individual institutions, as well as steps for improving coordination among key institutions dealing with domestic violence.10\n[15] The police and courts are tasked with working and assisting persons who suffer domestic violence. The police in Kosovo are one of the most trusted institutions and as reported by the Kosovar Center for Security Studies, the trust is genuine due to the respondents in their survey and their actual interactions with the police. There is a general perception that the Kosovo Police (KP) is functional, and persons in Kosovo consider it to be the first address for all societal and safety related issues.11 In 2015, out of the 184 cases reported, police came in 92.8% of cases and in 80 cases (44.4%), respondents said that the perpetrator was arrested by the police.12 According to victims' advocates (VAs), police responded according to established protocols to rape and domestic abuse allegations.13\n[16] In Kosovo, there are multiple levels and agencies mandated in the assistance and protection of women in Kosovo beyond the KP. According to the Victim's Advocacy Officers (VAO), a victims' advocate is a person authorized to advocate for domestic violence, victims' interests and to provide support and assistance to the victims. For further information on the role of the VAOs, please refer to the description below of the various kinds of protection orders:\nDistrict Legal Aid Bureaus provide free legal aid to qualifying victims. They facilitate victims' access to justice, for example, by providing information and advice to victims concerning their legal rights, by representing victims before courts or administrative bodies and by assisting with legal drafting and procedures.\nCentres for Social Welfare (CSW) CSWs play a key role in supporting domestic violence victims to deal with courts and police, especially when victims are minors or otherwise lack the capacity to act on their own. In addition, CSWs evaluate the situation of domestic violence victims and help to find the best solution for the victim. CSWs may also carry out home visits and liaise with hospitals and safe houses. CSWs may provide psycho-social and legal counseling to victims. CSWs may also include a victim in the social assistance scheme (if the victim qualifies for it). For further information on the role of CSWs, please refer above to the description of the various kinds of protection orders.\nOmbudsperson Institution (OI) The OI is an independent institution mandated to address alleged human rights violations by public institutions in Kosovo. The OI conducts investigations, issues reports and provides legal services and public advocacy. The OI provides services free of charge and accepts complaints from anyone in Kosovo. The OI can play a key role in supporting domestic violence victims through addressing shortcomings in regard to the implementation of the law on protection against domestic violence that affect the rights of domestic violence victims.14\nA shelter is a safe place where domestic violence victims and their children can temporarily stay and which provides protection and other services. Currently there are shelters in Gjakova\/\u00d0akovica, Gjilan\/Gnjilane, Mitrovic\u00eb\/Mitrovica, Pej\u00eb\/Pec, Prishtin\u00eb\/Pri\u0161tina and Prizren that host victims from communities all over Kosovo. Victims can stay in the shelter for six months. This can be extended upon agreement with the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare. The government and international donors provided support to seven NGOs to assist children and female victims of domestic violence.15\nShelters provide victims with accommodation, food, clothing, counseling (psychosocial and legal advice), medical support, vocational trainings (language, computer, internet, reading and writing, sewing, cooking, hairdressing, tailoring), health education, job-seeking services, and activities for children (music, drawing, dancing) among other services. The shelters are patrolled by the police and have various other security arrangements. Some shelters also contribute to preventing domestic violence by organizing awareness-raising activities and outreach visits to rural areas. Some shelters are also involved in monitoring and advocating for a legal and policy framework in Kosovo that is properly funded and that protects domestic violence victims. Some others conduct regular visits to the victims, once they return to their families or become independent.16\nThere are nine women's shelters with 140 shelter places available. The most recent women's shelter opened in Kosovo in 2014. Currently, 17% of recommended women's shelter places are still missing in the country. In 2014, 315 women survivors of violence and 197 children were accommodated at the shelters, and no women were turned away due to lack of space.17\n[17] According to women's advocates, institutions that work directly on assisting persons who have suffered domestic violence, such as police, courts, VAs, Centers for Social Welfare (CSWs) and shelters, seem to have improved their response in the past years. Police are better trained and tend to know their duties. The fact that several basic courts now have civil court judges specialized in domestic violence cases is an important improvement. Perceptions regarding the performance of VAs and CSWs, and their approach towards people who have suffered violence were mixed. Shelters offer some rehabilitation services, but their sustainable funding has not yet been resolved. Other institutions, such as educational institutions, municipalities, Vocational Training Centres (VTCs), employment offices, health institutions and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are less informed about domestic violence and how to treat such cases.18 I do find that women's advocates' reporting on the positive impacts of institutions tasked to handle domestic violence in Kosovo, are persuasive evidence of the effectiveness of the protective mechanisms in Kosovo.\n[18] The United States (U.S.) Department of State (DOS) Kosovo. Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2016 reports the following on gender-based and domestic violence:\nWhen victims pressed charges, police domestic violence units conducted investigations and transferred cases to prosecutors. The rate of prosecution was low due to societal factors as well as a backlog of cases in both civil and criminal courts. Advocates and court observers argued that prosecutors and judges favored family unification over victim protection, with protective orders sometimes allowing the perpetrator to remain in the family home while the case was pending. Advocates noted that victim confidentiality was often not respected, causing further harm. Sentences were frequently lenient, ranging from judicial reprimands to imprisonment from six months to five years. 19\n[19] It was argued as a particular point of concern that according to the U.S. DOS, domestic violence was treated in Kosovan law as a civil matter unless bodily harm was found. 20 To elaborate on this issue and the other concerns raised in the U.S. DOS report, I note the Kosova Women's Network Report, which states:\nThe Criminal Code of Kosovo (CCK) does not offer a definition of domestic violence per se, though a number of criminal offences committed within a family relationship may be considered for prosecution of domestic violence acts.[...] CCK, adopted in 2012, are the definitions offered in defining the vulnerable victim and the Victim's Compensation Fund. A \"vulnerable victim\" is considered a child, a physically or mentally handicapped person, a person suffering from diminished capacity, a pregnant woman, and a domestic partner. A domestic partner is drawn from the definition of domestic relationship defined as a: relationship between two (2) persons: who are engaged or married to each other or are cohabiting with each other without marriage; who share a primary household in common and who are related by blood, marriage, or adoption or are in a guardian relationship, including parents, grandparents, children, grandchildren, siblings, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins; or who are the parents of a common child.21\nThe Criminal Code defines a number of other criminal offences committed in a domestic relationship that may be considered as a basis for criminal prosecution. However, not all domestic violence acts defined by the Law on Protection against Domestic Violence are included in the Criminal Code. The criminal offences committed in a domestic relationship that are foreseen for prosecution if committed in a domestic relationship include: light bodily injury; grievous bodily injury; harassment; assault; kidnapping; coercion; unlawful deprivation of liberty; rape, including marital rape and sexual assault; degradation of sexual integrity; sexual abuse of persons with mental or emotional disorders or disabilities in a domestic relationship; mistreating or abandoning a child; and acts of violating family obligations, including avoiding child support. In relation to a domestic relationship, criminal provisions also forbid the holding of a person in slavery, slavery-like conditions, and forced labour.22\n[20] The Criminal Code of Kosovo (CCK) does name acts that constitute domestic violence, and provides for a vulnerable victim designation and compensation fund for victims, an important element when dealing with a patriarchal society, such as Kosovo. The situation for the claimant meets the CCK's definition of a domestic violence situation, in particular that her sibling is the agent of harm, designating her as a vulnerable person in relation to the CCK. The CCK also clearly has criminal prosecution for crimes that may or may not result in bodily harm, such as forced labour, coercion and harassment. But as noted, not all domestic violence acts defined by law are included in the CCK. I find that the claimant's allegations that she is threatened with bodily harm and murder are clearly enumerated in the CCK.\n[21] Further, the CCK defines forced marriage as a crime. Article 246 states that whoever compels another person to enter into a marriage, or enters into a marriage with a person whom he or she knows to be compelled into the marriage, shall be punished by imprisonment from one to eight years.23\n[22] I find that the laws in place in Kosovo are adequate for the protection of the claimant. They clearly define her situation and the criminality of her brother's actions, and offer adequate accommodations, compensations and sentencing structures for individuals found in contravention of the laws.\n[23] The Kosova Women's Network, in the report from 2015, states that during criminal procedures, courts are competent for sentencing perpetrators of domestic violence, persons who have violated protection orders and persons who have committed a criminal offence within a family relationship. Challenges raised by this report include delays in issuing sentences in some courts; an insufficient number of judges at courts to handle the caseload (which contributes to delays); corruption; nepotism and low sentences. 24 I am not persuaded that these issues are sufficient to rebut that adequately effective protection would not forthcoming from the courts.\n[24] To be protected, the claimant fearing for her safety would likely petition the courts for a restraining order from her brother. The U.S. DOS further reports that the law permits individuals who feel threatened to petition for restraining orders, but violation of restraining orders seldom led to criminal charges. Courts rarely gave recidivists enhanced sentences as required by law. A protection order is an order issued by a municipal court, which provides protection measures for a victim of domestic violence against a perpetrator. The municipal court will review a petition for a protection order and will decide within 15 days after receiving the petition.25\n[25] According to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, a report in 2012 on Protection orders that is somewhat dated states that:\nLPDV include failures to adjudicate petitions for protection orders within mandated time limits, and to adequately distinguish between protection orders and emergency protection orders. There are also deficiencies in the form and content of the protection orders issued by the courts. [...]. Overall, Kosovo institutions are failing to meet the requisite standard of due diligence in the implementation of the legislation on a case-by-case basis. In all too many cases, the observed shortcomings are sufficiently serious that victims of domestic violence cannot be said to have had access to an effective court remedy.26\n[26] The Kastrati case was argued as evidence of the failure of the state to protect victims similar to the claimant. This case was a failure of the state; however, that was not the end of the story.\nThe Diana Kastrati ruling of the Constitutional Court is considered a ground-breaking case related to domestic violence in Kosovo because it mobilized the response of the Kosovo judiciary by requiring that cases of domestic violence, i.e. the issuance of protection orders by Kosovo courts, should be prioritized in accordance with the timelines foreseen by the Law on Protection Against Domestic Violence. Further, the Kosovo Judicial Council issued decision Nr. 22\/2012 as a result of this Constitutional Court ruling, requiring Kosovo judges to act promptly on the issuance of protection orders. This changed the initial requirements of the Kosovo Judicial Council Strategy on reduction of Backlog cases, which did not consider domestic violence cases a priority. Since then, the identification of civil court judges specialized in domestic violence was evaluated as a very positive step towards improving institutional response to domestic violence cases. Moreover, respondents mentioned the prioritization of domestic violence cases and timely response of courts in issuing Protection Orders and Emergency Protection Orders as important improvements in courts' response to domestic violence cases 27\n[27] I find that Kosovan authorities have implemented effective changes to their response to domestic violence, in particular the response of Kosovan courts in responding an issuance of protection orders. Given the current evidence, I find that the claimant would more likely than not be able to seek a protection order against her brother due to the threat of domestic violence against her.\n[28] Considering the evidence before me, in particular the evidence emanating from victim advocate groups reporting that the implementation of the laws are improving and provide a level of effective protection for those seeking protection from domestic abuse, coercion and forced marriage situations, as the claimant alleges to fear, I find that there is not sufficient, clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption that Kosovo authorities are unable or unwilling to provide protection to the claimant.\nObjectively Reasonable To Approach Kosovan Authorities\n[29] Although the mechanisms, laws and institutions are in place in Kosovo, I am mindful of the Chairperson's gender Guidelines,28 which suggest that in certain circumstances, it is reasonable that a victim of gender-based violence would be dissuaded from reporting to police.\n[30] I do recognize that the patriarchal society of Kosovo, with traditional social attitudes in the male-dominated society, has a significant impact on women being able to approach authorities. The 2015 report from the Kosova Women's Network reports that women themselves do not believe that the state should be involved in marital\/family affairs and therefore, many do not approach authorities. But, I find that the claimant has mitigating circumstances to counterbalance some of these issues.29 Many issues revolving reconciliation and family unification are not at issue, as the claimant is fearing her sibling and there are no children to consider.\n[31] The claimant's personal situation has changed since she lived in Kosovo. The claimant has been living on her own for a number of years in Canada, and she provides for herself and her children being employed as a XXXX. She is independent, albeit requiring some transportation as she currently does not drive and requires transportation to her XXXX job. She has assistance from family members and extended family friends. It is more likely than not that she would benefit from these connections in Kosovo as well. These connections have assisted her in obtaining legal representation and attending court proceedings for her refugee case. The claimant was able to reasonably communicate her situation to authorities and to this panel. The claimant was able to have persons substantiate her allegations of abuse against her brother, including her own sibling who routinely travels back to Kosovo. There was almost no evidence put forward as to the profile of her brother and how that would aggravate her ability to seek protection. She would be returning to Kosovo to re-establish her life, a recognized hardship, in particular if she were to return without her children. However, I note that the presence of legal aid and shelters provide assistance and accommodation for individuals, such as the claimant, in approaching authorities and seeking protection from abusers. On the whole of the situation for this particular claimant, I find that there are no significant impediments in her approaching authorities for protection.\n[32] Given the evidence before me, I find that the claimant has not provided sufficient, clear and convincing evidence that she would not receive adequate or effective state protection from Kosovan authorities if she were to require it. Further, I find that she would be reasonably able to approach the authorities for protection, including seeking assistance from social service providers if necessary in returning to Kosovo. On the whole of the matter, I find that state protection would be reasonably available for the claimant in returning to Kosovo.\nCONCLUSION\n[33] For the foregoing reasons, the panel finds that XXXX XXXX is not a Convention refugee as set out in section 96, nor a person in need of protection within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the Act. Therefore, her claim is rejected.\n(signed)\n\"J. Schmalzbauer\"\nJ.

On July 18, 2012, she made a claim for refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \"Act\").1\n[2] This matter was originally heard by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) on September 21, 2015 and the claim was denied. A judicial review was allowed by Federal Court on May 11, 2016. The matter was re-heard by the RPD and this decision stems from that hearing.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimant is a 24-year-old bisexual woman from Tirana. Her brother's Personal Information Form (PIF) outlines the circumstances of a blood feud their family is engaged in.2\n[4] The claimant's family has ancestral agricultural land in XXXX that was confiscated by the communists in the 1950s. When the communist regime collapsed in the 1990s, two of the claimant's uncles returned to the area to reclaim it. Neighbouring landowners with the surname XXXX claimed some of it was theirs. In 1995, the claimant's uncles obtained a decision from the land commission recognizing that their clan was the rightful owner. The XXXX refused to accept this despite the involvement of mediators. During the political turmoil in 1997 when people pilfered military arms, the XXXX became involved in criminal activities for the Democratic Party (DP) who was seeking power. The claimant's uncles moved to XXXX for safety. When the socialists rose to power, many of the XXXX left the country so the claimant's uncles returned to work the land. In 2005, when the DP returned to power, the XXXX also returned and renewed their claim on the land. Numerous physical fights broke out and the claimant's uncles were injured. No resolution could be found despite intervention from police and municipal authorities. In 2007, the claimant's uncles ceded a portion of their land to the XXXX to make peace. In 2010, the XXXX clan destroyed the claimant's uncles' crops and killed their dog.\n[5] In November 2010, the claimant's father and brother went to XXXX to help with the harvest. When returning from a tavern, they were beaten by four members of the XXXX clan resulting in several days of hospitalization. Police were called and they interviewed the claimant's father and brother and said they would investigate. When the claimant's father followed up, the police officer became angry and told him police would call if there were any results. The claimant's father believes the XXXX paid off police.\n[6] Later the same month, the XXXX set the claimant's uncle's tractor on fire. The claimant's uncle shot one of the perpetrators. He fled the country soon after. A few days later, the XXXX declared a blood feud and the claimant's male family members went into self-confinement. Mediators could not resolve the matter and the XXXX began working the land in dispute. In XXXX 2012, the claimant's brother fled to Canada.\n[7] In May 2012, the claimant and her mother were walking home when they were stopped by two men who identified themselves as being from the XXXX family. They asked where the claimant's father and brother were. They assaulted the claimant and her mother, and threatened to kill them if they did not reveal the whereabouts of their family members. The claimant and her mother went to the hospital and police were called. Although they said they would investigate, when her mother followed up, police did not take the matter seriously and said the XXXX were honourable people who would not attack women. The claimant and her mother went into hiding in XXXX.\n[8] The claimant came to Canada in XXXX 2012 and made her claim for protection. Here, she was able to act on her attraction to women. She had sex with a woman in early 2013 and another woman in July 2013. In September 2014, the claimant met XXXX and they began a relationship that lasted until January 2016, when XXXX had sex reassignment surgery.\n[9] The claimant fears that if she returns to Albania, she will face persecution and other risks from the XXXX family and because she is bisexual.\nDETERMINATION\n[10] I find that the claimant is not a Convention refugee as she does not have a well-founded fear of persecution related to a Convention ground in Albania. I also find that the claimant is not a person in need of protection, in that her removal to Albania would not subject her personally to a risk to life, or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. There are also no substantial grounds to believe that her removal to Albania would subject her personally to a danger of torture for the reasons that follow.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[11] The claimant's identity as a national of Albania is established by her testimony and national identity card, birth certificate and family certificate evidence.3 I am satisfied of her identity by these documents.\nCredibility\n[12] At the hearing, the claimant was unable to offer much information about the blood feud, because she stated most things happened when she was a child and she does not know the details. Given that the claimant left Albania at the age of 20, she was a small child for many of these incidents. She also lived in Tirana, whereas the incidents took place in XXXX. I accept that she may not know the history of the blood feud. However, she was able to provide consistent testimony about the assault she experienced by people who identified themselves as the XXXX. This allegation is corroborated by a medical report in evidence.4 Based on the presumption of truthfulness, the claimant's uncontradicted testimony and the medial report, I accept that her family is involved in a blood feud with the XXXX.\n[13] The claimant was unable to provide information about the XXXX. She does not know any of their names or occupations. She believes they may be involved in farming. She could only state that they are well known, powerful and have money. She could provide no specific information to support their notoriety, power or wealth. While this does not undermine her credibility, it has implications for the state protection analysis, as will be discussed.\n[14] In terms of the claimant's sexual identity, I also accept that she is bisexual. She was able to discuss her long-term relationship and breakup in detail. She corroborated her participation in the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex (LGBTI) community with letters from related associations who state she has been a volunteer for a few years.5 Her doctor confirms the claimant has spoken to him about her sexuality.6\n[15] Overall, I find the claimant to be credible.\nState Protection\n[16] In this case, the claimant has not rebutted the presumption that there is adequate state protection in Albania. The presumption of state protection refers to the expectation that a refugee claimant seek assistance from authorities unless he or she offers \"clear and convincing\" proof of the state's inability to provide protection.7 Where it is alleged that state protection is inadequate, a claimant must demonstrate with reliable evidence that the state is unable to protect him or her, or that it was objectively unreasonable to seek state protection in the circumstances. Without compelling reasons for a claimant's failure to pursue state protection, a refugee claim will not succeed, nor will subjective reluctance to properly engage the state adequately explain the failure to so do.8\n[17] The burden of proof to rebut the presumption of state protection is directly proportionate to the level of democracy in the state in question.9 Claimants from democratic countries will have a \"heavy burden\" when attempting to show that they should not be required to exhaust all of the resources available to them domestically before claiming refugee status in Canada.10 The more democratic a country, the greater the expectation that one would go to the authorities, and if not helped initially, that they would take their concerns to a higher level or to a different authority. A claimant must show that they have taken all reasonable steps in the circumstances to seek protection.11\n[18] In this case, the claimant's brother's PIF indicates that the police investigation into the November 2010 assault yielded no results. The claimant is unaware whether her uncles reported specific crimes to police as opposed to reporting the land dispute. She also maintained that after her May 2012 assault, police came to the hospital and interviewed her and her mother. But, her mother was brushed off when she tried to follow up on the investigation later in 2012. The claimant believes police were inattentive because she is a woman. There is no other evidence of any other reports to police. The claimant was not living as a bisexual in Albania and therefore, had no related incidents to report to police.\n[19] I do not find that the claimant's family's two complaints to police demonstrate a failure of state protection. There is no evidence that the claimant's parents or brother made any efforts to complain to a higher ranking officer or internal affairs department. There is no evidence that they submitted a report to the prosecutor's office, the ombudsman or the commissioner for protection from discrimination (for assistance with gender discrimination concerns) about police misconduct. I find that they were obliged to complain if they were dissatisfied with the response they received from police. They did not adequately test state protection by reasonably engaging the state.\n[20] The claimant also argued that she could not obtain adequate state protection from the XXXX because they are wealthy and powerful. However, she could not support this belief with any specific information about them. I have insufficient evidence before me to find that the XXXX have sufficient wealth or influence over police to subvert her state protection efforts. Her brother's PIF states that the committed criminal acts for the DP. There is no evidence that they continue to have political connections more than 20 years later or that any such connections would be willing and able to assist the XXXX. The fact that one police officer told her mother that the XXXX are an honourable family does not adequately establish this. One officer's view does not represent a wholesale failure of the entire Albanian law enforcement system. Refusal to provide protection at the local level does not constitute broader refusal to provide protection.12 Moreover, this is one officer among thousands in the country, many of whom may take a different view.\n[21] It was submitted for the claimant that the failure of police to bring the XXXX to justice demonstrates a failure of state protection. I find that successful arrest, detention and conviction is not the test for state protection; a failure of state protection cannot be founded on a failure to bring a perpetrator to justice.13 State protection must be assessed on the basis of whether the state has the capacity to provide protection, rather than whether the local apparatus provided protection in a given circumstance.14 In Albania, the evidence demonstrates that the state has the capacity to provide state protection, particularly given the advancements in the last five years since the claimant left the country, as will be discussed.\n[22] It was argued that homosexuals face discrimination, harassment, mistreatment and violence in Albania. Indeed, Albania is a conservative society in which homophobia is strong. I do not doubt that sexual minorities face problems in Albania. However, the fact that sexual minorities experience problems does not in itself demonstrate that they are not also afforded adequate state protection. The test is not whether crimes against LGBTI people occur or how homophobic Albania is. Again, the question is Albania's capacity to provide protection from this.\n[23] Submissions were also made concerning societal attitudes and homophobic statements made five years ago by Albanian politicians. I am unable to indict the Albanian justice system based on hateful comments made by a couple of politicians. Politicians in North America have been criticized for homophobic attitudes. Various politicians in Europe have made appalling comments about minority groups.\n[24] An analysis of Albanian laws reveals a liberal policy shift towards LGBTI issues. According to the Astrea Lesbian Foundation for Justice:\nIn the last five years, the Albanian government has passed some of the most progressive LGBTI protections in the Western Balkans, and its public officials have demonstrated a unique willingness and ability to partner with LGBTI activists to pass reforms. The LGBTI community in Albania celebrated several encouraging advances in 2015.15\nReform in Albania has been sharp, which does not negate its legitimacy. As such, one must examine the most recent evidence to capture what has transpired in Albania for the LGBTI community. If we consider the legal strides made in Canada by the transgender community only in the last three years, notwithstanding some social opposition, this is reasonable.\n[25] Anti-discrimination laws in Albania expressly protect LGBTI persons and make hate crimes a criminal offence. The Home Office states in its August 2016 document on the topic that in May 2015, parliament approved a resolution on the protection of rights and freedoms of persons belonging to the LGBTI community.16 It calls for an action plan, further legislative amendments and other measures in support of LGBTI persons, and makes the ombudsman responsible for monitoring its implementation.\n[26] In accordance with the resolution, the Home Office reports that in July 2015, the Ministry of Social Welfare and Youth of Albania held the largest consultative meeting on LGBTI rights with the participation of one international expert, two national experts, all LGBTI organizations in the country, more than 30 human rights organizations and all relevant ministries and equality bodies to present and provide input on the action plan for non-discrimination of LGBTI people for 2015-2020.17 It was submitted for the claimant that LGBTI laws and policies are not actually implemented. However, in May 2016, the Council Of Ministers adopted the National Plan of Action and in August 2016, an order of the prime minister established the National Group of Implementation and Coordination to implement the action plan.18 The action plan seeks to improve the legal and institutional framework for protecting LGBTI persons, eliminate all forms of discrimination and improve access to employment, education, health and housing services.\n[27] In reference to violence by police against the LGBTI community, and violence at the gay pride parade five years ago, the Home Office finds that \"there are no longer reports that the Albanian police ill-treat known members of LGBT associations.\"19 According to the Department of State (DOS), at the last gay pride parade and diversity festival there were no violent incidents and \"police ensured activists' safety.\"20 The DOS outlines other noteworthy evidence that signals change in Albania, including a television spot on family equality rights, public recognition of 30 people who supported the LGBTI cause, the opening of an LGBTI shelter and a job placement company's release of an LGBTI employment equality index that rates the compliance of private companies with recruitment laws that protect sexual orientation.\n[28] The Home Office goes on to state that there are protections in law, avenues of redress and non-governmental (NGO) LGBTI organizations can assist a complainant. From its research, the Home Office concludes that \"effective protection is generally available for sexual minorities.\" Cases of discrimination can be brought to the Commissioner for Protection from Discrimination who has authority to issue sanctions and has done so in several cases. The Home Office indicates that the commissioner has registered complaints from LGBTI individuals and organizations and issued \"appropriate sanctions.\" It states that the law allows the commissioner to testify in court as an expert witness, and she has participated in many judicial proceedings.\n[29] A Response to Information Request (RIR) discusses older cases of discrimination against sexual minorities managed by the commissioner and the sanctions applied in the past.21 In two cases, politicians from two political parties were found guilty of discrimination. When they refused to apologize for their anti-gay statements and commit to refraining from similar actions, the commissioner imposed fines. Thus, while a few politicians may have used anti-gay rhetoric there are mechanisms to address it. Although it was submitted that the Commissioner's response was insufficient, I am unclear on what would be adequate, particularly if we consider the sanctions available to human rights bodies in Canada.\n[30] The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association's (ILGA) 2016 annual review of the human rights situation for LGBTI people in Albania summarizes its findings by stating \"the LGBTI community in Albania celebrated several encouraging advances in 2015. The collaborative spirit generated by the extensive 2015-2020 action plan discussions with various ministries gave LGBTI activists a confidence boost.\"22 The ILGA makes several observations about the progress made beyond the parliamentary LGBTI resolution, for which all but two members of parliament voted to approve. This includes the Ministry of Education signing an agreement that allows NGOs to hold lectures, presentations and other awareness-raising activities in high schools on LGBTI issues, including bullying. The Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Social Welfare and Youth sent recommendations to parliament to allow for gender-neutral cohabitation, and to recognize the rights of same-sex couples in relation to property, inheritance, health and social insurance. The actions of these law-makers is highly encouraging.\n[31] On review of the evidence, I do not find that there is \"clear and convincing\" proof of inadequate state protection in Albania for the LGBTI community. The country has undergone a period of transition and reform that has improved state protection and that is addressing corruption in the country. The progress made in strengthening democracy and criminal justice demonstrates that reforms for LGBTI issues will be implemented effectively. In my view, this also translates into adequate protection against blood feuds as Albania has a strong framework for law enforcement and criminal justice and is working to address corruption. There have been numerous reforms in Albania since the claimant left the country in 2012.\n[32] Albania is a parliamentary democracy. The World Bank states that Albania is a middle-income country that has \"made enormous strides in establishing a credible, multi-party democracy and market economy over the last two decades.\"23 In 2012, the European Union's (EU) European Commission recommended that Albania be granted EU candidate status, subject\nto completion of key measures in the areas of judicial and public administration reform, and revision of the parliamentary rules of procedures. Albania fulfilled this condition; in June 2014, Albania was awarded official candidate status by the EU. This status signifies a fairly high level of democracy. The European Commission acknowledges that while steady progress is being made, additional efforts are still required. Regarding corruption, the European Commission states that:\nThe number of corruption-related cases referred to the prosecution service has increased. However, the number of cases being brought before the courts remains low, even though it increased by 82% in 2014 compared to the cases sent to court in 2013. The number of final convictions involving junior or middle-ranking officials has nearly doubled in the first half of 2015, compared to the same period of the previous year. In 2015, there has been one first instance conviction of a corruption case involving a mayor and one conviction at appeal court level of a judge on corruption related grounds. The General Prosecutor's Office dismissed a prosecutor for a corruption-related offence.\nThe performance of the High Inspectorate for the Declaration and Audit of Assets and Prevention of Conflicts of Interest (HIDAACI) improved considerably. In 2014, the inspectorate referred 74 cases to the prosecution service, out of which 25 were sent to court. In 2015, HIDAACI sent 82 referrals to the prosecution service, out of which five were sent to court. These referrals resulted in three prison sentences and 17 penalties. Among the HIDAACI referrals are twelve judges, two prosecutors and six members of parliament. Sound follow-up to referrals by the inspectorate, including a track-record of successful prosecution and final convictions, has yet to be demonstrated. In 2014, the inspectorate imposed 400 administrative sanctions, and 420 in 2015.\nThe Council of Ministers' Internal Administrative Control and Anti-Corruption Unit (UIACA) carried out 20 administrative checks in 2014, which have led to 39 disciplinary measures and 3 criminal referrals. In 2015, UIACA carried out 117 administrative checks, which have led to 46 recommendations for disciplinary and administrative measures, and four criminal referrals. UIACA's recommendations have been implemented overall.24\n[33] The conviction of a mayor and a judge, the numerous corruption cases referred for prosecution and the sanctions and the prison sentences for corruption cases demonstrate that the government is applying laws to combat corruption and that this is yielding results.\n[34] In terms of efforts to improve police accountability, an RIR in evidence finds that one can file a report against police with the Professional Standards Department of the General Directorate, the Albanian People's Advocate (ombudsman), the prosecutor's office, the Service for Internal Affairs and Complaints, the Internal Control Service or any police station.25 Misconduct can be reported in person, to a toll free-number, online or by a special \"app\" that accepts government misconduct complaints. The ombudsman is known for being an active and outspoken defender. The RIR states that as early as 2010, 61 criminal complaints involving 111 police officers, including 28 supervisors and one mid-level manager, were referred for prosecution. In addition, 25 police officers were arrested on charges of corruption and misuse of authority. It should be noted that this was accomplished prior to the reform package introduced over the last few years.\n[35] According to the Council of Europe, efforts to eradicate and prevent unlawful activities and corruption among law enforcement have also yielded results. This is reflected by the recent dismissal of 81 out of the 105 staff members of the police office in Tirana and the initiation of criminal proceedings against 11 of them following an investigation.26\n[36] An RIR in evidence indicates that low salaries for police officers has been a factor influencing corruption in police practices, as well as poor motivation, leadership and a lack of diversity.27 It states that bribes for not issuing citations are commonplace. However, salaries were reportedly increased. Albanian law on state police was amended in September 2014 to provide for the creation of a National Bureau of Investigation tasked with investigating corruption-related offences. The RIR reports that a national anti-corruption strategy was adopted by the Albanian Council of Ministers for 2008-2013 with the aim of addressing the problem of corruption at the political and sectoral level. This was followed by a national plan from 2009-2014 that formed two agencies that aim to eliminate police corruption.\n[37] Sources cited in the RIR refer to Albania's \"concerted effort to improve the country's law enforcement and security infrastructure and reduce corruption\" and that its law enforcement capabilities \"continue to improve.\"28 It cites the replacement of a number of prison officials and police commanders, and the disbandment of several police units, including the traffic unit, to combat corruption. The sources consulted in the RIR state that complaints made against police are \"routinely investigated.\" In 2013, 134 criminal charges involving 170 police personnel were referred to the prosecutor. Twenty-three police personnel were immediately detained or arrested, and punitive measures ranged from expulsion to imprisonment. Corruption reports and referrals to the prosecutor continue to increase, thereby reflecting a will to hold police accountable.\n[38] The United States (U.S.) DOS report on human rights describes the gains made in Albania.29 However, it finds that police do not always enforce the law equally and indeed, personal associations can influence the enforcement of law. That said, the DOS finds that the government has mechanisms to investigate and punish abuse and corruption by officials. Authorities made efforts to address these problems by increasing salaries, renovating police facilities, upgrading vehicles, introducing the use of in-car and body cameras and publicly highlighting anticorruption measures. According to the DOS, while impunity remains a problem, the government has made \"greater efforts\" to address it by, for example, using camera evidence to prosecute police misconduct.\n[39] The DOS states that the government's Service for Internal Affairs and Complaints conducts audits, responds to complaints and carries out investigations with an increased emphasis on human rights and adherence to standard operating procedures. This office managed over 2,000 complaints and in the first three-quarters of last year, authorities dealt with 34 cases involving 46 officers as administrative violations and handled eight cases involving eight officers as criminal offenses, forwarding them for prosecution. It confirms that the ombudsman also handles complaints against police.\n[40] The DOS finds that the Ministry of Justice initiated disciplinary proceedings against eight judges; it dismissed one, suspended another and transferred one to a different jurisdiction. A judge was also ordered suspended and was later charged with receiving a bribe. It states that:\nIn July the Assembly unanimously approved constitutional amendments to approve a sweeping reform of the judiciary that included the creation of new anticorruption institutions. These included establishing an independent prosecutor's office and investigation unit, the sole responsibility of which will be the investigation and prosecution of high-level corruption and organized crime. In August the Assembly approved a law on vetting aimed at reducing corruption among prosecutors and judges. The government also expanded the use of body cameras on police officers to deter street-level corruption.30\n[41] The DOS notes that prosecutors made \"significant progress\" in pursuing low-level public corruption cases, including corrupt prosecutors and judges, though prosecution of higher-level crimes remains more elusive. A former labour minister was sentenced to prison for misappropriation of funds, and a mayor was removed from his position for soliciting sexual favours in exchange for employment; a decision upheld on appeal. Other instances of public officials, including ministers and senior officials, being fined and having cases sent for prosecution are discussed.\n[42] In a report on trafficking, the DOS finds that the government improved law enforcement efforts by convicting more traffickers than in 2014. But, the government and non-government organizations identified fewer victims and the government prosecuted fewer suspected traffickers than in 2014.31\n[43] The OSAC 2016 Crime & Safety Report finds that violent crime has seen a continual decrease over the last five years as police and security forces continue to achieve success in combating illegal weapons and the drug trade. This sustained improvement in crime illustrates the impact of Albania's reform. The report states:\nThe government is making a concerted effort to improve the country's law enforcement and reduce corruption and has improved the country's law enforcement and security institutions in the last few years. Police have a visible presence throughout Tirana and other larger cities. However, their response is often delayed due to limited resources and manpower. However, police tend to respond more rapidly when contacted by members of the international community. One concern regarding police performance is their low salaries and the resulting potential for corruption. Regardless, law enforcement capabilities continue to improve, especially in the areas of counter-narcotics and organized crime training.32\n[44] Freedom House finds that in 2015, Albania went through a series of reforms and law enforcement operations aimed at strengthening the rule of law and bringing the country closer to the European Union. It states that while justice reform was high on the agenda in 2015, reforms need to go further. About the year 2016, Freedom House states:\nAlmost three years after taking office, the government sustained its drive for crucial reforms and countrywide operations. Judicial reform will remain a top priority and the government will seek a cross-party consensus for a sustainable outcome. The decentralization process is set to start at the beginning of 2016. Law enforcement will continue to carry out major operations, which are expected to improve the rule of law and benefit the state budget.33\nFreedom House notes specific gains made in the battle against corruption. During 2015, parliament lifted the immunity of three members of parliament (MPs) who had been accused of serious charges, including a false murder plot claim, intentional serious injury and murder. Furthermore, a former cabinet minister was charged with abuse of office, and another MP was accused of destruction of property and illegal construction. In 2014, five municipality mayors and 16 commune mayors were under prosecution. The inspector for monitoring assets and conflicts of interest referred 12 judges for prosecution, including the head judge of the Tirana Appellate Court over asset declaration-related offenses and suspicions of money laundering. The inspector in charge of monitoring assets and conflict of interest referred six MPs, 12 judges and two prosecutors for prosecution in 2015. Some of the MPs were charged with concealing income, fictitious contracts and bank transfers, in some cases worth between 1.5 and 14 million euros. Prosecutors also received referrals from the High State Audit for cases of abuse of office or public tenders, though only a few were investigated and there have not yet been any convictions. I find this to be evidence of the operational effectiveness of anti-corruption measures, even against high-level officials. The state clearly has an appetite for holding corrupt officials to account.\n[45] The United Nations (UN) Office on Drugs and Crime reviewed Albania's implementation of articles under the UN Convention against Corruption in a detailed analysis and presentation of data. It concludes that Albania has \"several competent bodies in the fight against corruption,\" including specialized directorates and units dealing with corruption and economic crimes established at prosecution offices and the state police, both at the central and local level.34 The report states that the General Directorate for the Prevention of Money Laundering also plays an important role in the fight against money-laundering and corruption. It notes that the government is currently in the process of drafting the national strategy and action plan against corruption.\n[46] As far as judges and prosecutors are concerned, Albania has embarked on a fundamental constitutional and justice system reform, which if endorsed, would not only overhaul the entire judicial set-up, but also affect all sitting judges and prosecutors by subjecting them to an \"unprecedented vetting procedure.\"35 This prospect is highly encouraging.\n[47] The United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) observes various advances made in terms of human trafficking, gender violence, child protection, discrimination against minorities, blood feuds, organized crime and anti-corruption.36 In another document, the Special Rapporteur for the UNHRC identifies the need for more research and policy advances on blood feuds, but acknowledges Albania's efforts to change the mentality that causes blood feuds through education in schools and by training judges.37 He commends the Albanian police for adopting a regularly-updated, country-wide database to track all persons directly affected by blood feuds to which the prosecutor, courts and ombudsman all have access. He refers to \"significant measures\" to address gender-based violence, including the 2011-2015 national strategy, creation of specialized units, enhancement of shelter capacity and media campaigns. Some training of judges, prosecutors and police officers on gender issues has also taken place.\n[48] The special rapporteur notes that the national strategy on gender equality, violence against women and domestic violence is being implemented, and he identifies a change in attitudes among police towards domestic violence resulting from the training. Finally, he refers to the restriction of immunity from criminal investigation and prosecution of all elected officials, including MPs, members of government, the ombudsman and other high-level officials and judges as an important development.\n[49] According to the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights, various strategic documents and pieces of legislation concerning the justice system have been adopted in recent years. He states that the most important development was the adoption of a comprehensive justice reform strategy and action plan.38 Furthermore, he states that amendments to the constitution limiting immunity by members of the judiciary have, in fact, produced positive results. The commissioner makes various observations and recommendations about Albanian law enforcement and the justice system, and these are addressed by the Albania government in a corresponding report.39\n[50] The United Kingdom's Home Office concludes from its 2016 analysis of the research that the Albanian government \"has made significant efforts in recent years to address the issue of blood feuds and has created legislative, organizational and operational processes to tackle the phenomenon and \"state protection is generally available\" for blood feuds.40 It credits the government for taking the following steps: better policing, specific criminalization of blood feuds and blood feud killings, the creation of specialized police units and the establishment of a high-level coordination committee. It states that there are \"effective avenues for submitting a complaint against police for misconduct.\"41 Police officers are receiving training on issues related to vulnerable groups, and the Commissioner for Protection from Discrimination participated in the drafting of the curriculum.\n[51] Notwithstanding the annual advances in state protection described, most sources in evidence maintain that corruption and impunity are still problems and Albania must continue its reform measures. I have considered Albania's failures, its efforts and results and in my view, the evidence on state protection is not sufficient to overcome the claimant's responsibility to seek it out more exhaustively. The implementation of criminal justice reform I have described demonstrates that the legal advances in relation to blood feuds and LGBTI protections will also be implemented. I cannot conclude that the claimant is unlikely to get adequate state protection given the operational successes that have taken place. In Marqeshi42 the Federal Court upheld the finding that state protection in Albania is adequate at the operational level. While protection in Albania may not be as robust as Canada, it is not at a level that relieves the claimant of her duty to pursue it exhaustively as supported by several recent state protection cases concerning Albania.43\n[52] Both the Chairperson's Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression (SOGIE),44 and Gender Guidelines45 are applicable in this case. I have considered whether the claimant's sexual orientation and gender would hamper her ability to seek and obtain state protection, but find insufficient evidence that this is the case. The landscape in Albania has improved a great deal since the claimant left the country five years ago, and I find that she is likely to obtain adequate state protection against the blood feud and mistreatment resulting from her sexual identity or gender.\nCONCLUSION\n[53] Having considered all of the evidence, I find that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee as set out in section 96, nor a person in need of protection within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the Act. Her claim is therefore, denied.\n(signed)\n\"Preeti Adhopia\"\nPreeti Adhopia\nAugust 1, 2017\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibit 2.2.\n3 Exhibit 1.1 and Exhibit 8.\n4 Exhibit 7.\n5 Exhibit 4 and Exhibit 9.\n6 Exhibit 9.\n7 Canada (Attorney General) v.

Flynn\nConseil du ministre\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] These are the reasons for the decision in the application made by the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness pursuant to section 108 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \"Act\")1 to have the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (the Board) determine that the refugee protection of XXXX XXXX (the \"respondent\") has ceased. An oral hearing of this application was conducted by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) on July 4, 2017.\n[2] The Minister for Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness has brought an application to the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) under Section 108 of the Act, applying for the protection of the respondent to be ceased as per section 108(1)(a) of the Act as he has voluntarily re-availed himself of the protection of his country of nationality, Afghanistan.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] The panel finds that the respondent has shown a voluntary intent to re-avail himself of the protection of his country of nationality and therefore, the Minister's application is accepted.\nANALYSIS\nCanadian Legislation for Cessation\n[4] The Minister for Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness is arguing that protection considerations have ceased under section 108 of the Act. This section refers to a claim for refugee protection may be rejected and a person found not to be a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection in certain circumstances. This section of the Act outlines a number of circumstances that may cause an application to be brought by the Minister. In this particular application, the Minister is arguing under section 108(1)(a), that the person in question has voluntarily availed himself of the protection of their country of nationality. The Minister made no arguments in regards to other sections in section 108. Therefore, the panel will solely determine the Minister's application on this section of the Act.\n108(1)(a) - Voluntary Re-Availment of the Protection of the Country of Nationality\nRestrictive Approach to the Definition of Re-availment\n[5] A restrictive interpretation of the definition of re-availment must be made when determining that protection needs have ceased for an individual. The panel notes that a return to the country of nationality, in the context of determining a voluntary intent to re-avail, can be seen as evidence of intent or be seen as being in receipt of protection. But on the whole, in the context of section 108(1)(a), whether a person has voluntarily re-availed himself of the protection of his country, return in of itself is not decisive.\n[6] Guiding jurisprudence from the Canadian courts has provided some direction on the interpretation and application of section 108. Of particular note to the issue of re-availment, having a separate analysis from re-establishment is the Cadena Federal Court decision.2 Justice Shore found that re-establishment and the intention to re-establish is not the test when determining re-availment, that under section 108(1)(a) of the Act, it is the intention to re-avail themselves to the protection of the authorities that issued the passport, not the intention to re-establish in the country of origin. In the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Handbook, the distinction is made by referring to the diplomatic protection that is being sought by the refugee when looking at re-availment.3 The guidelines speak of the notion of the diplomatic protection, which principally relates to the actions that a state is entitled to undertake against another state in order to obtain redress, specifically when one of its nationals have been violated or threatened by the latter state. In the Federal Court decision of Nsende, the Federal Court had further stated that the presumption of re-availment is particularly strong where a refugee uses his national passport to travel to his country of nationality.4 It has even been suggested that this is conclusive.\n[7] In the decision of Abadi, it was stated that an intention to re-establish oneself in one's country of nationality should not be confused with the intention to re-avail oneself of that country's diplomatic protection. Further, it stated that although it was argued that the he had considered himself a permanent resident and had no intention of re-establishing himself in Iran, this fact did not detract from his voluntary acquisition of an Iranian passport and his re-availment of Iran's diplomatic protection by using it to travel to Iran via other countries on two occasions.5\n[8] In consideration of the UNHCR interpretive handbook and guidelines, and also the jurisprudence on the matter, the return to one's country is evidence that is supplemental to an argument of intention of ones re-availment and the required receipt of that protection from the country of nationality. The question under section 108(1)(a) is a single issue of whether or not a person has approached authorities while in Canada for diplomatic protection, whether they have done so in a voluntary manner, whether they obtained protection and why they have obtained it. The facts surrounding whether or not a person has returned to their country of nationality is not necessarily fatal when determining if the protection needs of a refugee have ceased.\nFacts of the Case\n[9] The basis of the Minister's application is that the respondent has re-availed himself of the protection of Afghanistan, due to the fact that he obtained in 2012, an Afghanistan passport and travelled five times on that passport, including four trips to Afghanistan. The Minister does not allege that any of the other potential grounds for cessation enumerated in section 108 applies to the respondent's circumstances.\n[10] The main facts of this application are clear and not in dispute. The Minister bases her application on the following facts that the respondent admitted to during his sworn testimony:\na. The respondent entered Canada as a government sponsored refugee XXXX XXXX, 2003 and became a permanent resident.6\nb. The respondent applied for and was issued an Afghanistan national passport on XXXX XXXX, 2012.\nc. The respondent used this passport to travel to Afghanistan XXXX XXXX, 2012, XXXX XXXX, 2014 and XXXX XXXX, 2014.7 He remained in Afghanistan from 2-6 weeks on his returns to Afghanistan.\nd. The respondent had travelled on his Afghanistan passport on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and XXXX XXXX, 2017.8\n[11] The respondent provided sworn testimony at the oral hearing. The respondent testified that he had obtained his passport as he wanted to return to Afghanistan to be married. He testified that he had fault in this as he was advised by his counsel at that time that to travel back to Afghanistan, he could apply for a passport at the embassy in Ottawa. The respondent states now that had he known that he could not do so, he would not have gotten the passport.\n[12] The respondent testified that he had travelled back to Afghanistan to be married in 2012, then to visit his wife and had travelled another time in order to attend his father-in-law's funeral. He had returned a fourth time in a single trip to escort his wife to and from India for their interview for the pending sponsorship application. He testified that he had no intention of remaining there as he had his life in Canada.\n[13] It is undisputed that the respondent obtained an Afghanistan passport and that he travelled back to Afghanistan in 2012 to be married. He further travelled back to Afghanistan three more times. At issue is whether the respondent has sufficiently rebutted the presumption that obtaining this passport and returning to Afghanistan is evidence of a voluntary intention to avail himself of the protection of Afghan authorities from persecution he feared when he was determined to be a Convention refugee.\n[14] Thus, the questions, as set out in the UNHCR Handbook and in the decision of Nsende, for the panel to determine are:\na. Did the respondent act voluntarily? (Voluntariness)\nb. Did the respondent intend by his action to re-avail himself of the protection of the country of his nationality? (Intention)\nc. Did the respondent actually obtain such protection? (Re-availment)9\nVoluntariness of the Act\n[15] The UNHCR Handbook speaks to circumstances when a refugee has acted voluntarily. With respect to the voluntariness of a refugee's actions, the UNHCR Handbook states at paragraph 120:\nHe may also be constrained, by circumstances beyond his control, to have recourse to a measure of protection from his country of nationality. He may, for instance, need to apply for a divorce in his home country because no other divorce may have the necessary international recognition. Such an act cannot be considered to be a \"voluntary re-availment of protection\" and will not deprive a person of refugee status.10\n[16] The UNHCR guidelines on cessation further clarifies voluntariness, if the refugee is compelled to act by circumstances beyond his or her control. The guidelines speaks about whether or not the refugee has truly acted out of his own free will in approaching the authorities of his country of origin.11 The guidance when looking at the voluntariness of an individual when approaching authorities the reasons for which must be analyzed, that the fact that someone was a refugee does not automatically preclude someone from approaching authorities and the panel returns to the UNHCR guidelines stating that a well-balanced approach be taken when depriving a person of their refugee status.\n[17] The respondent requested and received a passport and returned four times to his country of nationality, Afghanistan.\n[18] The motivations of a person in contacting authorities must be assessed with due care in order to establish for what purpose was the contact made. The panel notes that a distinction must be made between contacting authorities for the purpose of obtaining protection and whether authorities were contacted with other purposes in mind.12 Applications for extension or issuance of a national passport do imply an intention to entrust one's protection interests to their country of nationality. As the guidelines stipulate, the key issue is the intent: for what purpose was the passport obtained or renewed? In Chandrakumar, the Court found that an error is committed if the Court has failed to explore the motivations of the persons concerned in applying for a renewal or issuance of a passport. The Court must go beyond the act of application and determine the requisite intent.13\n[19] The guidelines in applying these provisions state that contacting authorities for certain civil documents can rebut the presumption of voluntary intent. The respondent chose to return to Afghanistan. He chose to do so voluntarily in order to be married. The respondent could have chosen alternative means to obtain this marriage, including a third party location, such as India or Pakistan, to be married. He could have chosen to have had a marriage by proxy, which at that time was recognized by Canada as a legal and valid marriage. However, the respondent chose to acquire a passport and travel on that passport to Afghanistan. The respondent's intention in acquiring the passport was to return to Afghanistan and had voluntarily done so when there were other reasonable avenues in which the respondent could have been married or see his wife, rather than travelling back to his country of origin.\n[20] It was argued that the respondent's limited education and poor advice from his previous counsel were factors that would invalidate the respondent's intent or motivation in obtaining his passport and returning to Afghanistan. The respondent may have limited formal education; however, he has been in Canada for 14 years. He is skillfully employed and he is surrounded by family members that are highly educated. Further, it was the respondent's own choices to approach Afghan authorities, and it was his choice to return multiple times to Afghanistan. As noted previously, applications for and issuances of national passports do imply an intention to entrust one's protection interests to their country of nationality. I am persuaded that the respondent is ultimately culpable for his decisions taken and that his decisions were based on the respondent's own wants, rather than any duress in having to return to Afghanistan.\n[21] I do find that the respondent did voluntarily choose to approach Afghan authorities for diplomatic protection by applying for, receiving and utilizing the passport for numerous international travels.\nRe-availment\n[22] According to the UNHCR guidelines, attempts or unsuccessful attempts would not lead to cessation, but when those requests are granted, then protection is de facto extended and therefore, established.\n[23] The question of whether the respondent actually obtained protection is not in contention. The respondent has conceded that he had applied for and acquired an Afghanistan passport in order to return to Afghanistan. The respondent also used that passport to travel numerous times.\n[24] The respondent submitted that it was his belief, from advice from his previous counsel, that this was the way to travel back to Afghanistan as he had asked for advice in this matter and was told it would be \"okay.\" I note that the respondent would not have been authorized to travel to Afghanistan with a refugee travel document and therefore, his only option to travel to his country of origin was an Afghan passport. Although the respondent may not have had full disclosure, the respondent made his own decision to return to Afghanistan. The evidence before the panel is that he had no issue in obtaining a passport and he has used this passport in order to return to Afghanistan. The panel is satisfied that the respondent was in receipt of diplomatic protection at the time his passport was issued. Further, he had been travelling under the protection of the Afghan government on his subsequent travels to India.\n[25] The panel, as noted previously, must determine from these facts presented whether the respondent's motivation or intention in contacting authorities was undertaken for the purpose of obtaining protection. There are a number of factors to be considered when analyzing the intent of an individual. The first is what motivated the respondent to apply for his passport. Secondly, in returning to Afghanistan with that passport, was the respondent's purpose to obtain protection and had he returned with such intent?\n[26] The respondent's intent was to return to Afghanistan to establish his relationship with his partner, marry and visit her. The respondent in his previous interviews at the Canadian port of entry, had identified he had no fears of the risks in returning to Afghanistan.14 At the hearing, he had testified that at that time everything was stable in Afghanistan and his father-in-law said it would be ok to return. The numerous documents attesting to the respondent's establishment and character in Canada is of little value in this assessment.15 The intention of the respondent to re-establish himself in Afghanistan is not of issue. The respondent intended to return to Afghanistan and to remain openly; presenting himself in public for family events and visitations.\n[27] Did the respondent contact the authorities with the intention to avail himself of the protection of the authorities, the panel finds that he did. The respondent had made the choice to contact authorities, apply for and use the passport in returning to Afghanistan numerous times. The returns were for weeks at a time and there was no attempt to hide his Afghan nationality, including when he and his wife had travelled to India for their interview with Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC). The respondent's particular circumstances have not sufficiently rebutted the presumption created when he had contacted officials for the passport and returned to his country of origin.\n[28] Considering the facts of this case and the respondent's explanations of why he had re-availed, on the whole of the matter, I find that the respondent did voluntary intend to re-avail himself to Afghan authorities and was in receipt of that protection.\nCONCLUSION\n[29] The panel finds that the respondent has sufficiently rebutted the presumption that he had intended to re-avail himself of the protection of his former country of nationality. Considering the forgoing, the panel has determined that the Minister's application to have the respondent's refugee protection ceased is allowed.\n(signed)\n\"Jodie Schmalzbauer\"\nJodie Schmalzbauer\nJuly 10, 2017\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Cadena, Sandra Luz Cabrera v.

The panel also finds that there is no sufficient evidence to establish that the principal claimant is not a person in need of protection, in that his removal Somalia would subject him personally to a risk to life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. There are not substantial grounds to believe that his removal to Somalia will subject the principal claimant personally to a danger of torture for the reasons that follow.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The following is a brief synopsis of the allegations that the claimant put forth in their Personal Information Forms (PIFs).2 The claimants allege that as a result of extortion against the principal claimant's business, the claimants fled Mogadishu in 2010. The claimants allege that al-Shabaab members would continue to target them if they returned. The claimants also submitted that as members of the XXXX clan, a sub-clan of the Digil, that they could be targeted by the larger, stronger clans in Mogadishu.\n[5] The claimants resided in XXXX Nairobi before raising enough finances to cover the cost of a smuggler for two years. The claimants arrived on fraudulent Italian passports to the United States (U.S.) in 2012. The smuggler then took them to Canada. The principal claimant testified that he wanted to be safe and the smuggler had made their final destination decision. They made their claim for protection which was referred to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (the \"Board\") on August 3, 2012.\n[6] At the hearing, the claimants submitted that given their significant residence in Canada over the past five years that they would be targeted by individuals within Mogadishu for perceived wealth and Western influence. In particular the children, who have spent much of their youth outside Somalia and the past five years in Canada, resulting in them losing much of the Somali language. It was also submitted that they would be unable to establish their lives, resulting in persecution due to their absence from Somalia similar to other displaced persons in Mogadishu.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[7] The panel is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the claimants are nationals of Somalia. The principal claimant testified in a genuine, detailed and credible manner as to the family's life and circumstances in Mogadishu. The principal claimant's sister provided an affidavit from Mogadishu attesting to the identity of the claimants.3 Further, two witnesses testified to having known the claimant in Somalia since 2000. I place no weight in the Italian language driver's licenses submitted, given the objective evidence of the breakdown in the state to offer documentation that is reliable.4 On a balance of probabilities, I am satisfied that the claimants have established their identities and Somali nationality.\nCredibility\n[8] The principal claimant, who was the primary witness, testified on behalf of himself and the family. The associate claimant and the associate adult male claimant testified on their own behalf. I found their testimonies to be credible and reliable in establishing their claim and identities. They did not embellish their situation and were consistent in their statements. Overall, I accept their allegations as presented.\nRisk of Harm\n[9] The claimant, to establish their status as a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, must show that there is a serious possibility that they would be persecuted or that they would be subjected, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture if removed to Somalia. The principal claimant testified that he fears that al-Shabaab could target him in returning, as previously he had denied their request. The principal claimant had also suggested that he may be targeted by larger, stronger clans in Mogadishu.\n[10] The security situation in Mogadishu has improved since 2011, with the control of Mogadishu returning to state authorities. The Somali Government forces and African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM) forces have been gaining more territory against al-Shabaab, pushing them further from Mogadishu. Somali authorities have controlled Mogadishu for almost four years. However, the evidence of al-Shabaab's conclusive defeat is elusive. Al-Shabaab continues to carry out assassinations and terrorist attacks in urban centres and neighbouring countries, including recently Kenya. Al-Shabaab's main goal is the creation of an Islamic state by clearing the country of all foreigners and Western influences. Al-Shabaab's main targets are the Somali Transitional Government, military forces, international aid agencies and people suspected of spying on them for the government, using a mixture of assassinations, suicide attacks and improvised explosive devices. These guerrilla warfare tactics are being waged to destabilize the current government. I am not persuaded, on a balance of probabilities, that after seven years away from Mogadishu and given the change of country conditions, that the principal claimant would be personally targeted by al-Shabaab for any ongoing issues stemming from the extortion demand.\n[11] The principal claimant submitted that as a returnee, he would be persecuted and or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. In December 2013, an al-Shabaab commander had made specific threats about persons who are returnees to also deter them from re-settling. Al-Shabaab is reportedly suspicious of persons returning from Western countries. 5 A person's relocation to Somalia, the evidence indicates, could lead to suspicion, in particular a risk in al-Shabaab controlled territories. But, the evidence also indicates that having been abroad is not sufficient to become an al-Shabaab target. The country condition evidence indicates that the vast majority of attacks in Mogadishu from al-Shabaab are not directed at civilians but at the state, and its actions would generally affect the civilian population in Mogadishu. Their assassinations target persons and locations such as the Prime Minister, head of the National Security Intelligence Agency, the regional courthouse in Mogadishu, the Deputy State Attorney, the U.S. compound in Mogadishu, the presidential palace and the Sahafi Hotel. The evidence before this panel is that the al-Shabaab has been heavily weakened territorially, financially and popularly. Although they have the ability and the motivation to launch attacks in Mogadishu, from the evidence before me it is more likely that these attacks are for high value targets, conserving valuable resources and inflicting the most damage against a larger \"enemy.\"6\n[12] I do note that threats have been made towards the returnee diaspora. Evidence also states that persons who are visible and do not blend in could be targeted by al-Shabaab. I do not see the principal claimant as similar to persons such as this. As noted in the evidence, this describes people who do not belong to clans established in the district or originate from areas presently controlled by al-Shabaab.7 The principal claimant, as previously noted, was successful in Somalia, maintaining businesses throughout the most difficult period of Somalia's history. He is from a sub-clan of the XXXX clan, a XXXX XXXX XXXX clan within Mogadishu. Although he has been away from Somalia since 2009, I do not find that this length is significant enough to raise the principal claimant's profile as a returnee from a Western country.\n[13] It was submitted that if the claimants were to return, that they would be similarly situated to displaced persons who are unable to find housing, employment and are generally discriminated against. According to the Danish Immigration Service's fact finding mission in 2015:\nIn urban areas such as Mogadishu a person returning would still have to somehow be identified by the local community in order to gain acceptance. Depending on the skills and capacity of the person returning, he or she might be self-sufficient and would not as a rule face clan harassment. If a person is weak and less resourceful he or she would need support from family members, relatives or close network in order to get housing, money etc.\nIn Mogadishu, the returning Somali diaspora are usually people with a network or a family in Mogadishu and they are often returning to recover their property, establish businesses, visit relatives or to work in the government. Given their socioeconomic status this category of returnee are self-reliant, resilient and would not normally end up in the same situation as IDPs in Mogadishu.8\n[14] The principal claimant does have family and had been previously successful in Mogadishu, giving the claimant a network of friends, clan and family. In the principal claimant's personal history, he has been able to re-establish himself in Canada and Kenya. I find that the principle claimant's situation is distinguished from the evidence of Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) in Mogadishu.\n[15] I am alive to the country condition evidence for persons in Somalia. On the whole, Somalia is a country with considerable hardships and difficulties.9 Since the fall of the Barre Government, there has been little respect for human rights, security of person, rule of law or effective governance. A person claiming protection in Canada must demonstrate that they face a personal risk, and it is not sufficient to rely solely on the country conditions of the country of reference. The claimant is a Somali male who has had a lengthy history of financial success. He has some family in Mogadishu and he has the support of his clan. Objective evidence indicates that there is a number of opportunities for investment and business in Somalia, which has seen fast development since 2011.10 As the United Nations (UN) Independent Expert noted in August 2013, \"The palpable improvements in the security situation in Mogadishu and in an increasing number of areas in the country is reflected in the return of an impressive number of people from the diaspora, including businessmen lured by the promises that have been made.\"11 Considering the principal claimant's personal profile and the country conditions, I find that there is not sufficient reliable evidence before me to conclude that this claimant would be treated any differently from other male members of the Somali population. The risk he would potentially face in returning to Somalia is generally faced by others in Somalia and as such, does not meet the test in section 97(b)(ii) of the Act.\nAssociate Claimant and Minor Female Claimant\n[16] The associate and minor female claimants submit that they fear gender-based persecution. I have applied the Chairperson's Gender Guidelines, as the associate claimant and the minor female children child are members of a particular social group.12 I note that violence and discrimination against women and girls is widespread in Somalia. Somalia ranks as one of the world's worst countries for gender equality.13 Non-governmental organizations (NGO) report patterns of rape perpetrated with impunity by numerous different armed groups, including government forces and militia members.14 The years of conflict within Somalia have broken down the traditional social structures, contributing to the increased vulnerability of women and girls to violence. Women are marginalized, in particular those from smaller tribes, and are denied access to humanitarian assistance, health care and education.15 Women are particularly concerned about the extreme interpretation of Sharia law by insurgent groups, restricting women's access to public space and requiring women to cover their faces, in contradiction with the accustomed practice of Islam and Somali culture.16 Given the country condition evidence of the situation in Somalia, the relatively small clan and the conflict situation in Somalia, I find that the associate claimant and her minor daughter face more than a serious possibility of gender-based persecution if they were to return to Somalia.\nState Protection\n[17] Law enforcement agencies are also reported to fail to prevent, respond to or investigate incidents of violence. The civilian judicial system is reported to be largely non-functional across the country.17 Protection from the state is generally not available in Mogadishu, even though the city is under the control of government forces supported by AMISOM troops.18 State protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in this particular case for the female claimants.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[18] The first prong of this assessment is to determine on a balance of probabilities if there is a serious possibility of persecution in the internal flight alternative (IFA) or no risk to life, cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger of torture in the IFA. These issues, as previously discussed, would be prevalent throughout Somalia and therefore, an IFA is not found for the associate claimant and her minor daughter in returning to Somalia.\nMale Associate Claimants\n[19] The two male children have submitted that they fear recruitment and targeting for their Western affiliation if they were to return to Mogadishu. The boys have spent a significant portion of their lives outside Somalia. It was attested to at the hearing that their Somali language skills have not developed and that they rely primarily on English. I find that the boys would more likely than not come to the attention of militias and al-Shabaab, given their Western education and lack of language skills. According to the objective evidence, adolescent boys and girls, as well as children, are the main target for forced or voluntary recruitment by al-Shabaab, even in areas with AMISOM\/Somali National Armed Forces (SNAF) presence.19 Al-Shabaab has a presence in Mogadishu and certain neighbourhoods have either no or almost no government presence. It is reported that collaborators and sympathizers are present throughout Mogadishu and al-Shabaab has reach inside Mogadishu.20 Sources do report that al-Shabaab is in general aware of newcomers and such persons would likely be scrutinized.21 I find that there is more than a mere possibility that given the situation of these two claimants, having been raised in a Western country from a relatively small clan and given the objective evidence of newcomers being scrutinized, I find that it is more likely than not that there would be interest in these claimants by armed groups in Somalia.\nState Protection\n[20] The objective evidence is that for security\/protection, clan protection from either surrogate clan or from one's own clan is no longer protective but social. There remains a certain impunity for those perpetrating crimes against individuals who are from weak clans or without protection by criminals operating in Somalia. In Mogadishu and other urban areas controlled by the government and its allies, the authorities may be willing to offer protection, but they are unlikely to be able to offer effective protection.22 Government security forces, allied militias, other persons wearing uniforms, regional security forces, al-Shabaab and unknown assailants committed arbitrary or unlawful killings.23 State protection would not be reasonably forthcoming in this particular case for the two male associate claimants.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[21] The first prong of this assessment is to determine on a balance of probabilities if there is a serious possibility of persecution in the internal flight alternative, or no risk to life, cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger of torture in the IFA. If these claimants were to relocate outside of Mogadishu, these issues would result in a higher risk than in Mogadishu or the same throughout Somalia and therefore, an IFA is not found for the male associate claimants in returning to Somalia.\nCONCLUSION\n[22] For the foregoing reasons the panel finds that the principal claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX, is not a Convention refugee as set out in section 96, nor a person in need of protection within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the Act. Therefore, his claim is rejected.\n[23] The panel finds that XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX are Convention refugees as set out in section 96 of the Act. Therefore, their claim is accepted.\n[24] The panel finds that XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX are Convention refugees as set out in section 96 of the Act. Therefore, their claim is accepted.\n(signed)\n\"J. Schmalzbauer\"\nJ.

Additionally, there must be \"clear and convincing\" evidence that state authorities in Colombia cannot adequately protect him from this persecution or risk.3 Furthermore, there must not be another place within Colombia where he could live safely and where it would be reasonable to do so under the circumstances.\n[3] I find that the claimant is not a Convention refugee in that he does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Colombia. I also find that the claimant is not a person in need of protection in that his removal to Colombia would not subject him personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, and in that there are no substantial grounds to believe that his removal to Colombia would subject him personally to a danger of torture. My reasons follow.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The claimant's allegations are set out in his Personal Information Form (PIF) and attached narrative,4 however in brief he alleges the following:\n[5] Prior to leaving Colombia in 2003, the claimant lived with his family in the city of XXXX XXXX.\n[6] The claimant's father purchased a farm near XXXX in 1997. He hired someone to manage the farm but frequently visited the farm himself.\n[7] By the end of 2000, Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerillas became very active in XXXX, the area where the farm was located. The claimant's father decided that they would no longer visit the farm because of concerns about their safety. However, this was a stressful decision because the claimant's maternal grandmother lived at the farm.\n[8] On May 12, 2001, the claimant visited the farm with his father in a vehicle. There they encounted armed uniformed men and saw the lifeless body of the farm manager. The claimant's father sped away, pursued by another vehicle. As they drove away, the claimant heard gunfire. Their vehicle was forced off the road by the pursing car. The claimant was thrown from the car and his father was badly injured. From the voices he heard, the claimant believes that their pursuers assumed that they were dead. On their way to the hospital, the claimant's father died.\n[9] In December 2001, the claimant came across his mother being extorted by two unknown men, who he later learned were from the FARC. In February 2002, a person attempted to hit the claimant's mother with a car.\n[10] A month later, the claimant and his mother moved to the small town of XXXX XXXX, XXXX hours away.\n[11] The claimant left Colombia and moved to the U.S. with his mother in XXXX 2003. He entered the country on a visitor visa. The claimant never returned to Colombia and lived in the U.S. illegally until XXXX 2012.\n[12] The claimant's mother acquired legal status in the U.S. through marriage. Although the claimant was included on her immigration application, his green card was denied because the application had not been properly completed by his father-in-law.\n[13] Claimant received small fines for minor drug possession charges in U.S. In 2012, he saw a lawyer who advised him that he had no hope of asylum in the U.S. because of his criminal record and because of the length of time he had been there without status.\n[14] The claimant alleges that the ownership of his father's farm still remains with his family, which could put him at risk if he is forced to return to Colombia.\nANALYSIS\n[15] The determinative issue in this case is whether the claimant has a viable Internal Flight Alternative.\nIdentity\n[16] The claimant's identity as a citizen of Colombia is established by his testimony and supporting documentation filed, including his passport, a certified true copy of which is on file.5\nCredibility\n[17] While I found that there were some credibility problems in the claimant's testimony, this is not the determinative issue in this case.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[18] The issue of an IFA to Barranquilla was raised at the hearing.\n[19] Barranquilla is Colombia's fourth-largest city, with just under 2 million inhabitants.6 It is located on the northern coast in the state of Atlantico. It is served by an international airport, located about 12 km from the center of the city.7\n[20] On the evidence before me, I find that Barranquilla is a viable Internal Flight Alternative for the claimant. There is no serious possibility that he would be persecuted, or subjected on a balance of probabilities to danger of torture or to a risk to life or a risk to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Barranquilla. Additionally, having considered the conditions in Barranquilla and all the circumstances of this case, including those particular to the claimant, I find that it is not objectively unreasonable for him to seek refuge there.\n[21] The claimant has not been threatened in over 15 years or since leaving Colombia. Nor was he threatened during the 14 months he remained in the country after relocating with his mother in March 2002 to the small town of XXXX XXXX, about XXXX hours away, following their last encounter with the FARC. Although the claimant testified that he was in hiding during this time, he also testified that he returned to their home for two weeks to a month (cumulatively) to dispose of their household possessions. This is the same place where his mother was extorted by the FARC.\n[22] The claimant testified that there were other threats to his family members apart from the ones he indicated in his PIF. However, he did not provide sufficient, credible evidence, including testimony, to demonstrate that his mother or any other relatives were threatened after his family relocated within Colombia in March 2002. In fact, he alleges that his maternal grandmother continued to live on the farm for six months to a year after his cousin and father were murdered\nthere by the FARC. His testimony about these other alleged threats and violent acts was vague and lacked the sort of detail one would expect given that these events happened to close family members. While he testified that his maternal grandmother was threatened repeatedly on the farm, and that the FARC destroyed most of the farm equipment, these and the other incidents are missing from his original PIF8 and his PIF update received less than two weeks before the hearing.9 The claimant did not have a reasonable explanation for these material omissions. Overall, I find that the claimant has embellished the threats from the FARC, and I do not find his allegations of incidents outside his PIF to be credible.\n[23] According to the UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines for Colombia, with respect to the possibility of an IFA, consideration must be given to whether a non-state agent is likely to pursue the claimant in the proposed area of relocation.\nGiven the purported ability of some NAGs and guerrilla groups to operate country-wide and indeed internationally as part of international criminal networks, a viable IFA\/IRA may not be available to individuals at risk of being targeted by such actors. It is particularly important to note the operational capacity of NAGs and the FARC, in particular, to carry out attacks in all parts of Colombia, irrespective of territorial control.10\n[24] The fact that the claimant and his family were effectively able to avoid further persecution by relocating XXXX hours away, despite the claimant returning to his home for a few weeks; and that he has not established that other family members who remained in Colombia were targeted by the FARC, despite the fact that ownership of the farm remained within the family, suggests that there is a very low likelihood of the FARC pursuing the claimant to Barranquilla, a city that is even further away, over 15 years later.\n[25] Moreover, there is reliable evidence that the situation in Colombia vis-\u00e0-vis the FARC has changed significantly since the claimant lived there. According to a recent BBC News article\non the conclusion of FARC's disarmament, the peace with the FARC \"has brought a dramatic drop in violence in many areas of Colombia\".11 There is also evidence in the NDP that in some instances, other illegal armed groups are filling the vacuum left by the FARC, and that FARC commanders are moving into leadership positions in these other criminal organizations.12 The claimant's counsel also noted the failure of other past peace initiatives in Colombia with the FARC and other armed groups. However, in view of these developments and the fact that the seminal events occurred over 15 years ago when the claimant was a young teenager, I find that there is no more than a mere possibility that the FARC will trace and target him in a place such as Barranquilla, on the basis of a dispute over his father's farm or a failed extortion attempt.\n[26] The claimant testified that he does not know whether anyone is currently living on his father's farm, and that even if the FARC are not there, other local criminal groups such as ELN of Group 44 could oppose his claim to the land. Counsel for the claimant cited numerous sources in the NDP concerning the dangers to activists and returnees claiming land rights. However, I find that the claimant is speculating about the risk from other criminal groups, and do not accept his allegation that if he returned to Colombia, he would have no choice but to return to the farm.\n[27] I find that it would not be objectively unreasonable for the claimant to seek refuge in Barranquilla. He is fluent in Spanish, the local language, and English. He is educated, having completed high school and two years of college in the U.S. Despite his illegal status and minor criminal record in the U.S. he was employed for most of the ten years he lived there, and lived independently during his adult years, with some financial assistance from his mother and ex-girlfriend. Since arriving in Canada and receiving his work permit, he has been steadily employed. He is financially self-sufficient and currently works in his desired occupation of XXXX XXXX. The claimant is still relatively young. His PIF form suggests that he is part of the ethnic and religious majority in Colombia.\n[28]\nAlthough the claimant testified that he has no remaining family in Colombia, he has demonstrated that he is an independent, capable and resourceful person, having successfully achieved a significant degree of establishment in two foreign countries. His testimony and the affidavit13 he has provided also indicate that he has a supportive family in Canada and in the U.S.\n[29] There is evidence that internally displaced persons within Colombia often live in \"poor neighbourhoods where crime rates are high and delinquency [is] commonplace\".14 However, I find that the claimant's strong prospects for gainful employment, together with his supportive family abroad, mean that it is highly unlikely that he will find himself in these circumstances or have no reasonable alternative but to live on the family farm, despite owning no other property in Colombia.\n[30] Counsel for the claimant noted that the claimant's psychological well-being must be taken into consideration when assessing the reasonableness of an IFA, and that the claimant's testimony, his demeanor during the hearing, and the affidavit from his mother, suggest that his return to Colombia will present an unreasonable mental and emotional burden for him. The claimant testified that he is preoccupied with thoughts of his father's death, that he sometimes cries at work, and that he has sought professional help to deal with his emotional and mental state.\n[31] I note that the test for the second prong of an IFA imposes a very high threshold, namely that an IFA is unreasonable if conditions in the proposed IFA would jeopardize the life or safety of the claimant.15 In determining that the IFA is reasonable, I note that the claimant has been steadily and gainfully employed in Canada, his mental and emotional difficulties notwithstanding. Also, while he has pursued some treatment in Canada for these issues, and he testified that his General practioner diagnosed him with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, he has not provided any medical or psychological reports to supports his allegations. Furthermore, he has not sought treatment in approximately ten months, despite having found a mental health institute that he considers affordable. He testified that he is waiting for his medical insurance to cover the treatment, but also said that he has not explored any other options for treatment in the interim. Although unquestionably the claimant was traumatized by witnessing the death of his father, and his relocation would present a hardship, on the basis of the foregoing, I do not find that the IFA is objectively unreasonable or unduly harsh.\n[32] The panel notes that claimant's sister's claim for refugee protection was accepted by the Immigration and Refugee Board in 2012. I have reviewed her original PIF and attachments.16 The panel notes that each claim must be decided on its own merits, and that the circumstances alleged by the claimant's sister and her husband are not the same as those alleged by the claimant. In fact, they are significantly different.\n[33] The claimant has supported his claim with a letter from his mother17 which repeats the principal allegations in his PIF. He has also disclosed a copy of his father's death certificate,18 a copy from the Fiscalia concerning his father's death, as well as relevant excerpts from a property ownership document, and his mother's medical records from 2001.19 I have no reason to question the reliability of these documents.\n[34] However, for the reasons already stated, I find that the claimant has a viable Internal Flight Alternative in Barranquilla. Since having a viable IFA is fatal to a claim made under both sections 96 and 97(1) of the Act, the claim fails under both grounds.\n[35]\nFor these reasons I determine that Mr. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\n\"Chad Prowse\"\nChad Prowse\nAugust 24, 2017\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Adjei v.

The panel also finds that the claimant has not established with reliable evidence that he is a person in need of protection, in that his removal to Georgia would subject him personally to a risk to life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. There are not substantial grounds to believe that his removal to Georgia will subject the claimant personally to a danger of torture for the reasons that follow.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The following is a brief synopsis of the allegations that the claimant put forth in his Personal Information Form (PIF) and in his amendment.2 The claimant fears that he will face political persecution for his activities and the political activities of his cousin, XXXX XXXX. He amended his PIF statements just prior to the scheduled hearing in April 2017. In his amended statements, he states that he fears physical violence and threats emanating from a personal vendetta from a police officer who suspects the claimant had an affair with his wife in 2013.3\n[4] The claimant originally submitted that his cousin had become a target of officials due to his political opinion against the government. In 2006, the claimant submits that his own apartment had been illegally searched and he was questioned about his cousin. In September 2007, the claimant's cousin fled Georgia and made a successful refugee claim in Canada.\n[5] Following his cousin's departure, the police continued to visit the claimant's apartment and questioning him as to the whereabouts of his cousin. The claimant estimates that they came five to six times a year since January 2008. He also believed that they were sabotaging his business.\n[6] The claimant, following the actions of authorities, became political himself. On May 22, 2011, he participated in antigovernment actions. He was arrested when police arrested innocent and peaceful protestors for vandalism perpetrated by a few. He was held for a few hours where he was insulted, spit upon and released with a warning not to participate in future demonstrations. During his detention, the brother to the cousin who had escaped was beaten by security officials. The claimant, upset by this incident, participated in another demonstration where he was assaulted by officers and spent a week in hospital.\n[7] In August 2011, he ended his business due to the multiple damages that had been done to the XXXX he was to sell. In September 2011, the claimant submits that he was beaten in his XXXX in front of the customers. It was after this he made arrangements for him to leave the country, leaving behind his wife and children.\n[8] In XXXX 2011, he had fled to Portugal. It was discovered that he had flown on a fraudulent passport in his attempt to travel to Canada and was deported back to Georgia. He was immediately detained and was released on the condition that he return in 30 days with his cousin. The claimant went into hiding.\n[9] In XXXX 2012, the claimant obtained a Georgian passport. In XXXX 2012, the claimant made a second attempt to exit Georgia by travelling through the Ukraine and Turkey. Again, he was caught with a fraudulent passport, this time by Turkish authorities, and again was forcibly deported to Georgia. Again, he was arrested by Georgian authorities and held for two days. He was again released with conditions to return in 30 days with his cousin. He again went into hiding.\n[10] On XXXX XXXX, 2012, he again left through Turkey but was successful after using his properly obtained passport. He travelled to Greece where he purchased a fraudulent passport and then travelled to Canada. He remained in Greece from XXXX XXXX, 2012 until XXXX XXXX, 2012, and he arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2017 by travelling through XXXX and the United States (U.S.).\n[11] The claimant submitted an addition to his PIF narrative4 stating that he had voted in Georgian elections on October 2012 for a change of government. The claimant submits that the change in politics in Georgia did not stop the police from questioning and threatening his family that he would be killed. The family relocated from XXXX to a home of a relative in XXXX for the summer of 2013, then returned to XXXX.\n[12] He submits that on December 1, 2013, his father was taken by individuals while an individual named XXXX XXXX had threatened the claimant and stated that he would not forgive the claimant for his relationship with his wife when she worked at the XXXX. The individual stated that they were high ranking police. His father was allegedly beaten in 2013 and was medically treated for his injuries thereafter. The family made an attempt to go to the police, but nothing was done.\n[13] In XXXX 2014, the Ministry of Internal Affairs sent a letter to the claimant to appear on XXXX XXXX, 2014. Days later, his bank account was allegedly frozen, making XXXX XXXX XXXX USD inaccessible for him. Police attended his home and his son was injured when they forced the door open. Again, this was allegedly reported to the police but nothing was done.\n[14] On XXXX XXXX, 2014, a phone call was received by his mother threatening to kill the claimant if he did not appear at the police station. She was taken to the hospital after the call and she was diagnosed with \"stress induced diabetes.\" The claimant fears contacting his family directly and only gets information through his brother-in-law in XXXX. The claimant, since coming to Canada, recalls that he had an employee and it must be her husband that has imagined an affair with his wife, and it is this man who is now threatening him and his family.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[15] The panel is satisfied on a balance of probabilities in the claimant's identity as a national of Georgia, considering the certified copy of his Georgian passport and his identity card.5\nCredibility\n[16] The duty of this panel is to determine if there is reliable and trustworthy evidence that can establish the claimant's allegations on a balance of probabilities.\n[17] The Minister for Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) was unable to attend the hearing and question the claimant, but provided a written submission prior to the hearing in June 2017.6 The Minister submits that the claimant's allegation of persecution is not credible as it does not make sense that senior police officers would persecute the claimant and the entire family for many years, even after the claimant fled Georgia, based on speculation that the claimant had an extramarital affair with his wife.7 The Minister submits that the claimant is in search of a credible claim and notes that the claimant had made no mention of XXXX XXXX in his 2012 allegations. The Minister further submits that it is improbable that other police officers would participate and conspire in acts of extreme violence based on a fellow officer's speculation about an extramarital affair. He cites that there is no genuine evidence that he is being falsely charged or prosecuted in Georgia by rogue officers. Further, it has been five years since he left Georgia and the test is forward looking. In summary, the Minister is of the belief that this claim has no credible basis and\/or is manifestly unfounded.\nInitial Claim - Political Claim - Section 96\n[18] The claimant submits that his cousin had been politically active against the Saakashvili regime in the early 2000s. As a result, he had been targeted by authorities and had to flee Georgia where he made his way to Canada and was found to be a Convention refugee.8 The claimant alleges that as they had lived together, he had been repeatedly harassed and questioned about his cousin. I take no issue with the claimant's cousin's claim and the credibility of that claim.\n[19] To establish his allegations of being politically harassed by authorities, the claimant submitted a number of documents. He included documents that attested to his cousin's situation, as well as his cousin's medical report dated May 22, 2011, which states cause of injuries of \"mutual dispute.\"9 The medical report dated May 26, 2011, notes that he was discharged on June 1, 2011, and states the \"patient had head injuries.\"10 A further medical report notes that the \"patient entered beaten\" and it is dated September 9, 2011.11 He also submitted documents that the police were still looking for him, which was comprised of a single statement signed by seven neighbors dated September 19, 2013.12 They write that the family was put in hiding with the mother-in-law after he left and that the change of government had no effect.13 Conversely, the claimant provided a security clearance from authorities dated September 19, 2013.14 The claimant also submitted a simply-typed statement with identity card from XXXX XXXX stating that the claimant had been in hiding with him.15\n[20] Georgia has politically moved on from the United National Movement's (UNM) control and President Saakashvili. According to the Nations in Transit Report for 2016:\nAfter coming to power in 2012, Georgian Dream (GD) embarked on a campaign of \"restorative justice,\" prosecuting former officials from the UNM for various acts of corruption and abuse of office. While a number of UNM officials did engage in abuses and had erected a system that put UNM allies in control of broad swathes of the economy, GD's campaign was regarded by many as politically motivated. GD's singular emphasis on prosecuting former officials, as opposed to redressing thousands of outstanding complaints of forcible state property appropriation, for example, contributed to doubts over GD's interest in pursuing justice. New cases against UNM ex-officials largely ceased in 2015, and disappeared almost entirely in 2016.\nThe UNM's loss effectively ceded the bulk of Georgia's political space to GD. In particular, the UNM's fixation on Saakashvili's potential return to Georgia likely did little to improve the party's electoral prospects, and left the party internally divided before and even more so after the elections. Even in its weakened and divided state after the October elections, the UNM is the strongest and best organized opposition party in Georgia, which makes the quality of its opposition crucial to Georgia's democratic future.16\n[21] There is almost no evidence that persons who had sought political change, and had won that political change by the coming of power of the Georgian Dream (GD), face any further political harassment, discrimination or persecution in Georgia following the 2012 election.\n[22] I find that there is no well-founded fear of persecution for any remaining political profile for the claimant in returning to Georgia. Further, I am not persuaded, given the only evidence before me, as to the claimant's politics having any further influence on the personal vendetta. This speculation by the claimant is insufficient to establish this fact on a balance of probabilities.\nPersonal Vendetta: Secondary Section 97 \/ Sur Place\n[23] The claimant submitted that he believed that the political issues are, or could be behind the alleged targeting of him and his family. However, the claimant is speculating on the motivations. There is almost nothing supporting the claimant's belief. Therefore, counsel also agreed at the hearing that this is a personal vendetta lacking a nexus to the Convention's refugee definition, as he is allegedly being targeted for his perceived sexual relationship with the agent of harm's wife.\n[24] The claimant submitted that his work experience in Georgia was playing XXXX XXXX and opening a XXXX XXXX. He had opened a XXXX but he testified that his wife had operated and managed that business. The claimant was not a reliable witness when it came to his personal and professional history in Georgia prior to his departure. I noted in his PIF that he had lived and was employed in Russia as a XXXX XXXX player until 2004. At the hearing, no direct or consistent answer came from the claimant regarding his XXXX career; he testified that it ended anywhere between 2002 and 2008, but every time he was asked, a different timeframe was given and he amended his level and the location of his experiences. He was asked about the XXXX XXXX and in the PIF narrative, it detailed that he took XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, fixed them and sold them.17 A letter submitted identified that the claimant had XXXX XXXX.18 At the hearing, he attempted to gloss over this business and had to be redirected a number of time to discuss it. He testified that he bought and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX., then he changed his testimony, stating he had purchased overseas and XXXX XXXX for sale in Georgia. A registration was also submitted of this XXXX XXXX.19 I do find that the circumstances of the claimant are material, as the claimant is alleging that he is targeted by an agent of the state and cannot approach authorities, and that he had some XXXX XXXX according to his original statements, but it is now unclear as to what extent.\n[25] Further, these matters are material as his professional experiences substantiate the issue of the seized assets; the claimant alleged that the authorities had unjustly seized over $XXXX XXXX XXXX USD.20 He was asked how he had such financial assets to be seized after allegedly paying numerous smugglers to get out of Georgia and supporting himself overseas for many years. The XXXX he was selling were, according to the government import tax department, worth approximately XXXX XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX CDN.21 With a profit to be made on an individual sale, it is difficult that he would have made such profits in the year or so he was in business as he alleged. Further, that he had stated that both business were financially and operationally destroyed, the panel had questioned where this money had come from. His explanation of savings he had did not clarify the matter. The claimant had no meaningful work since according to him, he opened an XXXX XXXX allegedly from a loan from his father who had worked in a XXXX XXXX XXXX. It is unlikely that this was a lucrative operation, in particular due to statements that the XXXX could not be sold because XXXX XXXX. Similarly, he stated the XXXX had been destroyed and he was financially unable to carry on that business. Yet, he alleges to have significant savings. I find that the claimant has not been forthright with this panel as to his personal history and financial dealings. His testimony was inconsistent as to his employment history and his alleged financial history is out of line with the employment history he gave. I do find that the claimant has not been a credible witness and his testimony as to his circumstances, and the seizure of assets are impugned by his lack of detailed and candid testimony.\n[26] Further of issue is the timing of the allegations of this personal vendetta. The new allegations brought forward by the claimant post-date the change of government and change of political circumstances within Georgia. A change in government that was in line with the claimant's alleged politics before leaving Georgia would mitigate a substantial amount of risk of persecution for that political opinion. The second claim was brought forward in 2017, a significant length of time after the original events happened in 2013. It is curious why an agent of harm, such as the alleged Mr. XXXX, would have waited two years before targeting the claimant. The XXXX was closed in 2011 after mere months when his wife had allegedly worked there. The claimant has no records to indicate the employee status of this individual. The claimant alleges that this person kidnapped his father in 2013 and that this is the first he had heard of the vendetta against him. Such a brief time, when any affair could have happened between January 2011 and his departure in October 2011, would more likely than not have been discovered shortly after the affair, rather than over two years later. However, it is speculation on my part or the Minister's why such a length time had occurred between the alleged time of the affair and the agent of harm finding out. However, I do find that it does somewhat impugn the credibility of those allegations, that they were not included in the initial statements of the claimant nor that that they were amended at the earliest opportunity, as the claimant has a significant motivation to amend his allegations knowing that his political allegations would no longer sufficiently establish a claim for persecution.\n[27] The central issue in regards to the personal vendetta is the alleged kidnapping of the claimant's father in December 2013. The claimant was not present for the events and has relied on the handwritten letters from his father as primary evidence. The claimant testified that he had heard directly from his father what had happened following the event in 2013. The credibility of this event is called into question given the numerous inconsistencies within the numerous documents of corroboration, in particular the letters from his father and the claimant's version of events. The letter submitted by the father in 2015,22 prior to the additional Basis of Claim (BOC) form completed in 2017 amending his allegations, makes no mention of statements allegedly made to him by the officers identifying Mr. XXXX. He also writes that he was unconscious and woke up in hospital. However, the claimant's narrative in 2017 indicates a lengthy description of the arduous walk his father had to take to get to the hospital. The claimant testified at the hearing that his father was taken to the hospital. His BOC had identified that he had walked to the hospital following the events. A medical report dated December 1, 2013 was submitted.23 A second letter from his father was received on the behest of the claimant correcting his previous statements.24 The letter from XXXX XXXX, the claimant's father, stated that the claimant wanted him to write that letter to say what had happened on December 1, 2013. It states what happened and why he had not stated it earlier, as he thought to keep it short. In this letter he states that his daughter-in-law had gone to the police. He now writes in the second letter who had assaulted him. He did not hear from the police and he called to inquire later, but did not hear anything further. He states that he did receive a letter from the Ministry of Internal Affairs for the claimant to appear there and it was signed by the assailant, XXXX XXXX. The father is clearly writing what he is directed to by the claimant. The claimant had amended his own allegations as to who had kidnapped his father from his initial statements, and it is more likely than not that this is the reason behind the claimant's father having to similarly amend his. I find that the father is not a reliable witness, in part because of his capacity to amend his statements based on his son's directions, and that in doing so he has contradicted his previous statements. I find that the claimant's allegations of his father being kidnapped as he alleges are significantly impugned by the inconsistencies and mutable story told by himself and his father.\n[28] The claimant submitted that the agent of harm in this case is head of the police in XXXX, giving him the power to unilaterally seize his assets and use extreme violence at will and with complete impunity. The claimant submitted that his family is living in complete hiding in a home that they are unable to leave. The children do not attend school. He further posits that he cannot contact them at any time as the police could track where they are. In contrast to this, his wife and father have applied for and received government identification documents (IDs).25 His father continues to collect his pension. I do find that the family has continued to approach these authorities for identity cards and a minimal pension undermines the credibility of such violence being directed by rogue state authorities, as alleged. This, again, undermines the claimant's allegations of the family having to be cloistered and incommunicado.\n[29] The claimant submitted a number of simply-typed statements from neighbors attesting to persons coming to look for him. The statements are from former neighbors stating that as of March 8, 2017, the police have continued to search for the claimant. This simple statement dated March 8, 2017, is typed and signed by all three with ID cards included.26 The statements made by the claimant are that his family had told them that the claimant had fled. Yet, these individuals continue to allegedly question all the same neighbors repeatedly about his whereabouts. The authorities would reasonably know that he had been deported twice to Georgia, in particular as he had been held for questioning during the last forcible deportation. It is highly improbable that these persons would continue to seek the whereabouts of the claimant, given the information that they know and if the agent of harm has the authority as he alleges.\n[30] It is the claimant's statement that his family is living in a cottage of his brother-in-law, XXXX XXXX XXXX, the same brother-in-law who he communicates with via skype and is his sole source of information regarding his family for the past three to four years. He submits that the family went into hiding and he fears communicating with them for fear that they will be found. In support of his allegations, he submitted the following:\n* A statement by the claimant's uncle, XXXX XXXX, regarding the family being in hiding in XXXX, undated and typed with no ID.27\n* A statement by the claimant's brother-in-law, stating that the family is still in hiding, undated and typed with no signature and no ID.28\n* Statements by the claimant's wife, mother and father dated Mach 15, 2017, which are very simple statements of being in \"hiding in one village of XXXX,\" typed and signed with accompanied ID cards.29\n* A statement from the wife of the claimant in XXXX and a letter stating that the family has been in a bad situation for five years, unable to talk to her husband, that the children are not in school and that she cannot work, typed and dated March 25, 2017.30\n[31] None of these statements are affidavits; the claimant stated that his brother-in-law had been the person tasked with organizing the documents coming from Georgia. Although numerous, they are simple statements that are unable to be tested. Of note, is that the mother and father had recently applied for new ID cards from the government.31 The letter is signed, so it is reasonable to suggest that the brother-in-law would visit these persons regularly, resulting in a very insecure hiding position for the family. I am not persuaded that living in the home of a family member, even in a village outside of XXXX, is any genuine attempt at evasion from this particularly profiled agent of harm. It is contradictory in my view that the person, even the head of the XXXX police, would have access to such technology to trace overseas phone calls and international surveillance from an unknown phone number to an unknown location in Georgia. To monitor the communication of his family or himself in such a manner, they would have to know their whereabouts. But, the claimant states that they are hiding and that is why no further reprisals have occurred. There seems to be an inherent contradiction in the claimant's evidence; if the family is in hiding, then why is the communication silenced as there is no reasonable expectation of surveillance? Further to this, that the alleged agent of harm, with the ability to corrupt the judiciary and use violence with complete impunity to his own ends is unable to locate the claimant's family in the home of a family member, is also highly improbable. It is this same agent of harm who allegedly said he would \"break the family\" to have the claimant pay. It is also the claimant's allegation that he beat his father unconscious in his quest for revenge. He has used the courts to seize his assets and allegedly continues to harass the neighbors about him and his family. But that he refuses to use any of these means to continue his vendetta is improbable, given the claimant's evidence. I find that the claimant's evidence of the family being in genuine hiding in such a manner is undermined by these issues. I find that the unresolved issues regarding the communication silence of the family is more likely than not concocted in order to protect the family from being called as witnesses in this case, undermining the claims of the claimant that the family is at risk in Georgia.\n[32] I have serious concerns as to the length that the claimant has gone in order to insulate himself from being questioned on any material aspects of this claim. Further, he has shielded his family from being questioned on the material issues that they are primary witnesses to. The claimant repeatedly stated that he has had no contact with the family whatsoever because they would be able to track them, ergo it would not be appropriate for the panel to either. The claimant could give no explanation as to what mechanism that the authorities could be \"tracking\" his or the family's communications as he alleges. For years, they have lived in a home owned by the brother of the claimant's wife without issue. By the claimant's own statements, he and his family believe that this person has unilaterally corrupted the police and the judiciary against him. I do take significant inference against the credibility of the allegations that the family is hiding in such a manner, as it would be reasonable that as they are the central witnesses and the primary victims of this individual, that they be called to testify and present their evidence, in particular as the claimant has almost no firsthand information to impart and the claimant's explanation for the lack of any contact with his family is not reasonable, given that it is a country that has internet access, telephones and numerous other methods of communication. There has been unreasonable explanation as to why they have had absolutely no communication in the intervening years.\n[33] In support of his allegations, the claimant submitted written letters from persons known to him in Georgia and these documents were compiled and sent to him by his brother-in-law. The claimant submitted a written letter from XXXX XXXX about the motive for an assault against the claimant at his XXXX in 2011.32 A simple statement that she was requested to write saying that she had witnessed an athletically-built \"guy\" forcefully beat up the claimant, and that she had heard afterwards that it was because XXXX XXXX was jealous of the claimant and his wife. Included was her passport identification page. Ms. XXXX is ambiguous as to how she had heard the motive of the attack, in particular as the claimant has identified that the attack in the XXXX was due to his political activities and had made no such connection to Mr. XXXX in his previous statements. Ms. XXXX made no mention of working or knowing Mrs. XXXX, as she only referred to her as \"his wife.\" Something I would reasonably expect if this was the person she had known, not her husband. However, she remarks of that attack against the claimant, which may have occurred, but the reasons are ambiguous in the letter submitted. I find that this letter has little weight in establishing the allegations of an ongoing vendetta against the claimant because of the ambiguity in her statements.\n[34] The claimant submits that his son was injured in an attack against the family, allegedly because of the vendetta against the claimant. Numerous statements, including statements from the claimant's mother and wife of the police entering their home and the injuries sustained by his son, XXXX, were submitted, typed and unsigned with ID cards.33 Further letters were submitted from neighbors; these are typed and unsigned with attached personal ID cards.34 A medical report was submitted for XXXX but it has no address, no activity listed for the cause of injury and it states that he was injured \"falling down.\"35 I am not persuaded that the typed statements that are unsigned have any probative value in establishing the events in question. The claimant was not there in person. These are primary witnesses and their statements are easily contrived and unable to be tested. Further, the medical report does say that XXXX fell down and that this had caused his injury. I find no issue with XXXX's injuries; however, the medical report does not substantiate the events leading up to the alleged injury. I am not persuaded that on a balance of probabilities his son was injured in the manner the claimant alleges.\n[35] The claimant testified that he was threatened to his mother by these individuals and as a result, she contracted diabetes. I note that a medical report for the claimant's mother, XXXX XXXX, dated August 10, 2014, indicates that she is insulin-dependent, caused by emotional stress.36 I find that the medical note has almost no weight, given that nothing was prescribed for the emotional distress but she was referred to an endocrinologist. As diabetes is a failure of the endocrine system to produce sufficient insulin and has no connection to stress, I further find that this medical note was more likely than not acquired for the claimant's allegations, rather than as an appropriate medical note. I find that the claimant is attempting to embellish the situation and context of his mother by attributing her diabetes to the stress of the threats against him. I do find that this further impugns the credibility of any threats as being ongoing against the family, due to the erroneous attribution of a physical disease to these allegations.\n[36] The claimant further submitted two pieces of evidence of his alleged persecution from Mr. XXXX, a summons for the claimant to appear, issued April 29, 2014,37 and a notice of his bank account being sealed, dated May 10, 2014. 38 The bank notice notes a court judgement. The claimant was asked what follow-up he had done to inquire about the circumstances of the seizure of $XXXX XXXX XXXX USD. He said it was impossible as he is not in Georgia. I question his rationale as he has access to contact any manner of persons, including lawyers within Georgia, to determine the seizure action against him. It is a significant financial impact to lose such an amount of money, especially considering that his father has to allegedly come out of hiding to collect his pension ($XXXX XXXX XXXX CDN)39 to support the family. It would be reasonable that this money be used by the family to maintain their security in Georgia, or as I had suggested, getting the family out of Georgia. The claimant did not provide any reasonable explanation why he had no follow-up to financial action. Further, the claimant had not been consistent or credible as to his own financial\/employment situation in Georgia and had not credibly established with reliable testimony his business dealings. It does appear that he was summoned, but it is unclear for what purposes. The claimant speculated that as the summons is signed by Mr. XXXX that the two are connected. But, I find it highly improbable that the judicial system would work, even so corrupted, as to be so efficient to have a court judgement seize such assets within two weeks' time from the initial summons. There is a paper trail to the alleged seizure of assets, but the claimant did almost nothing to determine the source of that seizure. I do find that the claimant's failure to support his speculation, in particular as he could have done so without reprisals from Canada and that this seizure was done at the behest of Mr. XXXX, undermines the credibility of his allegation that they are connected. The claimant may have had his assets seized, but I am not persuaded by his speculation and his erroneous deductions that the seizure was conducted for a personal vendetta, as he alleges.\n[37] Just prior to the hearing, on June 4, 2017, the claimant's father was allegedly attacked again by the same people from four years previous.40 He allegedly recognized an individual from the 2013 attack. A letter from his father dated June 6, 2017, the day prior to the hearing, the claimant's father again writes this, stating that when he was taking out money he was approached, threatened and assaulted by the agent of harm in this case, XXXX XXXX.41A submitted medical report and accompanying picture were included.42 The father of the claimant did not seek medical treatment until two days following the incident. It is fortuitous that the assault by the alleged agent of harm came just days prior to the hearing after having no reprisals against him for four years, and that he had a bank account and a public source of income. I take no issue with the claimant's father having the injuries as the picture shows and medical report indicates; however, that picture is undated and the sources of the injuries are unclear. The father has been shown to change his statements as necessary for this claim and I find that there is little weight I can place in another simply worded letter from the father. I find that there is not sufficient credible evidence to establish the second assault against the father.\n[38] The claimant had the opportunity to explain his situation in totality when he made his claim for protection, but did not do so. His initial claim was one of political persecution. When those circumstances changed within Georgia, only then did the claimant mount a different series of allegations. He initially attempted to politically connect the two circumstances of the personal vendetta and the political persecution, but as noted initially, there was not sufficient credible evidence to link the two circumstances. The claimant submitted that he and his family are under attack by the head of the XXXX police department for the perceived affair the claimant had with his wife six years ago. The claimant submitted numerous letters from various friends and family to support his allegations; these untested and simple statements, although numerous, have little material weight in establishing the allegations of the claimant. He also submitted medical evidence of treated injuries of his family since his departure. The claimant was not a reliable witness regarding his financial and business dealings in Georgia. Numerous times he relied on speculation to establish facts in his claim. The central witness, his father, was not consistent in his corroborative letters, initially corroborating the political allegations of the claimant and thenbusin amending his statements at the behest of the claimant to to line up with the new allegations. This resulted in further contradictions in the claimant's evidence of the central issue of the 2013 kidnapping. Finally, that the claimant has no first hand testimony to provide and has unreasonably insulated any other witnesses from doing so, further undermines the credibility of these allegations.\n[39] On the totality of the evidence before me, I find that the claimant has not established with reliable or credible evidence that on a balance of probabilities, the family and himself face a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment stemming from this alleged personal vendetta from Mr. XXXX.\nCONCLUSION\n[40] For the foregoing reasons, the panel finds that XXXX XXXX is not a Convention refugee as set out in section 96, nor a person in need of protection within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the Act. Therefore, his claim is rejected.\n(signed)\n\"J. Schmalzbauer\"\nJ.

The panel also finds that the claimant has not established with reliable evidence that he is a person in need of protection, in that his removal would subject him personally to a risk to life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment that extends throughout El Salvador. There are not substantial grounds to believe that his removal to El Salvador will subject the claimant personally to a danger of torture for the reasons that follow.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The following is a brief synopsis of the allegations that the claimant put forth in the Basis of Claim (BOC) form.2 The claimant alleges that he will continue to be targeted by Mara Salvatrucha (MS13) members for failing to pay extortion demands.\n[4] The claimant submits that he had been previously in Canada for 17 days in XXXX to visit his sister. He had been planning on returning to Canada in December for Christmas, but before this trip he was approached by gang members. The claimant alleges that on October 27, 2016 he was approached by persons threatening him that they knew of his personal situation and that he would have to pay these persons $500 a month. He was warned that his family would be successively killed if he had failed to pay them. He did not, instead he went to the police and the police relocated the family to a church. He alleges his family have continued to live in this church until December 2016 when they relocated to XXXX, a town on the XXXX outskirts of San Salvador.\n[5] The claimant made a claim at the port of entry, when he flew into the Calgary airport on XXXX XXXX, 2016. He completed his BOC form and it was received by the Board (Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada) on November 23, 2016.\n[6] The claimant arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2016 and he made his claim for refugee protection. His claim was referred on November 18, 2016.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[7] The panel is satisfied on a balance of probabilities, in the claimant's identity as a national of El Salvador, considering the certified copy of his passport and national identity card.3\nNexus\n[8] The panel finds that the claimant is not a Convention refugee as his fear of persecution is not by reason of any of the five grounds. He fears extortion from criminal gangs, who have targeted him for financial reasons. The claimant and representative conceded that he was not targeted for any of the reasons enumerated in the Convention. However, the panel will go on to assess the claim on whether or not on a balance of probabilities that this claimant would be subjected personally to a risk to his life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, should he return to El Salvador.\nRisk of Harm\n[9] The duty of this panel is to determine if there is reliable and trustworthy evidence that can establish the claimant's allegations on a balance of probabilities. The presumption before this panel is that the claimant's testimony is true; however, this can be rebutted in appropriate circumstances, such as inconsistences, or contradictions in the evidence before it.\n[10] The claimant was questioned as to the specifics of the single phone call and the extortion demand he alleges to have received on October 27, 2016. He was asked to recount all details as verbatim as necessary to convey the specifics of the only phone call he had received. In his testimony he testified that the person identified his allegiance to the maras and that he needed to pay them $500 dollars. The claimant made no response and the phone was hung up. He was later questioned as to how he was advised the extortion was to be paid and if there was any further direction given, and he clearly had stated that no further direction had been given. The claimant submitted a police denunciation that he allegedly made the following morning. In that report he clearly indicates that a longer conversation occurred, where he agreed to pay and that the next day a phone call would be made to him in a similar fashion and they would arrange to pick up the money. The claimant was questioned as to why these details found in the police report were conspicuously absent from his statements at the hearing. He re-read his police statement in Spanish at the hearing, but had no explanation, merely re-iterating his statements that no direction was given.\n[11] The claimant was questioned as to his family's circumstances. In San Salvador, he and his common-law wife, his mother and brother lived in the same residence. They fled the residence and since then his common-law wife, mother and brother have found a new residence in XXXX. He testified that his common-law wife continues to work and study daily in San Salvador, commuting between the two areas approximately XXXX XXXX a day. The claimant was asked if she was specifically threatened by the individual on the phone, he stated no. He was again questioned as to the credibility of those statements given that in the police report submitted that it stated that they specifically threatened her, by naming her. The claimant simply reiterated that they did not threaten her and therefore did not explain the discrepancy in his report to the police.4\n[12] I find that the claimant's statements are not consistent. I would reasonably expect that had the claimant received such threats and had gone to the police as he alleges and made those statements, that they would have been consistent with his statements made mere weeks later at his claim for protection. The details given in that police report are not what the claimant testified to at this hearing and he has not reasonably explained the discrepancies in the allegations raised in October and raised here. These are central to the single threat of extortion that he was levied and I would expect someone educated and experienced as the claimant to consistently recount these threats. I do find that the contradictions in his statements significantly undermine the credibility of the alleged threat of extortion he received. Therefore, I find that there is not sufficient credible or reliable evidence to support his allegations of being targeted by maras in El Salvador.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[13] Even if I were to find the allegations of these threats against the claimant credible I further determine that there would not be more than a mere possibility that the claimant would face a risk of to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment by these persons if he were to relocate to Santa Ana, his family's previous residence, or La Union on the southern coast.\n[14] The claimant had stated that he could relocate and not face a similar risk. At the port of entry the claimant also stated that he would be safe if he lived elsewhere.5 The claimant also testified that he could relocate and that these persons would no longer pose a risk to him. I also reviewed that his family members have successfully relocated and continue to live an open life, by commuting, attending school and working without apparent reprisal. The partner of the claimant did write that she had felt she was being followed, but her speculation is not sufficient evidence to find that there have been any further threats since their move.\n[15] If the threats were in fact truthful, it is more likely than not that the threats were local to the area in which they lived, including the claimant's friend stating their rental home was tagged with graffiti. This is supported by the objective evidence of the criminal organizations such as the MS13.\n[16] Gangs, in particular the MS-13, have an important hierarchical structure, as each clica (neighborhood level gang group of a few dozen members) has a great deal of autonomy in the relationships it maintains with other organizations, including Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCOs).6\n[17] According to International Assessment and Strategy Centre's report, Central American Gangs and Transnational Criminal Organizations, on the gangs in El-Salvador:\nThe clicas are grouped into larger blocs called programas, with mid-level leaders known as palabreros, who have authority over several dozen clicas. Above them is a ranflero, who is generally in prison but whose orders are passed on and obeyed. Above the ranfleros are the jefes nacionales, a small group of national leaders who have the ultimate authority on issues that affect the entire structure. Within this structure, local gang leaders have considerable autonomy in deciding which criminal activities to engage in as a clique or group of cliques, how to distribute criminal proceeds, and which non-gang TCO's to work with. Each clica is responsible for its own financial well-being, and thus can decide how to raise that money: through extortions; \"taxing\" of local businesses and those who transit the neighborhoods they control for commerce (vendors, gas suppliers, beer trucks etc.); narco menudeo or the small scale retail of cocaine and crack; and contract assassinations and other activities.7\n[18] According to the International Assessment and Strategy Centre, reporting the sophistication and organization of these gangs:\nThis lack of common approach or cohesion complicates efforts to assess the role played by gangs in transnational crime. The clearest evidence that there is not yet a robust economic relationship between the gangs and TCOs is the abject poverty... [of their neighborhoods] (both MS-13 and Calle 18) over the past two years, it is clear that the gang members and their families are deriving little beyond subsistence from their criminal activities, and certainly not enough for an opulent lifestyle. Some of the money is used by gang members to feed personal drug habits, purchase weapons for the clica, pay lawyers for those in prison and other activities; but, it is not enough to lift most gang members and their families out of poverty. This could be changing already, but is not yet widely visible.8\n[19] Were the principal claimant to remain their area of operation, the panel's review of the evidence does not support a finding that the local clica would have the wherewithal or motivation to engage in a nationwide hunt for the claimant, as opposed to simply selecting a new target of opportunity to extort money from. Therefore, I find that the claimant would not face on a balance of probabilities a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment from the particular agent of harm in this claim if he relocated.\n[20] The second prong of an internal flight alternative (IFA) assessment is to determine if it is objectively reasonable in the particular circumstances of the claimant to relocate. On the evidence before it this panel finds that it is objectively reasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for him to seek refuge elsewhere in El Salvador for the following reasons.\n[21] El Salvador respects freedom of movement and persons have access to other areas; his family had previously relocated. Therefore, it is practical for the claimant to relocate. I do accept that the violence in El Salvador is an issue, however it is an issue throughout the country. In review of La Union, it has the least amount of gang activity and would be reasonably less violent than San Salvador where they were previously living.9\n[22] The claimant argued that he would not be able to find a similarly-paying job if he lived elsewhere in El Salvador. Other than prospect of employment elsewhere, he stated that he had no further physical issues in relocating elsewhere. His common-law partner had relocated to another city, renting a new place without apparent issue.\n[23] There are other larger economic centers in El Salvador than San Salvador. The claimant is an experienced salesman; he had previously worked in the XXXX unit for a large hardware store. I accept and acknowledge the claimant's concern of finding a similarly lucrative job if he were to move. He is a skilled salesman who has over ten years of extensive experience. It is more likely than not that these skills and experience will assist the claimant going forward in finding comparable work but perhaps not identical work. Second, it is granted that El Salvador does have a high unemployment rate and high poverty; however, the claimant and his family's circumstances are distinguished from those impoverished individuals given his work history, his common-law partner's university education as a lawyer and continued employment.\n[24] Therefore, the panel concludes the claimant does not, on a balance of probabilities face a risk to his life or a risk of cruel or unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture, in Santa Ana or La Union. The panel further concludes that it would not be objectively unreasonable for the claimant to relocate in El Salvador and re-establish his life there.\nCONCLUSION\n[25] For the foregoing reasons the panel finds that, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is not a Convention refugee as set out in section 96, nor a person in need of protection within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the Act. Therefore, his claim is rejected.\n(signed)\nJ. Schmalzbauer\nJ.

They claim refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \"Act\").1 Their allegations are as follows.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The principal claimant is a 39-year-old single mother from Bogot\u00e1. In June, 2015, she was approached by two armed men who took her cellphone. They said they had information about her and would be watching her. Two weeks later, two other people confronted her and threatened her daughter if she stopped attending school. Again, the claimant was told she was being watched.\n[3] In August, 2015, the principal claimant got an order for products in relation to her side-business. When she went to deliver the merchandise, one of the men from the June incident and another man took her merchandise and then made a demand for monthly extortion.\n[4] In September, 2015, the principal claimant was confronted by an armed man who demanded an extortion payment by the following day. The principal claimant made the payment the next day at an agreed upon location and she was advised she had to make these payments each month. She lost her job due to the toll this stress took on her work performance. Later the same month, the principal claimant received a call from a woman who stated the next payment was due the same month. The claimant hung-up on her.\n[5] In October, 2015, the principal claimant's son was attacked while riding his bike to university. He was assaulted and told to tell his mother that they were not joking about the money. They slashed his tires. Several days later, the claimants moved to another neighbourhood in Bogot\u00e1. After two weeks, they received a note stating that no matter where they went, they would be found. It was signed by the Black Eagles.\n[6] A couple of weeks later, the principal claimant was approached by two men while walking to the bus stop. They demanded money and showed her a video of a boy they had killed in front of his mother because she refused to follow their demands. They threatened the principal claimant's son and said money had to be paid on the fifth of each month at a specific location.\n[7] By January, 2016, the claimants ran out of money to continue making payments and had to borrow some from a friend.\n[8] In March, 2016, the Black Eagles advised that the monthly payments were not sufficient. They demanded the principal claimant's son join them, or her daughter would be taken. The principal claimant agreed to give more money. She made some payments in April and May, and applied for, and received, visas to the U.S. (United States) in the meantime.\n[9] When she made her June payment they demanded another excessive amount. The claimants paid some of it until November 2016. Again, at that time an exorbitant sum was requested. The Black Eagles stated that if the claimants did not pay it by the next month, they would take XXXX.\n[10] The claimants left the country via the United States before the deadline passed and came to Canada, where the principal claimant has a brother. The claimants fear that if they return to Colombia, they will be harmed or killed by the Black Eagles.\nDETERMINATION\n[11] I find that the claimants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. My reasons follow.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[12] The claimants' identities as nationals of Colombia are established by their testimony and passports in evidence.2 I am satisfied of their identities by these documents.\nCredibility\n[13] In terms of credibility, the claimants outlined their allegations in a very detailed manner in their Basis of Claim narratives.3 The testimony of the principal claimant also set out, in a detailed fashion, the events that transpired. She was able to discuss events out of chronological order and move back and forth in the timeline without discrepancy, thereby giving weight to her allegations. There were no material inconsistencies or contradictions between her testimony and the other evidence before me. The claimants also submitted some evidence to corroborate their allegations, including the notice they received from the Black Eagles,4 and a letter from a friend who confirmed that he loaned the claimants money because of the extortion demands they received.5 Based on all of these factors, I find the claimants' allegations to be credible.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[14] In this case, I find that the claimants could live safely in other parts of Colombia, such as in Cali or Medell\u00edn, without a serious possibility of persecution, or a risk of harm on the balance of probabilities, within the meaning of section 97 of the Act. I base this largely on the profile of the agents of persecution\/harm. In this case, I do not find that the Black Eagles likely have the capacity or capability to track the claimants throughout Colombia. An RIR (Response to Information Request) in the claimants' evidence cites a source who states that the Black Eagle's activities are often \"very local.\"6 Sources in the RIR repeat the findings that the group has no central command or defined structure, they are unstable and flexible, divided, and do not operate as a systematic structure.7 Sources in the RIR also state that the name \"Black Eagles\" is a generic term that different groups or networks use at their convenience.8\n[15] The InSight Crime report states that the Black Eagles are a non-cohesive group, and the name has been a shifting and is not strictly defined term.9 The report also states that there is little evidence that the Black Eagles operate as a systematic organization, and that the name is really a blanket term.10\n[16] The Agencia Prensa Rural document, also in the claimants' evidence, states that the Black Eagles are a fragmented group, the name is a generic term, and groups who use the name function independently from each other and do not respond to a central command.11 It goes on to state that some criminal groups may adopt the name to intimidate their victims, and the report repeats that they do not operate in a systematic manner as an integrated organization and do not coordinate their activities on a large scale.12\n[17] Another RIR in evidence repeats findings that the name \"Black Eagles\" is a convenient label groups appropriate to generate fear, and that they are not a cohesive structure.13\n[18] The Southport document in the claimants' evidence also finds that the Black Eagles are a fragmented group without structure, hierarchy, or systematic relations between the different factions.14\n[19] Thus, although the Black Eagles may have a presence in Cali or Medell\u00edn, I find that the bulk of evidence supports the notion that they are not connected as a network. I note that Colombia Reports does not identify the Black Eagles as having influence in Cali,15 nor does InSight Crime identify Valle del Cauca, not to be confused with Cauca, as being an area of operation.16 But, I shall assume that the Black Eagles do have a presence in both IFA (internal flight alternative) locations. Based on the fragmented nature of the Black Eagles and the localized nature of their activities, I find it unlikely that they have the ability to track the claimants throughout the country to places such as Medell\u00edn or Cali, given their structure. In my view, there is insufficient evidence before me to demonstrate that the people targeting the claimants were not simply a local group, or that the Black Eagles likely have the kind of network and resources of, for example, paramilitary groups in Colombia, or the more organized and structured criminal organizations, so as to locate the claimants elsewhere.\n[20] There is some evidence that in addition to their criminal and extortion activities, the Black Eagles target activists for murder. However, in this case, the claimants are not activists and do not have the profile that would likely motivate their agents of persecution or harm to track them throughout Colombia. I have already discussed their capacity. The people mainly at risk in Colombia are journalists, human rights activists, Afro-Colombians, indigenous people, landowners and farmers, people in certain jobs like certain business owners and drivers, government workers, public officials, trade unionists, women in specific circumstances, and children with specific profiles.17 The claimants do not belong to any of these profiles either.\n[21] It was submitted that the principal claimant's son (an adult) is vulnerable to forced recruitment by gangs and paramilitaries throughout Colombia. While I agree that forced recruitment in Colombia is a problem, it is mainly by the paramilitaries and, particularly, for children in rural areas.18 I find insufficient evidence was educed to demonstrate that forced recruitment of adults in urban areas is so systematic that its occurrence is likely to happen more often than not in Medell\u00edn or Cali.\n[22] I also find that relocating to Medell\u00edn or Cali is reasonable in the circumstances. The claimants testified about the difficulties they would face in relocating to another city. However, many of these are difficulties that also pose challenges in relocating to Canada. For example, they must find employment and housing here in a completely different cultural environment. The threshold for hardship to make relocation unreasonable has been set at a very high standard by Canadian jurisprudence. War zones and humanitarian crises are things that warrant the finding of unreasonable relocation. In the seminal Federal Court of Appeal case of Thirunavukkarasu it is stated:\n...claimants should not be required to cross battle lines where fighting is going on at great risk to their lives in order to reach a place of safety. Similarly, claimants should not be compelled to hide out in an isolated region of their country, like a cave in the mountains, or in a desert or a jungle, if those are the only areas of internal safety available. But neither is it enough for refugee claimants to say that they do not like the weather in a safe area, or that they have no friends or relatives there, or that they may not be able to find suitable work there. If it is objectively reasonable in these latter cases to live in these places, without fear of persecution, then IFA exists and the claimant is not a refugee.19\n[23] This case indicates that claimants' preferences and convenience are not generally relevant considerations. In another Federal Court of Appeal case of Ranganathan20 it was established that hardship associated with dislocation and relocation is not sufficient to make an IFA unreasonable.\n[24] It was submitted that Cali and Medell\u00edn are violent cities with poor security. While the principal claimant maintained that these cities are \"the same\" as Bogot\u00e1, the associated claimant believes Bogot\u00e1 is less violent. It is indeed the case that Medell\u00edn and Cali experience high crime, but Bogot\u00e1, from where the claimants originate, also suffers from serious crime. The UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) states that urban areas such as Bogot\u00e1, Cali and Medell\u00edn crime rates, particularly for homicides, continue to be very high.21 I have considered that Colombia suffers from serious violence from gangs and paramilitary groups. However, I do not find sufficient evidence, even after reviewing Item 7.13 of the National Documentation Package,22 to demonstrate that it is at such a level to make relocation to Cali or Medell\u00edn unreasonable.\n[25] For the purposes of analysis of the second prong of the IFA test, I considered the Gender Guidelines23 and whether the principal claimant's status as a single mother affects her ability to relocate. I do not find that her status as a single mother undermines the reasonableness of relocation. Women are generally treated equally under the law, but the principal claimant also resides with her adult son, who upon completing his university education, entered the workforce.\n[26] Medell\u00edn and Cali are very large cities with developed infrastructure, essential services and amenities. The adult claimants are both young at 39 and 22, and there is no evidence to indicate that they are unhealthy or would be unable to sustain themselves. The principal claimant has worked as an administrative assistant or business consultant for most of the last decade. Throughout this time she also had a side business. Her son has post-secondary education and last year worked in IT (information technology) until he left the country. I find insufficient evidence to suggest that these skills are not transferrable to Cali or Medell\u00edn.\n[27] It should be noted that there are government programs available for people relocating to Medell\u00edn or Cali for low-income individuals for assistance with housing, health services and education.24\n[28] Overall, I find that the claimants can safely relocate to other cities in Colombia and it is reasonable for them to do so.\nCONCLUSION\n[29] Having considered all of the evidence, I find that there is no serious possibility of persecution, or on a balance of probabilities, a risk of other types of personalized harm if the claimants return to Colombia and I do not accept their claims under section 96 or 97 of the Act.\n(signed)\nPreeti Adhopia\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibit 1.\n3 Exhibits 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and Exhibit 4.1, pp. 9-13 and 14-16.\n4 Exhibit 4.3, p. 39.\n5 Exhibit 5, p. 3.\n6 Exhibit 4.1 Response to Information Request (RIR) COL105522.E, p. 2.\n7 Exhibit 4.1 RIR COL105522.E, p. 2.\n8 Exhibit 4.1 RIR COL105522.E, p. 3.\n9 Exhibit 4.2, p. 9.\n10 Exhibit 4.2, p. 10.\n11 Exhibit 4.2, pp. 11-12.\n12 Exhibit 4.2, pp. 12-13.\n13 Exhibit 4.2 RIR COL103710.E, pp. 15-16.\n14 Exhibit 4.3, p. 33-34.\n15 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP), Colombia, April 29, 2016, Item 1.2, p. 6.\n16 Exhibit 4.2, p. 10.\n17 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 1.7.\n18 Exhibit 3, NDP, Items 1.7, 2.1, 2.2 and 7.9 RIR COL104331.E.\n19 Thirunavukkarasu, Sathiyanathan v.

On the same day, they made claims for refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \"Act\").1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimants are 27 and 25-year-old Palestinian sisters from XXXX. They have lived in Jordan for their entire lives, but are stateless. While their mother is Jordanian by birth, her nationality does not entitle the claimants to citizenship. Their father is a stateless Palestinian born in Iraq. He XXXX XXXX XXXX Jordan in 2002 due to his XXXX XXXX, and has been living in Yemen since. The claimants renewed their temporary Jordanian permits annually in order to continue to reside there.\n[3] The claimants faced discrimination as Palestinian non-citizens. In addition to being denied citizenship, they had to pay for their education and were not included on the honour roll at university. They cannot be employed by the state and had difficulty finding work. They cannot own property in Jordan and do not have access to public health care.\n[4] In November 2015, the principal claimant married a Jordanian national. He did not treat her well and always asked her for money. He would not allow her to see her family. The principal claimant was unhappy in the marriage.\n[5] In late February 2016, the principal claimant refused to have sex with her husband so he raped her. Two days later, in March 2016, he misinterpreted a text message from her aunt and starting hitting the principal claimant. She left her husband and went to live with her mother. Only her mother supported her decision to leave her husband. The principal claimant's relatives, on the other hand, thought she should go back to her husband and would not allow her to report him to police.\n[6] In April 2016, the principal claimant filed for divorce. When her husband received notice of the divorce, he came to her workplace, shouted in the reception area and tried looking for her in the office. A few days later, the principal claimant was working in the community when she saw her husband immediately change directions in his truck as though trying to hit her. She ran into a shop and was able to avoid him. Several days later, he waited for her outside her workplace so she left from the garage exit.\n[7] The principal claimant's lawyer advised her that police would be unlikely to help because this is a family matter and the principal claimant is a ward of her husband. When the claimant went to police to report his stalking, they also told her it was a family matter, that she was under his guardianship and that she was not a Jordanian.\n[8] In June 2016, the principal claimant was working in the community when her husband's brother spotted her. She took a taxi to another area, but then received a call from her husband who demanded to know where she had gone and said he would catch her. The claimants moved to another neighbourhood. Her husband would call her and threaten her, saying things like he was going to burn her face with acid unless she withdrew her divorce claim.\n[9] The claimants left Jordan in XXXX 2016. Their residency permits have now expired and the divorce is still pending. They fear that they will be unable to reenter Jordan and even if they return, they will face discrimination because they are Palestinians without citizenship. The principal claimant also fears she will face harm from her husband who is refusing the divorce.\nDETERMINATION\n[10] I find that the claimants are not Convention refugees as they do not have a well-founded fear of persecution related to a Convention ground in Jordan. I also find that the claimants are not persons in need of protection, in that their removal to Jordan would not subject them personally to a risk to life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. There are also no substantial grounds to believe that their removal to Jordan would subject them personally to a danger of torture for the reasons that follow.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[11] The claimants' identities as Palestinian former habitual residents of Jordan are established by their testimony, Palestinian travel documents and Jordanian residency cards in evidence.2 I am satisfied of their identities by these documents.\nCredibility\n[12] In terms of credibility, the principal claimant's testimony had to be guided towards specificity as she frequently spoke in overly general terms. For example, she would refer to her husband always coming to her workplace, but when directed to be specific, revealed it only happened twice. Likewise, in terms of being followed by him, this also turned out to be only on two occasions. Related to the problem of generalization, there were some discrepancies between her testimony and her Basis of Claim (BOC) form.3 For example, whereas her BOC states that her husband \"used to beat [her] up\" and threaten to beat her more if she did not obey him, her testimony and port of entry interview indicate that she was physically harmed by him only once in March 2016.4 The principal claimant clarified that when she stated in her BOC that her husband used to beat her, she was referring to the single event. Thus, while I accept that these specific events happened and that the principal claimant genuinely fears her husband, her generalizations at times exaggerated her allegations. However, I accept that she is credible because when pressed for clarification, she was able to be specific. Her testimony was obliging and candid otherwise.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution & Risk of Harm\n[13] I will consider the principal claimant's fear of her husband in the next section. In this section, I will examine whether the claimants face a serious possibility of persecution or a risk of harm within the meaning of section 97 of the Act as stateless Palestinians and women. Overall, while I accept that the claimants face discrimination, I do not find that it rises to the level of persecution or would likely cause a risk of harm.\n[14] Women in Jordan face discrimination. The law stipulating that Jordanian men can pass citizenship to their children, but women cannot, is evidence of such discrimination. Men and women are not equals under the law. Whereas men can obtain a divorce by declaring it aloud three times, women must petition the courts. In cases of verbal, emotional, or physical abuse, either spouse may seek a divorce.5 Women experience discrimination in terms of inheritance, child custody, pension and social security benefits, the workplace and, in certain circumstances, the value of their testimony in a sharia court.6 Married women cannot go to school or work without their husbands' consent, although this is not the case if a woman was already working when she married,7 as in the principal claimant's case. Domestic violence and sexual harassment are problems in Jordan.8 The principal claimant experienced this first-hand, but has separated from her husband and filed for divorce.\n[15] I have examined the areas in which women are marginalized in Jordan in law and practice, but I do not find that they exceed discrimination. The disadvantages to women are unjust, but do not represent a serious, sustained and systematic violation of basic human rights or fundamental freedoms that amount to persecution. For example, I find the denial of the right to citizenship to the children of Jordanian mothers to be indefensible and discriminatory. But, I do not find that it rises to the level of persecution in terms of the level and kind of harm inflicted.\n[16] Statelessness per se does not give rise to a claim to refugee status.9 I do not find that the treatment of Palestinians crosses the threshold of persecution. Palestinians are discriminated against in large part because many lack citizenship. I found insufficient evidence of discrimination against Palestinians that does not relate to this issue of citizenship. The claimants argue that they do have access to education, health insurance or property ownership. It must be noted that the claimants have not been denied education and health care; rather, they must pay for them as non-citizens. Jordan does not allow non-citizen children to attend its state elementary and secondary schools.10 Although free primary education is a human right, the claimants are now university-educated. Indeed, the claimants paid foreign student rates of tuition unlike Jordanian citizens.11 Jordanian citizens can obtain certain medical treatments for free or at a low cost at public health facilities, but stateless Palestinians were excluded from these insurance benefits. This is discriminatory given the claimants' life-long residency in Jordan. While the claimants were prohibited from owning property as non-citizens, I do not find that denial of home ownership amounts to persecution. Even when considering it with the discriminatory education and health insurance practices together, I do not find that this rises to the level of persecution.\n[17] It should be noted that in 2015, Jordan passed a bill which enhances the rights of \"Jordanian progeny;\" provided that their mothers have been residing in Jordan for at least five years, they have a right to free high school education and health services in government hospitals, second priority after Jordanian citizens in all professions and exemption from any work permit fees.12 The bill also allows them to own property, make investments and obtain a driver's license for passenger cars. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch confirm that the government enabled the children of women with foreign spouses to apply for identity cards if they have resided in Jordan for at least five years, thus increasing their access to medical care, education, work permits, property ownership and a driver's license.13 Implementation is not yet complete, but this is an important development in terms of the situation for non-citizens and improving discriminatory practices.\n[18] In addition to the issues of state education, health insurance and property ownership, non-citizens are not eligible to work for the government and are prohibited from certain professions, such as medicine, law and engineering, and the \"private sector prefers not to employ anyone without Jordanian citizenship.\"14 As such, Jordanians of Palestinian origin \"tend to gravitate toward the private sector\" due to their general exclusion from the public sector.15 Human Rights Watch confirms that non-Jordanians have \"greater difficulty on the private job market.\"16 It states that the General Intelligence Department (GID) in Jordan reportedly has to give its consent for individuals to work in certain private companies, especially banks and other strategic firms, but that the GID does not give work approval to those without a national number (marker of citizenship).17 Nonetheless, in the claimants' case, both were able to find employment as loans officers. Previously, the principal claimant also worked at a call centre. Their ability to obtain employment in the past makes it likely that they could do so in the future. The employment challenges are discriminatory, but not persecutory.\n[19] The claimants argue that they face persecution because of their father's political writing, for which the Jordanian government deported him in 2002. They maintained that they were denied approval letters by the GID for employment because of their father's political views. I find that this is unlikely the case given the evidence that certificates are not given to those without a national number. Thus, the claimants were not entitled to GID approval anyway. In my view, the claimants' approval by the GID for post-secondary education, and the approval of their residency permits annually since 2012, demonstrate that they were not targeted because of their father. Palestinian non-nationals require a residency permit subject to the approval of the GID.18 The claimants have always been successful in obtaining this. Being asked questions about their father during interviews for permits, and being subjected to interviews itself, does not amount to persecution in my view.\n[20] Without question, women and stateless Palestinians face discrimination in Jordan. But, while these practices are discriminatory, even when taken together, they do not amount to a serious possibility of persecution.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[21] In this case, I find that the claimants could live safely from the principal claimant's husband in other parts of Jordan, such as Amman, without a serious possibility of persecution, or on a balance of probabilities, a risk of harm within the meaning of section 97 of the Act. I find it unlikely that her husband would locate them there based on his past behavior and the principal claimant's testimony.\n[22] The principal claimant filed for divorce in April 2016. When her husband received notice of this, he came to her workplace twice but she was able to avoid him. In April and June 2016, he also tried to locate her while she was working in the field. He veered his truck around in her direction as though he would hit her, and then he tried finding her when his brother saw her. There is no evidence that he ever made direct personal contact with the principal claimant from the time she left him in March 2016, to the time she left the country nine months later in December 2016. Although he called her and threatened her, he did not follow through with his threats in a great number of months. While I acknowledge that he turned up at her work place on two occasions, the principal claimant continued working without coming to harm before leaving the country. He did not confront the principal claimant at home, even though she was living in an obvious place; in her former home with her mother and sister. After the claimants' moved in June 2016, for the remaining six months before leaving the country, the principal claimant was never approached or confronted by her husband in person. If the principal claimant was able to evade her husband, perhaps by moving, and he did not make further efforts to approach her while she was in the same city, I find that he would be unlikely to do so if she moved to Amman. His failure to make good on his threats for so many months make it unlikely that he would carry them out if the principal claimant relocated, thereby eliminating the likelihood that she would cross paths with him. Amman is more than a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX drive from XXXX and has a population of a few million people. Given this distance and population, I find it unlikely that he could find the principal claimant there.\n[23] When the principal claimant was asked why she could not relocate to Amman, she only referred to problems finding work, entering Jordan and maintaining her residency. She was asked whether any other safety issues would arise if she moved to Amman and she replied in the negative. She was asked if her husband had ever gone to her mother's house and she replied that he would not be able to get the address. At no point did the principal claimant suggest that her husband would be able to locate her in Amman and harm her.\n[24] When responding to highly leading questions from counsel, the principal claimant testified that since she is still legally married to her husband, he has the right to obtain her address, could locate her in Amman and take her home forcibly. Even if this is true with active divorce proceedings, I find it unlikely that he would do so given that he did not when the claimants moved within XXXX. He failed to confront her at her mother's new residence over her last six months in the country.\n[25] The claimants' counsel asked the principal claimant what challenges women face when living on their own. In response to this leading question, the principal claimant testified that it is abnormal for women to do so and those who do are considered to have a low reputation. She further stated that women cannot rent apartments on their own.\n[26] I am mindful of the Chairperson's gender guidelines19 and discrimination against women in Jordan discussed earlier. However, I have also taken into account that the claimants' mother has headed their household for over 15 years since their father was deported and supported the claimants by working. At the outset of the hearing, the principal claimant was asked whether it is acceptable for her mother to be living on her own, and she testified that it was because the claimants had lived with her and she now lives closer to her relatives. When she was asked what problems they faced since her father was deported, she testified that there was \"oppression,\" but with time, they did alright. When asked again about specific problems faced, she could not identify any. She only stated that they had to do it. The principal claimant's inability to identify any specific problems lead me to find that there are unlikely to be any that would make relocation unreasonable. The claimants have had more than a decade of experience living without a father or husband in a female-headed household. Despite this challenge, they both obtained university degrees, employment and housing. Amman is well known to be one of the most liberal and Westernized cities among Arab countries. As such, I find that the situation for women is likely to be better in Amman.\n[27] The issue of whether and how the claimants would be permitted entry into Jordan is not within the purview of a refugee claim. My duty here is to determine whether the claimants' refugee claim against their former country of habitual residence is founded. I will note that while their residency cards indicate that they are invalid after six months abroad, there is nothing to prevent the claimants from reapplying for residency as they have done all of their lives.\n[28] I also find that relocating to Amman is reasonable in the circumstances. As stated, Amman is a liberal and Western city. It is also the economic and cultural centre of the country with modern infrastructure and services. As an economic hub, I find that the claimants would be more likely to obtain employment there. If the claimants lived together, they would have mutual social and economic support. The claimants testified that their mother was able to support the family for many years by giving private English lessons. In my view, the claimants would be able to sustain themselves, and their difficulties in doing so does not meet the standard of unreasonableness in Canadian jurisprudence. I find insufficient evidence to establish that relocation for them is unreasonable.\nCONCLUSION\n[29] Having considered all of the evidence, I find that the claimants are neither Convention refugees as set out in section 96, nor persons in need of protection within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the Act. Their claims are therefore denied.\n(signed)\n\"Preeti Adhopia\"\nPreeti Adhopia\nJuly 18, 2017\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibit 1 and Exhibit 5.\n3 Exhibit 2.1.\n4 Exhibit 2.1 and Exhibit 1, pg. 2.\n5 Exhibit 3.1, National Documentation Package (NDP), Jordan, March 31, 2017, Item 5.5.\n6 Exhibit 3.1, NDP, Item 2.1.\n7 Exhibit 3.1, NDP, Item 5.5.\n8 Exhibit 3.1, NDP, Item 2.1.\n9 Arafa, Mohammed v.

He testified that his sexuality was exposed in Nigeria when his same-sex partner was caught with another man, beaten by vigilantes, and then tortured by the police, at which point he revealed the claimant's name as a past sexual partner. There were several credibility concerns raised by the claimant's testimony.\nOmission of vigilantes coming to and staking out house\n[9] The claimant testified that he fears returning to Nigeria because of persecution from vigilantes in his community. The panel draws a negative inference about his credibility because of his omission of any specifics about threats from these vigilantes in his BOC narrative.\n[10] At the hearing the claimant stated that he feared vigilantes who were working with the police and came to his house in a vehicle along with the police on the day his sexual orientation was publicly revealed. He testified that his fear of these vigilantes was one of the things that made him flee his hometown and never return to his house. He stated that he knew prior to completing his BOC narrative that the vigilantes were positioned for months in front of his house after his departure, waiting and watching for him so that they could attack him and give him \"jungle justice\".\n[11] The claimant did not include these details in his BOC. Instead, the only thing that the claimant wrote about the vigilantes targeting him in his BOC was: \"I am afraid that I will be tortured and harmed by the vigilante group in my community because of my sexual orientation.\" The claimant made no mention that these vigilantes having previously targeted him in his BOC narrative.\n[12] When asked about this omission, the claimant stated that he was trying to summarize and then elaborate at the hearing. The panel does not accept that this response explains this important omission as Question 2(a) of the Basis of Claim Form asks for a detailed response with everything that is important for the claim. Some of the events that he did describe in his BOC narrative, for example, about his wife's emotional state, appear to be less relevant to his alleged fear of persecution than the presence of threatening vigilantes, working in concert with the police, surveilling his house for months. If the claimant had wished to \"keep it short\", it seems far more logical that he would have set out the most serious incidents in his Basis of Claim form. Additionally, in his port of entry interview at Exhibit 1, the claimant makes no mention of fearing vigilantes, only mentioning the police. Accordingly, the panel concludes that there never were vigilantes working in league with the police to target the claimant by waiting outside of his house so as to dispense \"jungle justice\" upon sight of the claimant. The panel draws a negative inference about the claimant's credibility.\nOmission of crowd gathering at compound and police bringing claimant's partner\n[13] The claimant states that he fears his neighbours. The claimant testified that after his same-sex partner was arrested, the police brought that lover to his compound. A large crowd then gathered outside of his home, and the police announced to the crowd both that they were there for an investigation into homosexual behaviour and that one of the perpetrators was in the vehicle at the scene.\n[14] The claimant's Basis of Claim form simply states \"the police went to my house but did not see me. My wife was instructed to inform me of the same sex allegation against me. My wife was shocked, sad and wept uncontrollably. My wife called to inform me that the police visited my house in connection with a homosexual investigation.\"\n[15] The panel asked the claimant why he did not mention the above details relating to his neighbours and the police announcing to his neighbours that he was homosexual, details which the claimant indicated he knew at the time that he completed his BOC narrative. The claimant indicated that he omitted the above details because he was trying to summarize. The panel does not accept this explanation. The claimant indicated in his BOC narrative that he has been facing persecution from community members because of his sexual orientation. The panel would expect the claimant, in response to the instruction in the BOC form to \"include everything that is important for your claim\" to include details about the fact that the police announced to a crowd at his home that they were investigating his homosexual behaviour when this detail was allegedly critical in spreading information about his sexual orientation to his neighbours. This would not have added significant length to an already multi-page BOC narrative.\n[16] As a result, the panel concludes that the claimant's neighbours did not gather in a large crowd outside of his home while hearing the police announce that the claimant's homosexual partner was present and that authorities were present at the house as part of an investigation into the claimant's homosexual practices. The panel draws a negative inference about the claimant's credibility.\nBank visits for personal travel authorizations implausible\n[17] The panel draws a negative inference about the claimant's credibility because it concludes that the claimant's testimony about his alleged actions when obtaining Personal Travel Authorizations (PTAs) from two banks to be implausible. Personal Travel Authorizations are stamps in Nigerian passports recording when Nigerians obtain foreign currency, usually for travel abroad.\n[18] The claimant testified that after he found out that the police were after him he decided to travel out of Benin City to go and hide in the city of Ibadan. He states that he did not return to Benin City after that. The panel then asked how, during the time that he was allegedly in hiding in Ibadan, he obtained three PTAs for foreign currency from banks in Benin City. The claimant stated that he had his friend get his passport and obtain those PTAs on his behalf. The claimant testified that his friend obtained his passport on XXXX XXXX and got the PTAs for him at that point. The panel then asked the claimant why the stamps for the PTAs in his passport pre-date this XXXX XXXX date, two of them being from XXXX. The claimant stated that he had the bank set aside PTAs for him in XXXX and that he phoned his account manager, telling him that his friend would bring in the passport later to have it stamped and that the bank back-dated the stamps when the passport was brought in the following month.\n[19] The panel does not accept this explanation as likely. The PTAs come from two different banks. The claimant indicated that he only phoned an \"account manager,\" not two account managers that he would have had to call. Additionally, having two separate banks agree to sell the claimant a PTA but not make the legally required inscription in his passport about this foreign currency sale at the time of the sale, instead allegedly backdating the stamps to make it look like the transactions occurred in a previous month, is unlikely. Finally, the claimant's testimony on this point was not spontaneous. He affirmed that there were three PTAs in his passport and that \"each time\" he would want to use it he would call his friend who would go and get the passport. It was only after the panel pointed out that he had said his friend obtained the passport for the first time on XXXX XXXX and that two of the PTAs preceded this date that the claimant stated that he had made arrangements for these two PTAs to be backdated.\n[20] The panel asked the claimant why he got these PTAs from banks in Benin City when he was in hiding in Ibadan and the banks have branches in Ibadan. The claimant indicated that he did not get the PTAs from the Ibadan banks because it was unsafe for him to leave the house that he was in hiding in and travel to the banks to get the PTAs. Instead, the claimant explained, when he found out that the police were aware of his sexuality and were actively searching for him in Benin City, his mind immediately went to issues with the foreign exchange market and he proceeded to two banks in Benin City where he completed paperwork in order to obtain foreign currency, before fleeing the city and remaining in hiding for two months. The panel does not accept this as reasonable or likely behaviour. It is not reasonable that the claimant felt unsafe setting foot outside in another city to visit a bank, but the day that he found out the police were in the process of pursuing him in his hometown, he remained in public view in that town to travel to not one, but two different banks, in order to complete foreign currency forms by hand, all for foreign currency that he would not need for some months.\n[21] The panel concludes that the claimant was not running from the police and that he did not go into hiding in the city of Ibadan but instead was in Benin City to obtain these PTAs himself. The panel draws a negative inference about the claimant's overall credibility.\nClaimant's friend's telephone testimony and affidavit\n[22] The claimant's friend XXXX from Ibadan, Nigeria provided an affidavit. In this affidavit, XXXX stated that he and the claimant are good friends who have known each other for about 15 years. XXXX swore that he learned that the claimant is bisexual; recounts an encapsulated version of the claimant's BOC narrative, which he states he was able to confirm while in Benin City; and states that he provided shelter to the claimant while the claimant was on the run from the police. As arranged at the end of the first sitting for this hearing, XXXX also testified by phone at the second sitting of this hearing, which occurred about XXXX weeks after the first sitting in which the claimant had testified. His testimony related to the above-noted contents of his affidavit and the events with the PTAs noted above.\n[23] The panel does not find that XXXX testimony is sufficient to overcome the significant concerns that it has with the claimant's testimony and it assigns XXXX affidavit and testimony low weight. To begin with, his testimony was a nearly verbatim restatement of the claimant's own testimony. Additionally, there were small but telling discrepancies between XXXX testimony and the claimant's testimony. For example, XXXX testified that he obtained one PTA for the claimant in the amount of $XXXX from UBA bank, but he did not mention the PTAs from First Bank of Nigeria even when asked specifically about how much money he had gotten on the claimant's behalf. Instead, he testified about giving money to XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX, not receiving PTAs from that bank.\nPsychological Assessment from DrXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\n[24] The claimant tendered a psychological assessment authored by Dr. XXXX XXXX XXXX, a licenced XXXX XXXX XXXX Psychologist in Ontario.4 In that report, Dr. XXXX states that the principal claimant is exhibiting symptoms of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Dr. XXXX states that the claimant has difficulties with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[25] The panel accepts this diagnosis but it does not accept that it explains the reasons for the claimant's omissions, and his shifting and implausible testimony for the following reasons:\n* The nature of the credibility concerns in this case do not relate to a simple lack of memory, but instead relate to claimant omitting significant elements of what he feared from his BOC. The claimant indicated that this was done purposefully, because he intended to elaborate at the hearing, not because of any memory issue. The panel's concerns also relate to an implausible and shifting account of events in Nigeria; this report does not indicate that such should be expected, instead it notes that the claimant had been \"forthcoming\" and \"clear.\"\n* The panel had the benefit of observing the claimant for over two hours of hearing on two separate days weeks apart. The claimant was able to provide sufficient detail to most of his answers and he did not indicate that he was having trouble testifying. He also did not appear to be having difficulties with memory, focus, or concentration.\n[26] As a result, the tribunal does not believe that the claimant's medical condition explains his lack of credibility.\nLetters from Toronto-area organizations\n[27] The claimant provided documents from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (XXXX XXXX).5 The panel accepts that the claimant has attended meetings held by these organizations and that when doing so he identified as bisexual; however, the panel gives little evidentiary weight to this evidence with respect to establishing the sexual orientation of the claimant as a bisexual.\n[28] The claimant provided a XXXX XXXX membership card, welcome letter, and an attendance sheet for XXXX XXXX programming.6 The information from XXXX XXXX states that the claimant has attended three meetings of their XXXX XXXX program. He included a photo of himself at an XXXX XXXX meeting. The panel notes that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is a public facility open to anyone who wishes to join, for whatever reason. Attending events (and having a membership card) at XXXX XXXX, in and of itself, is not a reliable indication of sexual orientation.\n[29] The letter from XXXX XXXX states that the claimant identifies as bisexual and recounts an encapsulated version of his narrative.7 He also provided photos of himself at an XXXX XXXX parade and at the church itself. The letter from XXXX XXXX was not written by someone with first-hand knowledge regarding the claimant's circumstances in Nigeria and simply reiterates what the claimant related. As the panel has found that the claimant lacks credibility, the panel assigns little weight to the letter.\nCONCLUSION\n[30] On the basis of the foregoing, the panel finds that the claimant was generally not a credible witness and concludes that he has not established on a balance of probabilities that he is bisexual. The panel consequently determines that the claimant has not satisfied his burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground or that it is more likely than not that he would be subjected personally to a danger of torture or to a risk to life or to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment upon return to Nigeria. The claim is rejected.\n(signed)\n\"J.M. Prowse\"\nJ.M.

He claims to be Kurdish and a supporter of the Peoples' Democratic Party (hereinafter referred to as the \"HDP.\")\n[3] The claimant alleges that he has been arrested and beaten by police a number of times as a result of his affiliation with political parties. He was arrested in XXXX of 2009 when he attended a demonstration regarding electoral fraud, in XXXX of 2013 when he was attacked by nationalists on his way to a Newroz (Kurdish New Year) festival and in XXXX of 2015 after attending a HDP meeting. The claimant alleges that his home was also raided by police in XXXX of 2015.\n[4] The claimant left Turkey on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and flew to XXXX; from there he flew to Mexico where he crossed into the United States of America on XXXX XXXX, 2016. The claimant was detained in the United States of America as he crossed the border illegally. He made a claim for asylum in the United States of America. The claimant was held in custody in the United States of America until approximately XXXX XXXX, 2016. The claimant abandoned his asylum claim in the United States of America and came to Canada. He made a second claim for protection at the port of entry in Canada on April 20, 2016.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] I find that the claimant is not a Convention refugee as he does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Turkey. Further, I find that his is not a person in need of protection as his removal to Turkey would not subject him personally to a risk to life, to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or to a danger of torture.\nISSUES\n[6] There are two (2) issues in this claim:\na. Has the claimant established his identity?\nb. Is the claimant a credible witness?\nANALYSIS\nHas the claimant established his identity?\n[7] The claimant has not provided his original passport. He alleges that the United States of American immigration officials continue to have it in their possession. This will be discussed further below.\n[8] To prove his identity, the claimant has provided: an untranslated Driving Licence issued on XXXX XXXX, 2001, over 16 years ago,2 a photocopy of the biodata page of his passport issued XXXX XXXX, 2015 with the photograph entirely blacked out,3 a copy of his Family Registration Sheet,4 an untranslated photocopy of his Family Booklet,5 a photograph of his Identity Card issued XXXX XXXX, 2009, almost eight (8) years ago, with an unclear photograph,6 a printout of his Subject Profile from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX indicating that his citizenship is Turkish,7 a Detainee Transfer Notification from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement indicating that his citizenship is Turkish8 and a copy of his father's Family Registration Sheet.9\n[9] I have concerns regarding the fact that the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) has not been provided with any original identity documents containing the claimant's picture. Further, the photographs of identity documents with the claimant's picture are all out of date, being eight (8) to sixteen (16) years old or unclear. The only original identity documents that the RPD has been provided are the Family Registration Sheets and these do not contain pictures. I have concerns, given that the photographs of documents with the claimant's picture are either old or unclear, that the original documents that have been provided may not match the person before me because I do not have any recent and clear pictures of the claimant on official documents. That being said, although I have this concern, given the sheer number of documents both original and photographed containing the claimant's name, birth date and place of birth, on a balance of probabilities, I find that I cannot make the finding that the claimant is not, XXXX XXXX from Turkey. Therefore, I find that the claimant has established his identity.\nIs the claimant a credible witness?\n[10] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true, unless there is valid reason to doubt their truthfulness.10 However, a general finding of a lack of credibility on the part of a claimant may conceivably extend to all relevant information emanating from his testimony.11 I find that, in this case, the claimant has not provided sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to support his fear of returning to Turkey. I make this finding because the claimant has misled the RPD with respect to his original identity documents, I am not persuaded that the claimant is a supporter of the HDP such that he would be targeted by the government and I do not find his evidence with respect to his arrests credible.\nOriginal Identity Documents\n[11] I find that the claimant's overall credibility is diminished due to the fact that he has misled the RPD with respect to the whereabouts of his original identity documents.\n[12] As stated above, the claimant provided the RPD with a photocopy of the biodata page of his passport with the photograph completely blacked out12 and a photograph of his Identity Card with an unclear picture of him.13 I asked the claimant where his original passport and identity card were. He explained that these documents were taken from him by the American immigration officials when he crossed the border illegally.\n[13] However, the claimant was provided with an Instruction Sheet to Detainee Regarding Requirement to Assist in Removal on XXXX XXXX, 2016 wherein it states that the claimant is required to submit his passport and his national identification card.14 This Instruction Sheet was provided to him over two (2) months after he had been detained by American immigration officials for crossing the border illegally.\n[14] I asked the claimant why the American immigration officials would ask for these documents if they already had them in their possession. The claimant restated that these documents were taken from him. I repeated my question and the claimant testified that he did not know why the American immigration officials would be asking for documents they already had.\n[15] I explained that, in Canada, when our immigration officials take identity documents, they issue a receipt. I asked the claimant whether he had a receipt. The claimant did not know.\n[16] Counsel submits that the Instruction Sheet to Detainee Regarding Requirement to Assist in Removal is a generic sheet. I do not accept this argument. The document itself states that \"[t]he following is a list of things you are required to complete within 30 days of receiving this form...requirements will be checked off by the INS officer depending on the facts of each case.\"15 Therefore, it does not seem as if this document is generic at all. It seems as if it is tailored towards each individual claimant and what they are specifically required to provide.\n[17] In any event, when the claimant was interviewed by the American Border Patrol Agent on XXXX XXXX, 2016, he was asked \"do you have any form of identification\" and the claimant answered \"no.\"16 Further, in interview with the American Asylum Officer on XXXX XXXX, 2016, the officer indicates that the claimant's identity was established by the claimant's statements rather than by his passport.17 Again it seems that the American immigration officials do not have the claimant's identity documents.\n[18] Subsection 100(4) of IRPA provides, in part, that \"the claimant must produce all documents and information as required by the rules of the Board.\"18 Rule 7 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules, in turn, provides that \"[t]he claimant must provide acceptable documents establishing identity and other elements of the claim. A claimant who does not provide acceptable documents must explain why they were not provided and what steps were taken to obtain them.\"19 Thus a lack of acceptable documents without a reasonable explanation for their absence, or the failure to take reasonable steps to obtain them, is a significant factor in assessing the credibility of a claimant.\n[19] I find that, more likely than not, the American immigration officials are not in possession of the claimant's original identity documents because, if they were, they would not have asked if he had these documents, they would not have requested that the claimant provide these documents to them and they would not have based their identity determination on testimony rather than an objective document. I find, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant has sought to mislead the RPD as to the whereabouts of these documents.\n[20] I can only speculate as to why the claimant would be unwilling to provide his original identity documents. Perhaps his passport shows extensive travel indicating failures to claim and reavailments such that his subjective fear will be discredited or maybe the passport and identity card are fraudulent and immigration officials would know this upon viewing the originals. Although, as stated above, I am unable to find that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant is not XXXX XXXX from Turkey, I do find that the fact that the claimant has sought to mislead the RPD as to the whereabouts of his original identity documents undermines his overall credibility.\n[21] I acknowledge that the claimant has provided a letter from his lawyer in the United States of America indicating that his Turkish Identity Card and Passport were seized upon the claimant's detention and will not be released until his immigration case is concluded before immigration court.20 I asked the claimant why this letter from his lawyer contradicted the Instruction Sheet to Detainee Regarding Requirement to Assist in Removal from the American immigration officials. The claimant reiterated that when he was arrested for crossing the border illegally, he gave the American immigration officials these documents. He did not explain the contradiction.\n[22] I asked the claimant what efforts he had made to get his identity documents back from the American immigration officials. He testified that he had not made any efforts.\n[23] I explained that, in Canada, when a claimant withdraws their claim for refugee protection, the Canadian immigration officials return identification documents. I asked whether the claimant has withdrawn his claim for asylum in the United States of America. He testified that he had not because he did not know the procedure. I reminded the claimant that he had a lawyer in the United States of America who was assisting him. The claimant explained that he only hired the lawyer to get him released from detention. However, moments later, the claimant admitted that he had also used the lawyer to obtain his bond back and I noted to the claimant that he also used the lawyer to appeal the No Credible Fear finding made by the American immigration officials.\n[24] I find that the claimant likely told his lawyer in the United States of American that the immigration officials had his identity documents, just like he told his lawyer in Canada and just like he testified to at his hearing; however, I am not persuaded that the immigration officials in the United States of America actually have these documents; because, they would not have asked if the claimant had these documents, they would not have requested that the claimant provide these documents and they would not have based their identity determination on testimony rather than an objective document. I find that the claimant has sought to mislead to the RPD as to the whereabouts of his identity documents and that this undermines his overall credibility.\nMembership in the HDP\n[25] I find that the claimant is not being sought by government authorities for his political opinion. I make this finding because the claimant is not a member of the HDP, did not vote in the most recent election and has provided fraudulent documents to support his involvement with the HDP.\n[26] The claimant alleges that during election time, he would shut down his business so that he could work for the party from morning until night. Despite this, he has not taken the step to become a member of the party. I asked the claimant why he was not a member. The claimant explained that he was afraid to become a member. I asked the claimant why he would be willing to shut down his business for the month leading up to the election in order to work for the party yet he would be unwilling to become a member. The claimant explained that he does not wish to become a member because, right now, members of the party are in prison. It seems that the claimant, himself, believes that he does not embody the profile of someone who the police would want to arrest and detain because he is not a member.\n[27] Further, on one hand, the claimant alleges that he would risk his life to support this party and that is why he cannot return to Turkey. However, on the other hand, he will not become a member because, if he did, he would risk his life. Therefore, it seems that the claimant's conviction in the party's goals does not actually extend to a point where his life and liberty is at risk because he is not willing to become a member. If the principal claimant was so deeply committed to helping the HDP succeed such that he would risk his life to support their cause, surely he would become an official member of the party despite the risk.\n[28] The claimant testified that he voted for the HDP in the June 2015 elections. However, the ruling party, the Justice and Development Party (AKP), fell short of a majority in the June 2015 elections so another election was held on November 1, 2015.21 I asked the principal claimant whether he had voted in the second election. He testified that he did not because he was too afraid to vote. As such an allegedly strong supporter of the HDP, who would risk his life if he were to return to Turkey due to his work within the party, it defies logic that he would not vote in the election. I note that this is an election that he was allegedly canvassing for. The November 1, 2015 election was important for the HDP because the party gained 13% of all votes in the legislative elections on June 7, 2015 and entered the parliament.22 It was the first time in Turkey's history that a pro-Kurdish party succeeded to do so by presenting its own lists and not independent candidates.23 Therefore the November 1, 2015 elections were important for the HDP to maintain that representation in parliament. Unfortunately, in November 2015, the AKP regained its absolute majority in the elections and the HDP got 10.7% of the votes.24 Although sufficient to cross the 10% threshold,25 not as much as the HDP obtained in the June 7, 2015 elections. It is difficult for the claimant to maintain that he is a supporter of the HDP when he did not even support the party by doing the most basic of things, voting in the most recent election. Given that he did not vote in this very important election, I find that he was not a supporter of the HDP such that he would be at risk.\n[29] The claimant has provided three (3) letters allegedly from the HDP;26 two (2) are in support of the claimant and the third is in support of the claimant's father, who has passed away. I pointed out to the claimant that each letter has different letterhead and asked the claimant whether there was any reason for this. The claimant testified that they sent the letters to him and they might be the same. However, they are not the same.\n[30] I asked the claimant whether the HDP had standard letterhead. The claimant explained that the emblem is the same. However, in the case of these letters, the emblem is not the same. The first is shorter and wider with bold colours, the one for the claimant's father is longer and narrower with faint colours and the third is smaller, yet the writing is larger, in a different font and separated from the black and white picture. It seems that each logo was pulled from different sources and input on the top of the page.\n[31] The formatting is also different. Where the date is located and the format of the date is different in each letter. The sign off is also different. One lists out Name and Surname, Signature, Title, Tel. and Address; the second does not have any of these markers and the one for the claimant's father does not list a telephone or address. I asked the claimant why the formatting was different and he testified that he did not know.\n[32] Also, each letter has a different stamp. The first has a stamp with the HDP logo, the second has a seal and the one for the claimant's father has a stamp with just the party acronym.\n[33] Of most concern is the letters in support of the claimant are purportedly from the same person, Mr. XXXX XXXX; however, this man's signature is different on both of the letters. I asked the claimant about this and he stated that he did not think the signatures were different. I disagree. I am not persuaded that these letters were signed by the same person as the claimant alleges.\n[34] Given the above anomalies, I do not find these letters to be genuine. The fact that the claimant has provided non-genuine documents to support his claim undermines his overall credibility as well as his allegation that he was an active supporter of the HDP.\n[35] Given that the claimant is not a member of the HDP, did not vote in the most recent election and has provided fraudulent documents to support his involvement with the HDP, I find that the claimant is not a supporter of the HDP to the extent that he would be sought by government authorities for his political opinion.\nClaimant's Arrests\n[36] The claimant was interviewed by an Asylum Officer in the United States of America on XXXX XXXX, 2016.27 The information the claimant provided to the American Asylum Officer with respect to his arrests is much different than the information contained in the claimant's Narrative such that I do not find his evidence with respect to his arrests to be credible.\n[37] According to the claimant's Narrative and his testimony, he has been arrested by the police three (3) times in Turkey;28 however, when questioned by the American Asylum Officer, the claimant had only been arrested once.29 I asked the claimant why he did not tell the American Asylum Officer about his most recent arrest that he alleges occurred on XXXX XXXX, 2015. The claimant explained that the Asylum Officer only asked him information up until the raid of his house so he was unable to tell the American Asylum Officer about the most recent arrest. However, after talking about the raid on his home, the American Asylum Officer specifically asked if the claimant had any other problems.30 The claimant responded that he did not.31 I asked the claimant specifically about this response and he said there was a problem with the interpreter. However, on the claimant's Schedule A, he did not list this arrest either.32 Near the end of the interview, the American Asylum Officer asked the claimant \"have you ever been arrested, detained or jailed in your country?\" and the claimant responded \"No, I have not been in jail, I was just detained the one time at the police station.\"33 I asked the claimant why he told the American Asylum Officer that he had only been detained once when he was telling me that he had been detained three (3) times. The claimant repeated that he was only asked to talk about events up until the raid. I then read the transcript to the claimant and he stated again that there was a problem with the interpreter.\n[38] Although it seems clear that the claimant was not only asked to discuss matters up until the time of the raid, because he was asked broadly whether he had any other problems and actually told the Officer directly that he had only been detained once, even if he was, his home was allegedly raided in XXXX of 2015; however, according to his Narrative he was arrested in XXXX of 2009 and XXXX of 2013.34 The claimant only told the American Asylum Officer about the XXXX of 2009 incident and not the XXXX of 2013 incident.35 I asked the claimant why he did not tell the American Asylum Officer about this incident, again he stated that there was a problem with the interpreter and added that he was not is a good state of mind.\n[39] In addition to the fact that the number of times the claimant has been arrested differs between what the claimant told the American Asylum Officer and what he wrote in the Narrative, the facts surrounding the one (1) arrest he did mention to the American Asylum Officer are different than what is contained in his Narrative. With respect to the arrest in XXXX of 2009, the American Asylum Officer asked the claimant whether the police harmed him while he was detained.36 The claimant told the American Asylum Officer that the police used gas and pressurized water to disburse protestors so he had those kinds of injuries but he was not beaten.37 This is much different than the claimant's Narrative and testimony wherein he states that he was beaten up by police when they attempted to disburse the demonstrators and that, in custody, he was attacked by three (3) police officers who were beating him with metal truncheons.38 I asked the claimant why he did not tell the American Asylum Officer that he was beaten. The claimant stated that he did tell the American Asylum Officer that he was beaten. I read the transcript to the claimant and he explained that there was an interpretation error.\n[40] The claimant also spoke about an incident when plain clothed police officers tried to arrest him. When interviewed by the American Asylum Officer the claimant stated that these officers swore and cursed at him.39 In his testimony at the hearing, the claimant stated that the plain clothed police officers cursed at him and put him in the car. However, in the claimant's Narrative, the plain clothed police officers grabbed him by the collar and started beating him.40 I asked the claimant about this inconsistency and he stated that the plain clothed police officers forcibly dragged him by his clothes, cursed at him and tried to put him in the vehicle. He did not explain the inconsistency and provided a further inconsistent response.\n[41] Given the multitude of inconsistencies between what the claimant told the American Asylum Officer and what he wrote in his Narrative, I do not find the claimant's evidence with respect to his arrests to be credible.\n[42] I acknowledge that the claimant states that there were interpretation issues. He points to the fact that under biographic information he is listed a female and his home town is incorrect.41 By my reading of the form, the biographical information was filled out prior to placing the claimant and the interpreter under oath.42 It seems like, due to a bad telephone connection, the interpreter was changed.43 The claimant had one interpreter from 8:43 a.m. until 9:00 a.m. and then the interpreter was changed due to a bad telephone connection.44 The claimant had a different interpreter from 9:00 a.m. until 11:01 a.m.45 The actual interview process started at 9:07 a.m.46 The claimant was asked whether he could hear and understand the interpreter at the beginning of the interview and he stated he could.47 If anything, the biographical information would have been filled out with the interpreter that had a bad telephone connection, not the one that assisted during the interview that the claimant confirmed he understood. Besides, it would have been clear to everyone that the claimant was not female so I am not persuaded that this was an interpretation issue. This was more likely a clerical error.\n[43] The claimant also notes that the transcript of his interview with the American Asylum Officer it states that he only speaks Turkish.48 According to his Basis of Claim form he speaks both Kurdish and Turkish and the claimant even used a Turkish interpreter when he prepared his Basis of Claim form and Narrative.49 I am not persuaded that the use of a Turkish interpreter during the American asylum process impacted the claimant's ability to give evidence because he chose to use a Turkish interpreter during the Canadian process as well. I, further, am not persuaded that the minute clerical errors indicate an overarching problem with interpretation such that I should discount the large inconsistencies between what the claimant told the American Asylum Officer and what he has put before the RPD. I find that the claimant was not credible with respect to his arrests.\nDocuments\n[44] I acknowledge that the claimant provided a letter from his wife,50 a letter from his uncle,51 a letter from his father52 and a letter from two of his cousins.53 While I have given these letters some weight, I note that they are not sworn and I have not had the opportunity to question these individuals on the information they have provided. I find that these letters from family members do not outweigh my large credibility concerns with respect to the claimant's other evidence.\n[45] I also acknowledge that the claimant has provided a positive decision for his uncle and his cousin, both named XXXX XXXX.54 These claims were decided by other Members of the RPD. I give this evidence little evidentiary weight as every case turns on its own facts and each case is decided upon its own merits. Further, in the uncle's claim, he was found to be a credible witness. I do not find this claimant credible. In the cousin's claim, there were credibility concerns including the abandonment of a claim in the United States of America (like in the case before me) and inconsistencies (like in the case before me); however, even after considering these credibility issues the Member was satisfied that the claimant's cousin was a target in Turkey. This is not the case in the claim before me. I am not satisfied that the claimant is a target. Further, these family members, who live in Canada, were not before me as witnesses to attest to the fact that the claimant was politically active alongside them. Members of the RPD are independent decision makers and are not bound by the decisions of other Members.\nResidual Profile of being Kurdish Alevi\n[46] The claimant is of Kurdish ethnicity. I accept that Kurdish people in Turkey face discrimination and harassment. However, I do not find that every Kurdish person in Turkey faces persecution due to their ethnicity.\n[47] Kurds are estimated to be the largest ethnic minority group in Turkey representing 18% of a total population of 79.4 million, which makes about 14.1 million Kurds.55 A significant proportion of Kurdish people have integrated fully into Turkish society.56 Kurds have historically experienced discrimination in Turkey.57 The main way in which the Turkish state has discriminated against Kurds has been in use of language and education.58 Until recently, the use of minority languages was forbidden by law but these restrictions have now been eased so as to allow Kurdish and other minority languages to be used in education in private schools - though not yet in state schools.59 The Kurdish New Year holiday of Newroz is generally freely and peacefully celebrated with rallies in cities nationwide.60 There have been a small number of reports of ill-treatment by the authorities which primarily concern the police using excessive force in responding to demonstrations involving Kurds, but such heavy-handedness is not confined to Kurds alone.61 Hate rhetoric by some of the Turkish media has been reported, as have incidents of societal violence.62 The numbers of such incidents are, however, relatively small compared to the size of the Kurdish population in Turkey.63 Even when taken cumulatively the discrimination faced by Kurds does not in general amount to them being subject to action on the part either of the populace or the authorities which would amount to persecution within the terms of the Refugee Convention or otherwise inhuman or degrading treatment.64\n[48] The situation may be different for Kurdish journalists, politicians, human rights activists and those living in the south east since the attempted coup on July 15, 2016;65 however, not every Kurdish person faces persecution as a result of their ethnicity alone.\nCONCLUSION\n[49] Given that the claimant has misled the RPD with respect to his identity documents, is not a supporter of the HDP at such a level that would make him a target by the government, has provided fraudulent documents in support of his claim and his evidence in his asylum claim in the United States of America is inconsistent with his evidence in his Canadian claim, I find the claimant to be, in general, not credible. Therefore, I find that the claimant has not provided sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to support his fear of returning to Turkey.\n[50] Having considered all the evidence, I determine that there is not a serious possibility that the claimant will be persecuted in Turkey, or that, on a balance or probabilities, he would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if returned to Turkey. Accordingly, his claim for refugee protection is rejected.\n(signed)\n\"M. A. McColl\"\nM. A.

XXXX XXXX XXXX is also a citizen of South Africa.\n[2] The claimants constitute a family. XXXX XXXX XXXX is the mother of two minor claimants, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXage XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXage XXXX as well as her adult son, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXage XXXX. Their claims were joined with that of a nephew, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXageXXXX XXXX. The adult female claimant was designated as the representative of the two minor claimants on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2012 in accordance with subsection 167(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[3] Identity has been established by means of Swaziland passports.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] XXXX XXXX XXXX is a Convention refugee. The other four claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n[5] XXXX XXXX XXXX husband and the father of the two minor claimants, XXXXand XXXX, is XXXX XXXX who was a member of the People's United Democratic Movement (PUDEMO). Authorities attempted to arrest him after a bridge was bombed in XXXX 2009, but were unable to do so because he fled to South Africa. In their attempt to locate him, police began to harass and question the claimants. XXXX XXXX XXXX was detained for questioning on a number of occasions and assaulted. In XXXXor XXXX 2010 her house was also searched and she was again taken in for questioning. After release she went to live with her sister at XXXX in XXXX 2010. However, the police visited her there and asked her again about her husband. She left the country with XXXXand XXXX in 2012 to come to Canada. She learned from her brother in law that her husband died in South Africa in 2013.\n[6] XXXX father, XXXX XXXX XXXX, is a citizen of South Africa and his mother is the adult female claimant. This claimant is a citizen of Swaziland through birth in that country and is also a citizen of South Africa through his father. He moved to XXXX, Swaziland in 2009 to attend boarding school. He then moved to South Africa in 2010 to continue his studies. His mother moved to Canada in 2012 because his father had problems with the government. He went back to Swaziland for holidays and school breaks, and then moved back to Swaziland in XXXX 2016. During a trip home in 2013 he noticed that his uncle, XXXX XXXX, had occupied his mother's home after his maternal grandfather passed away. His mother told him in 2014 that the problem with the house had been resolved. In XXXX 2014 he found that his aunt was in possession of the property. After his aunt married and moved out, his uncle XXXX told him to leave the house. The police raided the house in XXXX 2016 in search of his parents. His cousin was also asked about the whereabouts of his mother. The police arrived and terminated a party that he was having in XXXX 2017. He saw the officers speak with his uncle. His uncle wanted him to leave and go to live with the XXXX family. He refused to leave the house. Despite the harassment, he did not go to the police. He states that he is not political, although he does not support the government. He obtained a United States visa with the support of a letter of invitation from an aunt. He traveled from South Africa to the United States on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017. After visiting his aunt for several months, he came to Canada on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017 to make a refugee claim. He did not make an asylum claim in the United States.\n[7] XXXX XXXX XXXX aunt is the adult female claimant who raised him after his mother's death in 2006. He began attending a boarding school in Swaziland in 2009. In XXXX 2012 he began attending school in South Africa until XXXX 2014. XXXX XXXX XXXX did not tell him about the problems she was having because of her husband. He returned to Swaziland in XXXX 2015 at which time strangers began asking him about his mother. His maternal uncle, XXXX, was causing problems. He initially stayed at his grandfather's house, but then moved to his aunt's home, but was harassed by XXXX. The police came a number of times in 2016 looking for his aunt. The first time was in XXXXor XXXX 2016. The second time was in XXXX or XXXX 2016, when they slapped him and struck him with a whip because he refused to say where his aunt was. Police returned in XXXX 2016 and asked him if he had any more information. When he said that he did not, they gave him their phone number and left. His aunt recommended that he and XXXX visit their aunt in the United States. He is not a political person, but he does not support the King.\n[8] XXXX XXXX XXXX also raises a second risk factor - forced marriage. After the death of her husband, his family went to Swaziland to arrange a marriage between her and her brother-in-law in accordance with custom. They have gone to her home asking about her. She fears that her children could be used to force her to marry.\n[9] A lawyer's undated letter states that XXXX XXXX was their client and that he was active with the PUDEMO. Most court appearances that he made on behalf of this client were related to PUDEMO rallies that he organized. Attempts by authorities to locate him led them to target his family. On one occasion, this lawyer assisted in the release from detention of the adult female claimant who had been arrested when she went to pick up XXXX XXXX XXXX car from the garage.1\n[10] A copy of XXXX XXXXZimbabwe national registration card and South African death certificate were also filed. He died on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2013.\n[11] The adult female claimant filed a medical report from the XXXX XXXX XXXX Hospital in Manzini, Swaziland, that states that she was treated on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2009 for facial injuries incurred during an assault.2 A police report from the Manzini police station indicates that XXXX XXXX XXXX was assaulted on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2009.3 An affidavit from XXXX XXXX XXXX sister, XXXX, states that the adult female claimant had her children come to stay with her in XXXX 2010 because of problems with the police. Two weeks after her arrival the police came looking for her.4 An XXXX 2012 affidavit was filed from a lawyer, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who is the XXXX of the Swaziland Democracy Campaign and a member of Lawyers for Human Rights in Swaziland. She knows the adult female claimant and confirms that her husband was a member of PUDEMO and that the police have subjected her to continuous harassment, intimidation, abuse and assaults. Her house has been raided many times and she was once forced to relocate, but was tracked down. The lawyer advised XXXX XXXX XXXX to seek asylum in another country.5\n[12] XXXX XXXX XXXX successfully sued a businessman, XXXX XXXX, for assault after she was attacked when she tried to XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX in conjunction with her work as a XXXX XXXX XXXX.6 She was detained by police for a day after the altercation.7\n[13] An affidavit was filed that states the XXXX XXXX was planning a birthday party on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2017, but that the party was cancelled after the police visited and spoke with XXXX.8\n[14] Her husband was born in Zimbabwe. Some text messages ask the adult female claimant to go to Zimbabwe to marry her XXXX. XXXXand XXXX are said to belong to the XXXX clan.9\nCOUNTRY CONDITIONS\n[15] According to the United States Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices:10\nThe principal human rights concerns are that citizens do not have the ability to choose their government in free and fair periodic elections held by secret ballot; police use of excessive force, including torture, beatings, and unlawful killings; restrictions on freedoms of speech, assembly, and association; and discrimination against and abuse of women and children. Other human rights problems included arbitrary killings; arbitrary arrests and lengthy pretrial detention; arbitrary interference with privacy and home; prohibitions on political activity and harassment of political activists...\nPolitical Parties and Political Participation: The government harassed and detained opposition members and openly stated it did not want political parties in the country. The constitution provides for freedom of association but does not address how political parties may operate and contest elections. While political parties existed, there was no legal mechanism for them to register or contest elections. The constitution also states candidates for public office must compete on their individual merit, thereby effectively blocking competition based on political party affiliation.\n[16] Documentary evidence filed by the claimants substantiate risk of arrest, torture and murder of activists with the People's United Democratic Movement of Swaziland.11\n[17] The claimants' testimony was consistent, detailed and supported by reliable evidence. The panel has no good reason to doubt the allegations of fact as presented in the Basis of Claim forms and in oral testimony.\n[18] XXXX XXXX, the adult female claimant's husband and the father of XXXX and XXXX XXXX was an active member of the PUDEMO who organized rallies. As a result of attempts by authorities to arrest him, he fled to South Africa where he died in an automobile accident in 2013. Although one could reasonably expect state interest in the family to have stopped after his death, this was not the case. When her nephew and her son by another father returned to Swaziland in 2015, authorities questioned them about the whereabouts of XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX was assaulted on one occasion by police while questioning him. XXXX has not been assaulted. The police intervention to prevent a party cannot reliably be linked to interest in finding XXXX XXXX XXXX, given that it could reasonably be related to issues relating to the police mandate to maintain the peace.\n[19] Should XXXX XXXX XXXX return to Swaziland, there is a serious possibility that she would be detained by authorities for questioning about her late husband and the PUDEMO. The documentary evidence establishes that harsh interrogation can be used. Although the documentary evidence refers to torture and assassinations with respect to PUDEMO activists, none of the claimants are members of this party, nor are they politically active. State interest is likely confined to obtaining information about XXXX XXXX work and contacts with the PUDEMO. The issue of his whereabouts is moot now that he is dead and XXXX XXXX XXXX has official documents from South Africa to prove it. Notwithstanding his death, state authorities continue to have an interest in interviewing her.\n[20] The nature of the treatment can reasonably be categorized as persecutory in nature, given that it concerns a serious violation of fundament human rights pertaining to the security of the person. There is a nexus to the Refugee Convention by means of membership in a particular social group as the spouse of a person who has been targeted for reasons of political opinion. Given that the state authorities are the agents of persecution, state protection and internal relocation are not viable solutions to the risk. XXXX XXXX has a well-founded fear of persecution in Swaziland.\n[21] Although her children may be asked by police where XXXX XXXX XXXX is, the evidence does not establish that this questioning rises to the level of mistreatment sufficient to constitute persecution. XXXX was assaulted by police once during an interaction, but the next time the police came, they left after he said that he did not know where the adult female claimant was. The evidence does not establish a sustained and systematic violation of human rights that is sufficient to constitute persecution. Although there was one instance of violence, the other instances were confined to asking questions and leaving. XXXX was asked by the police where his mother is, but he was never mistreated by them. The panel is not satisfied that XXXX XXXX XXXX children have a well-founded fear of persecution because they may be questioned about the whereabouts of the adult female claimant.\n[22] XXXXand XXXXare XXXXandXXXX XXXX years of age. After the death of their father in South Africa, the XXXX family in Zimbabwe asked XXXX XXXX XXXX to return to Zimbabwe with XXXX and XXXX. In accordance with tribal custom, she is expected to marry her brother-in-law. In addition, the two minor claimants are considered to be members of XXXX family who want them to join them in Zimbabwe. When asked why they face a risk in Swaziland if the family resides in Zimbabwe, XXXX XXXX XXXX stated that Swaziland respects customary family law and would not interfere with the XXXX family's attempts to compel XXXX XXXX XXXX and the children to go to Zimbabwe. The claimants submit that this interference in their personal lives with respect to choice of spouse and residence is persecutory in nature. Evidence was filed that substantiates the patriarchal nature of society in Swaziland and the entrenched practice of forced marriage in that country.12 It is unlikely that the state would intervene if members of the XXXX family went to Swaziland to compel XXXX XXXX XXXX to marry her brother-in-law. The scant evidence on this issue does not lead the panel conclude that there is a serious possibility that this would happen.\n[23] According to the adult female claimant's oral testimony, her aunt told her that the children must be raised by the XXXX family and that she needs to marry her brother. XXXX XXXX XXXX stated that if she refused to marry him, the family would use her children to force her to marry. She stated that, although the family lives in Zimbabwe, the culture is the same. If they came for the children, the government of Swaziland would not stop them.\n[24] Documentary evidence in support of this risk is found in text messages that are only partly in English. Failure to file an English translation of the foreign language phrases reduces the ability of the panel to read the phrases in context. Although undated, one phrase refers to it having been one year since her husband died. This would place the exchange in about 2014. Reference is made to XXXX XXXX XXXX returning to Zimbabwe to marry XXXX. XXXXand XXXX are said to belong to the XXXX clan. She is asked not to go against the elders and the spirits. The adult female claimant replied by saying that there is nothing much to discuss and that she would not be going to Zimbabwe and that she would never marry XXXX. Although it is recommended that she not go against the elders and the spirits, the communication does not contain a threat against her or the children. According to her Basis of Claim form, the male side of the family is entitled to custody of the children after the death of a male. As a result, the XXXX family would have a right to custody of the children.\n[25] Given that the adult female claimant is a protected person in Canada, she would not be required to return to Swaziland with her children. Should they return to that country without her, the issue of custody under tribal custom that may vest rights in their father's family is not persecutory in nature. The adult female claimant alleges that the family may try to use the children to force her to go to Zimbabwe to marry her brother-in-law. Without an evidentiary basis to establish this risk, it remains speculative at best. She was living in Canada when her husband died in a traffic accident in 2013. A social media message exchange in 2014 asked her to return with the children and marry. She unequivocally refused. Without more, the panel is not satisfied that there is a serious possibility that the XXXX family would mistreat the children in order to compel the adult female claimant to travel to Zimbabwe. The evidence is insufficient to establish a serious reasonable chance of persecution or a likelihood of death, torture or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment on this basis. They do not have well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of their father's family, nor are they at risk of serious mistreatment as understood in section 97 of the Act. The minor claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n[26] Both XXXX XXXXand XXXX XXXX state that they disagree with the current government even if they are not politically active. Given that they have not given public expression to their personal political views, they have not come to the attention of authorities for mistreatment. Although the panel cannot ask people to cease political activities in order to be safe, this is not the case with these claimants. Their life in the community as established by their past actions does not create a serious possibility that authorities would persecute or seriously mistreat them on the grounds of imputed political opinion. In addition, there is not a serious possibility that the interest on the part of authorities in locating XXXX XXXX XXXX would involve treatment that is persecutory in nature or that would likely involve treatment described in section 97 of the Act. They are neither Convention refugee nor persons in need of protection on this grounds.\n[27] XXXX XXXX is also a citizen of South Africa. The facts as previously-determined do not establish that there is a serious possibility that this claimant would experience persecution or would likely be subject to treatment described in section 97 of the Act because of the work of XXXX XXXX in Swaziland before his death in 2013. In addition, for previously-stated reasons, there is not a serious possibility that he would be subject to persecution or serious mistreatment at the hand of the XXXX family.\n[28] The claimants also presented evidence that an uncle, XXXX, made a claim against the property of XXXX XXXX XXXX. According to an article filed by counsel, all land is owned by the king who holds it in trust for the nation except for land subject to a privately-held title deeds. All Swazis have equal access to land for normal domestic purposes without regard to gender. A surviving spouse is entitled to a reasonable provision out of the estate of the other spouse. Land is held by customary tenure which is administered by the chiefs' courts. Freehold land is regulated by Roman-Dutch law and administered by the Deeds Registry. The law provides that \"acquisition and registration of private land of a married woman in either a community of property regime or if married under customary marriage is governed by Swazi law and custom and that property rights of a married woman are dependent on the concept of marital power. A woman holds property rights with the legal status of a minor and owns the property jointly. However, the husband has absolute control over the property.13 The nature of XXXX claim against XXXX XXXX XXXX property cannot be properly assessed based on the evidence presented and no legal opinion on the matter was filed. Tribunals are available in Swaziland to address disputes over land tenure. According to XXXX, his uncle wanted him to contribute more money because his home was bigger and took more electricity. Although he was not physically violent, he verbally harassed and threatened him. He was trying to take over his mother's house that was built on the property. XXXX wanted him to leave and go to his father's place. When the police came to stop a party in XXXX 2017, he saw his uncle speaking with the officers. This conflict in the family over use of XXXX XXXX XXXX house does not rise to the level of persecution. XXXX is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection because of risk from his uncle.\n[29] XXXX XXXX XXXX states that XXXX harassed and threatened him while asking that he leave XXXX XXXX XXXX house because it did not belong to her. This is family dispute over use of XXXX XXXX XXXX house. The words exchanged are not persecutory in nature, nor do they disclose a likelihood that he would be subject to treatment described in section 97 of the Act.\n[30] XXXX XXXX XXXX worked as a XXXX XXXX XXXX and was assaulted by a businessman when she tried to XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX. Although she successfully sued him, she was unable to execute the judgement after she left the country. She also alleges that collection would not have been possible because he has a close family member who works in the royal palace. The evidence does not establish that her children are at risk of persecution or serious mistreatment described in section 97 because of this issue.\n[31] In light of this assessment, the Refugee Protection Division determines that XXXX XXXX XXXX is a Convention refugee and accordingly allows her claim.\n[32] The Refugee Protection Division determines that the other four claimants are neither\n[33] Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection and accordingly denies their claims.\n(signed)\n\"H.
