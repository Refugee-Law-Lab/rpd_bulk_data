They have made refugee claims under sections 96 and 97 (1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (\"IRPA\").1\n[2] The daughters are minors and the Board has designated their mother as their representative. The Board has also taken into consideration the Chairperson's Guidelines Concerning Child Refugee Claimants2 regarding the daughters' claim.\n[3] In addition, the Board has taken into consideration the Chairperson's Gender Guidelines3 with respect to the female claimant and her daughters in this matter. All relevant factors, such as the social and cultural context in which they find themselves, along with the issues of the state protection and changing country conditions were examined and guided in respect to the Gender Guidelines.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The specifics of the claim are stated in the claimants' Basis of Claim forms (BOC).4 They allege the following.\n[5] The adult claimants were not able to pay for the money owing on their credit cards and line of credit from the bank. The male claimant lost his job in XXXX 2014, and the female claimant has been on an extended medical leave due to XXXX and was not employed. In XXXX 2014, the claimants borrowed money from a lender named XXXX XXXX (XXXX). The claimants described XXXX in their narrative as \"a Shark lender at a coffee shop in downtown XXXX 'XXXX'.\"[Emphasis mine] The claimant borrowed XXXX XXXX pesos (approximately $ XXXX Cnd dollars) from XXXX. The claimants could not pay back the loan. Approximately XXXX XXXX pesos was left outstanding on the loan. XXXX threatened to harm the claimants when they did not pay back the loan.\n[6] The claimants believe that they will be harmed by XXXX and his associates if they remained in Chile and believed that they were not safe anywhere in Chile. As such, they left Chile on XXXX XXXX, 2015, and arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2015, and made a protection claim on or about October 26, 2015.\nDETERMINATION\n[7] The Board finds that the claimants have not satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground or that they would personally be subjected to a risk to life or risk of a cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger of torture if they were to return to Chile. As such, the Board finds that the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the IRPA. The Board reasons as follows.\nANALYSIS\n[8] The Board considered the following issues in this matter: nexus, credibility and state protection. Both adult claimants testified at the hearing.\nIdentity\n[9] The Board is satisfied with the identities of the claimants based on certified true copies of their passports.\nNexus\n[10] The Federal Court has held that victims of crime, corruption5 or vendettas6 generally fail to establish a link between their fear of persecution and one of the Convention grounds in the definition of Convention refugee. The Board has been upheld in its finding of lack of nexus where the claimants are found to be the target of a personal vendetta7 or where they are victims of crime.8\n[11] The claimants' fear in this particular case is not linked to race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. In this particular case, the claimants allege that they are victims of a crime and vendetta; that they borrowed money from a loan shark named XXXX, and could not pay the money back. The claimants believe XXXX and his associates will kill them if they remain (or return) in Chile.\n[12] Therefore, the Board finds that the claimants are victims of a crime and\/or a personal vendetta and this does not provide them with a link to a Convention ground. The Board also notes that counsel for the claimants conceded in his submissions that the claimants are indeed victims of a crime and that there is no nexus and thus the claim fails under section 96 of the IRPA and that the claim should thus proceed under section 97 (1) of the IRPA.\n[13] Based on the above analysis, the Board denies this claim under section 96 of the IRPA. However, the claimants have also made a claim under section 97 (1) of the IRPA and therefore, the remainder of this decision will determine whether the claimants are persons at risk pursuant to section 97 (1) of the IRPA.\nCredibility\n[14] The Board did not find the adult claimants to be credible or reliable witnesses. In fact, many parts of their testimonies did not have a \"ring of truth to it.\" The Board found that there were parts of their testimonies that were vague and in some cases did not make sense. The Board further finds that there were discrepancies, inconsistencies and omissions between their BOC narrative and their testimonies regarding significant elements. Still further, the Board found that many of their explanations regarding the aforementioned discrepancies and inconsistencies were not reasonable. The Board will go through some of the more important discrepancies and inconsistencies in this decision.\nProof of Contract (Credit Note)\n[15] The adult claimants testified that in XXXX 2014 they borrowed approximately XXXX XXXX pesos which is approximately $ XXXX (Canadian dollars) from XXXX. The male claimant met with XXXX and signed a credit note (which was also signed by XXXX). The female claimant testified that when they initially borrowed the money they did not know that XXXX was a loan shark.\n[16] The claimants did not provide a copy of the credit note (or any other document) to substantiate that the loan\/transaction occurred. The claimants testified that they left the credit note in their apartment in XXXX. They maintained that they left their apartment in XXXX quickly because they feared XXXX and his associates would harm them. The claimants maintained that they only packed a few clothes and left their furniture and all personal items behind. The claimants then travelled to XXXX to hide at the female claimant's mother's apartment (they remained there until they left to come to Canada).\n[17] The panel asked the adult claimants whether they phoned the landlord of their apartment in XXXX when they arrived in Canada to see if he had put away their personal items, such as family photos, family and financial documents such as the credit note. The adult claimants replied that they did not consider calling the landlord.\n[18] In the Board's view, the credit note is a very important element of the claim as it substantiates that the claimants borrowed and received a loan of XXXX XXXX pesos from XXXX and it would also indicate the terms of the loan. In many ways the existence of the loan (and its terms) goes to the very heart of the claim, for if the claimants did not allegedly borrow the XXXX XXXX pesos from XXXX, XXXX would not be persecuting them and the claimants would not have had to leave Chile and make a claim in a foreign country for refugee protection.\n[19] Furthermore, section 11 of the Refugee Protection Division Procedural Rules states that a claimant must provide acceptable documents establishing identity and the elements of the claim. The Board does not find it reasonable (particularly given the unreliable testimonies of the claimants and the other credibility concerns mentioned in this decision) that the claimants would leave all their personal items at the apartment in XXXX and not take anything with them.\n[20] Even if the claimants genuinely feared that their lives were in danger from XXXX and his associates (which the Board does not concede) and did not take any of their personal items with them, the Board does not find it reasonable that they would not try to contact (while in Canada) the landlord of the apartment which they rented in XXXX to see if the landlord had put aside the personal items (such as family photos, furniture, family heirlooms, and personal documents, and of course an important document for their refugee claim; the credit note). Given the other credibility concerns mentioned in this decision, the Board draws an adverse inference regarding the adult claimants' overall credibility and the truthfulness of the allegations in the claim for not having a copy of the credit note or any document to substantiate the existence of the alleged loan from XXXX.\nDeath Threats in XXXX 2015\n[21] The female claimant testified that neither she nor her husband contacted the police to make a complaint against XXXX because XXXX (XXXX's associate) warned the male claimant during the XXXX 2015 meeting that if he did contact the police that he and his family would pay the repercussions. The female claimant maintained that she believed XXXX would kill the male claimant and the rest of the family if they went the police.\n[22] The panel asked the female claimant why she did not mention the death threat allegedly uttered by XXXX against her husband when the incident of XXXX 2015 was described in the narrative. At first, the female claimant replied that she believed she did inform her counsel of the death threat and she believed it was included in the narrative. She then stated that she was confused (when the BOC was being prepared) and was not well due to the traumatic events that she and her family went thorough in Chile.\n[23] The Board did not find the female claimant's explanation reasonable as to why she did not mention in the narrative XXXX's threat. The Board found her explanation as to why it was not mentioned in the narrative to be vague and confusing. At one point she stated that she told her counsel of the alleged threat but later stated that it was not mentioned due to past trauma that she and her family faced in Chile which caused her to be confused.\n[24] In the Board's view, the alleged threat made by XXXX (to the male claimant) is an important element in the claim; that is, the female claimant maintained that she and her husband did not go to the police because of this threat; that she genuinely believed that there would be repercussions against her and her family. Given the importance of the threat it would be reasonable to assume that it would have been mentioned in the narrative. Even if she was confused due to the events that she allegedly went thorough in Chile (which the Board does not concede), she did put down many other allegations regarding her claim and as noted it would be reasonable that she would have mentioned the death threat against her and her husband and children (which resulted in her not going to the police).\n[25] The Board further notes that there is a discrepancy between the female claimant's testimony and that of the male claimant regarding what XXXX's comments were during the XXXX 2015 meeting. It was the male claimant's testimony that he did not go to the police because he was told by XXXX (during the XXXX 2015 meeting) that it would be \"useless\" for him to go and make a complaint to the police because he (XXXX) and XXXX had connections with the police and they would do nothing. The male claimant also stated that he did not go to the police because he did not trust the police, that some of the police officers were corrupt.\n[26] It would appear that the testimonies of the adult claimants are different as to why they did not go to the police to make a complaint after the XXXX 2015. The male claimant testified that he was at the meeting with XXXX, not his wife, so his testimony was correct. However, that does not explain why the female claimant's testimony would be different on the same point. The Board also notes that the narrative did not mention the male claimant's version that XXXX told him during the XXXX 2015 meeting that it was useless to go to the police because of his and XXXX's connections with the police. Given the discrepancies between the testimonies of the claimants as to what XXXX said at the XXXX 2015 meeting and the omissions in the narrative of the either version of what XXXX said, the Board draws an adverse inference to the claimants' overall credibility and the truthfulness of the allegations in the claim.\n[27] Furthermore, the female claimant testified that during the XXXX 2015 incident, the male claimant was grabbed and pushed by XXXX. The Board notes that this was not mentioned in the narrative. The female claimant again testified that she believed that it was mentioned in the narrative. She then stated that her husband was not badly injured and that she was not well at the time when the BOC was being prepared due to the traumatic events she and her family had gone through in Chile and that she forgot to mention it. The Board does not find her explanation reasonable that she would forget to mention that her husband was assaulted (grabbed and pushed by XXXX); therefore, the Board draws an adverse inference to the claimants' overall credibility and the truthfulness of the allegations in the claim.\n[28] The Board notes that at the beginning of the hearing, the claimants stated under oath that their BOCs including their narratives were true and correct. They did not indicate at that time that they did not go to the Chilean police because of XXXX's comments or that the male claimant was grabbed and pushed by XXXX at the XXXX 2015 meeting. Further, the claimants signed a declaration that the information in the BOC and attached documents (i.e. their narratives) were \"complete, true and correct.\" Still further, an interpreter assisted the claimants in filling out the narrative and the interpreter signed an attached declaration stating the information in the BOC and attached documents were translated to the claimants and that the claimants told the interpreter that they understood the content of the BOC, including the narrative.\nSimilar Fact Situation\n[29] The female claimant testified that another reason that she did not call the police and report XXXX was because she was aware of a similar fact situation that occurred in XXXX where another family had borrowed from lenders like XXXX and that family could not pay the lender back and the husband\/father of that family just disappeared. The Board found the female claimant's testimony regarding the aforementioned similar fact situation to be vague and somewhat confusing. She did not know the name of the family or exactly when it occurred. Furthermore, the claimants did not mention this similar fact situation in their narrative. The female claimant testified that she did not mention this similar fact situation in the narrative because of the traumatic events that she and her family went through in Chile and as such she forgot to mention it in the narrative.\n[30] The Board acknowledges that there would be a residual effect from the traumatic events that the claimants have alleged to have gone thorough (the Board does not concede that the claimants borrowed money from XXXX and that XXXX was pursuing and persecuting them). However, in the Board's view, it does not explain the selective memory gaps that the claimants have demonstrated in their testimonies throughout the hearing. As such, the Board finds that on a balance of probabilities there was not enough credible or trustworthy evidence to establish that the aforementioned similar fact situation in XXXX ever occurred.\nThreatening Phone Calls\n[31] The female claimant testified that she received approximately twenty phone calls after the first call she got on or about XXXX, 2015, requesting that her husband go to XXXX to meet XXXX and an associate. She maintained that these calls were received on her cell phone and that on some occasions the caller identified that he was calling on behalf of XXXX and on other occasions the caller just uttered insults and that she would hang up on the caller.\n[32] The Board notes that the claimants did not mention the twenty threatening phone calls in the narrative. In fact, the only phone call mentioned in the narrative was the phone call from XXXX on or about XXXX XXXX, 2015, asking why they did not pay the amount owing and asking the male claimant to come to XXXX to see XXXX. The male claimant acknowledged in his testimony that his wife did receive many phone calls from their assailants.\n[33] The panel asked the female claimant why the twenty threatening phone calls were not mentioned in the narrative. She replied that she informed her counsel of the phone calls. Then she testified that due to the traumatic events that she and the rest of the family went through in Chile that she may have missed it or skipped it. The panel then asked the female claimant which was it; did she tell her counsel or did she just forget to mention it to her counsel. She replied that she could not remember.\n[34] The Board did not find the female claimant's explanations reasonable as to why she omitted from the narrative such an important allegation as twenty threatening phone calls from her agents of persecution. The Board can understand that the female claimant (as well as the male claimant) was in a vulnerable position coming to an unknown country like Canada and asking it for its protection, with very little stability in her own life and that she was afraid and frightened of her predicament. The Board can further understand that she and the male claimant were anxious about the outcome of the claim, as all claimants are.\n[35] Nevertheless, just because the female claimant (as well as the male clamant) was anxious and\/or in a vulnerable position does not reasonably explain why she would omit essential elements in the BOC narrative (like the twenty threatening phone calls, another family in XXXX being extorted and the head of that family disappearing, XXXX assaulting her husband and XXXX telling the husband not to go the police). In the Board's view, it would be reasonable to assume that any claimant requesting refugee protection would state more of the important elements in his or her claim. Because the twenty threatening phone calls were not mentioned in the narrative, the Board draws an adverse inference as the female claimant's (and the male claimant's) overall credibility and the truthfulness of the allegations in the claim.\nReturning to Chile\n[36] The panel asked the female claimant whether the police would protect her if she and her family returned to Chile. She replied that \"I think that once we landed in Chile, XXXX and his associates would learn that we are back.\" The panel then asked the female claimant how would XXXX and his associates know that she and her family had returned. She replied that \"groups are connected, that they have connections with other criminals.\" In addition, she testified that she believed XXXX may have connections with some police forces in Chile. She stated that the police in Chile are corrupt and some of the police officers are informers for the gangs.\n[37] The adult claimants testified that XXXX belonged or was connected to a Colombian based organization and with such contacts and resources XXXX would be able to find claimants anywhere in Chile. However, the claimants did not provide any credible or trustworthy evidence to establish that XXXX had any connections with the police or that XXXX was linked or connected to any larger criminal organization or that he was involved with any Colombian organization or cartel.\n[38] In the Board's view, it was pure speculation on the part of the claimants that XXXX was involved in organized crime; in particular that he was involved\/connected with a Colombian crime organization\/cartel. The Board notes that counsel for the claimants conceded in his submissions that it was speculative on the part of the claimants that XXXX was involved with a Colombian crime organization\/cartel (although counsel stated in his submissions that it would nevertheless make sense that XXXX was connected with a Colombian crime organization).\n[39] The Board acknowledges that there was some indication in the documentary material filed that there are corrupt rogue police officers in Chile. However, the documentary evidence does not establish that there is systematic corruption within the police forces in Chile. Further, the documentary material does not portray the police in Chile as completely ineffective or that they do not adequately protect the public from crime. Later in this decision, the issue of police and state protection will be discussed in greater detail.\nXXXX belongs to a Colombian crime syndicate\/cartel\n[40] As previously mentioned, it was the claimants' premise that XXXX was a member of a larger criminal organization, in particular part of a Colombian criminal organization. Counsel for the claimants stated in his submissions that it is more than likely that XXXX was part of a Colombian criminal organization\/cartel. Counsel argued if that was the case, it would be reasonable to assume that XXXX with such connections would be a much more dangerous and influential agent of persecution as he would have tremendous resources and contacts throughout Chile and would be able to find the claimants anywhere in Chile. Counsel also submitted that if XXXX was indeed connected with a Colombian criminal syndicate that he would probably have contacts and influence with the police in Chile.\n[41] However, the Board finds that the claimants did not provide any credible or trustworthy evidence to establish that XXXX belonged to a Colombian criminal syndicate\/cartel. The panel asked the male claimant \"numerous times\" if he knew anything about the criminal organization that XXXX allegedly belonged to. He replied no. The panel then asked him directly if XXXX belonged to a Colombian criminal organization. The male claimant replied yes. The panel asked why he did not mention this when asked if he could tell the Board anything about the criminal organization that XXXX allegedly belonged to. The male claimant replied he was about to tell the panel this information. The Board does not find the male claimant's explanation reasonable or credible. The panel had asked the male claimant a number of times to tell the Board what he knew about the criminal organization that XXXX supposedly belonged to. In the Board's view, it would be reasonable to assume that the male claimant would have replied that he believed that XXXX belonged to a Colombian criminal organization\/cartel.\n[42] Further, the panel asked the male claimant why he believed that XXXX belonged to a Colombian criminal organization. The male claimant replied that he believed that XXXX was involved with a Colombian criminal organization because XXXX's associate, XXXX, had a foreign accent. The panel asked whether XXXX had an accent. The male claimant replied no.\n[43] The panel also asked the claimant why he believed XXXX belonged to any criminal organization; whether Colombian or otherwise. He replied that XXXX's apparatus and the fact that XXXX and XXXX had threatened him if he did not pay the amount owing. The Board found the male claimant's explanations as to why be believed that XXXX was associated with any criminal organization and\/or Colombian criminal syndication\/cartel to be vague, confusing and speculative at best. Therefore, the Board finds that on a balance of probabilities there is not enough credible or trustworthy evidence to establish that XXXX was connected or belonged to any criminal organization, including belonging to or linked with a Colombian criminal syndication.\nDaughters' Persecution\n[44] The female claimant testified that if her daughters returned to Chile that they would be murdered by XXXX and his associates. However, the female claimant testified that the daughters have never been harmed by her assailants while in Chile. In fact, none of the claimants have been physically harmed (except the male claimant who was allegedly grabbed and pushed by XXXX during the XXXX 2015 meeting).\n[45] The Board finds that on a balance of probabilities the claimants have not provided enough credible or trustworthy evidence to establish that the daughters would be harmed by XXXX and\/or any of his associates. It was the adult claimants who borrowed the money, not their thirteen year old daughters. In fact, the Board finds that on a balance of probabilities that the claimants did not provide enough credible or trustworthy evidence to establish that they borrowed money from XXXX or that XXXX was persecuting them or if they returned that XXXX would persecute them.\nMedical documents\n[46] Medical documents were filed for the female claimant9 and the male claimant.10 A report dated XXXX XXXX, 2015, from Dr. XXXX XXXX XXXX, a psychiatrist practising in Chile was filed.11 Dr. XXXX stated that the female claimant has been her patient from XXXX XXXX, 2012, to XXXX XXXX, 2015. During this time the female claimant was on medical leave. During this time, Dr. XXXX prescribed also \"XXXX XXXX\" to the female claimant.\n[47] Dr. XXXX stated the following in her letter: \"The patient suffers a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX caused by psychosocial and family related stress. The psychosocial condition prevented her to resume her employment.\"12 [Emphasis mine] The Board notes that the female claimant has been a patient of Dr. XXXX's since XXXX XXXX, 2012, which was approximately XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX before the claimants allegedly borrowed money from XXXX.\n[48] A letter dated XXXX XXXX, 2015, from a nurse, XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in Toronto, was also filed.13 Ms. XXXX stated in the letter that the male claimant first came to the XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2015. Ms. XXXX stated the following in the letter:\n... At our initial visit, Mr. XXXX advised me that he was diagnosed with XXXX XXXX years ago and has been treated with multiple medications since that time. He takes XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX daily to control his XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX.\nIt is important that individuals with chronic diseases such as XXXX have access to ongoing primary health care services to decrease the risk of complications and minimize the development of other related conditions. At this time, it seems that Mr. XXXX' treatments are working well, as his XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He will however, require consistent primary health care to ensure that his XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and to help him to maintain good health well into the future.14 [Emphasis mine]\n[49] The Board notes that Ms. XXXX stated in her letter that the male claimant told her that he was diagnosed with XXXX XXXX years ago (which means he had this condition years before he allegedly borrowed money from XXXX) and has been treated with multiple medications since that time.\n[50] As noted above, it would appear that the claimants had their medical conditions long before the alleged borrowing of money from XXXX. More important, the Board finds that the above mentioned medical documents do not substantiate the claimants borrowed money from XXXX or that XXXX was persecuting them in Chile or if the claimants returned to Chile that XXXX and his associates would persecute them. As such, the Board will put no evidentiary weight on the said medical letters.\n[51] Counsel for the claimants argued in his submissions that the conditions mentioned in letters from Dr. XXXX and Ms. XXXX explains the inconsistencies and discrepancies in the claimants' testimonies. However, the Board respectfully disagrees with counsel as there was no credible or trustworthy evidence to establish that the medical conditions (which the claimants had before the money was allegedly borrowed from XXXX) mentioned in the letters had anything to do with the selective memory gaps of the claimants.\nSummary of Credibility Findings\n[52] In summary, the Board finds that the above discrepancies, omissions, inconsistencies and contradictions show a general lack of credibility in the claimants' testimonies. Canadian courts have concluded that \"unless one is prepared to postulate (and accept) unlimited credulity on the part of the Board, there must come a point at which a witness's contradictions will move even the most generous trier of fact to reject his [or her] evidence.\"15 [Emphasis mine]\n[53] Credibility findings can be made in a number of ways. In assessing the reliability of a claimant's testimony, the Board may consider, for example, vagueness, hesitation, inconsistencies, contradictions, omissions and demeanour. The Board is entitled to make an adverse finding of credibility based on the implausibility of the claimant's narrative and can make reasonable findings based on common sense and rationality in regard to the surrounding circumstances and situation.16\n[54] A general finding of a lack of credibility on the part of the claimants in this case can conceivably extend to all relevant evidence emanating from their testimonies. Based on the above mentioned credibility concerns regarding the lack of documentary evidence to substantiate that a loan with XXXX existed, the omissions between the BOC narrative and the testimonies of the claimants, the inconsistencies in their testimonies and that the explanation as to the discrepancies were not reasonable, the Board finds that on a balance of probabilities the allegations in the BOC narrative did not occur. As such, the Board finds that the claimants are not Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA or persons in need of protection pursuant to section 97 (1) (a) or (b) of the IRPA.\n[55] However, if the Board's credibility findings are found to be unreasonable, the Board also finds that there is adequate state protection should the claimants return to Chile, and therefore their claim will still fail under sections 96 or 97 (1) of the IRPA. Further, the Board finds that this claim fails because the claimants did not seek or canvass state protection in Chile before seeking refugee protection in Canada.\nState Protection\n[56] Whether the analysis is under section 96 or 97(1) of the IRPA, a claimant must show on a balance of probabilities that adequate state protection is not available. In assessing the issue of state protection, the Board is guided by a number of cases from the Federal Court, Federal Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada. In this regard, the courts have established a number of principles relating to state protection and the Board has applied those principles to the case at hand.\n[57] There is a presumption that a state is capable of protecting its citizens except in situations where there is a complete breakdown.17 To rebut the presumption of state protection, a claimant must provide clear and convincing evidence of the state's inability to protect that national.18 While the effectiveness of the protection is a relevant consideration, the test is whether the protection offered is adequate.19 The evidence that state protection is not adequate must be reliable and probative and it must also satisfy the Board on a balance of probabilities that the state protection is inadequate.20\n[58] A claimant must approach the state for protection providing that state protection might be reasonably forthcoming.21 In the absence of a compelling explanation, a failure to pursue state protection opportunities within the home state will usually be fatal to a refugee claim. Where a state is in effective control to its territory, has military, police and civil authority in place and makes serious efforts to protect its citizens, the mere fact that it is not always successful at doing so will not rebut the presumption of state protection.22\n[59] A claimant cannot simply rebut the presumption of state protection in a functioning democracy by asserting only a subjective reluctance to engage the state.23 Doubting the effectiveness of the protection offered by the state when one has not really tested it does not rebut the existence of presumption of state protection.24\n[60] In addition, the burden of proof that rests on a claimant increases with the level of democracy of the state in question. The more democratic a state is, like Chile, the more a claimant must have done to utilize the courses of action open to them to demonstrate state protection was or would not be forthcoming.25 When the state in question is democratic, a claimant must do more than simply show that he or she went to see some members of the police force and that his or her effect were unsuccessful.26 Even where the protective services of the home state have gaps or deficiencies, a claimant who alleges a subjective fear based on criminality must, in the absence of a compelling justification, take reasonable steps to access those services.27\n[61] In this particular case, the claimants did not even make a complaint against XXXX to the police. As noted, the Board found the testimonies of the claimants to be inconsistent as to why they did not go the police. The female claimant testified that she and her husband did not go to the police because XXXX warned her husband at the XXXX 2015 meeting that if he or anyone else went that they would be harmed. However, the male claimant testified that he did not go to the police because XXXX told him at the XXXX 2015 meeting that it was useless to go because XXXX had connections with the police and that the police would not help them. As already noted, the Board did not find the claimants' explanations for the inconsistencies reasonable.\n[62] As the claimants did not make a complaint with the police or any other Chilean authorities regarding the actions of XXXX and associates, the Board finds that the claimants did not rebut the presumption of state protection. As noted above, doubting the effectiveness of the protection offered by the state (particularly a functioning democracy like Chile) when one has \"not really tested\" does not rebut the existence of presumption of state protection.28 As such, the Board finds that the claim must fail on this fact alone; that is, not filing a complaint to the Chilean police or any other state agency.\n[63] Furthermore, the Board has carefully reviewed and considered the country condition articles and reports filed by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) and counsel. The Board notes that many of the articles and reports filed (in particular the articles and reports from the RPD) are from independent, well known and respected international human rights organizations and from state departments and agencies from well-respected western democracies. The Board finds that the country condition documents indicates that Chile is in effective control of its territory and that it has in place a functioning security force that upholds the laws and the constitution of the country. Still further, the Board finds that the country conditions articles and reports indicates that state protection in Chile would be forthcoming if the claimants sought it.\n[64] For example, the following was stated in the U.S. State Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices in Chile for 201429 regarding human rights practices in Chile:\nChile is a constitutional multi-party democracy. In 2013 citizens elected Michelle Bachelet to be president in an election that observers considered free and fair. Present Bachelet assumed office in March. Authorities maintained effective control over the security forces.\nThe principal human rights problems concerned harsh prison conditions; violence and discrimination against women, children, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons; and societal conflict and discrimination against indigenous populations.\nAdditional human rights concerns included reported use of excessive force by security forces, isolated reports of government corruption, anti-Semitism from nongovernmental actors, and child labour.\nThe government took steps to investigate and prosecute officials who committed abuses. Nevertheless, many human rights organizations, including the governmental agency charged with overseeing and monitoring human rights, the National Institute of Human Rights (INDH), noted that security officials accused of committing abuses were infrequently convicted of those crimes.30 [Emphasis mine]\n[65] The U.S. Country Reports on Human Rights Practices also states the following regarding the role of the Chilean police and its security apparatus:\nThe Carabineros [they are military police] and the PDI [Policia de Investigaciones de Chile; they are the civilian police of Chile] have legal responsibility for law enforcement and maintenance of order within the country. The Ministry of the Interior oversees both forces. The INDH [National Institute of Human Rights] monitors complaints and allegations of abuse.\nCivilian authorities generally maintained effective control over the Carabineros and the PDI, and the government has mechanisms to investigate and punish abuse and corruption. The military justice system investigates alleged abuses by Carabineros, and the criminal justice system investigates accusations of abuse by PDI officers. The INDH stated in its 2013 annual report that there were 1,775 complaints against Carabineros in 2012 for \"unnecessary violence;\" less than 2 percent of that number resulted in convictions in the military justice system. The report noted that Carabineros convicted of using \"unnecessary violence\" were often reassigned within the institution. Human Rights Watch reported concern that military courts were not fully independent.\nDuring the year the PDI implemented a training curriculum on human rights issues, including coursework on \"Gender, Human Rights, and Sexual Diversity.\"31 [Emphasis mine]\n[66] The same U.S. Human Rights report stated that the Chilean constitution provides for an independent judiciary, and that the government generally respected its judicial independence.32\n[67] It would appear from the passages above, that civilian authorities in Chile maintain effective control over security forces. Further, the government has mechanisms to investigate and punish abuse and corruption among its police officers. The Board acknowledges that the documentary evidence indicates that there are concerns about abuse perpetrated by the Carabineros. However, the Carabineros are the national police element of the armed forces. In the case at hand, the claimants would more than likely be reporting their complaint against XXXX and associates to the PDI. According to the articles filed it would appear that the PDI does investigate and arrest offenders of loan sharking.33\n[68] For example, in the article, \"Illegal Lenders Harass Small Merchants All over Chile\"34 small merchants were being extorted by lenders (the article was filed by counsel). The article indicates that these lenders were investigated, detained and charged by the PDI. The article states the following:\nAttorney General's Office: Reports of usury increased 80% in one year.\n\"We have observed an increase in cases of usury during at least three years\" said Alejandro Moreira, Under - Director of the Special Unit of Money Laundry, Economic Crime and Organized Crime (ULDECCO) of the Attorney General's Office.\nHe explained that between 2012 and 2013 there was an increase of 80% in the reports of these offences, last year there was a leap from 62 to 110. The expert also stated that the participation of foreign individuals is recurrent in this crime, and that the usual victims are persons who do not have access to the formal money market. Unlike the offence of fraud, the crime of usury has a fix penalty that does not change in relation to the amount of the harm. In this case the penalties go from 61 days to 5 years of prison but the law stipulates an additional penalty, which is the expulsion form the country in case that the guilty party is a foreign national.\nOn its part, the number of the National Direction of Economic Crimes of the PDI also shows increases: from 2012 to 2013 there was an increase from 38 to 52 crimes of usury investigated by this unit and there were more detentions for the same crime, from one to twenty.\n...\nSince 2012, the PDI have increased the arrest for this offence, first in the capital city and then in the capital city and then in the regions. Iquique, Copiapo, Concepcion, Temuco and Valdivia are cities where these loans are already a common practice.35 [Emphasis mine]\n[69] The above passages indicate that the penalties for usury goes from 61 days to 5 years of prison and that the law stipulates an additional penalty, which is the expulsion from the country in case that the guilty party is a foreign national. Further, the above article states that since 2012, the PDI has increased their arrests regarding this offence, first in the capital city and then in the regions, and in the cities of: Iquique, Copiapo, Concepcion, Temuco and Valdivia.\n[70] Simply put, it would appear from the above passage that the PDI does investigate, arrest and charge offenders of usury. The panel directed the male claimant to the article \"Illegal Lenders Harass Small Merchants all over Chile\" and read some of the above passage mentioned above to him and asked him whether he believed the police investigates and charges offenders of usury. The male claimant acknowledged in his testimony that the police does indeed investigate; charge and convict offenders of usury. But he also stated that in his particular circumstance he did not trust the police and that XXXX told him that it would be useless to go to the police as he had connects with them. However, as noted above, the claimant did not provide any credible or trustworthy evidence to establish that XXXX or XXXX had any connection or influence with the police.\n[71] In a report from Freedom House, \"Chile: Freedom in the World 2014,\"36 the following was stated regarding the corruption of the government and its security forces:\nC. Functioning of Government 12\/12\nLevels of official corruption are low by regional standards. Congress passed significant transparency and campaign-finance laws in 2003 that contributed to Chile's reputation for good governance. A 2007 law further improved transparency by offering protection for public employees who expose corruption. A freedom of information law was enacted in 2008, and in practice the government grants the public access to all unclassified information. Chile was ranked 22 out of 177 countries and territories surveyed in Transparency International's 2013 Corruption Perceptions Index.\nThe government has developed effective mechanisms to investigate and punish police abuse and corruption. However, excessive force and human right abuses committed by the Carabineros - a national police element of the armed forces - still occur. An official body created two years ago to monitor human rights release a report in December 2012 highlighting ongoing police violence. While acknowledging progress toward a culture of respect of human right in the Carabineros, the report condemned the \"irregular and disproportionate use of anti-riot shotguns\" and highlighted complaints about sexual aggression against female demonstrators. The Carabineros continued to use excessive force against members of the Mapuche indigenous community in 2013. Chile's inmates suffer from physical abuse as well as substandard medical and fold services.37 [Emphasis mine]\n[72] Again it would appear from the passage above that the problems with the security forces in Chile are mostly confined to the Carabineros. There was no mention of problems with the PDI in the above mentioned Freedom House report. As noted it would appear that the claimants would more than likely be reporting their compliant to the PDI and the Carabineros.\n[73] The claimants filed a number of short articles38 regarding criminal organizations and Colombian criminal organizations\/cartels and extortion in other countries. Simply put, the Board did not find many of the articles filed by the claimants to be on point. In fact, some of the articles did not support the claimants' premise that there was not adequate state protection in Chile.\n[74] In summary, the claimants had avenues open to them to seek protection from the authorities in Chile but they did not avail themselves of these services. Further, the Board finds that if the claimants did seek out protection from the Chilean police that adequate state protection would be forthcoming. Therefore, the Board finds that the claimants have not provided clear and convincing evidence that they would not receive adequate state protection from the authorities in Chile. Accordingly, the Board finds the claimants have failed to rebut the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence.\nCONCLUSION\n[75] The Board has carefully reviewed and considered all the documentary and the viva voce evidence and submissions from counsel and finds for the abovementioned reasons that the claimants are not Convention refugees pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA or persons in need of protection pursuant to section 97 (1) (a) or (b) of the IRPA.\n(signed)\n\"Michael Somers\"\nMichael Somers\nFebruary 19, 2016\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27.\n2 Child Refugee Claimants: Procedural and Evidentiary Issues, issued by the Chairperson pursuant to Section 65 (3) of the Immigration Act, IRB, Ottawa, September 30, 1996, as continued in effect by the Chairperson on June 28, 2002, pursuant to section 159 (1) (h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n3 Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution: Guidelines issued by the Chairperson pursuant to section 65(3) of the Immigration Act, IRB, Ottawa, March 9, 1993; Update: November 1996, as continued in effect by the Chairperson on June 28, 2002 pursuant to section 159(1) (h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n4 Exhibits 2 to 5.\n5 Leon, Johnny Edgar Orellana v.

After their daughter was born in XXXX 1999, the claimant's husband and mother-in-law were still not happy, as they had hoped for a boy. After giving birth, the claimant was required to use birth control in the form of an intrauterine device (IUD) and attend regular pregnancy checks according to the family planning policy. As she and her husband still wished to have more children, after using the IUD for ten years the claimant had it removed in XXXX 2009 at a private clinic. In XXXX 2009, the claimant found out that she was pregnant and went into hiding in order to avoid the family planning office (FPO) officials who came looking for her after she missed a scheduled pregnancy check. The claimant's second daughter was born in XXXX 2010, and the claimant was required to pay a fine before the child could be registered in the family hukou and to resume attending the IUD checks.\n[4] After their second daughter was born, the claimant's husband became distant and stopped caring about the two children. The claimant was continuously blamed by him and her mother-in-law for not giving birth to a son, and suffered physical abuse from her husband on one occasion for the same reason. In XXXX 2015, the claimant had the IUD removed again after being told by her husband and mother-in-law to try for a boy while she was still able to have children. In XXXX 2015, the claimant became pregnant and went into hiding again. In XXXX 2015, the FPO officials tracked her down and forcibly took her to the hospital where she underwent an abortion against her will and was told to report for a sterilization procedure the following month.\n[5] The claimant and her husband went into hiding and found a smuggler to help them leave China. As they were unable to collect sufficient funds for both of them, the claimant's husband stayed behind and remained in hiding. The claimant left China on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015, arriving in Canada the following day. She made her claim for protection inland on XXXX XXXX, 2016.\n[6] The claimant fears persecution on the basis of imputed political opinion as a person who has violated the government's family planning policy in China. She also alleges that if she were to return to China, she would face sterilization at the hands of the state authorities.\nANALYSIS\n[7] The determinative issues in this case are credibility and the forward-looking risk faced by the claimant should she return to China.\nIdentity\n[8] The claimant's identity as a national of China has been established by her testimony and the supporting documentation filed, namely a copy of her People's Republic of China Resident Identity Card (RIC)3 seized by the CIC, and her household register, or hukou,4 the original of which was presented at the hearing.\nCredibility\n[9] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true unless there is valid reason to doubt their truthfulness.5 The panel is entitled to make reasonable findings based on implausibility, common sense and rationality, and may reject evidence if it is not consistent with the probabilities as a whole. The Federal Court of Appeal6 has held that \"one cannot be satisfied that the evidence is credible or trustworthy, unless satisfied that it is probably so, not just possibly so.\" The onus is on the person making a refugee claim to present evidence that is credible on a balance of probabilities to support the allegations which form the basis of the claim. In this case the panel finds that the claimant has not met that onus.\n[10] The claimant testified about the relationship with her husband and mother-in-law, her interactions with the family planning office (FPO) authorities in China, and the couple's attempts to have a son in addition to their two daughters. The panel noted inconsistencies between the claimant's testimony and the documentary evidence before it for which the claimant was unable to provide reasonable explanations. While not every piece of evidence will be referred to in these reasons, the panel carefully considered the entirety of the evidence in reaching its decision.7\nClaimant's passport\n[11] The claimant did not submit the passport she used to travel to Canada into evidence. According to the claimant's testimony, the passport was genuine and validly issued to her by Chinese authorities in 2009, and the smuggler took it after accompanying her to Toronto, telling her that she was now safe in Canada and would \"no longer need it.\" When asked by the panel for a boarding pass or luggage tags that would corroborate the timing of her exit from China and entry into Canada, the claimant answered, \"I lost it.\"\n[12] The failure to provide a valid passport is an important matter in assessing the credibility of a claim. In addition to confirming a claimant's nationality and identity, a passport provides evidence of the route taken to Canada as well as previous travel, and therefore the claimant's location during the events that allegedly gave rise to the fear that forms the basis of a claim. The panel's view is supported by Elazi where Mr. Justice Nadon states that\n[I]t is entirely reasonable for the Refugee Division to attach great importance to a claimant's passport and his air ticket. In my opinion, these documents are essential to establish the claimant's identity and his journey to come to Canada. Unless it can be assumed that a refugee status claimant is actually a refugee, it seems unreasonable to me to ignore the loss of these documents without a valid explanation. In my view, it is too easy for a claimant to simply state that he has lost these documents or the facilitator has taken them.8\n[13] The claimant's explanation for giving the passports to the smuggler is not sufficient. The panel finds that the failure to provide her passport without a reasonable explanation, in addition to the other credibility concerns addressed below, impugns the claimant's overall credibility.\nTemporary Resident Visa (TRV) application\n[14] The claimant was directed by the panel to the Specific Information Research Unit (SIRU) response on file that includes the completed form and supporting documentation in her Temporary Resident Visa (TRV) application,9 and was questioned about the contents. The claimant testified that once the decision for her to leave China was made, she provided her passport, RIC, and hukou to the smuggler who completed it on her behalf. The panel pointed out to the claimant that the information for the names and dates of birth for herself, her husband, and her parents was more or less consistent in both her BOC and the TRV application and asked how the smuggler obtained this information for her parents, since it was not contained in any of the documents she had named. The claimant replied that the smuggler telephoned her and asked for her parents' names only and that she knew nothing else about it.\n[15] With the exception of the biographical data for the claimant and her husband and parents, the TRV application contains information that is inconsistent with the claimant's profile and information as presented in her BOC. In the visa application, the claimant states that she is a XXXX XXXX XXXX, her husband a XXXX XXXX XXXX, and her two adult daughters are XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX In her BOC and testimony, in addition to being a mother of two young children, the claimant presented herself as having XXXX XXXX years of education and never having worked outside the XXXXorXXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[16] The panel informed the claimant of its concerns regarding the inconsistencies in her profile as presented in the TRV application and in the BOC. While the panel is willing to accept that a smuggler might inflate a person's educational background and professional experience in order to increase the chances of a tourist visa being granted, changing the age of an applicant's children would not appear to serve a similar purpose. According to the TRV, the claimant's daughters were born in 1990 and 1991 respectively, making them 26 and 25 years of age in the current calendar year, while in her BOC and testimony, they were born in 1999 and 2010 and thus about to turn 17 and six years of age.\n[17] The panel noted that the family makeup as presented in the TRV follows the general demographic timelines more consistently in that it consists of a wife and husband who married in 1989 and had children within the first few years of marriage in their twenties, as opposed to the claimant's allegations-while not implausible-that she had her first child at thirty and her second at 41 years of age after being unable to conceive throughout her twenties. The panel asked whether the claimant had any photographs of her children or her family that she would be able to present, and the claimant answered in the negative. The panel then asked her to talk about her daughters and describe their favourite activities. The claimant spoke in generalities, saying that her five-year-old was \"young\" and played with other children and that her fifteen-year-old went to school, without offering any additional detail. In order to elicit a more personal response, the panel asked the claimant about the relationship between the two sisters and the older girl's reaction when first introduced to her baby sister. The claimant's only statement in response was that \"she liked it very much.\"\n[18] The panel is mindful of the various factors that could affect oral testimony, such as the milieu of the hearing room, the claimant's anxiety, age, cultural differences, level of education, and the use of an interpreter,10 and took these into consideration when assessing the claimant's overall credibility. The panel accepts that the claimant's level of education and sophistication may not be extensive and her style of communication circumscribed rather than expansive. In questioning the claimant about her daughters, the panel was not seeking copious disclosure of personal details about her children. However, in light of the inconsistencies between the TRV application and the claimant's BOC, the panel strove to ensure that the claimant had ample opportunity to testify about her two young children and demonstrate her desire to have more, and asked the claimant again to talk about her daughters' activities and likes. The claimant provided somewhat more detail about her older daughter without mentioning the younger one. She eventually referred to a meal on the younger child's fourth birthday, without responding specifically about the girl's food preferences, after the panel asked about a recent family celebration.\n[19] In light of the inconsistencies between the TRV application and the BOC, and taking into consideration the claimant's limited response about her daughters' interactions and activities beyond generalized statements after repeated questioning, the panel finds that the claimant failed to present satisfactory evidence to conclude, on a balance of probabilities, that she is a mother of a five-year-old child as she alleged. The panel draws a negative credibility inference as a result.\nPersonal documents in support of allegations\n[20] In support of the allegations, the claimant produced her marriage certificate, her daughters' birth certificates, receipts of family planning fines, IUD insertion and removal notes, abortion certificate, and sterilization notice.11 She testified that after not using any birth control and attempting to get pregnant for the first eight years of her marriage, she gave birth to her first child and was required to have an IUD inserted as per the family planning policy. The panel referred to country documentation that indicates that according to certain conditions, a second child may be permitted, as in the case of couples in rural areas or to those whose first child is a girl.12 When questioned by the panel why she and her husband were not allowed to have another child as a couple with a rural hukou and a daughter as their first-born, the claimant stated, \"That's the request for everybody.\" The panel finds this statement inconsistent with the documentary evidence before it and draws a negative credibility inference as a result.\n[21] The claimant testified that she had the IUD removed ten years later when pressured by her husband and mother-in-law to give birth to a boy. She testified that she went to a private clinic in XXXX 2009 to have this done in secret, and became pregnant a month later. When asked by the panel to confirm that she was unable to become pregnant throughout her twenties and then became pregnant one month after having the IUD removed at 41 years of age, the claimant said yes. She testified that she was required to have an IUD inserted 20 days after giving birth to her second daughter, and that it was also removed in secret at the same private clinic in XXXX 2015 after she gave in to the pressure from her husband and mother-in-law to have a son. The claimant confirmed that she became pregnant within three months of it being removed at the age of forty-five. After this pregnancy was discovered by the FPO, the claimant was forced to undergo an abortion and was told to report for a sterilization procedure the following month. She testified that if she did not report for the procedure, her husband was also at risk of sterilization and therefore went into hiding as well.\n[22] The panel notes that, as per Orelien, it \"cannot be satisfied that the evidence is credible or trustworthy, unless satisfied that it is probably so, not just possibly so,\"13 and finds the claimant's allegations not to be credible. The claimant's evidence is not consistent with probabilities as a whole: the claimant was unable to conceive throughout her twenties but then became pregnant within one month and three months of not using birth control at 41 and 45 years of age; the claimant used an IUD for ten years before trying for a second child at 41 in spite of her infertility history nearly two decades prior; the claimant used an IUD again for four years until her husband and mother-in-law pressured her to have another child at 45 years of age; the claimant was a great distance away in Canada from her two children, one of them a preschooler, in China, as well as uncertain as to when she would see them next, but testified that she had no photographs of them. The panel also rejects the claimant's testimony as unreasonable, making a finding in this instance based on common sense and rationality.14\n[23] The panel considered the claimant's testimony about twice attending a private clinic that her husband was able to locate through a friend in order to have the IUD removed in secret, and finds it inconsistent with the documentary evidence she presented in the form of two receipts from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX clinic.15 The panel finds it unreasonable that a private clinic, performing procedures \"in secret\" and contrary to government policy and regulations as enforced by the FPO, would issue receipts for these procedures that would then identify it and its employees to the authorities. The panel therefore draws a negative credibility inference as a result of this finding.\n[24] Furthermore, the panel finds that this general lack of credibility extends to all relevant evidence emanating from the claimant's testimony.16\n[25] In light of the above negative credibility findings, the veracity of the claimant's supporting documents is in doubt. The panel also refers to country documentation stating that forced abortions and sterilizations are illegal in China, and that a number of officials have been disciplined for forced pregnancy termination.17 Taking into consideration additional country documentation that indicates the widespread availability of fraudulent documents in China, including RICs and hukou booklets,18 the panel assigns the supporting documents in the claim little weight as a result.\nRecent change in Family Planning Policy\n[26] The documentary evidence indicates that in October 2015, the Chinese government announced that it was ending its \"one-child\" policy nationwide and all couples would be allowed to have two children.19 The panel asked the claimant whether this change, in effect as of January 2016, would have an impact on her situation. The claimant responded that in XXXX XXXX where she lived, \"it does not materialize.\" The panel acknowledges that family planning laws in China, although established at the national level, vary in their implementation provincially, locally, and in actual enforcement practice.20 However, country documentation states that the new article 18 of the Population and Family Planning Law \"provides that the state advocates that every married couple have two children and that more children may be allowed where the requirements specified by laws and regulations are met. (2015 Law, art. 18 \u00a7\u00a7 1&2.).\"21 Taking into consideration the negative findings regarding the claimant's overall credibility, the panel prefers this objective country documentation and concludes that the change in policy applies to XXXX XXXX where the claimant resides as well.\nWell-founded fear upon return\n[27] The claimant alleges that she would face persecution at the hands of the Chinese government for her opposition to the government's family planning policy. The assessment in refugee protection claims is forward-looking. Having considered the available relevant evidence of country conditions before it, the panel concludes that as a mother of two children now permitted under the new law, the claimant is not in violation of it. The panel further finds that there is insufficient evidence before it to establish that the claimant, at the age of 46 and not in contravention to the policy at the present time, would be subject to forced sterilization in XXXX XXXX.\n[28] The panel finds the question of whether the claimant will in fact have a third child and therefore find herself in violation of the family planning policy at that point to be speculative. While the claimant testified that she and her husband would like to have another child, there is no evidence before the panel to indicate that the claimant will have another child upon her return to China. For these reasons, the panel finds that the claimant does not face a serious risk of persecution based on her opposition to the government's family planning policy, upon her return to China.\n[29] In light of the above considerations and findings, the panel finds that there is not a serious possibility of persecution on a forward-looking basis should the claimant return to China. For the same reasons, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant would not personally face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or be subjected to a danger of torture upon return to China.\nCONCLUSION\n[30] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel finds that there is not a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground should the claimant return to China, or that, on a balance of probabilities, she would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment should she return.\n[31] The panel therefore finds that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee under section 96 nor a person in need of protection under subsection 97(1) of IRPA.

The interlocutory matter in question concerns the interpretation of Rule 29(2)(a) of the Refugee Protection Division Rules (the \"Rules\")1 and whether the Notice of Intervention filed by the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (the \"Minister\") is in compliance with this Rule.\n[2] By way of background, the claimant arrived in Canada in XXXX 2015, and applied for refugee protection at the immigration office in Vancouver, British Columbia on November 18, 2015. The Minister filed their Notice of Intervention (the \"Notice\") on December 31, 2015. The description of the purpose of the Minister's intervention is as follows:\n... the purpose for which the Minister will intervene in this refugee claim hearing will be by appearing through Minister's counsel at the proceedings to present evidence, question witnesses and make representations.\n[3] The hearing of the claim was originally scheduled to occur on January 18, 2016, but was re-scheduled to March 22, 2016. Upon reviewing the file in preparation for the March 22 hearing, the presiding member (the \"panel\") noted that in the view of the panel, the Notice did not contain the \"purpose for which the Minister will intervene\" as required by Rule 29(2)(a). The hearing scheduled for March 22 was changed to a pre-hearing conference so the matter could be discussed by the parties. During this pre-hearing conference, counsel for the claimant (the \"counsel\") concurred with the view expressed by the panel that the Notice may not be in conformity with Rule 29(2)(a). Both counsel and counsel for the Minister (the \"Minister's counsel\") were invited by the panel to make written submissions to the Board on the issue of whether the Notice is in compliance with the Rules. The last of these submissions was received by the Board on April 20, 2016.\nANALYSIS\n[4] The relevant provisions of the Immigration & Refugee Protection Act (\"the Act\")2 and Rules are as follows:\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act\n[5] 161.(1) Rules - Subject to the approval of the Governor in Council, and in consultation with the Deputy Chairpersons, the Chairperson may make rules respecting\n(b) the conduct of persons in proceedings before the Board, as well as the consequences of, and sanctions for, the breach of those rules;\n[6] 170. The Refugee Protection Division, in any proceeding before it,\n(e) must give the person and the Minister a reasonable opportunity to present evidence, question witnesses and make representations;\n(f) may, despite paragraph (b), allow a claim for refugee protection without a hearing, if the Minister has not notified the Division, within the period set out in the rules of the Board, of the Minister's intention to intervene;\nRefugee Protection Division Rules\n[7] Notice of intention to intervene\n29. (1) To intervene in a claim, the Minister must provide\n(a) to the claimant, a copy of a notice of the Minister's intention to intervene; and\n(b) to the Division, the original of the notice, together with a written statement indicating how and when a copy was provided to the claimant.\n[8] Contents of notice\n(2) In the notice, the Minister must state\n(a) the purpose for which the Minister will intervene;\n(b) whether the Minister will intervene in writing only, in person, or both; and\n(c) the Minister's counsel's contact information.\n[9] Intervention - exclusion clauses\n(3) If the Minister believes that section E or F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention may apply to the claim, the Minister must also state in the notice the facts and law on which the Minister relies.\n[10] Time limit\n(4) Documents provided under this rule must be received by their recipients no later than 10 days before the date fixed for a hearing.\n[11] Section 161(1)(b) of the Act allows the Chairperson of the Board to make rules, subject to Cabinet's approval, respecting the conduct of persons in proceedings before the Board, as well as the consequences of, and sanctions for, the breach of those rules.\n[12] The wording of Rule 29(1) and (2) is clear: in order to intervene in a claim and thus become a party to the proceedings, the Minister must provide a Notice of Intervention, and this Notice must state the purpose for which they are intervening in the claim. The authority of the Minister to intervene in a claim is discretionary, and the Minister does not intervene on every refugee claim. The Minister's non-participation in refugee claim hearings is expressly envisioned in the Act, as exemplified by section 170(f). The panel's plain reading of the rule would suggest an obligation on the part of the Minister to provide a reason in their Notice of Intervention as to why they have elected to file the notice on this particular claim.\n[13] In the view of the panel, the Minister did not state the purpose of their intervention in their Notice at all. By stating that the purpose is \"by appearing through Minister's counsel at the proceedings to present evidence, question witnesses and make representations,\" they are merely listing what they intend to do at the hearing as opposed to why they are doing it. The Minister has not stated what their purpose is for filing their intervention; they have simply recited the obvious role Minister's counsel will play at the hearing when they appear in person once they become a party. The statement in the notice made by Minister's counsel that is defined as their \"purpose\" are descriptions of actions and not the reasons behind those actions, and therefore do not constitute a statement of purpose at all.\n[14] As provided by counsel's submissions, the previous Refugee Protection Division Rules3 only required the Minister to state in their notice how the Minister will intervene and provide the Minister's counsel's contact information. This has changed with the new Rules; now the Minister must state whether they are intervening in writing only, in person, or both; the Minister's counsel's contact information; and the purpose for which the Minister will intervene. In stating that the purpose of the intervention is \"by appearing through Minister's counsel at the proceedings to present evidence, question witnesses and make representations,\" Minister's counsel is merely reiterating the information they are required to provide in Rule 29(2)(b). The only reason the Minister appears in person at a refugee hearing is \"to present evidence, question witnesses and make representations.\" Allowing this type of non-description of the Minister's purpose would make the addition of Rule 29(2)(a) to the current RPD Rules redundant by virtue of Rule 29(2)(b).\n[15] The primary intent of Rule 29(2)(a) is clear to the panel. It exists to compel the Minister to provide notice to the claimant why they have decided to intervene in his or her claim. It is to provide the claimant with fore-knowledge of the concerns the Minister has with the claim, so as to allow the claimant to prepare a response to these concerns. It is an issue of procedural fairness. The panel notes the decision of Justice Dawson in Awan4 as relevant to this issue. While referring to Rule 29 of the previous rules (regarding the timelines for disclosure, as opposed to the requirements of the Minister to provide the purpose of an intervention), Justice Dawson wrote: \"Rule 29, like all disclosure rules, exists to avoid trial by ambush.\" Explaining the purpose of an intervention to a claimant assists in preventing \"trial by ambush\". Counsel's reference to the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Singh5 is on point with respect to the ability of a claimant to know the case against them.\n[16] The Minister's intervention in a refugee claim changes the nature of the proceedings into an adversarial one, putting the refugee claimant into the position of having to defend him or herself from the government's attempts at having the refugee claim denied. The panel interprets Rule 29(2)(a) as a procedural fairness measure that allows the claimant to know why this has happened, in order to more effectively prepare for the presentation of his claim.\n[17] A statement by the Minister explaining the purpose of their intervention serves the added benefit of enabling the Board to better delineate the issues of importance at the hearing so as to conduct the hearing in a more fair and efficient manner. Given the considerations of procedural fairness and the administration of a fair and efficient hearing, the panel assigns considerable importance to adherence of this Rule. While the submissions of the Minister are suggestive of an application to be excused from the application of this Rule, no direct or formal application on this point was made by the Minister.\n[18] In his initial submissions received by the Board on March 31, 2016 Minister's counsel relies on the Federal Court case of Atabaki6 to support the Minister's contention that section 170(e) of the Act enables the Minister to avoid including \"the issues the Minister wished to raise\" in their Notice, as section 170(e) requires the Board provide the Minister with a \"reasonable opportunity to present evidence, question witnesses and make representations.\" In his reply to this submission, counsel references the fact the Atabaki decision precedes the coming into force of the amendment to the specific Rule at issue in this interlocutory matter, and the panel finds this rebuttal on point.\n[19] The Minister's initial submissions of March 31 contain no actual defence of the statement they consider a description of their purpose as actually constituting such. Minister's counsel correctly notes that \"Rule 29(2)(a) does not indicate that the issues that the Minister will raise are to be listed or be identified in the Notice.\" He further states that \"a requirement to list the issues that will be raised at the hearing is unreasonable\", and that \"forcing the Minister to identify the specific facts and issues of the intervention prior to questioning the witness could potentially confine the Minister.\" Minister's counsel then states that \"the specifics of the Minister's participation are only to be included pursuant to Rule 29(3). Minister's counsel is correct on all of these points; however, none of these points exempt the Minister from the requirement to comply with Rule 29(2)(a), nor do they assist in establishing the statement the Minister asserts is a description of their purpose as being such. Minister's counsel has advised the Board as to what the Rule does not require as opposed to explaining how they have met its actual requirements.\n[20] The panel notes that while the Minister is not required to provide the factual basis for his intervention, and that a description of the Minister's purpose need not to be an outline of all the facts upon which the Minister is relying upon. The panel further notes that one of the reasons the Minister was not required to provide the factual basis for their intervention was due to the presence of Rule 29(2)(a). As per the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement prepared by the Board upon the drafting of the new Rules:\nRespondents also requested that the Minister be obliged to provide the factual basis on which the ground of intervention is based. The IRB believes that a rule change is unnecessary as the Minister is already obliged to state the purpose for which the Minister will intervene and, in some circumstances, the Minister is obliged to state the facts and law on which the Minister will rely in their intervention.7\n[21] Furthermore, the panel is not making any finding within this decision that would limit the scope of the Minister's intervention in this claim once they become a party to the proceedings, nor is the panel imposing a requirement upon the Minister that they disclose \"what issues the Minister wished to raise\" in their Notice. In the view of the panel, there is nothing in the Rules or the Act that would constrain the extent of the Minister's participation in all aspects of the hearing once they have become a party to the proceedings. However, in order to first become a party to the proceedings, they must first follow the explicit rules set out in Rule 29.\n[22] In his April 20 reply to the submissions of counsel, Minister's counsel attempts to justify their statement in the Notice as being a sufficient description of their \"purpose\" by suggesting that the word \"purpose\" should be defined according to \"Black's Law Dictionary\" as opposed to the \"Meriam-Webster English Dictionary\" relied upon by counsel. According to Minister's counsel, the absence of the word \"reason\" from the Black's Law Dictionary definition of the word \"purpose\" means the Minister is not required to provide the \"reason\" for the intervention, only the \"plan\" or the \"aim\" of the intervention, which he asserts the Notice did. The panel has reviewed the definition of the word \"purpose\" favoured by the Minister, and finds that a description of the Minister's \"aim\", \"intention\", or \"end\" in the Notice of Intervention all amount to an explanation as to why they are at the hearing as opposed to what they are doing while they are there. This interpretation of Rule 29(2)(a) advances the procedural fairness considerations for the claimant, is consistent with the other provisions of Rule 29 and section 170(e) of the Act, and facilitates the conduct of a fair and efficient hearing. As the Minister is not limited in the scope of its intervention once they become a party to the proceedings, the Minister has not established that they are prejudiced in any way by stating the purpose of their intervention.\n[23] The panel does not agree with the submission of counsel that the Minister is required to \"justify\" their intervention. \"Stating\" their purpose is distinct from \"justifying\" it, and the panel has reviewed no authority that would provide it with the jurisdiction to assess whether the Minister was justified in intervening in a claim. It is for the Minister to state what the purpose of their intervention is in order to become a party to the proceedings, and at that point section 170(e) requires the Board to provide the Minister with a reasonable opportunity to engage in all aspects of the claim. Rule 29(2)(a) requires the Minister to state what their purpose is in order to advise all concerned; it does not provide the Board with the jurisdiction to assess whether the Minister's purpose is valid or not.\n[24] As the panel has determined the Minister has provided no statement of their purpose at all in their Notice, the panel is not in a position to assess the level of detail or amount of explanation the Minister is required to provide in stating the purpose of the intervention. The level of detail required in the Notice is fact driven and may vary from case to case. A description of the issues the Minister will raise at the hearing or identifying the specific facts and issues of the intervention are not necessarily required, and the panel does note the distinction raised in Rule 29(3) concerning the requirements for Notices of Intervention based on exclusion grounds. Ultimately, the level of detail required in a statement of purpose could vary depending on the facts of any particular case. With respect to the case immediately before it, the panel does not know why the Minister has chosen to intervene in this claim, and therefore the Minister has simply not complied with the Rule.\n[25] Minister's counsel raised the Federal Court decision of Paramo de Gutierrez (currently before the Federal Court of Appeal)8 as an impediment to their ability to provide the \"specific factual and legal issues that will be raised.\" Paramo de Gutierrez is a decision by the Federal Court that limits the Minister's ability to question a refugee claimant post-eligibility determination on issues of credibility. While the panel agrees that an inability to question a refugee claimant on credibility issues prior to a hearing could present challenges to the Minister from affording the level of detail in the Notice of Intervention requested by counsel in his submissions, and could potentially constitute a \"purpose\" to their intervention in of itself, this limitation imposed on the Minister by the Federal Court does not absolve the Minister of their procedural fairness obligations under Rule 29(2)(a).\n[26] Lastly, the Minister submits that \"the specifics of the Minister's participation are to be included pursuant to rule 29(3)\", in that only in the event an Exclusion Article is raised must they then provide specifics of the facts and law on which the Minister relies. Missing from Minister's counsel's submission on this topic is the placement of the word \"also\" in the Rule: \"If the Minister believes that section E or F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention may apply to the claim, the Minister must also state in the notice the facts and law on which the Minister relies.\" Ergo, if the Minister believes that an Exclusion Article applies to a claim, they must state in their notice the facts and law relevant to that Exclusion Article in addition to the other requirements of Rule 29, such as the purpose of their intervention. That being said, in the case where an Exclusion Article has been raised, the purpose for the Minister's intervention would at that time be obvious.\nDETERMINATION\n[27] In order to intervene in a claim and be a party to the proceedings, the Minister must provide a notice of intervention, and this notice must state the purpose of their intervention. The Minister has yet to do this, and is therefore not a party to this claim at this time. The hearing of this claim is scheduled for May 26, 2016 and accordingly as per Rule 29(4) a notice of intervention would be required by the Minister by May 16, 2016 in order for them to become a party to these proceedings.\n(signed)\n\"Jesse Davidson\"\nJesse Davidson\nMay 4, 2016\nDate\n1 Refugee Protection Division Rules, SOR\/2012-256.\n2 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n3 Refugee Protection Division Rules (SOR\/2002-228).\n4 Awan v.

Klagsbrun\nConseil du (de la) ministre\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] This is a decision in the claim of refugee protection made by XXXX XXXX. The claimant is a citizen of Iran and is claiming refugee protection to ss. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nDETERMINATION\n[2] The panel finds that the claimant has not established that there is a serious possibility on a Convention ground or that, on a balance of probabilities, he would personally be subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he were to return to Iran today.\n[3] The determinative issue in this case is credibility.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] Regarding the allegations, these are noted in the claimants' Basis of Claim Form (BOC).2 The following is a summary.\n[5] The claimant is a 20 year old man from Iran. He is atheist and he is gay. He fears returning to Iran due to his sexual orientation. The claimant did not know that he was gay until he came to Canada. He came to Canada in XXXX 2014 and once he was exposed to the openness of Canadian society he felt safe to express his true feelings about being gay. In Iran the claimant felt isolated and could not connect with his classmates. He knew he was different, but he could not find the real reasons for feeling or being different.\n[6] The claimant had a relationship with another boy when he was 15, but this relationship was stopped when a school director found out and threatened the claimant. The claimant was afraid of his parents because they are religious fanatics.\n[7] When the claimant was in high school he got into trouble for questioning freedom of religion in Iran.\n[8] The claimant waited 11 months to make his claim in Canada because the claimant experienced a gradual sense of being gay and that when his status was going to expire he realized he could not return to Iran.\n[9] The claimant made a claim for protection in Canada.\nIDENTITY\n[10] The claimant's identity as a national of Iran was established by his testimony and by the supporting documents filed, such as his Iranian passport.3 The claimant's identity as an atheist was not established. The claimant's identity as a gay man was not established. The analysis follows.\nCREDIBLITY\n[11] In assessing credibility, the panel was mindful of the claimant's education, and background. The panel is also cognizant of the many difficulties faced by claimants in establishing a claim, including cultural factors, the milieu of the hearing room, and the stress inherent in responding to oral questions through an interpreter, and nervousness. However, the panel finds the claimant's testimony not to be credible with respect to the central allegations of his claim.\n[12] The claimant said he realized he was gay when he was 19 years old. The claimant turned 20 in XXXX 2016. The claimant said he is not in a same sex relationship at the moment, and he is yet to date a man in Canada. The claimant said he has had one same sex relationship and this was with a man named XXXX. When asked when he was involved in this relationship the claimant he was 15 or 16 years old. He said he was in grade three of elementary school. The\nclaimant clarified that this was before high school. However in the claimant's port of entry (POE) notes he states that he started high school in XXXX 2010.4 In XXXX 2010 the claimant was 14 so he could not have started his relationship at 15 before he started high school. When asked to respond, the claimant first stated that there must be a mistake in the conversion of the dates from the Iranian calendar. When it was pointed out to the claimant that there is no conversion required for him stating his age of 15 and him stating that he was in elementary school, the claimant said he must have mixed up the dates when he completed his forms. He said maybe he started high school in 2009. The panel does not accept this explanation as reasonable. The claimant stated that he was in elementary school, grade three, when he entered into a relationship with XXXX. If the claimant started high school in 2009 and not 2010 then there is more of an inconsistency regarding how old he was when he began his relationship with XXXX. The claimant clarified while questioned by his counsel that by elementary school he meant guidance school, which is the school you attend for three years prior to entering high school in Iran. In the panel's view if the claimant was involved in one same sex relationship in his life, and he was caught at school in a romantic situation with this person, it is reasonable to expect the claimant to be able to recall with consistency whether this occurred at high school or at guidance school. As such the panel is drawing a negative inference regarding the claimant's credibility.\n[13] The claimant later said that he entered into the relationship in guidance school and then it continued on into high school. However this was not offered at the time he was questioned originally. This explanation was offered to try and explain the inconsistency in the claimant's evidence. The panel does not accept this explanation as reasonable. The claimant states in his BOC that when he was 15 years old he had an attraction to one of his class mates but shortly after the director of the high school found out. Later in his evidence the claimant was describing an incident in XXXX 2010, he said this was just before he began his relationship with XXXX. He began his relationship with XXXX just before Iranian New Year, which is in March, and it lasted XXXX months therefore the relationship would be XXXX XXXX XXXX 2011 - XXXX XXXX XXXX 2011. The claimant turned 15 XXXX 2011. Therefore the claimant's explanation that the relationship\nstarted in elementary\/guidance school and continued into high school, does not make sense. The claimant also mentioned a summer break between guidance school and high school. If the relationship started in guidance school and continued into high school, the relationship would have lasted XXXX or XXXX months and not XXXX months as the claimant described during the hearing. As such the panel is drawing a negative inference regarding the claimant's credibility.\n[14] Counsel submits that the claimant was so traumatized that he could not be expected to recall this part of his life. However, the claimant did not say that he could not remember this part of his life. He said the relationship was during elementary school at 15 years of age and this is inconsistent with the evidence in his BOC and in his POE forms.\n[15] The claimant states that he has friends in Canada that know he is gay. However, the claimant has not brought any of these friends forward to act on his behalf as a witness. In response the claimant said that his family does not know that he is gay and his Iranian friends do not know that he is gay, it is just his friends at the XXXX XXXX he has recently joined that know he is gay. In the panel's view, if he claimant has friends in Canada that know him to be gay it is reasonable to expect that the claimant would offer these friends as witnesses in support of his identity.\n[16] The claimant has brought a Facebook post which shows a comment he made two weeks ago on the XXXX XXXX Facebook page.5 The claimant has a letter from the XXXX XXXX XXXX6 The letter does not state that the claimant is gay, but the letter does states that the claimant is involved in the organization in an effort to start his own LGBT group at school. The letter is dated about one week prior to the hearing and the claimant confirmed that he joined the group in XXXX 2015. At this time the claimant was also beginning to make his refugee claim. The claimant's POE forms were signed on December 15, 2015. In the panel's view, given the credibility concerns in this case, the panel is giving these documents little weight in regards to establishing the claimant's identity as a gay man. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities,\nthat the claimant joined the XXXX XXXX and commented on their Facebook page in order to bolster his refugee claim and not because he is gay.\n[17] During submissions counsel noted that the claimant cannot return to Iran because he is an Atheist. However this was not mentioned in his BOC. The claimant noted in his BOC that he is afraid to return to Iran because he is gay. He explained his delay in claiming in Canada because he did not consider making a claim in Canada until he realized that he was gay and this was sometime after he had already arrived in Canada. In the panel's view if the claimant feared returning to Iran also because he was Atheist, the explanation for the delay does not make sense.\n[18] The BOC notes the claimant knew he was Atheist before he came to Canada, and he did not put forward a claim for protection until he realized that he was gay. The claimant states that he has been Atheist since he was 15. He stopped going to mosque, and he stopped practicing Islam. Although his parents were religious fanatics, they could not stop him from turning away from his religion. The claimant's BOC indicates that he is Atheist and he against the teachings of Islam, but there is no indication that he has a fear due to the fact he is an Atheist. In response the claimant said that everyone knows that you cannot be an Atheist in Iran. However, the claimant lived in Iran as an Atheist for several years before he came to Canada. In the panel's view if the claimant were truly afraid of returning to Iran because he is an Atheist this should have been noted in his BOC. As such, the panel is drawing a negative inference regarding the claimant's credibility.\n[19] The claimant states that in XXXX 2010, before he started going to high school, he was detained by the religious police in Iran. He was taken into their car and warned not to express his ideas on politics and religion. The religious police threatened the claimant. The claimant was terrified over the consequences. He realized another student's father was a member of the revolutionary guard. However this incident is not noted in the claimant's BOC. In response the claimant said he did mention that he got in trouble but he did not provide the details as he was planning on doing this at the hearing. The panel does not accept this explanation as reasonable. The BOC asks the claimant if he has ever been harmed, mistreated, or threatened by any person or group. The question asks the claimant to provide details including who threatened him and the\ndates of the events. The claimant did neither in regards to him being threatened by the religious police in XXXX 2010 and him being terrified. In his BOC he says that he got in trouble. In the panel's view if this event occurred, and the claimant was threatened by Iranian authorities, it is reasonable to expect that the claimant would be able to recall this when he was filling out his BOC. The claimant was represented by counsel at the time of his filling out his BOC. As such, the panel is drawing a negative inference regarding the claimant's credibility.\n[20] The claimant states that he was still in guidance school when he was taken by the religious police. However in his BOC he states that he was 15 and he was in high school. Again the claimant has not provided consistent information regarding where and when the event occurred. The claimant turned 15 in 2011. In response to this concern the claimant said that he did not give the correct dates. The panel does not accept this explanation as reasonable. In the panel's' view if this event occurred, it is reasonable to expect that the claimant would be able to recall with consistency which school he was attending at the time, whether it was guidance school or high school. It is reasonable to expect that the claimant would also be able to recall how old he was when this occurred. As such, the panel is drawing a negative inference regarding the claimant's credibility.\n[21] Counsel submits that the claimant has suffered traumatic experiences and that is why he is not consistent with his evidence, and that it is reasonable that he has shut out this information from his mind. However, the claimant has not provided any medical documentation to corroborate any psychological impediment related to his ability to provide evidence. Further, the claimant did not say, for example, that he could not remember which school he was going to when the events occurred. He provided inconsistent information regarding these events.\n[22] Given the serious credibility concerns, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is not gay. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is not an Atheist.\nCONCLUSION\n[23] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant has not established that there is a serious possibility on a Convention ground, or that on a balance of probabilities, he would personally be subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if they were to return to Iran. The panel rejects the claim.\n(signed)\n\"C. Gibbs\"\nC.

The provisions of the IRPA, subsection 170(f), provides that the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) may allow a claim for refugee protection without a hearing, unless the Minister has notified the Division of the Minister's intention to intervene within the time limit set out in the RPD Rules.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] The panel finds the claimants to be Convention refugees.\nALLEGATIONS\n[5] These are noted in the claimants' Basis of claim (BOC) forms and the separate BOC Narrative for the principal claimant, which he has signed and dated.1 The original BOCs were signed by the principal claimant and his spouse, XXXX XXXX, and the principal claimant signed the minor claimants' BOCs.\n[6] The adult claimants declared that the information provided in the BOCs was complete, true and correct, and they indicated that they could read and understand English, and that neither required an interpreter.\n[7] The claimants' allegations can be summarized as follows:\n[8] The adult claimants were both born in Syria, but have spent most of their lives in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), where they received their education and both worked. Their children, the minor claimants, were all born in the UAE.\n[9] The claimants allege that they are Sunni Muslims by religion, and that their only family member still remaining in Syria, the principal claimant's sister, resides in XXXX. Both of the adult claimants' parents and other siblings all reside in the UAE, according to their BOCs.\n[10] The principal claimant states that his two nephews still living in Syria were arrested while participating in a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in 2013. As he was listed as XXXX XXXX XXXX contact of his nephews, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Syrian Intelligence Services started asking about him in his hometown of XXXX, and visited the home his parents still own there.\n[11] The principal claimant also states that he and his family's religious affiliation as Sunnis would also lead them to be perceived as being opposed to the Assad regime. He also writes that their lengthy stay outside of Syria, and the fact that the children have never in fact resided there, would make it very difficult for them to return there now, given the current country conditions.\n[12] The claimants have family members in Canada and have visited previously, according to stamps in their passports, copies of which are on file. The claimants were visiting again in XXXX, 2016, when the principal claimant learned that his UAE residence visa had been cancelled. He had previously lost his long-term employment and was in the process of seeking new employment in the UAE when this occurred.\n[13] The claimants decided to make inland claims for refugee protection, as they fear to return to Syria, their only country of nationality.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[14] The claimants' identities were established by the copies of their Syrian passports their family civil record, and birth certificates for each the minor claimants issued by the registry office of XXXX, Syria, through the Syrian consulate in XXXX XXXX.2\n[15] The UAE residence visa of the female claimant, XXXX XXXX, indicates that it is valid until XXXX XXXX, 2017.3 However, she states in her BOC that she also fears being forced to return to Syria to renew her passport and maintain this status.4\n[16] The panel is satisfied from a review of documents in the Boards' NDP on the UAE that the female claimant's possession of a residence permit for the UAE does not raise the possibility of exclusion from refugee protection under section 98 of IRPA.5\nCredibility\n[17] The panel has reviewed the claimant's BOCs, the narrative of the principal claimant, and their refugee intake forms, and GCMS notes on file. The panel has also considered the country condition documents contained in counsel's disclosure and the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Syria.6\n[18] After reviewing all of the evidence, the panel finds the claimant's evidence to be both internally consistent and consistent with the objective country condition documents. The panel also notes that the claimants have provided documents confirming their religious affiliation, and that the principal claimant's allegation that he lost his employment at the XXXX XXXX XXXXeffective XXXX, 2015.7\n[19] The panel has no reason to doubt the truthfulness of the claimant's account and therefore finds the claimants' allegations to be credible.\n[20] There is an abundance of information before the panel regarding the current country conditions in Syria in the NDP. It contains numerous reports and documents from a variety of reliable sources, including human rights organizations, other NGOs, government agencies such as the US Department of State and the UK Home Office, and international agencies, such as the UNHCR.\n[21] In the panel's view, the situation in Syria is dire, with little to no protection available for civilians. According to a December, 2014 UK Home office report on the security and humanitarian situation in Syria:\nA third of Syria's population is displaced and the total number of people in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria has reached 11 million. Mass daily displacements continue to occur, including multiple displacements, civilians are denied humanitarian assistance and starvation is being used as a weapon of war. All parties to the conflict have been implicated in targeting vital services resulting in interruptions to the supply of safe drinking water and electricity. Both government forces and non-state armed groups have sought to deprive the overwhelmingly civilian population within besieged areas of the basic necessities of life, by cutting water and power supplies, denying access to food supplies, medicine and medical care, and preventing the movement of people into and from the areas under siege.8\n[22] The documents in the NDP describe the horrific human rights abuses being perpetrated by all parties to the conflict in Syria, and amply corroborate the claimant's concerns about their safety. According to a recent Amnesty International report :\nSyria's internal armed conflict continued relentlessly through the year and saw both government forces and non-state armed groups commit extensive war crimes and gross human rights abuses with impunity... Security forces arbitrarily arrested or continued to detain thousands, including peaceful activists, human rights defenders, media and humanitarian workers, and children, subjecting some to enforced disappearance and others to prolonged detention or unfair trials. Security forces systematically tortured and otherwise ill-treated detainees with impunity; thousands of detainees reportedly died due to torture or harsh conditions.9\n[23] The panel notes that the UNHCR most recent document on international protection considerations for Syrians indicates that almost all citizens of Syria appear to be at risk for harm and in need of international protection, including those who oppose or are perceived to oppose the government, and members of religious groups, including Sunnis.10 As well, the claimants' status as long-time expatriates without many close family members in Syria would also put them at greater risk of harm at the hands of other armed groups for kidnapping or other criminally-motivated behaviour, according to the country condition documents.\nState Protection\n[24] The panel finds that adequate state protection would not be forthcoming to the claimants in Syria, on a balance of probabilities, as the country is in a state of chaos and general insecurity. Also, the claimants fear state actors, and the country condition documents indicate that the regime continues to engage in egregious human rights abuses with little or no consequences for the perpetrators.\n[25] As noted in the US Department of State report, \"impunity was pervasive and deeply imbedded in the security forces and elsewhere in the regime, since the regime did not attempt to investigate, punish, arrest or prosecute officials who violated human rights. The regime often sheltered and encouraged those in its ranks to commit abuses.\"11\nInternal flight alternative\n[26] The panel finds that there would not be any safe or accessible internal flight alternative for these claimants anywhere in Syria, on a balance of probabilities. The country condition documents establish that they would face a risk of harm and a limited ability to travel throughout Syria.\n[27] The above-cited UK Home office report concludes the following on this issue:\n\"Internal relocation within Syria to escape any risk from indiscriminate violence is extremely unlikely to be possible or reasonable because of the highly limited ability to move, and move safely, from one part of Syria to another part of the country and the unpredictability of the violence in areas of proposed relocation coupled with the humanitarian situation for those internally displaced.\"12\nCONCLUSION\n[28] Having considered the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimants have established a serious possibility of harm amounting to persecution based on two Convention ground, namely their imputed political opinion and religion, in Syria.\n[29] The Refugee Protection Division accepts these claims.\n(signed)\n\"Maureen Carty\"\nMaureen Carty\nMarch 7, 2016\nDate\n1 Exhibit 2 - 7 and 10\n2 Exhibit 1\n3 ibid\n4 Exhibit 3\n5 Exhibit 14\n6 Exhibit 8\n7 Exhibit 11 and 12\n8 Exhibit 8, item 1.18\n9 Exhibit 8, item 2.2\n10 Exhibit 8, item 1.14\n11 Exhibit 8, item 2.1\n12 Exhibit 8, item 1.18\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRPD.29.1 (August 31, 2012)\nRPD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SPR : TB6-00718\nTB6-00743 TB6-00749 TB6-00750\nTB6-00751 TB6-00752\n",

The claimant and his wife were living with his father and often experienced conflict and disagreements that caused tension and stress in the household. The claimant was introduced to Falun Gong by his good friend XXXX XXXX who told him it would alleviate his XXXX XXXX. After practising in secret and learning some basic knowledge from his friend, the claimant joined a group practice in XXXX 2013. He found that his relationship with his family members had soon improved as a result of his practice. However, the claimant was concerned about being discovered by the authorities and also interested in practising Falun Gong freely in a country where it would be possible.\n[4] As the claimant had a friend living in Toronto who told him about being able to practise Falun Gong freely and openly in Canada, the claimant found a smuggler to help him obtain a U.S. visa improperly. He left China on XXXX XXXX, 2014, arriving in XXXX the following day. From XXXX, the claimant made his way to the U.S.-Canada border and entered Canada near Vancouver without presenting himself to the immigration officials for inspection. The claimant made his claim for Canada's protection inland on January 20, 2016 in Toronto.\n[5] The claimant fears persecution and arrest in China on the basis of his involvement in illegal Falun Gong activity. He also wishes to practise Falun Gong freely and openly.\nANALYSIS\n[6] The determinative issue in this case is credibility.\nIdentity\n[7] The claimant's identity as a national of China is established by his testimony and by the supporting documentation filed, namely, copies of his Resident Identity Card (RIC)3 and his household register, or hukou,4 originals of which were presented at the hearing. The claimant also submitted a copy of his passport5 that was seized by the referring CIC office.\n[8] In addition to copies of his identity documents, the claimant presented a letter of support from a fellow practitioner6 and three photographs.7\nCredibility\n[9] The determination as to whether a claimant's evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities. While statements given under oath are presumed to be true, that presumption can be rebutted by contradictions or inconsistencies in the evidence.8 The onus is on the person making a refugee claim to present evidence that is credible on a balance of probabilities to support the allegations which form the basis of the claim. In this case the panel finds that the claimant has not met that onus.\n[10] In assessing the claimant's credibility, the panel considered the decision in Orelien9 wherein the Federal Court of Appeal held that it is necessary for the claimant to establish that his evidence is probably credible or trustworthy, not just possibly so. The panel also took into consideration the various factors that could affect oral testimony, including the milieu of the hearing room and the claimant's anxiety, age, cultural differences, level of education, and the use of an interpreter.10 While not every piece of evidence will be referred to in these reasons, the panel carefully considered the entirety of the evidence in reaching its decision.11\nDelay in claiming and stay without status\n[11] The claimant testified that he attended weekly group practice from XXXX 2013 until his exit from China in XXXX 2014. During this time, he enjoyed the benefits of Falun Gong but always had a fear, \"in the back of [his] mind,\" that the Public Security Bureau (PSB) might find out and question him. As he wanted to experience what it is like to be able to practise freely, he decided to travel to Canada. When questioned by the panel about his plans upon arrival in Canada, the claimant testified that he wanted to feel free when practising. When asked by the panel to explain the steps he planned to take regarding his status upon entry, the claimant responded that he planned to \"practise Falun Gong and work part-time here and there to maintain a living.\" The panel asked once more for the claimant's plans regarding his status in Canada or return to China, and he responded that once he arrived here, he had no plans to return to China.\n[12] The panel found that the claimant did not present himself to immigration authorities for inspection upon entry and that the only clear plan for his stay that he was able to articulate at the hearing was to engage in employment without authorization and remain in the country in contravention to Canada's immigration and employment laws. In addition, the panel found the claimant's responses regarding his plans to obtain legal status in Canada vague and evasive in spite of repeated questioning, and draws a negative credibility inference as a result.\n[13] The panel asked the claimant for a reason for such a lengthy delay between his arrival in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2014, and the date when his claim for protection was referred to the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) on January 20, 2016. The panel pointed out to the claimant that a delay in claiming of a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX would be part of an assessment going towards his subjective fear and, therefore, credibility. The claimant testified that as he was not sought by the Communist Party of China, he \"didn't really think much about it.\" He added that he was also not aware that Falun Gong practice could form the basis of a refugee claim until his landlord told him.\n[14] The panel does not accept the claimant's explanation as reasonable, as it is inconsistent with his testimony. He testified that his friend who resides in Toronto first informed him about the safety and freedom in Canada when the claimant was still in China. The claimant also stated that he took part in Falun Gong activities with many practitioners here in Canada. The panel finds that the claimant had the opportunity to ask his friend or approach members of his Falun Gong group for information on the possibility of filing a claim for protection as a Falun Gong practitioner. By delaying his claim and by remaining in Canada without legal status for a year and a half, thus vulnerable to possible deportation to China at any time, the claimant demonstrated a lack of subjective fear. The panel therefore rejects the claimant's explanation for the lengthy delay as inconsistent and unreasonable and draws a negative credibility inference.\nIdentity as a Falun Gong practitioner\n[15] The claimant testified that he started practising Falun Gong with his friend in XXXX 2013 and attended group practice in China for approximately XXXXmonths. He testified that he has been attending group practice in Canada once a week in XXXX XXXX since XXXX 2014 and that he has purchased a copy of Zhuan Falun and read all of it.\n[16] The panel is aware that a sound grasp of theory of a belief system is not a requirement for one to consider oneself a follower of that belief system. Rather than concentrating on specific knowledge questions about Falun Gong, the panel asked the claimant open-ended questions about what significance Falun Gong held in his life; in other words, the panel stayed clear of a microscopic examination of faith that the Federal Court has warned against in Gao v. Canada.12 In questioning the claimant, the panel was mindful of Gao when it comes to establishing the genuineness of a person's beliefs, and the Court's ruling that\n[...] such questioning and resulting analysis must indeed focus on the genuineness of those beliefs and not whether they are theologically correct. This can be a difficult task for the Board, as it is entitled to consider whether the claimant holds a level of religious knowledge that would be expected of someone in the claimant's position but should not reach an adverse conclusion based on minutiae or holding the claimant to an unreasonably high standard of religious knowledge.13\n[17] When questioned on Falun Gong principles and doctrine, the claimant was able to answer basic questions about certain elements of Falun Gong teachings. He named the fourth talk in Zhuan Falun as the one that held special significance to his life since it talks about improving one's mindset. He testified that this talk helped him because he stopped XXXX XXXX and his relationship with his family members improved. The panel asked the claimant what in particular in the talk applied to improving one's mindset, and he replied that one must follow truth, compassion, and forbearance. The panel then asked the claimant to provide an example from his daily life that would indicate his adherence to these principles, and the claimant stated that he apologized to someone who had bumped into him in the street the day before, and that he helped his landlady with tasks such as taking out the garbage or changing light bulbs.\n[18] The panel asked the claimant to expand on the meaning behind the three principles of truth, compassion, and forbearance. The claimant testified that according to the first one, you have to be true to yourself, and tell the truth of what you have seen; the second, you should be nice to others, animals, yourself, family, to everybody; and the third, you must tolerate whatever you can tolerate unless absolutely unbearable, not talk back, and not hit back when hit.\n[19] According to the claimant's testimony, he has been a Falun Gong practitioner for nearly three years, has read Zhuan Falun in its entirety, and has attended weekly group practice sessions in XXXX XXXX since XXXX 2014. During testimony, the claimant repeatedly referred to the three core principles of Falun Gong without going beyond their rudimentary meaning. The panel finds that the claimant failed to display a level of knowledge reasonably expected of someone who has been practising and studying Falun Gong for as long as he alleged. The panel acknowledges that the authenticity of a claimant's commitment to Falun Gong and genuine adherence is difficult to determine. The panel must rely on an assessment of the claimant's credibility and the consistency of testimony and supporting documentation.\n[20] The panel asked the claimant about the significance of Falun Gong in his life and his ongoing commitment to the practice. The claimant testified that he has been practising for three years and that the practice has allowed him \"to let go\" and improved his mood. The panel finds that the claimant was given the opportunity to demonstrate some of the knowledge imparted to him during group practice that he allegedly attended and finds that he failed to do so. He failed to express his intent to cultivate the mind nature or a desire to elevate his state through this cultivation, a foundational teaching of Falun Gong.\n[21] The panel refers to the documentary evidence before it regarding the higher objective of Falun Gong as \"cultivation and practice towards enlightenment... The foundation of Falun Dafa consists of a body of fundamental knowledge essential for the task of undertaking proper cultivation towards higher stages of attainment.\"14 The panel finds that the claimant failed to express the need to incorporate this objective of cultivation towards enlightenment.\n[22] The panel is mindful of the Court's ruling in Ren15 and did not engage in an assessment of the soundness of the claimant's theology, staying clear of seeking specific answers regarding esoteric points of Falun Gong knowledge. The panel finds that the claimant failed to demonstrate a commitment to master the \"body of fundamental knowledge\" as part of his cultivation. The practice of Falun Gong encompasses both exercise and philosophy and if one does not demonstrate a commitment to attain the knowledge of the philosophy, then one is not a true practitioner. The panel therefore finds that the claimant is not a genuine Falun Gong practitioner.\nSur place claim and subjective fear upon return\n[23] Regarding the sur place aspect of this claim, the panel listened to the claimant's testimony that he has practiced Falun Gong openly in public and viewed the photographs of the claimant in a group of people performing gestures together in a park. The panel was, however, not presented with any evidence to find that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant's participation in Falun Gong activities publicly in Canada has been brought to the attention of Chinese authorities.\n[24] The panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant is not a genuinely committed Falun Gong practitioner. The panel also finds, on a balance of probabilities, that if the claimant has taken part in Falun Gong activities in Canada, his participation has not come to the attention of Chinese authorities.\n[25] The foregoing findings lead the panel to conclude that the claimant's allegations that he practiced Falun Gong in China are not credible. The panel also finds that the claimant is not a genuine Falun Gong practitioner in Canada.\nCONCLUSION\n[26] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel finds that there is not a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground should the claimant return to China, or that, on a balance of probabilities, he would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment should he return.\n[27] The panel therefore finds that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee under section 96 nor a person in need of protection under subsection 97(1) of IRPA. The claim is rejected.\n(signed)\n\"M. Moc\"\nM.

To summarize, the claimant alleges to fear racist and homophobic extremists groups in Hungary, on account of his homosexual orientation and Roma ethnic identity.\n[3] The claimant obtained a Hungarian passport in XXXX, 2015, shortly after he turned 18 years of age. The claimant traveled to Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2015, and made a claim for refugee protection upon his arrival.\n[4] The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration has intervened in this claim by the participation of counsel for the Minister at the hearing to question the claimant and make submissions.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] The panel finds that the claimant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. The determinative issue in this claim is the credibility of the claimant's identity as a homosexual of Roma ethnic origin.\nANALYSIS\n[6] The panel is satisfied that the claimant is a citizen of Hungary, according to his passport and other identity documents.1 However, the panel finds that the claimant has not corroborated his alleged homosexual orientation or Roma ethnic origin with credible or reliable testimony or documents which would allow the panel to make these key identity findings, on a balance of probabilities.\n[7] The panel has been mindful of the presumption of truth of sworn testimony but has found that the claimant's evidence has contained inconsistencies, omissions and discrepancies which have not been reasonably explained, and which are sufficient to overcome this presumption.\n[8] The panel was also mindful of the inherent difficulties of testifying through an interpreter in an unfamiliar hearing room setting, as well as the fact that the claimant is a XXXX XXXX man with a XXXX XXXX.\n[9] The panel did not notice that the claimant had any apparent difficulties understanding the questions he was being asked or the interpretation during the hearing. The claimant had been advised at the outset of the hearing that he should advise the panel immediately should such a situation arise.\n[10] The panel has considered the claimant's statement in his BOC that he did not receive a XXXX XXXX of education in Hungary, and his counsel's submission that his XXXX XXXX and lack of sophistication have impacted on his ability to testify and to respond to questions.\nThe claimant's education in Hungary\n[11] The claimant stated in his BOC that he had enrolled in XXXX XXXX in a town called XXXX after completing XXXX XXXXat a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX but that he was not able to continue due to his family's inability to pay for transportation and school supplies. However, at the hearing the claimant testified that he had never tried to continue his education past XXXX XXXX, because of his financial situation.\n[12] The claimant was asked about this discrepancy, and his explanation was only to deny ever having stated anything in his BOC about enrolling in XXXX XXXX. The panel cannot accept this as a reasonable explanation for this inconsistency this issue, which the claimant himself has described as a significant one. The panel takes a negative inference towards the claimant's credibility as a witness from this discrepancy.\nThe claimant's statement at the port of entry\n[13] The panel pointed out to the claimant that the officer's notes from the interview held at the port of entry upon his arrival indicate that the claimant feared persecution in Hungary because 'they wanted to kill me over there because I'm a homosexual person'. The panel asked the claimant why he did not mention at that point that he was alleging a fear of persecution also on his ethnic identity as a Roma, as he has put forth in his BOC and testimony. The claimant's response was that, 'I forgot to tell them'.\n[14] The panel has noted other instances where the claimant's explanation for material discrepancies in his evidence was that he didn't know what he had said previously or had forgotten. The claimant has not presented any medical or psychological reports indicating that he is experiencing any memory or other cognitive deficits as a result of his XXXX XXXX or for any other reason.\n[15] Therefore, the panel simply cannot find that the claimant's stated lack of recall to be an acceptable explanation for the claimant having failed to mention this key aspect of his alleged subjective fear of persecution in Hungary upon his arrival in Canada. Rather, the panel takes a strongly negative inference towards the claimant's credibility as a witness on the issue of his ethnic identity from this significant omission.\nThe claimant's experiences in Hungary as a Roma\n[16] The claimant was asked about the discrimination he alleges to have experienced as a member of the Roma minority in Hungary. As set out earlier, the claimant stated in his BOC that his education was inferior due to having attended a XXXX XXXX XXXX school, and that his family lived in XXXX XXXX due to their ethnicity.\n[17] The claimant testified that he had never personally been the victim of an assault by skinheads, or known anyone who had been, nor had he ever been denied a job due to his ethnicity. When questioned further, the claimant stated that he had never in fact applied for a job in Hungary, due to his young age and the fact that 'it is hard for Roma to find jobs'.\n[18] The claimant did not provide details to corroborate any of his allegations of mistreatment in his testimony, such as the poor medical attention he alleged to have received as a Roma, even when specifically asked about this by the Minister's counsel. Rather, the claimant appeared to be relying on news reports or other distant sources, saying several times, for example, about extremist groups that 'I heard that they hate Roma people.'\nWhere is the claimant's father?\n[19] The panel notes that the claimant stated in his BOC narrative that job prospects for Roma in Hungary are poor, and his father was never able to find a job. At the hearing, however, the claimant provided vague and conflicting testimony on the whereabouts of his father. He initially stated that he was still in Hungary, and then that he might be here in Canada. He later stated that his father had arrived about XXXX or XXXX months ago.\n[20] The claimant testified that he was not close to his father, and that he didn't know where he lived, but later admitted that his father had helped him to come to Canada. The panel notes that information in the claimant's port of entry notes shows that the claimant's father, XXXX XXXX, had in fact booked and paid for the claimant's ticket to Canada.2\n[21] When the claimant was asked about his inconsistent testimony regarding his father and their relationship, his response was again to say that 'I forgot those things, I am forgetful'. The panel finds instead the claimant's testimony on this issue was evasive, and takes a further negative inference towards his credibility as a witness.\n[22] Given the claimant's problematic testimony about his experiences as a Roma in Hungary and his father's presence in Canada, it was surprising to the panel that no evidence from the claimant's father was forthcoming which could have supported his alleged ethnic identity, especially given the claimant's young age.\n[23] The panel found the evidence did not credibly establish that there was any estrangement between the claimant and his father. The panel takes a further negative finding towards his credibility of his alleged identity as a Roma from his failure to present evidence which should have been reasonably available and would have been helpful in establishing this identity.\n[24] The panel finds that the claimant has not provided sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to establish that he is a member of the Roma minority, on a balance of probabilities, having considered his testimony and evidence on the issue overall, and particularly the fact that the claimant made no mention of this alleged Roma identity when initially asked his reasons for claiming refugee protection in Canada, which was not satisfactorily explained.\nWas the claimant in a same-sex relationship in Hungary?\n[25] The panel also takes negative inferences towards the credibility of other key aspects of the claimant's stated identity, as a homosexual, from his vague and inconsistent testimony, and his failure to provide other evidence to corroborate his alleged homosexual orientation.\n[26] The claimant had difficulty providing meaningful information about his alleged boyfriend, XXXX, in Hungary. For example, the claimant could not say how long he had known XXXX, describe his family or even give his last name.\n[27] The claimant was asked whether he had attempted to contact XXXX since coming to Canada, but replied that he had not 'because we didn't care about each other any longer'. The panel notes that the claimant still has family members in Hungary through whom he could have obtained some corroboration from XXXX regarding their relationship, but that he never attempted to do so.\n[28] The claimant also provided discrepant evidence about the XXXX XXXX during which he stated that he was subjected to homophobic slurs because of his perceived homosexual relationship with XXXX. The claimant testified that this incident took place in XXXX 2015, although his narrative to his BOC states that is occurred 'in XXXX XXXX, 2015'. The claimant explained this discrepancy by saying that the names of the months sound similar, and that he had been mistaken earlier in his testimony.\n[29] However, the panel notes that this event was significant as it was the only incident which the claimant mentioned when asked about why his relationship with XXXX was different than with his other friends, and this discrepancy was therefore problematic. The panel finds that the claimant has not provided consistent or corroborative testimony or evidence to support his allegation that he was in a 'boyfriend' type of relationship with XXXX, or that this relationship ever became known to others in his community.\nThe claimant's homosexual identity\n[30] The claimant has also not provided any other evidence to show that he has ever expressed his alleged homosexuality in any way, either in Hungary or Canada. Even considering the fact that the claimant is still a teenager, the panel finds that he has not provided sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to show that he is homosexual or would be perceived as a homosexual by potential agents of persecution in Hungary.\n[31] The claimant himself could shed very little light how he became aware of his orientation, or how his friendship with XXXX developed into a homosexual relationship. He was unable to elaborate upon what he meant by the 'thoughts' he had prior to his discovery that he was gay in XXXX, 2015, as set out in his BOC. His response to Minister's counsel's question about these alleged 'homosexual thoughts' was only to reiterate that he decided that he would like to 'spend more time with a boy'.\n[32] The claimant was asked why he believed that he would be identified as being gay by groups that hate homosexuals, and he said because 'it is visible I am gay'. However, although he said that the way he talked and walked makes it visible, he did not explain this testimony. When asked if there is anything else he wished to say on this issue, the claimant stated, 'I don't know, there is nothing.'\n[33] Therefore, the panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant was not in a homosexual relationship in Hungary, and has not had difficulties on this account in the past, nor would he be more likely than not to be perceived as a homosexual were he to return to Hungary now.\nCONCLUSION\n[34] The panel has considered the totality of the evidence, including the claimant's testimony, and the submissions of both counsel. The panel finds that the claimant's evidence about his alleged homosexual orientation and Roma ethnic background to be lacking in credibility, as set out above. The panel finds that there is insufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to find that he faces a serious possibility of harm in Hungary on either of these grounds.\n[35] Therefore, the panel finds that the claimant has not established that he would have a well-founded fear of persecution in Hungary, or that, on a balance of probabilities, he would be personally subjected to a risk to life or to cruel or unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture in Hungary.\n[36] The Refugee Protection Division rejects this claim.\n(signed)\n\"Maureen Carty\"\nMaureen Carty\nMarch 14, 2016\nDate\n1 Exhibits 1 and 4\n2 Exhibit 1\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRPD.29.1 (August 31, 2012)\nRPD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SPR : TB5-10001\n",

Although counsel for the claimant does not make specific reference to Refugee Protection Division Rule 60 (the \"RPD Rules\"),1 the panel accepts the January 18, 2016 correspondence as an application to reinstate a withdrawn claim.\n[3] In coming to this decision, the RPD has considered the correspondence from the claimant's counsel dated January 18, 2016, the Minister's response dated January 25, 2016 opposing the application to reinstate as well as the previous decision from the RPD dated January 7, 2016 as well as the submissions received from the claimant's counsel on December 24, 2015 as well as the claimant's affidavit and the Minister's submissions received on December 24, 2015.\nTHE FACTS\n[4] The Canada Border Services Agency (\"CBSA\") forwarded the claimant's duly signed Notice of Withdrawal on December 4, 2015. Counsel for the claimant by way of letter dated December 14, 2014 informed the RPD that the claimant no longer wished to withdraw his refugee claim.\n[5]\nOnce the Notice to withdraw the claim is filed with the RPD, the claim is considered withdrawn and no decision is required by the RPD. In this particular case, the claimant's counsel wrote to the RPD asking that the Notice of withdrawal not be accepted by the RPD as the claimant had changed his mind. At the time of counsel's letter, the processing of the withdrawal had not been completed by IRB staff. In light of this, the RPD requested submissions from the claimant's counsel and the Minister's counsel with respect to the Notice of withdrawal and whether the RPD should accept it.\n[6] Counsel for the claimant and counsel for the Minister provided the RPD with submissions on December 24, 2015. The RPD provided a response to the parties on January 7, 2016 whereby the RPD accepted the withdrawal. The RPD provided in that letter the reasons for accepting the withdrawal.\n[7] As noted previously, counsel for the claimant has asked the RPD to reinstate the withdrawn claim. Minister's counsel provided submissions dated January 25, 2016 opposing the reinstatement.\n[8] The RPD in reaching this decision is guided by sections 60(3) and 60(4) of the RPD Rules.2 The RPD must assess whether there was a failure to observe a principle of natural justice in accepting the withdrawal or if it is otherwise in the interests of justice to allow the application to reinstate.\n[9] The RPD is also guided by the case law3 in deciding this application. The RPD must consider any relevant factors, including whether the application was made in a timely manner and the justification for any delay.4\n[10] The RPD acknowledges that the assessment of the application is twofold as outlined in section 60(3) of the RPD Rules. The RPD must assess first of all whether there was a failure to observe a principle of natural justice in this case and secondly, the RPD must decide if it is in the interests of justice to allow the application.\nNATURAL JUSTICE\n[11] The RPD finds that there was no failure to observe a principle of natural justice in this case. The claimant was detained by the CBSA on November 18, 2015 at the time that he made his refugee claim. The CBSA detained the claimant because the Minister was not satisfied with respect to his identity. The claimant was brought before the Immigration Division within 48 hours of his detention. He was provided with Duty Counsel, Mr. Warren Puddicombe at his detention review of November 20, 2015. The claimant was brought before the Immigration Division for his 7 day detention review on November 27, 2015. Once again, the claimant was afforded the opportunity to meet with Duty Counsel to discuss his detention and his refugee claim. Duty Counsel, Linda Mack was present at his detention review hearing. The claimant's detention was continued by the Immigration Division.\n[12] On that same day, the claimant indicated to the CBSA that he wished to withdraw his claim as he was uncertain how he would obtain identification documents under the name XXXX XXXX and he also indicated that he feared he could be detained indefinitely.\n[13] The CBSA did not accept nor did it seek to have the claimant complete a withdrawal form of his refugee claim at that time. Arrangements were made to bring the claimant from the detention facility to the CBSA Office in downtown Vancouver on November 30, 2015, which was the same day that his wife was required to report to the CBSA. The objective was to have the claimant speak to his wife prior to allowing him to complete the withdrawal form of his refugee claim. The claimant was hospitalized following a medical issue on the XXXX XXXX, 2015 and he was not able to speak to his wife on that day.\n[14] The claimant was then brought in to the CBSA office on December 4, 2015. The CBSA facilitated a phone call between the claimant and his wife. Following that conversation, the claimant once again indicated his desire to withdraw his refugee claim.\n[15] The CBSA prior to having the claimant complete the withdrawal form, put him in contact with Legal Aid Counsel, Chris Ghirardi. The claimant following his conversation with counsel Ghirardi informed the CBSA that he still wished to withdraw his claim. Following this, the CBSA facilitated a call between the claimant and his wife for a second time. Following the second call with his wife, the claimant indicated that he still wanted to withdraw his claim. The claimant was provided with a Punjabi interpreter and completed the Notice of Withdrawal of a Claim for Refugee Protection which the CBSA forwarded it to the RPD on December 4, 2015.\n[16] Counsel in the letter dated January 18, 2016 states that the RPD did not give sufficient consideration to the fact that the claimant was in detention during the entire time he has been in Canada and that the CBSA is an adverse party in the refugee proceeding. Counsel also states that the claimant's separation from his family and his psychological state were dismissed by the RPD in accepting his withdrawal.\n[17] The RPD finds that there has been no failure to observe a principle of natural justice in this case. As noted previously, the claimant was given access to legal counsel at various stages of the process. The claimant had access to Duty Counsel at his 48 hour and 7 day detention review. It would have been clear to the Duty Counsel representing him before the Immigration Division that he had made a refugee claim in Canada. Furthermore, there is no indication that he was prevented from discussing his detention and refugee claim with those counsels.\n[18] More importantly, the CBSA did not simply get the claimant to complete the withdrawal form as soon as he indicated his desire to do so. They facilitated a meeting between the claimant and his wife that was to take place on November 30, 2015. Unfortunately, this meeting did not take place as a result of a medical issue for the claimant. The CBSA facilitated a phone call between the claimant and his wife on December 4, 2015, approximately one week after his last detention review where he had been represented by Duty Counsel. Following the call with his wife, the claimant indicated that he still wanted to withdraw his claim.\n[19] The CBSA did not get the claimant to complete the withdrawal form following the call with his wife. The CBSA instead facilitated a phone call between the claimant and Legal Aid Counsel Ghirardi. The CBSA indicates in their December 23, 2015 letter to the RPD that the purpose of the call to Counsel Ghirardi was for the claimant to fully understand the implications related to the withdrawal of his claim. The claimant continued to indicate his desire to withdraw his claim following his call with Counsel Ghirardi.\n[20] Following this, the CBSA facilitated a second call between the claimant and his wife. The claimant indicated to the CBSA following this second call to his wife that he still wanted to withdraw his refugee claim. Only after taking all these steps did the CBSA provide the claimant with the withdrawal form that he duly signed.\n[21] Counsel for the claimant provided an affidavit from the claimant dated December 23, 2015. In the affidavit, the claimant states that he did not fully realize what he was signing or its consequences. He further adds that he has health problems and that he was taken to the hospital twice and he believed that he was dying and he was upset.\n[22] Counsel argues that the claimant's mental state should be considered when deciding this application. The panel finds that the claimant was aware of the consequences of his decision to withdraw his claim. He had access to counsel throughout his time in detention. He had counsel present for his detention review hearings and he was given the opportunity to speak to Duty Counsel about the implications of his decision with Counsel Ghirardi. He was also given the opportunity to speak to his wife twice prior to withdrawing his claim.\n[23] Although the claimant had an ongoing medical condition at the time, the RPD has not been presented with evidence showing that the claimant's psychological state at the time that he withdrew his claim was such that he was incapable of appreciating the nature of the decision he made. The panel therefore finds that the claimant has not established that there was a failure to observe a principle of natural justice in his case. On the contrary, the RPD finds that the CBSA took several reasonable steps to allow the claimant to make a reasoned decision prior to getting him to complete the withdrawal form.\nTHE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE\n[24] The second consideration for the RPD under section 60(3) is whether it is in the interests of justice to allow the application. As noted in the case law, the interests of justice is a broad concept that goes beyond the principle of natural justice. The RPD finds that given the specific facts of this case, it would not be in the interests of justice to allow the application.\n[25] The RPD acknowledges that the application for reconsideration was made in a timely manner. Counsel for the claimant informed the RPD on December 14, 2015 that the claimant no longer wished to withdraw his refugee claim. Following the RPD's decision to accept the withdrawal, counsel for the claimant filed the application to reinstate the claim. Although the application has been made in a timely manner, the panel must consider what happened prior to the application to reinstate. As noted previously, the claimant was not the victim of a failure on the part of the CBSA or the RPD to observe a principle of natural justice. The claimant's decision was done with the advice of counsel and in consultation with his wife. Although the application was filed in a timely manner, the timeliness not sufficient to overcome the fact that the claimant had time to consult with counsel and his wife before completing the withdrawal form and that he freely chose to withdraw knowing what the consequences of that decision would be.\n[26] The RPD also takes into consideration that his wife and child are pursuing their refugee claims. This could be an important factor if the evidence before the RPD showed that the claimant was not in contact with his wife prior to making the decision to withdraw his claim. In this case, the claimant spoke to his wife on two occasions on December 4, 2015 and the purpose of the call was to discuss his withdrawal. One call was made before he consulted with legal counsel and a second call was made after his consultation with legal counsel. The RPD finds that the claimant made the decision to withdraw his refugee claim knowing that his wife and child would pursue their claim.\n[27] The RPD has also considered the claimant's health problems. The evidence before the RPD indicates that the claimant received medical attention in Canada at least twice. It appears that the claimant is suffering from a heart ailment. The RPD accepts that the claimant was upset and distressed with his medical condition. That being said, the RPD finds that the claimant's medical condition was not sufficient to impact the decision he made to withdraw his claim. The RPD finds that the claimant freely and knowingly made the decision to withdraw his refugee claim despite his medical condition. The RPD has not been presented with any medical reports stating that the claimant's medical condition impaired his ability to understand his actions.\n[28] As noted in the case law, RPD Rule 60 is exceptional and is not designed to protect applicants from the consequences of their freely chosen course of conduct even where they have made the decision or taken steps which did not work out as they may have hoped.5\n[29] The RPD finds that the claimant made the decision to withdraw his refugee claim freely and that there was no failure to observe a principle of natural justice in his case. The RPD further finds that the claimant has not established that it would be interests of justice to allow the application to reinstate his claim.\n[30] The RPD therefore dismisses the application to reinstate the claim of XXXX XXXX.\n(signed)\n\"Daniel Tucci\"\nDaniel Tucci\nFebruary 16, 2016\nDate\n1 Refugee Protection Division Rules (\"RPD Rules\"), SOR\/2012-256.\n2 Sections 60(3) and (4) of the RPD Rules:\n60(3) The Division must not allow the application unless it is established that there was a failure to observe a principle of natural justice or it is otherwise in the interests of justice to allow the application.\n(4) In deciding the application, the Division must consider any relevant factors, including whether the application was made in a timely manner and the justification for any delay.\n3 Ohanyan v.

The associated claimant indicated in her BOCs that she is relying on the principal claimant's narrative.4 The principal claimant alleges the following:\n[6] She is 20 years old and comes from XXXX province. She was in a relationship with Mr. XXXX. He was too controlling and she ended their relationship. He continued to call and come to her home. He threatened to tell his father, a member of a Neighbourhood Committee (\"Committee\"), that he broke up with her when he found out that she was a member of the Falun Gong cult. This was lie because she is not a Falun Gong practitioner. She did not take him seriously.\n[7] In XXXX 2015, a Committee member went to her home and told her parents that they received a tip that she was practicing Falun Gong. Her parents said that it was not true. The Committee member said that they \"opened a file\" on her, that they will be watching, and if she were discovered to be a Falun Gong practitioner, she would go to jail.\n[8] Her parents tried to contact Mr. XXXX father, but he would not talk to them. They worried that they would make the situation worse if they contacted other Chinese authorities. They decided to send the claimants to the United States (U.S.). A smuggler was found who helped the claimants apply for U.S. visas. After they obtained these visas, her parents decided to send the claimants to Canada instead. The smuggler helped them apply for Canadian visas and brought them to Canada on September 30, 2015.\n[9] In XXXX 2015, a Committee member went to her home to inquire about her whereabouts. Her parents said that the claimants had gone to Canada. The Committee member said that she was still under suspicion for being a Falun Gong practitioner and that because her sister is with her in Canada, a file will be opened on her as well. The Committee member told her parents that the claimants have to report to the Committee for questioning when they return to China.\n[10] She does not know whether the Chinese authorities really suspect the claimants of being Falun Gong practitioners or just made this accusation to harass and frighten the claimants.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[11] The panel accepts, on a balance of probabilities, the claimants' national identities on the basis of the certified true copies of their Resident Identity Cards (RICs).5\nCredibility\n[12] The determinative issues were credibility, and related to that, subjective fear.\n[13] The majority of the testimony came from the principal claimant. The associated claimant testified that she agreed with her testimony and had nothing else to add.\n[14] In assessing credibility, the panel was mindful of the claimants' age, education and background. The principal and associated claimants noted in their immigration forms that they were university students in China and that they have 14 and 15 years of formal education and training respectively.6 The panel also took into consideration the difficulties that a claimant can face in the hearing room, including cultural factors, the milieu of the hearing room, and difficulties inherent in responding to oral questions through an interpreter.\n[15] For the reasons that follow, the panel did not find the principal claimant to be a credible witness, and that the claimants did not establish what they have alleged in their claims.\nThe Principal Claimant's Presence in China at the Relevant Time\n[16] The principal claimant produced no documents to establish that she travelled to Canada from mainland China as alleged or even that she was in China at the times material to her claim. The panel did not have the claimants' passports before it. The claimants allege that their (genuine) passports were taken by the smuggler because the smuggler provided false information to obtain the American and Canadian visas. When the principal claimant was asked at the hearing whether she has any proof that she came from mainland China to Canada, she answered \"no\".\n[17] Although the claimants allege that they travelled together from the mainland to Hong Kong, when the principal claimant was asked where they entered Hong Kong from the mainland, she did not know. She was asked numerous times and in different ways the location of the border crossing\/checkpoint where they left the mainland and entered Hong Kong but she did not know. She said: the Hong Kong airport; the border of Hong Kong and China; the checkpoint was where they switched from the bus to the car; and she did not know. When she was asked whether it was located in Shenzhen, a border crossing between the mainland and Hong Kong, she said no.\n[18] While the associated claimant testified that her passport was stamped when she left the mainland and entered Hong Kong, the principal claimant did not testify that her passport was stamped upon exiting China. When she was directly asked whether her passport was stamped, she did not answer the question. She said that the panel asked her if she had any evidence that she travelled from the mainland to Canada and she has no proof and that the only proof she had is that she travelled from Hong Kong to Canada. She was asked again whether her passport was stamped. She said that \"they\" only issued a paper document indicating how many days she could stay in Hong Kong. The panel requested to see this document. She responded that it might be in her file. It was not there. Her sister pointed to their coats that were hanging on the wall. The principal claimant pulled out a piece of paper and handed it to counsel, who examined it and handed it to the panel. This paper was not previously disclosed. It was then marked and entered as Exhibit 9. The panel noted that it was an entry permit to Hong Kong and that it had the associated claimant's name on it. The panel asked the principal claimant the whereabouts of her entry permit. She said \"no\" with no explanation. The panel confirmed with her that she does not have it. The panel notes that counsel was given an opportunity to question the claimant and to clarify any matters and that he did ask some questions. The panel has no evidence with respect to why the associated claimant was able to produce her entry permit to Hong Kong and the principal claimant was not. The panel takes a negative inference in regard to the principal claimants' credibility from her failure to provide the entry permit and her lack of knowledge of where the border crossing between China and Hong Kong was. It is reasonable to expect that she would be able to provide the same document her sister provided and she was unable to explain why she did not have it.\n[19] Moreover, the principal claimant was asked whether she had any proof that she was in XXXX province in 2015. She said \"no\" but that she came with her sister together. The panel accepts that the principal and associated claimants travelled to Toronto from Hong Kong on September 30, 2015, as provided by the boarding passes they disclosed at the start of the hearing.7 However, there is no evidence before the panel that the principal claimant left from mainland China on September 30, 2015 as she alleges. Although she testified that she travelled by bus from XXXX to Hong Kong on that date, when she was questioned about the bus ticket, she said: she did not have it, she probably threw it away; maybe she threw it away unintentionally. The panel also asked the associated claimant about her bus ticket. She said she did not have it; she did not remember where it was; she just realized it was just gone.\n[20] Furthermore, the principal claimant testified that she was attending XXXX XXXX in XXXX province until XXXX 2015. Although the principal claimant (and the associated claimant) did provide a XXXX XXXXgraduation certificate,8 she did not produce any evidence that she (they) attended university. She was asked at the hearing whether she had any evidence that she attended this university until XXXX 2015 and she said she has evidence. She was asked what evidence. She said a student card. A student card was not disclosed to the Board. She was asked when the student card was issued and she said 2013. She was asked whether she had any evidence pertaining to her studies from 2015. She said not from 2015, but that the student card was valid for four years. The panel is not satisfied. A student card issued in 2013 is not confirmation of school attendance. The panel notes that a student card was not included in the list of identity, travel or supporting documents that she indicated that she has or could provide in Schedule 12. The panel takes a negative inference from her failure to provide documents that would reasonably have been available.\n[21] The principal claimant was asked why she provided in Schedule A that she was studying at XXXX XXXX until XXXX 2015 but testified at the hearing that she stopped attending university in XXXX 2015. She explained that the school year ended in XXXX 2015 and restarted in XXXX 2015. When she was asked what she was doing between XXXX 2015 and XXXX 2015. She said that she stayed at home.\n[22] Given the allegation that she was a student in university in XXXX, it is reasonable to expect some evidence from the university such as a report card, a school letter confirming her attendance and enrollment in XXXX 2015. The claimant is also expected to ensure that proper information was being provided to Canadian officials. The panel does not find that she provided a reasonable explanation for the different dates she provided in her testimony and in her immigration documents. The panel takes a negative inference with respect to her credibility from this inconsistency.\n[23] The panel has considered all of the above noted credibility concerns and negative inferences which include her lack of knowledge of where she left the mainland and entered Hong Kong, the claimants' contradictory testimony about the exit stamp from China (the associated claimant testified that her passport was stamped, the principal claimant testified that she was only given an entry permit), the inconsistency about the school dates, and the lack of supporting documentation (including university records, bus ticket, entry permit to Hong Kong for the principal claimant), which the panel finds would have been reasonably available to her. The panel finds on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant's presence in (mainland) China at times material to her claim (in 2015) has not been established. The panel determines, based on the totality of the evidence and on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant was not there.\n[24] The panel notes that the principal claimant's RIC9 only establishes her presence in China in XXXX 2013. The submitted hukou,10 issued in November 2012, does not establish her presence in China in 2015. The hukou (Household Register) is a legal right to permanently reside in a province or country;11 it does not establish actual residence. Her XXXX XXXX Graduation Certificate,12 issued in XXXX 2013, does not establish her presence in China after XXXX 2013.\n[25] The panel also notes the documentary evidence which provides that hukou fraud frequently exists in China, both genuine and fake hukous documents are sold on the black market, and individuals can obtain multiple hukous containing false information.13 The use of fraudulent hukou documents remains common in China. Fake hukou booklets and other identity documents can be purchased on the black market.14\nSubjective Fear\n[26] The panel notes the following inconsistencies between the principal claimant's words and actions: she claimed she was afraid of the Neighbourhood Committee and she testified that she no longer felt safe in China after their first visit; \"starting from XXXX 2015\", but she left China in a manner which suggested otherwise. She did not go into hiding or attempt to leave the country illegally (she travelled on her own genuine passport). She testified that she was told at her U.S. visa interview on May 4, 2015 that her application for a visa was approved but she did not use this visa to leave China. She explained that her parents wanted the associate claimant to go with her. She testified that although her sister (the associate claimant) passed the interview for the U.S. visa in July 2015, they still did not use their visas to leave China. This was because, their parents changed their minds because the U.S. is not safe and they wanted the claimants to go Canada instead. Given that the principal claimant is an adult and alleges that she fears imprisonment due to her suspected involvement in Falun Gong, the panel did not find her explanation that the U.S. is not safe to be adequate or credible.\n[27] The panel also had serious credibility concerns with respect to the principal claimant's evidence about the Canadian visa. The principal claimant testified that after her sister obtained the U.S. visa around July 2015, her parents changed their minds and looked for a smuggler to apply for the Canadian visa. The smuggler applied for the Canadian visa in August 2015. She was asked whether a different smuggler applied for the Canadian and U.S. visas. She said the same person applied. She was therefore asked why she testified that her parents had to look for a smuggler. Her response did not address the inconsistency. She simply repeated that the same smuggler applied for the U.S. and Canadian visas. She testified that her parents told her that the smuggler applied for the Canadian visa in August and that she did not see the Canadian visa application. The panel notes that the Canadian visa application15 is dated September 12, 2015 and bears several signatures that are questionably similar to the signature on her BOC.16 When she was shown these signatures in her Canadian visa application and in her BOC, she stated that it was not her signature. When she was asked why her Canadian visa application indicates that a travel agency assisted her with her application,17 she said she was not sure about this.\n[28] The principal claimant testified that she was not afraid to travel on her own passport that identities who she is. When she was asked why she felt comfortable leaving on her own passport, she responded that the Neighbourhood Committee just suspected her, they had no right to stop her from leaving. The principal claimant alleges that: she was suspected to be a Falun Gong practitioner, the Neighbourhood Committee \"opened a file\" on her, she \"had a feeling\" that they were monitoring her, she feared that they would report her to the PSB and she feared imprisonment. The panel notes that she chose to leave in a manner which would guarantee her exposure to the very authorities who she claims she fears - the PSB. The panel notes in this regard, the most recent documentation before it about China's security system.\n[29] To summarize, the Chinese Government has implemented a broad and complex security and surveillance system to monitor its citizens. The broad system is known as the Golden Shield; within it are other systems, such as PoliceNet, which enables officials to find extensive personal information about any citizen. Various components of the broad policing system are integrated, allowing public security forces to target and neutralize dissidents. There is specific evidence that PoliceNet has been used against Falun Gong practitioners for years. Airport security officials are connected to the broader system, and the Chinese Government uses exit controls to deny foreign travel to dissidents. There are reports of incidents in which Chinese citizens have been detained at airports, and of political activists detected, detained and questioned.18\n[30] The panel finds that there is no evidence that the smuggler did anything to enable the claimants to leave undetected by the authorities. The panel further finds that the principal claimant (and the associated claimant) was not wanted for arrest, nor was she a person of concern to the authorities, at the time that she left.\n[31] When the principal claimant was asked why she waited until November 24, 201519 to initiate her claim in Canada, she testified that she was planning to return to China. The panel notes that in response to follow-up questions, the principal claimant testified that she did not have nor did she purchase a return ticket, and that she changed her mind about returning to China after the Neighbourhood Committee's visit in XXXX 2015.\n[32] The panel finds the principal claimant's XXXX-month delay (from XXXX 2015 to XXXX 2015) in leaving China unreasonable given her alleged fears. The panel further finds that her delay in leaving and intention to return to China are indicative of a lack of subjective fear. Given this finding, the panel takes a negative inference with respect to her credibility and alleged fear of the Chinese authorities.\nVisits by the Neighbourhood Committee\n[33] The principal claimant wrote in her BOC narrative that there were two visits by the Neighbourhood Committee: in XXXX 2015 and in early XXXX 2015. She testified at the hearing that the Neighbourhood Committee's first visit was in early XXXX 2015. She was asked the date in XXXX. She said that she did not remember and that it was at the beginning of XXXX. She was asked whether the Neighbourhood Committee returned to her home. She said \"no\". She was asked whether they ever came back. She said no, but that she had a feeling that they were monitoring them\/her. It was noted that she wrote in her narrative that they did return to her home. She said that this visit occurred after she left the country. She was asked why she did not mention that visit in her testimony. She said that she thought that the panel was only asking about the time that she was still in China. The panel is not satisfied. The claimant was simply asked whether the Neighbourhood Committee returned to her home and she did not say that they only returned after she left China. It is reasonable to expect consistency between the claimant's oral testimony and her documents. The panel takes a negative inference with respect to her credibility from her contradictory evidence.\n[34] Moreover, when the principal claimant was questioned about the second visit, she said that she did not know: the date, who went to her home, whether it was the same Committee member who went to her home in XXXX, or what he inquired about. Additionally, she testified that she had no evidence to prove that the Neighbourhood Committee went to her home or that they are still interested in her.\n[35] Based on the previous finding that the principal claimant's presence in China at the relevant time has not been established, her contradictory evidence about the visits, the lack of any information or details beyond what was provided in her BOC that could have been reasonably obtained from her parents, and the lack of subjective fear, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that no visits by the Neighbourhood Committee occurred.\nRelationship with Mr. XXXX\n[36] There was no persuasive evidence before the panel that the principal claimant was in a relationship with Mr. XXXX. When the principal claimant was asked by the panel about her relationship with Mr. XXXX, she said that it was as boyfriend and girlfriend, they put their arms around each other's shoulders and they kissed. When she was questioned by counsel about why she broke it off, she said: he was controlling, she had no privacy, he was jealous, and he kept calling to check what she was doing. She was asked by the panel to explain why she did not mention these aspects (that she told counsel about) when she was asked by the panel about the relationship. She said that she thought that the panel was asking about the state or stage of their relationship. The panel is not satisfied by her explanation. The panel simply asked her to tell the panel about their relationship. It is reasonable to expect consistency in testimony. The panel takes a negative inference with respect to her credibility.\n[37] The claimant also testified that for a week after she broke up with Mr. XXXX, he called her continuously, showed up at her home, and threatened her. She was asked whether she reported or complained about his behaviour to the authorities. She said no and she was asked to explain. She said: she told her father, he tried to contact Mr. XXXX father, her father believed that officers tend to cover up for their colleagues in authority, her parents told her that they do not believe that the police would listen or do anything for her. The panel is not satisfied by her explanation. The panel, noting that the claimant is an adult, who alleges that she was being harassed and threatened by an ex-boyfriend, and that the phone calls and visits were made to her parent's home, finds it unreasonable and not credible that she and her parents made no efforts to approach the police to complain or report about Mr. XXXX behaviour considering that threats were made.\n[38] In light of these concerns and in the context of the previously identified credibility concerns, the panel is not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the allegation that the principal claimant was in a relationship with Mr. XXXX, a controlling ex-boyfriend, who made a false allegation about her to the Neighbourhood Committee to be credible.\n[39] Lastly, the panel notes that the principal claimant's testimony that she believes that the Neighborhood Committee would not let them go freely and would report the claimants to the PSB, to be based on speculation.\n[40] On the basis of the totality of the evidence, the panel does not believe what the claimants have alleged happened in China. The panel does not find the principal claimant to be a credible and trustworthy witness. The associated claimant testified that she agrees with the principal claimants' testimony and has nothing to add. The panel does not accept their allegations that they are being pursued by the Neighbourhood Committee or any authority in China due to suspicions that they are Falun Gong Practitioners. The panel therefore finds that they can return to China.\nCONCLUSION\n[41] The panel therefore finds that the claimants have not satisfied their burden of establishing a serious possibility that they would be persecuted, or that it is more likely than not that they would be personally subjected to a danger of torture, or face a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment should they return to China. The claimants are therefore neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n[42] For the foregoing reasons, the Refugee Protection Division rejects their claims.\n(signed)\n\"R.

She is claiming refugee protection in Canada pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)1.\n[2] The panel has considered and been guided by the Chairperson's Guidelines for Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution (the \"Guidelines\")2 during the hearing and in coming to a decision in this claim.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The details of the claimant's allegations were documented in her Basis of Claim form (BOC)3 as well as in her oral testimony. The claimant is a victim of domestic violence and fears her abusive husband, XXXX XXXX as well as her husband's second wife, XXXX XXXX.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] The panel determines that the claimant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of IRPA.\n[5] The determinative issue in this claim is credibility.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[6] The panel finds that the claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, her personal identity and national identity as a citizen of Uganda through her oral testimony and the disclosure of her identity document, namely her passport.4\nCredibility\nThe claimant's marriage certificate\n[7] The claimant disclosed her original marriage certificate and a certified copy of her original marriage certificate.5 The claimant testified that she and her husband had their customary traditional marriage rites on XXXX XXXX, 2008 and then had their church wedding on XXXX XXXX, 2008.\n[8] The claimant testified that her marriage certificate was issued from the church where she and her husband were married, namely the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The panel has reviewed the documentary evidence with respect to the issuance of marriage certificates in Uganda which states that copies of marriage records are obtainable from the District Commissioner of the District in which the marriage took place or from the Government Agent, Kampala.6 The marriage certificate submitted by the claimant has the header, \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\" and underneath that, \"Marriage Certificate\". There is no indication from the marriage certificate that it was issued by any government official or any government department. The claimant herself has testified that the marriage certificate was issued by the church. There is no documentary evidence before the panel that establishes that an official marriage certificate can be issued by a church or that marriage certificates are issued by churches in Uganda at all. Rather, the documentary evidence before the panel states that marriage records are issued by the government of Uganda. The panel gives more weight to the documentary evidence than the claimant's testimony as the documentary evidence originates from reliable, objective, and trustworthy governmental sources that have no vested interest in the outcome of the claimant's refugee claim. The panel finds the marriage certificate disclosed by the claimant is not a reliable or a trustworthy document and therefore gives the document no evidentiary weight.\n[9] The claimant submitted a certified copy of her original marriage certificate which was issued on XXXX XXXX, 2015.7 The claimant testified that the certified copy of her marriage certificate was also issued by the church where the claimant got married. Again, the panel notes the documentary evidence which states that copies of marriage records are obtainable from the District Commissioner of the District in which the marriage took place or from the Government Agent, Kampala.8 There is no evidence before the panel to establish that official certified copies of marriage certificates are issued by churches in Uganda. The panel finds the certified copy of the marriage certificate submitted by the claimant is not a reliable or a trustworthy document and gives the certified copy of the claimant's marriage certificate no evidentiary weight.\n[10] The panel notes that there is no supporting documentation before the panel that originates from the government of Uganda or its officials, which legally and properly records the claimant's alleged marriage or establishes that the claimant was ever married at all. The claimant alleges she was married by customary rites on XXXX XXXX, 2008 and the documentary evidence indicates that for marriages performed according to customary tribal law, no records exist; however, certificates are obtainable from the village chief.9 The claimant has not submitted any such certificates from her traditional marriage. The panel finds there is no evidence that is reliable and trustworthy which originates from proper and legal governmental sources to establish that there exists any record of the claimant ever having been married. The panel finds the claimant's credibility is undermined and finds the claimant is not a credible witness.\nThe claimant's Temporary Resident Visa applications to Canada\n[11] The claimant previously submitted two Canadian Temporary Resident Visa (TRV) applications, the first dated March 2, 2013 and the second dated December 29, 2014.10\n[12] In the claimant's first TRV, the claimant stated in her application that her marital status is 'married' and that she was married on XXXX XXXX, 1996. The claimant testified and stated in her BOC that she was married on XXXX XXXX, 2008 and XXXX XXXX, 2008 by customary rites and by the church respectively. The panel also notes that the claimant gave her alleged husband's date of birth in her first TRV application as XXXX XXXX, 1969; however, in her BOC the claimant states her husband's date of birth is XXXX XXXX, 1971. When asked why the date of her marriage is not consistent with the information she provided in her first TRV, the claimant stated that her TRV application was completed by a third party who submitted erroneous information. The panel rejects that explanation. The claimant is fluent in English. The claimant is a well-educated individual XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimant signed her TRV application declaring that she answered all questions in her application \"fully and truthfully\". Aside from the claimant's testimony there is no independent evidence that there was any third party involved in the completion of the claimant's TRV. The panel has already found that concerns have arisen with respect to the claimant's credibility and the panel therefore finds there is no reliable evidence to establish that someone other than the claimant herself completed her TRV. And even if the panel were to accept that a third party did in fact complete the application, the claimant testified that she herself provided the information to the third-party agent for her TRV application. The panel finds there is no reasonable explanation for why the claimant would state in her first TRV application that she was married on XXXX XXXX, 1996 when she was allegedly married on XXXX XXXX, 2008 and XXXX XXXX, 2008 and why the claimant would provide two completely different dates of birth for her husband in her BOC and her TRV. The panel finds the inconsistent evidence before the panel as to when the claimant was allegedly married undermines the claimant's overall credibility and is further evidence of the claimant's lack of credibility with respect to her allegations that she is married.\n[13] The claimant stated in her second TRV application of December 2014 that she is single. The claimant then further certified in her Family Information portion of her second TRV application that she does not have a spouse or a common-law partner. The claimant certified this statement by signing the statement and dating it (December 29, 2014). When asked why she would state in her second TRV application that she is single, the claimant stated that it was an error and she did not want to ask her husband for a letter which would have been required if she stated in her TRV that she was married. The claimant stated that she knowingly submitted fraudulent information to Canadian embassy officials. The panel finds the claimant's actions demonstrate that the claimant is not a reliable or a trustworthy witness and is therefore not credible. The claimant has admitted to knowingly advancing fraudulent information to Canadian officials for her own purposes. The claimant has stated that even though she stated in her first TRV application that she was married, she was never asked to submit a letter from her husband. There is no evidence before the panel to show that married TRV applicants are required to submit letters from their spouses. The panel finds the claimant has not provided a reasonable explanation for stating she is single and not married in her second TRV application. The panel finds there is no persuasive evidence that is reliable and trustworthy to establish the claimant's marital status or whether the claimant was ever married. The panel finds the inconsistencies of her marital status between her second TRV application, her BOC, and her testimony is significant. The panel finds the claimant is not a credible witness and moreover the panel finds her word cannot be trusted as she has admitted to knowingly lying to Canadian officials. The panel gives the claimant's testimony no evidentiary weight.\nPost-hearing evidence\n[14] The claimant submitted post-hearing a copy of a letter from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.11 The letter is written by the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who states that Mr. XXXX XXXX and Ms. XXXX XXXX XXXX were married at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2008 and that the \"information indicated on the certificate is true\". There are no identity documents or credentials attached with the letter to establish the identity or the professional position of the author of the letter. The letter is not a legally notarized or a sworn statement. The original document has not been disclosed by the claimant. The panel finds that an unsworn document from an individual whose identity and position has not been established does not address or overcome all the credibility concerns that have arisen with respect to the claimant's alleged marriage and marital status. The panel gives the letter no evidentiary weight.\nThe claimant's marital status\n[15] The claimant has not disclosed any official documentation issued from the government of Uganda that establishes that the claimant was ever married even though the documentary evidence clearly shows that such official documentation is available. The claimant has provided significantly different information in her BOC and TRV applications regarding her marital status and date of alleged marriage. The panel finds these discrepancies are significant and go to the heart of the claimant's allegations of her refugee claim. The panel finds that no reasonable explanations have been given by the claimant to address these credibility concerns. Based on these inconsistencies the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is not credible with respect to her allegations that she was married to a man named XXXX XXXX or that she was ever married at all. If the claimant cannot establish that she was ever married to an XXXX XXXX, the panel cannot find that the claimant's allegations that she was in an abusive marriage with XXXX XXXX are credible and trustworthy. Given that the panel has found that the claimant has not established she was married to XXXX XXXX, the panel finds that there is no persuasive evidence that is credible and trustworthy to establish that the claimant was a victim of domestic violence at the hands of her alleged husband, XXXX XXXX.\nA letter and affidavits\n[16] The claimant submitted a letter from XXXX XXXX as well as several affidavits from XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX.12 All of these documents state that the claimant was married to XXXX XXXX.\n[17] The panel notes that the letter from XXXX XXXX is not a sworn or notarized declaration. There is an Electoral Commission Voter identity card attached with the letter; however, the panel notes that the documentary evidence states that documents routinely carried and used for identification purposes by Ugandan citizens include an identity card from the person's place of work, if he or she is working; a driving permit if the person is driving; and a \"graduated tax ticket\" which bears the name of the holder and the location in which he or she lives and pays the graduated tax.13 There is no documentary evidence before the panel that establishes that an identity card from The Electoral Commission is a valid identity document used in Uganda. The author of the letter was not available to be questioned as a witness. The panel finds that a letter from an unknown individual whose identity has not been established and moreover whose letter contains information that raises credibility concerns is not persuasive evidence that is sufficiently reliable or trustworthy to overcome the credibility concerns that arose in the claimant's evidence. The panel gives the letter no evidentiary weight.\n[18] None of the affidavits from XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, or XXXX XXXX include any identity documents. There is no evidence before the panel that the deponents of the affidavits established their identity in any manner before their statements were taken. There is no evidence before the panel that the deponents of the affidavits were required to establish their identity before their statements were taken. All the affidavits refer to the claimant's marriage to XXXX XXXX, which the panel has found to not be credible. The deponents of the affidavits were not available to be questioned by the panel. The panel finds that affidavits from unknown individuals whose identities have not been established and moreover whose affidavits contain information that raises credibility concerns is not persuasive evidence that is reliable or trustworthy to overcome the credibility concerns that arose in the claimant's evidence. The panel gives the affidavits no evidentiary weight.\nStatements from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\n[19] The claimant submitted statements from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.14 The statements all refer to the claimant's marriage to her husband, XXXX XXXX. There are no security features associated with these statements. While there is a very simple stamp that says XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX there is no evidence on the statement of the name or identity of the person who prepared the statement. The panel has found that the claimant is not a credible witness and that she is not credible with respect to her allegations she was married to XXXX XXXX. The panel finds that statements from unknown individuals whose identities have not been established and moreover whose statements contain information that raises credibility concerns is not persuasive evidence that is reliable or trustworthy to overcome the credibility concerns that arose in the claimant's evidence. The panel gives the statements no evidentiary weight.\nPolice letter\n[20] The claimant submitted a letter from the police.15 The letter states that the claimant is married to XXXX XXXX. The panel has found that the claimant is not credible with respect to her allegations that she was ever married to an XXXX XXXX. The panel finds that the letter that has no security features and is from an unknown individual whose identity and credentials have not been established is not persuasive evidence that is reliable or trustworthy to overcome the credibility concerns that arose in the claimant's evidence. The panel gives the police letter no evidentiary weight.\nLetter from XXXX\n[21] The claimant submitted two letters from XXXX XXXX in Toronto, Canada, XXXX, where the claimant is currently XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.16 One of the letters states that the claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and has shared her own experiences of abuse. The second letter states that the claimant disclosed to the author of the letter that she is married to XXXX XXXX and has suffered from an abusive marriage. The evidence before the panel indicates that the author of the letter is simply recounting what the claimant has said and there is no evidence that the author of the letter has any evidence independent of the claimant to establish that the claimant is in fact married to XXXX XXXX. As any knowledge of the claimant's personal circumstances by the authors of the letters from Nellie's originates from the claimant herself, who the panel has found to not be credible, the panel finds the letters from XXXX is not persuasive evidence to overcome the credibility concerns that arose in the claimant's evidence. The panel gives the letters no evidentiary weight.\nMedical documents\n[22] The claimant submitted several medical documents, including a Discharge Summary Form from XXXX XXXX XXXX, an Inpatient Discharge Form from XXXX XXXX, a medical note from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and a medical record from the Ministry of Health XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.17\n[23] The Discharge Summary Form from XXXX XXXX XXXX simply states that the claimant suffered from XXXX XXXX XXXX and records her treatment. The panel gives this document no evidentiary weight in establishing that the claimant was married and suffered from an abusive marriage.\n[24] The other medical documents all state that the claimant was abused by her husband. There is no evidence before the panel of how these alleged officials are aware of the claimant's marital status. The panel has found that the claimant is not a credible witness with respect to her allegations she was ever married. The panel finds that documents with no security features from unknown individuals whose identities have not been established and moreover whose statements contain information that raises serious credibility concerns is not persuasive evidence that is reliable or trustworthy to overcome the credibility concerns that arose in the claimant's evidence. The panel gives the medical documents no evidentiary weight.\nPhotographs\n[25] The claimants provided photographs of herself as well as of another individual.18 Given the serious credibility concerns that arose with respect to the claimant's allegations of her alleged marriage to XXXX XXXX, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that photographs of the claimant and of an unknown individual, whose identity and his relationship to the claimant has not been verified in any manner further to the claimant's testimony, which has been found to not be credible, do not offer persuasive evidence to conclude, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant was married or was involved in an abusive marriage and therefore do not overcome the credibility concerns as noted previously with respect to the claimant's alleged abusive marriage to XXXX XXXX. As the claimant has been found to not be credible, the panel is simply left with photographs of the claimant and of an unknown individual in unknown circumstances with unknown context. The panel finds that such photographs do not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant was married or suffered from an abusive marriage. The panel therefore gives the photographs no evidentiary weight.\nThe claimant's profile as a victim of domestic violence and forward-looking risk\n[26] The claimant alleges she was married and subsequently became a victim of domestic violence at the hands of her husband, XXXX XXXX. The panel has found that serious credibility concerns arose and the claimant lacks credibility with respect to her allegations she was ever married. As there is no persuasive evidence before the panel that the claimant was ever married, the panel finds there is no persuasive evidence to establish that the claimant was ever a victim of domestic violence at the hands of an alleged husband. The panel finds the claimant is not credible with respect to her alleged marriage, is not credible with respect to her alleged husband, XXXX XXXX, and is not credible with respect to her alleged domestic abuse. The panel further finds that the claimant has demonstrated her capacity to knowingly and purposefully deceive Canadian officials by submitting fraudulent information in her TRV applications, while at the same time declaring in those same applications that she had answered all questions fully and truthfully. The panel finds this is strong evidence of the claimant's lack of credibility. The panel finds that there is no credible evidence to establish that the claimant would face any harm should she return to Uganda.\nCONCLUSION\n[27] The panel has considered all the grounds of protection under section 96 and subsection 97(1) of IRPA and based on the totality of the evidence determines that there is not a serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted in Uganda, or that, on a balance of probabilities, she would be personally subjected to a danger of torture, or face a risk to her life, or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Uganda.\n[28] The panel concludes that the claimant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection and therefore rejects her claim.\n[29] In rejecting the claim, the panel determines there was no credible or trustworthy evidence on which the panel could have made a favourable decision, given the claimant's lack of credibility and the lack of independent, credible evidence linking the claimant to potential persecution or a risk of harm under section 96 and 97 of IRPA. In accordance with section 107(2) of IRPA the panel determines that there is no credible basis for this claim.\n(signed)\n\"A. Jung\"\nA.

A hearing was conducted on April 25, 2014 and July 7, 2015 to determine if the claimants were Convention refugees or persons in need of protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \"Act\").1\n[2] At the onset of the hearing on April 25, 2014 the principal claimant was assigned by the panel as the designated representative for the two minor claimants.\n[3] The Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (\"the Minister\") was a party to the proceedings, having filed a Notice of Intervention dated May 16, 2013.2 The Minister's intervention was limited to the filing of documentary evidence and by making written submissions. Despite being notified by the Immigration and Refugee Board (the \"Board\") under Rule 26(1)3 that Article 1E Exclusion was an issue in the claim, the Minister's intervention was limited to issues of credibility.\n[4] By way of an application made to the Board on July 24, 2015, counsel for the claimants sought to have documents submitted post-hearing accepted as evidence in these claims. The panel has reviewed these documents, and concurs with counsel that they are probative to the issue of Article 1E Exclusion. The documents are entered as Exhibit 24.4 The claimants have also provided translations of their Greek Health booklets. These documents are entered as Exhibit 25.5\nDETERMINATION\n[5] The panel finds the claimants are not Convention refugees, nor are they persons in need of protection from a risk to their lives, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture.\nALLEGATIONS\n[6] The claimants allege a fear of harm from an individual named XXXX XXXX and the organization known as the XXXX XXXX in both Albania and Greece, in addition to the human smugglers who assisted the claimants in coming to Canada.\n[7] The principal claimant has resided in Greece since 1991. The dependent claimant joined him there in approximately 2001, and both of the minor claimants were born in Greece yet are not citizens of that country.\n[8] In 2007 the principal claimant's father learned that people associated with XXXX crime group were using the family's land in Albania to grow marihuana. The principal claimant reported the matter to the police in XXXX 2009. This led to XXXX XXXX being incarcerated for XXXX years in XXXX 2009.\n[9] Individuals from XXXX crime group began to threaten the principal claimant's family in XXXX 2009, as the claimants had returned to Greece at this time. They informed the principal claimant's parents that they would face consequences for bringing the complaint forward, and owed them compensation for the marihuana that was seized. The parents complained to the police in XXXX 2010, but the police did not wish to get involved in the situation.\n[10] In XXXX 2012, XXXX was released from prison. He assaulted the principal claimant's father, and inquired as to the principal claimant's whereabouts.\n[11] Unbeknownst to the principal claimant, on XXXX XXXX, 2012 the dependent claimant was raped in the claimants' residence in Greece by two of XXXX associates. The dependent claimant only informed the principal claimant of the rape subsequent to their arrival in Canada and the filing of their initial Personal Information Forms.6 The dependent claimant did not report this sexual assault to the police in Greece.\n[12] The principal claimant returned to Albania in XXXX 2012 and met with his family in a secret location, where his parents introduced the principal claimant to a smuggler who would assist the claimants in leaving Greece. He returned to Greece, and the claimants travelled to Canada using the fraudulent Greek passports on XXXX XXXX, 2012. They made their claims for protection at the immigration office in Toronto, Ontario on June 6, 2012.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[13] The claimants' identities as nationals of Albania are established by the documentary evidence they provided contained in Exhibit 11.7 In reviewing these documents in conjunction with information provided by the Minister, the panel is satisfied on the balance of probabilities the claimants are not citizens of Greece.\nArticle 1E Exclusion\n[14] The claimants' residency in Greece was a predominant issue in these claims. The agents of harm feared by the claimants are located in Albania, and during the time period in which the claimants felt at risk they were residing in Greece as long-term residents. Greece is a democratic country, with a strong human rights record and effective state protection mechanisms. In the view of the panel, the claimants' residence in this country raised issues of Article 1E Exclusion, state protection, and credibility \/ subjective fear.\n[15] Article 1E provides \"The Convention shall not apply to a person who is recognized by the competent authorities of the country in which he has taken residence as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of the nationality of that country.\" A non-exhaustive list of the criteria that constitutes \"the rights and obligations which are attached to possession of nationality of that country\" was provided by the Federal Court in Shamlou v. Canada: (a) the right to return to the country of residence; (b) the right to work freely without restrictions; (c) the right to study, and (d) full access to social services in the country of residence. Temporary status which must be renewed and could be cancelled should not result in a claimant from being excluded. 8\n[16] The Federal Court of Appeal provided additional guidance on the application of Article 1E Exclusion in the case of Canada v. Zeng at paragraph 28:\nConsidering all relevant factors to the date of the hearing, does the claimant have status, substantially similar to that of its nationals, in the third country? If the answer is yes, the claimant is excluded. If the answer is no, the next question is whether the claimant previously had such status and lost it, or had access to such status and failed to acquire it. If the answer is no, the claimant is not excluded under Article 1E. If the answer is yes, the RPD must consider and balance various factors. These include, but are not limited to, the reason for the loss of status (voluntary or involuntary), whether the claimant could return to the third country, the risk the claimant would face in the home country, Canada's international obligations, and any other relevant facts.9\n[17] The principal claimant testified that he first entered Greece in 1991 and has resided in that country for the majority of time since then. He testified that he left Albania due to economic reasons, and initially entered the country by crossing the border illegally. He initially obtained legal status in Greece in 1997 in the form of a residency permit, and in 1999 his permit was changed so as to allow the principal claimant to work in Greece. The dependent claimant moved to Greece in 1999 upon marrying the principal claimant and his support of her entry through a family reunification procedure. In 2010 the principal claimant obtained a 10-year residency permit. The two minor claimants were born in Greece in 2001 and 2003. The principal claimant testified that despite his possession of a 10-year residency permit, the other claimants possessed permits that required renewal every two years.\n[18] According to the principal claimant's testimony, between 1999 and 2012, he travelled back and forth between Greece and Albania on numerous occasions, using his Albanian passport and Greek residency permits. Both the principal claimant and the dependent claimant were permitted to work in Greece, and their children were able to attend school. The dependent claimant received social assistance in Greece, and the claimants utilized the Greek medical and dental systems. Regarding medical problems that the dependent claimant was suffering, the principal claimant testified that she went to see private doctors because the wait times for public doctors was too long. There was no indication from the claimants that they could not access state social services.\n[19] The principal claimant's testimony regarding his spouse's immigration status in Greece was unclear. He testified that prior to 2004, the dependent claimant had remained in Greece as his co-dependent. However, in 2004 the dependent claimant went on social assistance, and at that time her immigration status was considered independent to that of the principal claimant. At that time, she was given a work permit that enabled her to work in Greece. It was unclear to the panel why the Greek authorities would grant the dependent claimant a work permit and assess her immigration status independent of her husband's after she began to receive social assistance, and thus be even more dependent on her spouse. The principal claimant was unable to explain why this occurred. During questioning by his counsel, the principal claimant testified that he was unsure whether his wife would be eligible for a 10-year permit. He could also not explain why one of the minor claimants (XXXX) would be included under his spouse's two-year residence permit and the other minor claimant (XXXX) under his 10-year permit, or why if XXXX only had a two-year permit if he was included under the principal claimant's 10-year permit.\n[20] The principal claimant testified that he had attempted to apply for Greek citizenship for the family in 2010, but the applications were denied. The claimants provided copies of stamps they purport establish they applied for citizenship. The stamps are dated XXXX XXXX, 2011 and appear to have a handwritten file number underneath. The only thing connecting these documents to the claimants are the first names of the adult claimants handwritten at the top.10\n[21] The principal claimant further testified that subsequent to coming to Canada, he went to the Greek consulate in Toronto in order to have a criminal records check done, and was informed verbally that he was not permitted to return to Greece. The claimants have not received any documentation indicating that their status in Greece has ceased.\n[22] The dependent claimant attempted to clarify during her testimony the manner in which she obtained her immigration status in 2004. She stated that in 2004 she began to work as a XXXX, and in order to track her employment she was required to be assigned a number similar to a Social Insurance Number in Canada. This necessitated her immigration status in Greece to be assessed independently from that of her spouse. She did not believe she would be able to get a 10-year visa as her husband did due to the fact that she was working \"under the table\" in Greece. The panel noted that despite her immigration status changing in 2004 due to her becoming employed as a XXXX, the dependent claimant stated in her IMM5611 \"Claim for Refugee Protection Form\" that she was actually employed as a XXXX since 2002.11 She stated that between 2002 and 2004 she was on a \"training period\" and she did not actually obtain an employment record until 2004. In the view of the panel, the dependent claimant's explanation does not account for the contradiction between her testimony and the documentary evidence.\n[23] The documents provided by both the claimants and the Minister pertaining to the claimants' immigration statuses in Greece are incomplete and confusing. The claimants travelled to Canada using false (improperly issued) Greek passports. At the time they made their refugee claims in Canada, they also presented Albanian identity certificates and Albanian identity cards for the two adult claimants. On May 16, 2013 the Minister disclosed to the Board information received from the Greek government they had received on March 29, 2013. This information indicated the principal claimant had a residence permit that expired on XXXX XXXX, 2010, and that the other \"foreign individuals mentioned\" (presumably the other claimants) \"have also acquired a Residence Permit (No. XXXX and XXXX) as members of the same family\".12 \"Residence Permit XXXX\" corresponds with a visa in the second passport of the dependent claimant (expires XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015) that appears to have been valid for only XXXX days: XXXX XXXX, 2007 to XXXX XXXX, 2007. The information from the Greek authorities appears to contradict the claimants' testimony that the dependent claimant acquired her immigration status in Greece independent of her husband after 2004.\n[24] On February 24, 2014 the Minister disclosed an additional document from the Greek authorities that was issued on XXXX XXXX, 2013. This document states the principal claimant was issued a 10-year permit, number XXXX, valid from XXXX XXXX, 2010 to XXXX XXXX, 2020.13 The document further states that no information regarding the \"rest of the aliens\" could be found in the archives of their department.\n[25] Also, on February 25, 2014 counsel for the claimants disclosed identity documents for the claimants, including copies of the claimants Albanian passports, birth certificates, family certificate and marriage certificate. The passport for the principal claimant (issued XXXX XXXX, 2005) indicates that he was given a \"permit for employment\" for Greece on XXXX XXXX, 2009 that was valid until XXXX XXXX, 2010.14 The passport for the dependent claimant (issued XXXX XXXX, 2009) indicates that she was given a permit on XXXX XXXX, 2011 that was valid until XXXX XXXX, 2013. A copy of a second passport for the dependent claimant was also issued that appears to cover the same period of validity as the first, XXXX XXXX, 2005 to XXXX XXXX, 2015.15 The passports for the two minor claimants have no indication of their status in Greece.16 These passports indicate frequent, regular travel across the Greek border with Albania.\n[26] The post-hearing evidence filed by the claimants contains copies of a second passport for the two children.17 The passport for XXXX XXXX was issued XXXX XXXX, 2004, the expiry date is cut off on the copy. The most recent residency permit issued has a validity date expiring XXXX XXXX, 2010. The second passport for XXXX XXXX was issued XXXX XXXX, 2006 and expiring on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2011. This passport clearly falls within the same validity passport as the one contained in Exhibit 11. The most recent residency permit in this passport appears to expire XXXX XXXX XXXX 2011.18 As part of the application to submit evidence post-hearing, the dependent claimant provided an affidavit in which she explains that these passport copies had not been provided to the Board previously due to an oversight on her part. She further wrote that upon expiration of the minor claimants' permits, the family applied for extensions but never received a reply. Instead, they received an acknowledgement from the Greek authorities that the application had been received, and they used these documents in lieu of an actual permit. These attestations are included with the post-hearing evidence, and corroborate the dependent claimant's statement that they are valid \"to a temporary resident permit until the issuance of a respective decision.\"19\n[27] The panel is satisfied the claimants do not currently have status in Greece similar to nationals of that country. While numerous credibility issues were apparent with the claimants' testimony regarding their immigration status in Greece, the documents provided by the Minister from the Greek government are similarly unclear. The claimants have remained in Greece for a long time with valid status, and enjoyed employment, educational, and medical rights in that country similar to nationals of that country. However, the documentary evidence before the panel establishes the immigration status they were provided in Greece was not indefinite, and had to be renewed. While the panel does not accept the claimants' testimony regarding the manner that this status was renewed, or their description of the efforts they made to acquire permanent status, ultimately there is insufficient credible evidence before the panel to establish the claimants were automatically entitled to any type of permanent status in Greece. The principal claimant is currently in possession of what appears to be a valid 10-year residency permit, and the panel's review of Greece's immigration legislation20 indicates there is a distinction in Greek law between permits of this duration (as outlined in Article 91 - Transitional arrangements21) and the \"Long-term residency permit\" detailed in Article 67.22 It has not been established to the panel's satisfaction that renewing the 10-year visa is automatic, and thus cannot be considered permanent. Receiving the permit is conditional on the claimants maintaining medical coverage which, as per the submissions of counsel for the claimants, is dependent on their ability to afford it. With respect to the other claimants, it is clear that whatever status they formerly had in Greece has expired.\n[28] Therefore, the panel concludes the claimants do not have status substantially similar to nationals of Greece, nor did they automatically have access to this type of status but failed to acquire it. Accordingly, the panel finds the claimants are not excluded by operation of Article 1E, and has considered these claims on their merits.\nCredibility\n[29] The panel did not find the claimants to be credible witnesses, and therefore did not believe what they alleged in support of their claims. The panel's decision on the claimants' credibility is based on inconsistencies between their testimony and the documentary evidence, a significant omission from their Personal Information Forms (the \"PIFs\"), and a lack of corroborative documentary evidence.\n[30] The principal claimant alleges that the claimants' problems in Albania arose as a result of him making a complaint to the police about the drug dealing activity of XXXX XXXX. The principal claimant's testimony as to when he made the police report was imprecise; he stated, \"I cannot remember precisely, but maybe XXXX or XXXX of 2009.\" The court documents provided by the claimant establish that XXXX XXXX was arrested by the police on XXXX XXXX, 2009.23 There is no documentary evidence linking the police report allegedly made by the principal claimant to the arrest and conviction of XXXX XXXX.\n[31] The panel is cognizant of the corruption and inefficiency that exists within the police forces in Albania. However, while problems of corruption and inefficiency plague the Albanian police, the Albanian constitution requires that judges issue warrants for the arrest of suspected criminals based on sufficient evidence.24 While \"political pressure, intimidation, widespread corruption, and limited resources sometimes prevented the judiciary from functioning independently and efficiently,\" the government \"generally respected the rights\" of accused persons to a fair trial, including the right \"to be informed promptly and in detail of the charges\" against them.25 In the view of the panel, this would include being provided with any information that led to their arrest, such as the complaint made by the principal claimant to the police against XXXX XXXX.\n[32] Accordingly, the key documentary evidence missing from the claimants' disclosure is a copy of the police report he made when he reported XXXX XXXX drug trafficking activities to the police. The principal claimant's testimony as to whether he had attempted to obtain a copy of this police report was vague and unclear. When asked this question by the panel directly, the principal's claimant's initial response was that he \"was not sure\" if he had asked for a copy of the report or not, and that he did not think that he would have been able to obtain a copy of the report. When clarification was sought by the panel due to the principal claimant's unclear response, the claimant changed his evidence and stated that he had asked his father to obtain the police report, but his father was told that the documents did not exist. Contrary to the principal claimant's unclear testimony on this issue, the objective documentary evidence establishes quite clearly that individuals are able to obtain police reports in Albania, and that they are able to obtain police reports through the use of a third party if power of attorney is granted to the third party.26 The panel drew a negative inference on the claimant's credibility due to his vague and contradictory testimony relating to this key piece of evidence for his claim.\n[33] It is open to the panel to draw a negative inference on a claimant's credibility due to a lack of corroborating documentation accompanied by the lack of a reasonable and credible explanation for the failure to produce that evidence.27 The copy of the police report made by the claimant would have connected the claimant's actions to the motivation of his alleged agent of harm to target him; the only other evidence that makes this connection is the claimants' testimony, which the panel does not accept at face value due to the credibility issues noted in these reasons. The objective country condition evidence establishes that this report should have been available to the claimants, and the principle claimant's explanation for not providing the document was vague and contradictory. The claimants are represented by counsel, and have had an ample amount of time to obtain the document.\n[34] The primary credibility issue in these claims is the omission of the rape allegedly perpetrated against the dependent claimant while the claimants were residing in Greece from the claimants' initial PIFs. The initial PIFs were filed with the Board on July 23, 2012. These PIFs were completed by the claimants with the assistance of the claimants' former counsel and an interpreter. The dependent claimant did not prepare an independent narrative in her initial PIF, and relied on the narrative provided by the principal claimant. Amended PIFs were filed by the claimants on February 25, 201428 with the assistance of an interpreter and their current counsel. In her amended PIF, the dependent claimant provided the details of the rape that was allegedly committed against her on XXXX XXXX, 2012.\n[35] The dependent claimant's explanation for this omission, as provided in her amended PIF and recounted during her oral testimony, is that she had decided against telling her husband about the sexual assault because she was afraid that he would attempt to take revenge on the people who had harmed her, and because of the shame and trauma she experienced due to having been the victim of a sexual assault. It was only after she had come to Canada and subsequent to the filing of the initial PIF with former counsel that she confided about the rape with her current counsel, who referred the dependent claimant to trauma counseling and assisted the claimants in completing the amended PIFs. For the reasons that follow, the panel does not accept the explanations for the omission provided by the claimants, and it drew a significant negative inference on the claimants' credibility as a result.\n[36] The dependent claimant's explanation for the omission pertaining to her fear that her husband would take retribution against the attackers is negated by the fact that the omission was made while the claimants were in Canada, and thus the principal claimant would have not been able to take any action against the individuals who allegedly harmed his wife. While this circumstance could have made the dependent claimant reluctant to divulge the sexual assault to her husband while the claimants were still in Greece, given the importance of the refugee claims to the family it is not reasonable the dependent claimant would have withheld this information from her spouse for two years after the claimants were no longer in proximity to the alleged assailants.\n[37] There is objective evidence before the panel that establishes that victims of sexual assault are reluctant to disclose these incidents due to shame and embarrassment.29 The Gender Guidelines30 specifically state: \"Women from societies where the preservation of one's virginity or marital dignity is the cultural norm may be reluctant to disclose their experiences of sexual violence in order to keep their \"shame\" to themselves and not dishonor their family or community.\" Despite this evidence and information from the Gender Guidelines, the panel does not accept that in this particular circumstance, the dependent claimant omitted this information from her initial PIF due to feelings of shame and embarrassment for the following reasons.\n[38] The principal claimant's testimony as to why the family left Albania was not credible. During his testimony, the principal claimant attributed his decision to leave Greece to the pressure and insistence from the dependent claimant that they needed to leave the country. Despite not being aware that XXXX XXXX organization had located them in Greece and having lived in this democratic, European state for the better part of two decades, the principal claimant decided to leave Greece due to his spouse's mere insistence. The initial PIF completed by the principal claimant completely omits this rationale for leaving Greece. Rather, the principal claimant attributes the decision to leave on the economic and political situation in Greece, the hostility of the Greek police, and reports of nationalists threatening and attacking foreigners in Greece.\n[39] The principal claimant was asked why he did not mention in his original PIF that he left Greece due to the pressure and insistence of his spouse. The principal claimant attributed this omission to the failure of his former counsel to accurately record his story. The panel does not accept this explanation. No formal allegations of misconduct have been made against the previous counsel, and therefore previous counsel has not had an opportunity to either confirm or deny the claimant's version as to how the original PIF narrative was created.\n[40] This omission from the principal claimant's initial PIF is compounded by a significant contradiction between his oral testimony and both the original and amended PIF with respect to the claimants' reasons for leaving Greece. The principal claimant testified that he was arrested and beaten by the police in 2009 for being an Albanian national without proper identification. This incident was not recorded in either the initial or the amended PIFs, and in fact the principal claimant answered \"no\" to Question 9(a) of the PIF31 that asks if he has ever been arrested before. His description of other various attacks he suffered due to be an Albanian living in Greece was vague in terms of dates and specific events.\n[41] The provision of the sexual assault incident serves to remedy a major evidentiary gap that existed in the initial PIFs. Prior to the sexual assault information being provided to the Board two years after the filing of the initial PIFs, there was little explanation provided by the claimants as to why they left Greece. Their alleged agents of harm resided in Albania. The claimants had not had any contact with the agents of harm while in Greece. The principal claimant stated in his initial PIF that the decision to leave Albania was based on the economic situation in that country and the increasing level of racism against Albanians. As the initial PIFs were originally prepared, significant issues of failure to claim elsewhere and state protection were apparent in these claims. The fact that the provision of the sexual assault incident information serves to overcome these shortcomings in the claim causes the panel to further question the credibility of the dependent claimant's explanation for withholding this information.\n[42] Lastly, the only corroborating evidence provided by the claimants to assist in establishing the sexual assault was committed against the dependent claimant is a statutory declaration from the sister of the dependent claimant, XXXX XXXX.32 The document merely states that the dependent claimant was the victim of rape in Athens in XXXX 2012. The circumstances of the event, and the declarant's actual observations during the time surrounding the event, are not provided. For example, the manner in which the declarant learned of this rape is not provided, nor are there any details of the assistance provided by the declarant to the dependent claimant. The declarant did not testify at the hearing, and therefore her credibility could not be assessed through examination by the panel. When the panel weighs the evidentiary shortcomings of this document against the credibility concerns noted above, the panel finds it cannot afford this document sufficient weight to repair the credibility concerns in the claimants' sworn testimony. Other declarations provided by the claimants that purport to establish other elements of the claim33 suffer from the same lack of descriptive detail.\n[43] The panel has reviewed the psychiatric assessment report pertaining to the dependent claimant, as well as the letters from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.34 In attributing the dependent claimant's mental health difficulties to the rape she states she suffered in Greece, the evidentiary value of these documents are ultimately reliant on the credibility of the statements provided by the dependent claimant to these health care providers. The panel assigns greater weight to its own observations regarding the dependent claimant's credibility as opposed to the findings of the authors of these documents.\n[44] The only remaining evidence before the panel that would assist in establishing that XXXX XXXX organization is after the claimants is a grainy photograph of a man lying down with bandages on his face35 and a grainy photograph of a dog lying on the ground.36 The claimants assert these photographs are evidence that XXXX XXXX associates assaulted the claimant's father and poisoned the family dog, however the quality of these photographs do not allow the panel to reach these conclusions.\n[45] The credibility concerns with the claimants' evidence are apparent in the apparent motive of XXXX XXXX to harm the claimants (the unexplained lack of a police report), the solitary incident in which the claimants were harmed by this individual (the omission from of the sexual assault of the dependent claimant from the PIF) and the claimants' rationale for leaving the western, democratic country in which they resided due to their problems (omission of the arrest in Greece and the pressure from the dependent claimant from the PIF of the principal claimant). When the scope of these credibility concerns through multiple aspects of the claim are considered in combination with the generally vague and unclear nature of several parts of their testimony, the panel finds it is unable to accept the claimants' testimony at face value. The claimants have also failed to provide sufficient documentary evidence that would assist the panel in accepting their allegations as true. Accordingly, the panel finds the claimants have failed to establish on a balance of probabilities that they are being targeted by the criminal XXXX XXXX or his organization.\n[46] With respect to the fears expressed by the claimants of the people smugglers who assisted their travel to Canada, the panel does not find that these smugglers present, on a balance of probabilities, a risk to the lives or a risk of cruel or unusual treatment to the claimants. These smugglers are located in Greece, and the claimants are nationals of Albania. While these smugglers may have the ability to travel into Albania, and may perhaps even have connections to other criminals in Greece, insufficient evidence has been provided by the claimants to establish the scope, size and reach of any organization these smugglers belong to would be able to locate them in Albania, or even be made aware of the claimants' return to Albania after having been absent for more than two decades.\n[47] The panel's findings with respect to the claimants' credibility are determinative of the claims for both the panel's analyses under section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Act.\nNCLUSION\n[48] The panel finds the claimants are not Convention refugees, nor are they persons in need of protection from a risk to their lives, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture in their country of nationality. The claims for protection are therefore denied.\n(signed)\n\"Jesse Davidson\"\nJesse Davidson\nFebruary 29, 2016\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibit 5\n3 Refugee Protection Division Rules, SOR\/2012-256.\n4 Exhibit 24.\n5 Exhibit 25.\n6 Exhibit 2.\n7 Exhibit 11.\n8 Shamlou v.

He is claiming refugee protection in Canada pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)1.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The details of the claimant's allegations were documented in his Basis of Claim form (BOC)2 as well as in his oral testimony.\n[3] The claimant fears persecution in Eritrea because he left the country illegally. The claimant also fears mandatory military service.\n[4] The claimant left Eritrea in 2004 and travelled through several countries before arriving in the United Kingdom (UK) in XXXX XXXX, 2006 where he made an asylum claim. The claimant's UK asylum claim was denied in 2006 and his subsequent appeal was denied in 2007. The claimant left the UK and came to Canada on August 31, 2015.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] The panel determines that the claimant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of IRPA.\n[6] The determinative issue in this claim is identity and credibility as it relates to identity.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity and Credibility\n[7] The claimant did not have any identity documents from Eritrea. The claimant presented other supporting documentation to establish his identity, including his baptism certificate, national identity cards for his mother and father, and his mother's passport.3 The panel noted several credibility concerns with the claimant's testimony. The panel finds the claimant has not provided reasonable explanations for the credibility concerns and therefore finds the claimant is not a credible witness. The panel therefore finds that the presumption of truthfulness is not applicable in the claimant's circumstances.\nUnited Kingdom\n[8] The claimant testified he resided in the United Kingdom from XXXX XXXX, 2006 to XXXX XXXX, 2015. The claimant made an asylum claim in 2006 which was rejected. The claimant's appeal was rejected in 2007. The claimant did not present any documents pertaining to his UK asylum claim. The claimant stated he left all his documents in the UK. When asked what efforts he made to obtain his UK asylum documents, the claimant stated that he contacted his friends. The claimant testified he did not contact his counsel in the UK nor did he make any attempts to contact the UK authorities. The claimant testified in a confusing and evasive manner that he could not contact his UK lawyer and therefore he could not contact the UK government. The panel rejects the claimant's explanation. There is no evidence before the panel that the claimant contacted his friends in any manner, whether the claimant provided any letter of authorization to his friends to act on his behalf or what he expected his friends to do to obtain the claimant's UK asylum documentation. There is no evidence before the panel that the claimant contacted the British consulate in Toronto or the British High Commission in Ottawa or his UK counsel who represented the claimant in the UK. The panel finds it is reasonable to expect that if the claimant contacted the UK government authorities that he could potentially have obtained some documentation, including documents pertaining to his asylum claim and verification of his status and identity in the United Kingdom. The panel notes that the claimant has retained counsel in Canada to assist him with his refugee claim and the panel finds that the claimant thereby had the necessary resources at his disposal to inquire into such processes. Moreover, the claimant had ample opportunity to contact UK authorities and\/or his UK counsel after his hearing of December 15, 2015 as the panel adjourned the hearing until April 2016 to await further documentation pertaining to the claimant's UK immigration history. The Board sent a request to obtain the claimant's UK biometrics report which was ultimately unavailable. There is no evidence before the panel that the claimant made any reasonable efforts during the four month adjournment following his refugee claim hearing of December 15, 2015 to obtain documentation from the UK authorities or his UK counsel. The panel simply does not find it reasonable that in the course of nine years of living in a stable, functioning country such as the UK that the claimant does not have a single piece of documentation issued from UK authorities or his UK counsel to submit as evidence. The panel finds the claimant's lack of documents from the United Kingdom, his unreasonable explanation for the lack of such documents, and his lack of reasonable efforts made to obtain such documents undermine his credibility. The panel draws a negative inference with respect to the claimant's credibility and his credibility as it relates to his identity.\n[9] The claimant resided in the United Kingdom from 2006 to 2015. The claimant testified he did not work during this time and was \"just idle\". The claimant repeated that he did not do anything in the nine years he resided in the United Kingdom and that he got assistance from the church. The panel notes the disclosure of a letter from the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahdo Menbere Tsebaot Medhanealem Church in the UK.4 There is no reference in the letter that the church assisted the claimant in any manner with his nine year residence in the UK. The panel does not find it reasonable that the claimant was able to reside in the United Kingdom for nine years by just being \"idle\". The claimant did not provide any detailed testimony of how he managed to shelter, clothe, and feed himself in those nine years by just being \"idle\". The panel finds the claimant is not a credible witness in this regard. The panel finds the claimant is deliberately being evasive with respect to his activities in the UK. The panel finds the claimant is not a credible witness and his lack of credibility undermines his allegations as it relates to his identity.\n[10] The claimant stated his UK asylum claim was denied in 2006 and his appeal was denied in 2007. The claimant stated he did not have legal status in the UK from 2007 to 2015. When asked why he waited eight years before leaving the United Kingdom and coming to Canada, the claimant stated he had no options. The panel finds the claimant has not provided a reasonable explanation for the long delay in coming to Canada. The claimant stated that his friends assisted him in coming to Canada in 2015. There is no supporting evidence before the panel from these friends and what they did to assist the claimant. There is no supporting evidence before the panel to explain why these alleged friends could not have assisted the claimant sooner than 2015 to leave the country. The panel finds the claimant's lack of a reasonable explanation for his eight year delay before leaving the UK after his appeal was denied undermines his credibility.\n[11] The claimant states in his Schedule 12 form that he left Eritrea on August 31, 2015, had a stopover in the UK and arrived in Canada on August 31, 2015. The claimant testified that in fact he left Eritrea in 2004. The claimant explained in his BOC that the information with respect to his travel route to Canada was not truthful and that he provided incorrect information because he was afraid the immigration officials might return the claimant back to the UK. The panel notes that the claimant signed his Schedule 12 form and by signing he declared that \"the information I have given in the foregoing application is truthful, complete and correct, and I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing it to be true and knowing that it is of the same force and effect as if made under oath\". The claimant has admitted to providing information in his Schedule 12 that is not true. The evidence before the panel is that despite the claimant's solemn declaration that he is telling the truth, he deliberately and knowingly provided information that is not true. The panel finds the claimant has not provided a reasonable explanation for his deceit, as the claimant himself states in his BOC that while he was in the UK he was told that Canada is a compassionate country and that he may be accepted as a refugee here. There is no reasonable explanation why the claimant would come to Canada believing Canada could protect him but then tell lies because he believed Canada would deport him. There is irrefutable evidence before the panel that the claimant is not a credible witness despite his solemn declarations that he is telling the truth. The panel finds the claimant to be lacking in credibility and gives no weight to his testimony.\nBaptism Certificate\n[12] The claimant presented his Baptism Certificate.5 The panel asked the claimant when the baptism certificate was issued. The claimant did not answer in a straightforward manner. The panel had to repeatedly ask the question numerous times. The claimant gave an evasive, confusing response and stated that it was issued \"last month\" but then said that he did not know the exact date of when his baptism certificate was issued. The claimant then proceeded to explain that the certificate is signed on the date the person is baptized but that the certificate is not issued \"right away\" but at some later date. The panel pointed out to the claimant that his baptism certificate indicates that it was issued on XXXX XXXX, 1987 and the date of the claimant's baptism is also XXXX XXXX, 1987. When asked if he was aware his baptism certificate was issued in 1987, the claimant did not give a straightforward answer and evaded the question. The panel finds the claimant's evasiveness and his confusing and rambling testimony with respect to his baptism certificate undermines his credibility.\n[13] A certificate of baptism is not an official identity document. There are no security features on the certificate and no accompanying photo. Furthermore, the claimant did not have any reliable knowledge of how his baptism certificates was issued or when or what documents are required, if any at all, in order to obtain a baptism certificate. The panel finds that the baptism certificate does not confirm or establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the individual before the panel is XXXX XXXX. The panel finds there is no persuasive evidence before the panel that is reliable and trustworthy to establish that the baptism certificate is a properly issued document and one that was issued to the claimant. The panel gives the certificate of baptism no evidentiary weight in establishing, on a balance of probabilities, the identity of the claimant.\nNational identity cards of the claimant's mother and father\n[14] The claimant disclosed copies of national identity cards for the claimant's mother and father.6 The attached copy of the national identity cards, allegedly from the claimant's mother and father, indicate that the claimant's father's name is XXXX XXXX XXXX, with a date of birth of XXXX XXXX, 1943 and that the claimant's mother's name is XXXX XXXX XXXX with a date of birth of 1956. The panel notes that the claimant states in his BOC that his mother's date of birth is \"1955XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\" and his father's date of birth is \"1945XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\". When asked for an explanation for the inconsistencies, the claimant explained that he did not know the exact dates of birth for his parents and simply provided their approximate ages when he completed his forms. The claimant stated that he guessed the approximate ages of his mother and father but did not know the actual year of birth. The panel rejects the claimant's explanation for the inconsistent information with respect to his parents. The panel notes that the claimant is given clear instructions in his BOC with respect to providing dates of birth as follows: \"If you do not know the date, give the person's approximate age (__years)\". The claimant was represented and had the benefit and guidance of experienced counsel in the completion of his BOC and in the preparation for his hearing. The claimant confirmed at the outset of the hearing that his BOC was complete, true, and correct. In this context, the panel notes that if the claimant only knew his parents' approximate age as he claims, he had the option and was in fact duly instructed, to provide only the approximate age and not a date of birth in his BOC. Instead, the claimant provided a year of birth for both his mother and his father in his BOC. The panel therefore rejects the claimant's explanation that he knew only the approximate age of his parents and not the actual year of birth. The claimant further testified that errors in writing may arise once names are translated to English. The panel notes, however, that the inconsistencies in the names of the claimant's parents between the claimant's BOC and the national identity cards are not simply a matter of a difference in spelling, but also the addition of another surname. The panel finds the claimant has not provided a reasonable explanation to address why the personal information in the national identity cards of his alleged parents is not consistent with the claimant's BOC. The panel finds there is no persuasive evidence before the panel to find, on a balance of probabilities, that the national identity cards are from the claimant's parents. The panel gives the national identity cards no evidentiary weight in establishing the identity of the claimant.\nPassport\n[15] The claimant disclosed a copy of his mother's passport.7 The name in the passport is stated as XXXX XXXX XXXX and the date of birth as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX1956. This information is not consistent with the claimant's BOC which states the claimant's mother's name is XXXX XXXX, with a date of birth of 1955XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimant stated that there might be some \"errors\" in writing names when names are translated to English and that furthermore he never provided a date of birth for his mother, only an approximate age. The panel finds the claimant has not provided a reasonable explanation to address why the personal information in the alleged passport of his mother is not consistent with the claimant's BOC. The panel finds there is no persuasive evidence before the panel to find, on a balance of probabilities, that the passport is that of the claimant's mother. The panel gives the passport no evidentiary weight in establishing the identity of the claimant.\nWitness\n[16] The claimant presented a witness, Mr. XXXX XXXX (hereafter \"the witness\"), to corroborate his identity. The claimant stated that he and the witness grew up together in Eritrea. The claimant stated that once he left Eritrea in 2004 he did not have any further contact with the witness until they reconnected here in Canada in 2015. The witness also stated he had no contact with the claimant since 2004. The panel finds the witness' complete lack of knowledge of the claimant's personal history since 2004 is not sufficiently persuasive evidence to establish, on a balance of probabilities, the identity of the claimant. While the panel accepts, based on the witness' testimony, that the witness personally knew the claimant in Eritrea at some point in time before 2004, there is no evidence before the panel to find that the witness' testimony establishes the current national identity of the claimant as a citizen of Eritrea and no other country. The panel therefore gives the witness' testimony no evidentiary weight in establishing the identity of the claimant.\nLanguage and knowledge of Eritrea\n[17] The panel acknowledges that the claimant testified at the hearing in Tigrinya, a language commonly used in Eritrea. Furthermore, the claimant demonstrated knowledge of Eritrea. However, the panel finds that demonstrating fluency in a language used in a particular country and knowing the geography and culture of a country does not establish one's personal or national identity. For example, the panel notes that there many Canadian citizens who can speak reliably and knowledgeably about all aspects of Eritrea and are furthermore also fluent in the languages spoken in Eritrea, yet they are Canadian citizens and not Eritrean citizens. The panel gives no evidentiary weight with respect to the claimant's ability to speak Tigrinya and to speak about the country of Eritrea in establishing the personal and national identity of the claimant.\nLetters\n[18] The claimant submitted a letter from the Merso Ahmar St. Michael Eritrean Orthodox Tewahdo Church in Toronto, of which he is a member.8 A confirmation letter of membership from a church is not an identity document and although the letter confirms that an individual named XXXX XXXX has been attending the Merso Ahmar St. Michael Eritrean Orthodox Tewahdo Church, the letter does not confirm nor establish on a balance of probabilities that the claimant before the panel is XXXX XXXX, a citizen of Eritrea. There are no security features in the letter. The panel gives the letter from the church no evidentiary weight in establishing, on a balance of probabilities, the personal and national identity of the claimant.\n[19] The claimant submitted a letter from Eritrean Orthodox Tewahdo Menbere Tsebaot Medhanealem Church in London, UK.9 The letter states that the claimant \"served for long period of time\" at the church. The letter is not an identity document and there are no security features in the letter. Although the letter states that \"XXXX XXXX\" attended the church, the letter does not confirm nor establish on a balance of probabilities that the claimant before the panel is XXXX XXXX, a citizen of Eritrea. The panel gives the letter from the church no evidentiary weight in establishing on a balance of probabilities the personal and national identity of the claimant.\nFraudulent documents\n[20] The panel has reviewed the documentary evidence with respect to the prevalence of fraudulent documents in Eritrea. Fake and fraudulent Eritrean identity documents are prevalent outside Eritrea.10 Fraudulent identity cards are also prevalent in Eritrea and such documents are faked and sold by government and military officials on the black market.11 Eritrean national identity cards are \"easily alterable, making proof of Eritrean citizenship difficult to determine\".12 Given the prevalence of fraudulent documents and corruption in Eritrea in conjunction with the credibility concerns that arose with the claimant's testimony regarding his alleged parents' identity documents, the panel finds the claimant is not a credible witness with respect to his identity and has therefore not established on a balance of probabilities his personal identity or national identity.\nCONCLUSION\n[21] In considering the totality of the evidence the panel finds the claimant is not a credible witness and has not met the burden to establish his identity on a balance of probabilities as required by Section 106 of IRPA and Rule 11 of the Rules.\n[22] The panel concludes that the claimant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection and therefore rejects his claim.\n[23] In rejecting the claim, the panel determines there was no credible or trustworthy evidence on which the panel could have made a favourable decision, given the claimant's lack of credibility and the lack of independent, credible evidence linking the claimant to potential persecution or a risk of harm under section 96 and 97 of IRPA. In accordance with section 107(2) of IRPA the panel determines that there is no credible basis for this claim.\n(signed)\n\"A. Jung\".\nA.

The principal claimant completed 12 years of formal education.\n[6] As a result of this friendship, the principal claimant started attending his friend's XXXX XXXX, the place where the Shia worship and also a Shia community centre for their faith.\nSomeone complained to his uncle with whom he was living at the time. The principal claimant explained to his uncle what he had learned about Shias and his uncle told him to do as he liked.\n[7] The claimant's experiences and observations led the claimant to conclude that Shias are just as much Muslim as Sunnis are, and that Sunnis brainwash innocent children in madrasas, who go on to become terrorists, killing innocent men, women and even children. He was impressed with Shi'ism, and concluded everybody has the right to practice his religion of choice.\n[8] The principal claimant often visited Lahore with his friend, XXXX, and in 1994 he met the female claimant, his future wife, while staying with XXXX step-uncle. After the principal claimant converted from the Sunni to Shia faith, the adult claimants married in 1995. Everyone in his family but one uncle agreed with the union.\n[9] The female claimants are well-known in the Shia community; they build imam XXXX, and help poor Shia families arrange marriages. Several years later, the female claimant told the principal claimant that she wished to preach Shi'ism, to which the principal claimant agreed, as she had preached prior to their marriage. The principal claimant started to help her preach, and the female claimant became propaganda secretary of their ladies wing of the local imam XXXX.\n[10] Many small incidents happened often to the claimants and their Shia brethren but the big shock to the family was the brutal murder of the female claimant's step-uncle, Dr. Syed Al XXXXr, and his son in XXXX 2013.\n[11] The principal claimant was the owner and director of flour mills that distributed flour throughout Pakistan. Some flour mills stopped selling four to imam XXXX, and the principal claimant received many threats to stop, but he remained alert. The principal claimant's father had owned the flour mill, and transferred the whole business to the adult claimants in 2014.\n[12] On 14 XXXX 2014, unknown culprits came to the home of the claimants. Finding them absent, they stole valuables from their home. The principal claimant registered this incident as having been perpetrated by extremists, but the police registered the incident as \"theft\". The claimant received anonymous telephone threats, which he reported to the police, without result.\n[13] On XXXX XXXX 2015, the principal claimant and a son with a friend, on their return from a shrine, were shot at by persons unknown on a motorbike. The police came to the scene.\n[14] The family was shocked by this incident. They remained indoors. They applied for visas to Australia and the United States of America (US) in XXXX 2015. They received US visas and entered the US on XXXX XXXX 2015, valid to remain there until February 2016. The claimants came to the Fort Erie Port of Entry on or about 9 September 2015, where they were met by Canadian citizens, whose relationship with the female claimant allowed the claimants all to enter Canada without visas, as they qualified for the safe-third country exception.\nDETERMINATION\n[15] The panel determines that the claimants are not Convention refugees and not persons in need of protection. I also find6 that should the claimants return to their home country, they would not be subjected to risk to life or to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, personally. Further, on substantial grounds, I find there is no danger of torture.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[16] On a balance of probabilities, I find that the claimants established they are nationals of Pakistan based on the testimony and copies of the passports as seen in Exhibit 1.\nCredibility\n[17] In order to be determined to be either a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, the evidence must establish that the claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution for a Convention ground or must establish that his or her removal to the country of nationality would subject him or her, personally, either, (a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or (b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\n[18] In assessing the credibility of the evidence presented by the claimant, I am mindful of the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Maldonado7 wherein the Court stated, in part, that \"when a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there be reason to doubt their truthfulness\". I also considered the principle established by the Federal Court of Appeal in Dan-Ash,8 that such presumption of truthfulness may be rebutted by the existence of contradictions in the evidence presented by the claimant and that it is a valid basis for a finding of lack of credibility.\n[19] The evaluation of the credibility and probative value of the evidence must be made with regard to the totality of the evidence, including what is generally known about the conditions and laws of the country the claimant is from,9 as well as the experiences of similarly situated persons in that country.10 In assessing the claimant's credibility, I have also considered the decision in Orelien11 wherein the Federal Court of Appeal held that it is necessary for the claimant to establish that his or her evidence is probably credible or trustworthy, not just possibly so. I took into consideration the various factors that could affect the claimant's testimony including cultural differences, testimony given through the filter of an interpreter and hearing-room anxiety.12\n[20] I found the following credibility problems in this claim which caused it to doubt the evidence that has been put forward. Often, I needed to repeat a question because the claimant did not provide a direct answer, although he had been instructed at the outset to listen carefully to the questions posed, and to answer the question; further, if he did not understand a question for any reason, he was to let us know; finally, if he did not know the answer to a question, he was to\nsignify that he did not know the answer. Nevertheless, I found the claimant's answers to questions put to him vague and often not on topic.\n[21] For example, while discussing his wife being a Shia, I asked the claimant if his wife was Sufi; he answered, \"She preaches\", which I find is unresponsive. I repeated my question, \"Is your wife Sufi\" and the claimant again provided an indirect reply, \"Sufi is a branch of Sunni\". I then stated, \"So your answer to my question is 'no'\". Then the claimant stated, \"I do not know what you mean by Sufi.\" This reply ought to have been given to the first time I asked the question, and was typical of what I found to be evasive responses. I then noted, \"You just said 'Sufism is a branch of Sunni'\" and the claimant replied, \"That is what I heard\". The reason that this reply is relevant and significant is that the claimant's most frightening event alleged to have occurred is when he and his son were returning late at night from a Lahori shrine dedicated to a Sufi saint. After asking the claimant how often he went to this shrine and why he went (to pay his respects to the saint, Abul Hassan), I asked the claimant if he knew this saint was Sufi, and the claimant said he did, \"because he is close to God\". I find this exchange makes little sense, in the context and caused me to doubt the truthfulness of the claimant, which rebuts the presumption.13\n[22] Accordingly, I have followed the direction of the Supreme Court of Canada with respect to weighing evidence. The burden of proof with respect to the claim rests on the claimant. Facts in issue must be proven by the party with the onus on a balance of probabilities. The evidence provided must always be clear, convincing and cogent to satisfy the balance of probabilities test.14 Mr. Justice Rothstein, writing for the majority, agreed at paragraph 44 with Lord Hoffman in the case of In re B at paragraph 2:\nIf a legal rule requires a fact to be proved (a fact \"in issue\"), a judge or jury must decide whether or not it happened. There is no room for a finding that it might have happened. The law operates a binary system in which the only values are zero and one. The fact either happened or it did not. If the tribunal is left in doubt, the doubt is resolved by a rule that one party or the other carries the burden of proof. If the party who bears the burden of proof fails to discharge it, a value of zero is returned and the fact is treated as not having happened. If he does discharge it, a value of one is returned and the fact is treated as having happened.\n[23] Another exchange also provides an indication of the manner in which the principal claimant responded to questions indirectly:\nQ: What does the fact you manage a XXXX XXXX have to do with your claim?\nA: I was working for it - flour went all over Pakistan - there is a shortage of flour, so people did not give flour to the Imam XXXX.\nQ: Does your occupation have anything to do with your claim?\nA: I was quite well-off. We were attacked.\nQ: Does your occupation have anything to do with your claim?15\nA: I was well-established.\nQ: Anything else about the flour business?\nA: My wife, children and I were attacked. I used to supply the Imam XXXX.\nQ: And therefore ...?\nA: Because of that Sunnis ...\nQ: Are you saying that Sunnis attacked you because you delivered flour?\nA: Yes, but the main problem is that my wife preached and worked in the Imam XXXX.\n[24] Claimant's Counsel assisted in bringing the claimant's testimony back on track at this point. However, when I then asked if the claimant had anything indicating what they did in or for the Imam XXXX, the claimant just repeated that they went to the Imam XXXX. There is a letter from the Chief Organizer of the Imam XXXX, and a donation receipt from the Imam XXXX XXXX Referring to the letter (supra), I asked what a \"propaganda secretary\" was. The claimant stated that it is a person who preaches a lot and spreads the word of God. I noted that I thought that described what the Imam did, and the claimant replied that an imam cannot do it all.\n[25] I asked the claimant who they feared in Pakistan. The claimant stated it was the Sunni extremists and no one else, but he could not name any particular person they feared or any particular group of extremists: \"There are so many groups that I did not know which ones.\"\n[26] The claimant stated he feared persecution and risk to life. I asked why them. The principal claimant stated it is because his wife is participating in preaching and he often accompanied her. I asked where and the claimant gave another non-answer: \"Preaching is when ...\" and I repeated the question, stressing, 'where'. The claimant stated, \"The Imam XXXX; we go to the people\" (in their homes). I asked why that became a problem, and wondered aloud if the people to whom they preached were Shia or Sunni. I found the claimant was all over the map in this exchange as he was not seemingly able to be clear on where the preaching took place, to whom they preached or why that posed problems for the adult claimants. From this I have drawn an adverse inference.\n[27] An important aspect of the testimony concerned to whom the claimants preached. At first the claimant stated that they \"focussed their attention on Sunnis\" but later admitted that it is not part of the Shia faith to convert Sunnis. I then asked, \"Then why do it?\" and the claimant replied, \"Only to those who show interest\". I then asked how that became a problem for them, and the claimant replied, \"When you try to convert someone, others find out\". This was, in my opinion, the crux of the claim: the claimants were not compelled to convert Sunnis but they tried to convert those that showed interest, in the Imam XXXX, their homes and restaurants. I find the claimant's responses inconsistent and contradictory and, in the end, not tenable. In Sung,16 the Federal Court stated,\nThe other observation which might be made is that in the realm of a claimant's credibility, contradictions are not the exclusive factual source on which the presumption of truth in the claimant's evidence, as so ruled by the Federal Court of Appeal, may be rebutted. A tribunal may also conclude that a claimant's evidence is implausible, or improbable, or dubious, or untenable, or unreliable, or absurd, or unconvincing.\n[28] I found the claimant's allegation that they attempted to convert Sunnis flies in the face of the law of Pakistan, as we know it, or at least that it is contrary to the attitude of even moderate, much less extremist, Sunnis. I find this allegation is an embellishment to further their claims, as it goes against all common sense to anyone who knows the situation in Pakistan.17\n[29] The claimant indicated that there were two major incidents that propelled them to leave Pakistan for Canada: the break-in and robbery at their home, and the drive-by shooting, both in 2014. The claimant insisted that the robbers were actually Sunni extremists, but he has no proof of that. Although it is possible that the robbers were actually seeking to kill the claimants for their proselytizing, I find it is not probable. If the perpetrators had wished to kill the claimant or his family, they needed only to watch their home and attack them while home. The allegation that they broke in and robbed them, I find, is more in keeping with robbers whose intention was monetary and not for reasons of religion.\n[30] The claimant applied for a US visa in XXXX 2015, and picked it up on XXXX 9, 2015. The motorbike shooting incident allegedly took place at the end of July. Nevertheless, the claimants did not flee until toward the end of August. I find the claimants, if shot at, and if robbed, the year before, were more likely the victims of random crime than targeted for their religious teaching, on the basis of the timing, subsequent to their obtaining visas to leave.18\n[31] The claimants indicated that they are at risk because the female claimant is related to the famous Dr. XXXX XXXX XXXX, a well-known and respected Shia doctor, murdered in 2013. This allegation has not been established on the evidence. I have drawn a further adverse inference from this claim, as an embellishment to their story.\n[32] I noted that Shias form 30% of the Muslims in Pakistan, where 98% are Muslim. The claimant believed the Shias were over 20%, which may be a high estimate, but settled on around 30 million. According to the US Central Intelligence Agency, the figure in July 2014 was closer to 96%, of which the Sunni are 85-90%, and Shia 10-15%, out of a population just under 200 million. In other words, there are 20 to 30 million Shias in Pakistan.19\nIn a report to the UN Human Rights Commission, the Society for Threatened Peoples (STP), an NGO with special consultative status, reports that between 2008 and April 2013, approximately 942 Shia were killed in 481 incidents in Pakistan, and that the Hazara remained \"prime targets\" (23 May 2013, 2). Basing their figures on media reports, the HRCP State of Human Rights in 2012 indicates that in Balochistan, between 2008 and 2012, 758 Shia were killed; of these 338 were Hazara Shias (Mar. 2013, 64). Sources indicate that targeted Shia include \"ordinary\" Shia (Jinnah Institute 2013, 20; Human Rights Watch 5 Sept. 2012), meaning people who are not high profile individuals or involved in sectarian politics (Jinnah Institute 2013, 19, 20).\nAccording to the Jinnah Institute report on extremism in Pakistan Extremism Watch, there were 203 Shia killed in 2011 and 450 killed between 1 January 2012 and 30 November 2012 (ibid., 19). According to the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP) there were 136 Shia killed in 2011 and 396 killed in targeted attacks in 2012 (2013). According to HRCP, in 2012, 531 people were killed in sectarian violence across Pakistan, the majority of whom were Shia (Mar. 2013, 62-63). At least 325 Shia Muslims were killed in targeted attacks in 2012, according to an article by the AHRC (23 Feb. 2013). According to Human Rights Watch, approximately 400 Shia were killed between 1 Jan. and 11 Nov. 2013 (11 Nov. 2013).20\n[33] This Response to Information Request (supra)21 indicates that there is violence perpetrated by Sunni extremists against member of the Shia faith, especially in Lahore and Multan, but it would seem that other than random violence, targeted killings are perpetrated on particular profiles that are not those of the adult claimants. One violent death is one too many, at any time. The violence ebbs and wanes but it continues in Pakistan. Based on my credibility findings above, I find that in the context of the deaths and killings reported, there is no more than a mere possibility the claimant would be persecuted should they return to Pakistan.22 Their risk to life or other serious harm under section 97, therefore, is not probable.\nCONCLUSION\n[34] Therefore, after a thorough review of all the evidence in this case, I find that there is not a serious possibility or reasonable chance that the claimants would face persecution for a Convention ground or, on balance, is in need of protection if required to return to Pakistan, based on the oral testimony and other evidence put forward for these claims.\n[35] Having considered all the evidence, and based on the above analysis, I find the claimants are not Convention refugees as the claimants have not established that there is a reasonable chance or serious possibility that they will face persecution for a Convention ground or, on a balance of probability, they will face a risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or\na danger of torture, believed on substantial grounds to exist, should they return to Pakistan. The Panel rejects these claims pursuant to both sections 96 and 97(1) of the IRPA.\n(signed)\n\"James V. Railton\"\nJames V.

On the other hand, I am aware that, once the facts respecting an allegation of persecution is found, then I must determine if, on those facts, there is more than a mere possibility of persecution in the future, that is to say, a \"reasonable chance\" of persecution for a Convention ground, as set out in Adjei.\n7 Maldonado v.

On November 13, 2015 the Minister attempted to verify the authenticity of the brother's death certificate by inputting the serial number into the Georgian Government website.5 It is noted that the document instructs the recipient to perform such a task to verify authenticity.6 When the task was performed by a representative of the Minister's office, the biographical information that was received was not that of the brother's but rather that of his father.7 The claimant was made aware of this problem several months before the hearing and although explaining that this was an error on the part of the Georgian Government, he provided no further evidence to confirm that the mistake was made on the part of the government. With no evidence to confirm the claimant's explanation, and in light of the other credibility concerns surrounding the claimant's brother death, I draw a negative inference from the problems shown when the brother's death certificate was verified by the Minister's office.\n[7] Moreover, the two death certificates, despite being administered by the same government agency and within a short time of one another, are very different in appearance. As noted by the Minister's counsel, the brother's death certificate does not contain a barcode like his fathers. Additionally, the two death certificates do not share the same government seal\/stamp. When the claimant was asked about these noted differences, he stated that he did not know. The documentary evidence reports that.\n[8] Fraudulent documents of varying quality are readily available for purchase. The government is working to arrest and prosecute document vendors, but the penalties for such types of crimes are minimal. Therefore, bank documents and employment records are easily created, as fake seals and stamps are common. Although fraudulent civil documents are less available and more easily verified, there have been reported instances of their use.8\n[9] In view of this evidence, the claimant's failure to provide a reasonable explanation and the other credible problems surrounding the death certificate of the claimant's brother, I am persuaded by the submissions of the Minster's counsel and find that the death certificate is fraudulent.\nBrother's Tombstone\n[10] To further corroborate the death of his brother the claimant submitted photographs of his brother's tombstone in Georgia.9 After careful examination of the .photograph I am of the opinion that the photograph was altered. It is evident that the number \"4\" in the date of death is not consistent with the numerical style of the other numbers etched onto the tombstone. Moreover, when compared against the \"4\" on his father's tombstone, which can be found in his, year of birth 1946 and although it shares a similar font style to that found on the brother's tombstone, the \"4's\" are clearly different.10 I will not speculate as to how this was achieved, I will, however, find that the photograph was tampered with in an effort to deceive the panel into believing the year of death was 2014. I draw a negative inference from this and the photograph to be fraudulent.\nOmbudsperson's Letter\n[11] To support the allegation that the claimant has actively been seeking state protection he has provided a letter from the Ombudsperson of Georgia.11 The letter states that the Ombudsperson of Georgia received a complaint from the claimant on XXXX XXXX, 2015. However, in his BOC the claimant states that he pursued an investigation into his brother's death with the Office of the Ombudsman in 2014. On his hand written statement taken at the port of entry the claimant wrote that he filed a complaint with the National Ombudsman's office on XXXX XXXX, 2006 and received no response; however, he makes no mention of filing a report in 2015 or the response he received in evidence.12 When the claimant was questioned about these inconsistencies he was unable to provide any explanation. Thus, I draw a negative inference from this evasiveness and find that in light of his history of altering and producing fraudulent documents and the documentary evidence with relation to ease at which documents are forged. Therefore I also find this document to be fraudulent.\nContradictions, Inconsistencies and Omissions between POE interview and BOC\n[12] The claimant was interviewed several times by immigration officers when he entered Canada on September 22, 2015.13 He was provided with a Georgian interpreter for all his interviews and was given an opportunity to write, in his own language, the reasons for which he was travelling to Canada. During every interview and in his written statement the claimant, alleged that his brother was killed in 2000 and that his father was killed after his brother in 2006. This is contrary to what he had written in his BOC where he alleges that his brother was killed in 2014 after his father was killed in 2006. The claimant was confronted with this contradiction at the hearing and at the hearing the claimant attempted to blame this contradiction on the interpreter. This however, is not acceptable explanation, as an interpretation error does not explain why the claimant would write, in his own hand and in his own first language, that his brother died in 2000 before his father in 2006. Again, the claimant was asked to explain this and he stated that he just copied what the officer had showed him. I asked him why he felt compelled to write the incorrect date rather than correct the error and he stated that he did not know. Given that the alleged gravity of this event, I do not find this explanation acceptable. All things considered, I find the contradiction unresolved and draw a negative inference from the claimant's inability to remain consistent as it relates to the date on which his brother passed.\n[13] During the same interviews, the claimant stated that the cause of his brother's death was drowning. He alleged that a group of Georgians were partying on the shore, saw his brother and pushed him into the water and he drowned. However, in his BOC the claimant alleges that his brother was beaten to death by Georgian police officers. The claimant was confronted with this contradiction and he explained that the beating took place close to the shore and that he did drown as a result of that. There is no mention of being close to a body of water or that his brother drowned in the claimant's BOC and therefore the claimant was asked why he would omit these facts from his BOC. The claimant replied that he did not include these details because the cause of death was the beating. Again the claimant was asked why he did not reveal to the officer that his brother was beaten to death if that was the truth. The claimant stated that the officers where pressuring him to reveal the first and last names of the people who beat his brother and he did not want to reveal that information so he said that his brother drowned to end the questioning.\n[14] I have reviewed the officer's notes with relation to this area of questioning and I see no indication that the officer was asking the claimant to reveal the names of anyone. Nor do I see any reason why the officer would be interested or in need of this information. As such, I am not convinced by the claimant's explanation and find that the contradiction to be evidence that the claimant's allegations lack credibility.\n[15] When asked by the immigration officers as to why the claimant could not return to Georgia he stated that he feared random people on the streets and explained that he would get into random fights with random people. This is very different from what is written in the claimant's BOC. According to the claimant's BOC, he fears a very specific group of people, the Georgian police, and very specific officers within the police force; XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX There is no mention in his BOC of getting into confrontations with random people on the streets. I asked the claimant to first explain why he did not tell the officers about his fear of the police or Vano Patashuri and Ivane Zurabashvilli. The claimant stated that he was concerned that the Canadian authorities would send this information back to Georgia. I do accept the claimant's fear of not wanting to reveal specific names; however, I do not understand why he would not generally state that he feared the police. The claimant explained that he believes that if he told the officers that he feared the police they would ask him who he feared and compel him to reveal the names of those he feared. I have canvassed the interview notes and I do not find any grounds for the claimant's fear. When the officers asked about the random people, they only asked if he feared anyone in particular and when he stated that he did not, there were no further questions. This tells me that the officers were not forcing the claimant to provide names and therefore I am not convinced by the claimant's explanation. The claimant's fear of the Georgian police is the central element of his claim. It is these fears on which all allegations hinged and as such, I find it troubling that he neglected to include this, either when interviewed or when writing his own hand written statement.\n[16] Despite admitting that what he told officers about getting randomly beaten in the streets, he did not include this information in his BOC. The claimant was asked why he would omit such events and he stated that he did not need medical attention after these attacks and therefore felt they were not important. The claimant was asked what lead him to believe that he only needed to include events whereby he sought medical attention and the claimant was not able to provide a clear explanation. If true, I find it material that the claimant was attacked on multiple occasions by random Georgian because he is Ossetia. The claimant's is alleging persecution on the grounds of his Ossetia ethnicity and therefore I draw a negative inference from the omission of these facts and find their omission to be an indication that the claimant's allegations are not credible.\n[17] In light of the major omissions, contradictions and inconsistencies between the claimant's oral, written and documentary evidence, I find the claimant not to be a credible witness and do not believe what he has alleged in support of his claim. Therefore, I find that he will not face persecution or a risk to his life should he return to Georgia.\nPsychologists Report\n[18] I do not doubt the doctor's expertise in diagnosing the claimant as suffering from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX XXXX, as the claimant may very well be suffering from such ailments.14 What I do doubt, however, is that he is suffering from these aliments due to the allegations set out in his BOC. Having found several pieces of substantial evidence to be fraudulent and the numerous credibility problems identified, I give the reasons as to why he suffers from these ailments no weight, thereby dismissing the credibility of the claimant's account as told to the doctor and not the doctor's medical expertise.\nMANIFESTLY UNFOUNDED\nSection 107.1 of the IRPA reads:\n[19] If the Refugee Protection Division rejects a claim for refugee protection, it must state in its reasons for the decision that the claim is manifestly unfounded if it is of the opinion that the claim is clearly fraudulent.\n[20] The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Position on Manifestly Unfounded Applications for Asylum has provided the following guidance on this topic:\n[21] The Office has stated that the notion of \"clearly fraudulent\" could reasonably cover situations where the applicant deliberately attempts to deceive the authorities determining refugee status. The mere fact of having made false statements to the authorities does not, however, necessarily exclude a well-founded fear of persecution and vitiate the need for asylum, thus making the claim \"clearly fraudulent.\" Only if the applicant makes what appear to be false allegations of a material or substantive nature relevant for the determination of his or her status could the claim be considered \"clearly fraudulent.\"15\n[22] Having found that the claimant provided fraudulent information to support the material and substantive elements of his claim, including a death certificate, photographs of a tombstone and an ombudsperson letter, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that his claim is clearly fraudulent. Therefore, the panel finds that his claim is manifestly unfounded.\nCONCLUSION\n[23] Having considered all of the evidence, the Panel determines that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of IRPA.16 The Refugee Protection Division therefore rejects his claim for refugee protection.\n(signed)\n\" J.

They are claiming refugee protection in Canada pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)1.\n[2] In accordance with section 167(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the Refugee Protection Division appointed the principal claimant to be the designated representative of the minor claimant for the purpose of this refugee claim.\n[3] These claims were heard jointly pursuant to Rule 55 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules. The claim of the minor claimant relies upon the basis of claim of the principal claimant.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The claimants allege the following as documented in their Basis of Claim (BOC) forms.2\n[5] The claimants fear the criminal organization, Los Urabenos. The principal claimant and her two sisters were business owners who operated a XXXX XXXX XXXX business in the city of XXXX. The principal claimant and her sisters were subject to extortion demands and threats by members of the Los Urabenos beginning in December 2013.\n[6] The claimants left Colombia and arrived in Canada in November 2015. They made refugee claims upon arrival.\nDETERMINATION\n[7] The panel determines that the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of IRPA.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[8] The panel finds that the claimants have established, on a balance of probabilities, their personal identities and national identities as citizens of Colombia through the principal claimant's oral testimony and the disclosure of the claimants' identity documents, namely their passports, national identity cards, and birth certificates.3\nSection 96\n[9] The principal claimant was a business owner and operator of a merchandise shop in XXXX, Colombia. The claimant became the target of extortion demands from the Los Urabenos group starting in December 2013. Members of the Urabenos group gathered the principal claimant and her sisters as well as the other merchants of the commercial centre where the principal claimant's shop was located. The Urabenos group demanded a monthly vacuna payment of XXXX XXXX pesos from all the businesses in the commercial centre.\n[10] The term bacrim, or criminal gangs, is used by the Colombian government to designate new illegally armed groups, including the Los Urabenos group, as well as paramilitary successors.4 Bacrim are \"not linked to the old paramilitaries\" and are a \"new phenomenon\".5 While the former paramilitary groups purported to have political aims and were motivated by anti-insurgent ideals, bacrim do not follow this ideology, as they have \"no appetite to fight the insurgents and, unlike the paramilitaries, do not have the manpower to do so\".6 Bacrim are \"private armies whose aim is to control the drug trade\" and the majority of these criminal groups are just \"drug gangs\".7 Several sources list drug trafficking as the main criminal activity of the bacrim and other criminal activities include illegal mining, extortion, kidnapping, organized crime, money laundering, gasoline smuggling, theft of auto parts, arms trafficking and local drug distribution.8 Bacrim are implicated in \"grave human rights violations\" such as \"attacks on civilians, especially activists and community leaders\".9 Human Rights Watch notes that successor groups \"have repeatedly targeted human rights defenders, Afro-Colombian and indigenous leaders, trade unionists, and victims' groups seeking justice and recovery of land\". Further review of the documentary evidence indicates that \"there is a perception in certain regions that the bacrim are a political force, since their violence often targets unionists, land restitution activists, and social movements that threaten business interests\"; however \"this does not mean these \"political\" actions are an inherent function of their existence\".10\n[11] The principal claimant stated that neither she nor the minor claimant had ever been politically active in Colombia. The claimants were not public figures in their community or elsewhere in Colombia. The principal claimant was asked if the Los Urabenos wanted anything else aside from money. The principal claimant stated, \"No, they wanted money.\"\n[12] Based on the evidence before the panel, the panel finds that the fear the claimants have of Los Urabenos is of a criminal nature and that the claimant was targeted for reasons based on criminality and not on any of the five Convention grounds. The principal claimant was a business store owner who was extorted for money. There is no persuasive evidence before the panel to establish on a balance of probabilities that the principal claimant was targeted for any underlying political reason or for any other reason related to her race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group.\n[13] There are numerous Federal Court cases which have held that victims of crime, corruption11, or vendettas12 generally fail to establish a link between their fear of persecution and one of the five grounds in the definition of Convention refugee. The Board has been upheld in its finding of lack of nexus where the claimant was the target of a personal vendetta13 or where the claimant was a victim of crime14 and has failed to establish a link between their fear of persecution and one of the Convention grounds in the definition of a Convention refugee. The panel finds that the principal claimant was the target of criminal activity and a victim of crime and it does not provide a link to a Convention ground.\n[14] The panel finds that the claimants have not satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground and the claim therefore fails under s.96 of the IRPA. The balance of the analysis will be focused on the grounds under ss.97 (1) of the IRPA.\nSection 97\n[15] The evidence before the panel indicates that the Urabenos are the most powerful bacrim in Colombia and that the bacrim are engaged in a wide range of criminal activities including extortion. The panel has carefully reviewed and considered the documentary evidence on file and finds that criminal activity perpetrated by violent criminal gangs, including Los Urabenos, is a serious problem in Colombia. The evidence before the panel is that it is the general modus operandi of the Urabenos group to engage in extortion activities as part of their criminal tactics. There is no persuasive evidence before the panel to establish that the principal claimant was targeted for extortion for any specific, individualized reason. The principal claimant testified that all the shop owners of the commercial centre in which her shop was located was similarly targeted by the Urabenos for extortion payments. The principal claimant states in her BOC that all the merchants of the commercial district were confronted by the Los Urabenos on December 23, 2013 and told that they would have to pay monthly financial payments to them. The principal claimant stated that she believes she was targeted by the Urabenos because she was a shop owner. The principal claimant testified that other business owners outside the commercial centre where the principal claimant's store was located were also targeted by the Urabenos and that the Urabenos have taken over Colombia.\n[16] In this context, the panel finds that any risk that the claimants face from the Urabenos is a risk faced generally by other individuals and business owners in Colombia who may also be potential victims of the Urabenos' criminal activities. While the principal claimant did go to the police to make a denunciation against the Urabenos and faced threats from the Urabenos thereafter, the panel finds that the risk the claimants face from the Urabenos is a risk that any other victim of extortion would face if he or she also went to the police. There is no evidence before the panel to establish that the risk faced by the claimants is any different than any other business owner who faced extortion demands from the Los Urabenos and who also went to the authorities to make a denunciation. Case law from the higher courts state that victims of generalized violence are often known to the perpetrators by name, by position, or for a number of different reasons. The fact that the victims of generalized violence have an identity, as all people do, and that that identity is or becomes known to the perpetrator does not mean that they are not a victim of generalized violence.15 There is no persuasive evidence before the panel that the claimants face a greater risk than that faced by other individuals or other business owners in Colombia who are also living and working in areas where the Urabenos are present. There is nothing particular to the claimants that would differentiate their risk from the Urabenos from other citizens of Colombia who are also present and working in the vicinity of the Urabenos' operations. The panel finds that the claimants would not be personally subject to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment and that the risk they face from the Urabenos in Colombia is a generalized risk that is also shared by a segment of the population in Colombia, namely those that work and\/or reside in the regions where Urabenos engage in their criminal activities.\n[17] Based on the evidence provided, the panel finds that on a balance of probabilities, the claimants would not be personally subjected to a danger of torture or a risk to life, or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if they were to return to Colombia. .\n[18] Therefore the claimants' claims fail under subsection 97(1) of IRPA.\nCONCLUSION\n[19] The panel has considered all the grounds of protection under s.96 and ss.97 (1) of IRPA and based on the totality of the evidence finds that the claimants would not face a serious possibility of persecution in Colombia nor would they, on a balance of probabilities, be subjected personally to a risk to their lives, or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or to a danger of torture.\n[20] The panel determines that the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of IRPA.\n[21] Their claims are therefore rejected.\n(signed)\n\"A.

They have each entered a claim for refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.1\n[2] Pursuant to Rule 55 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules (the Rules), the claims were heard jointly. Each claim was decided on its individual merits. However, the claimants were advised at the outset of the hearing that one claimant's testimony may affect the other joined claims.\nRequest for Resumption of Hearing\n[3] At the conclusion of the hearing in this matter on January 11, 2016, counsel for the claimants requested that she be permitted to make her final submissions to the panel in writing. This request was granted, and counsel was until February 5, 2016 to provide these materials.\n[4] However, on January 21, 2016, counsel made an application under sections 50(1), 50(2) and 50(3) of the RPD Rules for a resumption of the hearing so she could make her final submissions in person. This application was denied by the panel.\n[5] On February 1, 2016, counsel again made a request for a resumption, which was also denied, although the panel extended the deadline for written submissions to February 15, 2016. On February 15, 2016, counsel made another request for an extension of time until February 22, 2016; this was granted.\n[6] The panel ultimately did not receive any written submissions from counsel, and proceeded to decide the matter on its merits.\nALLEGATIONS\n[7] The specifics of the claim are stated in the narrative of the claimants' Basis of Claim (BOC) forms.2 In their BOCs and their viva voce testimony to the panel, they allege that they are Tibetan Buddhists and followers of the Dalai Lama who reside in India, although they do not have Indian citizenship. They fear that because the Chinese government considers them to be Chinese citizens, they are in danger of being removed from India to China, where they will be persecuted on the basis of their religion, ethnicity and political beliefs.\nDETERMINATION\n[8] The panel finds that the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. The panel's reasons are as follows.\nANALYSIS\n[9] The determinative issues in this case are whether or not the claimants are stateless, and if so, whether they have a well-founded fear of persecution in their country of reference.\nIdentity\n[10] The panel finds that the claimants are ethnic Tibetans. The principal claimant stated to the panel that he was born in Tibet in 1934, and that his wife was born there in 1945. His testimony is corroborated by the personal documentation on file, which includes copies of the claimants' Identity Certificates and similar documents issued by the Tibetan Settlement Office.3 There is no evidence suggesting otherwise, and so the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants were born in Tibet prior to the occupation and annexation of Tibet by China in 1959.\n[11]\nIn regard to their citizenship, the panel is aware that the formerly sovereign nation of Tibet is no longer recognized by the international community as a country which can grant its own citizenship. The panel finds, based on the claimants' written and oral testimony and on a balance of probabilities, that neither have citizenship in any recognized country, and that they are therefore both stateless. The panel further finds that the country of reference in these claims is India. The reasons for these findings are discussed below.\n[12] The claimants confirmed that they are residents of India and were asked if they have citizenship there, and they replied that they do not. Exhibit 1 contains certified true copies of the claimants' currently valid \"Identity Certificates\" issued by India. According to materials found within the \"National Documentation Package\" for India,4 these types of certificates are an international travel documents issued by Indian authorities to Tibetan refugees residing in India. They are issued in lieu of a national passport, and would not be provided to those who have Indian citizenship. On the basis of the claimants' testimony, and the fact that they are holders of Indian Identity Certificates, the panel finds that the claimants are not citizens of India.\n[13] As mentioned above, counsel for the claimants did not make submissions. However, a number of her questions to them during the hearing focussed on whether or not their Tibetan ethnicity made them, by operation of law, automatically citizens of China. The principal claimant, for example, was asked if he considered himself and his wife to be Chinese citizens, and he answered in the affirmative, explaining that the Chinese government has claimed Tibetans as citizens of China, despite the fact that most Tibetans consider themselves to be independent of that country.\n[14] Among the documents submitted to the panel by the claimants was an item published by the Research Directorate of the Immigration and Refugee Board in 1995 and ponderously entitled: \"Information on whether Tibetans born in Tibet prior to 1959 who have fled Tibet since 1959 and who have not returned are considered to be PRC citizens\/nationals or are entitled to PRC citizenship.\"5\n[15]\nThe answer, according to an official of the Chinese embassy in Ottawa, is that Tibetans who have left Tibet since 1959 and who have not obtained the citizenship of a foreign country are considered to be Chinese citizens. The document goes on to say that since both the PRC and the international community consider Tibet to be part of China, Tibetans are considered to be Chinese citizens, although many Tibetans do not consider themselves to be Chinese citizens.\n[16] However, the panel notes that it has been over twenty years since this information was published, and that it was based on the opinion of an unnamed embassy official, whose precise expertise and authority to speak on behalf of the Chinese government is unknown. Therefore, the panel assigns it little probative value.\n[17] Instead, the panel examined the Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China, which governs the acquisition, loss and restoration of Chinese citizenship. The relevant portions are set out here:\nArticle 3 The People's Republic of China does not recognize dual nationality for any Chinese national.\nArticle 4 Any person born in China whose parents are both Chinese nationals or one of whose parents is a Chinese national shall have Chinese nationality.\nArticle 5 Any person born abroad whose parents are both Chinese nationals or one of whose parents is a Chinese national shall have Chinese nationality. But a person whose parents are both Chinese nationals and have both settled abroad, or one of whose parents is a Chinese national and has settled abroad, and who has acquired foreign nationality at birth shall not have Chinese nationality.\nArticle 6 Any person born in China whose parents are stateless or of uncertain nationality and have settled in China shall have Chinese nationality.\nArticle 7 Foreign nationals or stateless persons who are willing to abide by China's Constitution and other laws and who meet one of the following conditions may be naturalized upon approval of their applications:\n(1) they are near relatives of Chinese nationals;\n(2) they have settled in China; or\n(3) they have other legitimate reasons.\nArticle 8 Any person who applies for naturalization as a Chinese national shall acquire Chinese nationality upon approval of his application; a person whose application for naturalization as a Chinese national has been approved shall not retain foreign nationality.\nArticle 9 Any Chinese national who has settled abroad and who has been naturalized as a foreign national or has acquired foreign nationality of his own free will shall automatically lose Chinese nationality.\n...\n[18] The legislation does not directly address the citizenship of persons born in areas outside of China but which are subsequently annexed into the territory of the PRC, as in the case of Tibetans born in Tibet prior to 1959. Article 7 may conceivably apply in these situations, but in their testimony in the present matter, the claimants were adamant about not wanting to become Chinese citizens and only being citizens of Tibet. By denying recognition of the legitimacy of China's claim over Tibet they very clearly are not willing to abide by China's Constitution and laws. Thus, they would be disqualified from Chinese citizenship, regardless of whether it is voluntarily sought or imposed upon them.\n[19] Rule 11 of the Refugee Protection Division's Rules state, in part, that a \"claimant must provide acceptable documents establishing their identity and other elements of the claim\" (emphasis added). Aside from their own viva voce testimony, and the 1995 item discussed above, the claimants have not provided the panel with documentary evidence substantiating that they are citizens of the PRC.\n[20] Having considered all of the evidence presented to it, the panel does not agree with the claimants that they are unwilling, but nevertheless de jure, citizens of China. They are not likely citizens of the PRC, nor are they citizens of India, Tibet or any other country. On a balance of probabilities, therefore, the panel finds that the claimants are stateless.\n[21] The panel determines India to be the country of former habitual residence for the claimants. The panel is guided by Maarouf6 which indicated factors to consider in determining former habitual residence. This includes whether a claimant was admitted to the country with a view to continued residence for some duration, without necessitating a minimum period of residence, and whether there is a significant period of de facto residence. There is no requirement that the claimant must be legally able to return there.\n[22] In this case, the claimants do not dispute that since fleeing Tibet in 1959, they have resided solely in India. They testified that although they suffered some degree of bureaucratic and societal prejudice against Tibetans, such as being made to pay more at food markets, they were nevertheless able to live and work in India for over five decades. Based on this testimony, and documentary evidence such as the claimants' Indian Identity Certificates, the panel therefore finds India to be the country of reference for the claimant in this claim.\n[23] The panel notes that the claimants did not identify in their BOC any risk of harm or fear of persecution in India itself; their fears of return to India were that they might someday be deported by Indian authorities to China and there face a risk of persecution and risk to life due to their Tibetan ethnicity and Buddhist religion. However, there is no evidence before the panel indicating that the Indian government is currently deporting Tibetans to China, or that it might do so in the future.\n[24] Moreover, there is nothing in the evidence available to the panel which suggests that Tibetans in India are subject to treatment amounting to persecution, or that they face a risk as defined in section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Similarly, there is no evidence corroborating the claimants' allegations that Tibetans are currently, or will be, in danger of being forced to return to Chinese-controlled Tibet.\nCONCLUSION\n[25] Having considered all of the evidence before it, the panel finds that there is not a serious possibility that the claimants would face persecution if they returned to India. The panel also finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants would not be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in India. Therefore, these claims are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Michael Rusek\"\nMichael Rusek\n\"April 13, 2016\"\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27 as amended.\n2 Exhibits 2 and 3.\n3 Exhibit 6.\n4 Exhibit 4, item 14.10.\n5 Exhibit 5, p. 52.\n6 Maarouf v.

I also find that the claimants are not persons in need of protection for the following reasons.\nAllegations\n[4] The complete story alleging the basis of the claimant's fears is captured in their Basis of Claim Forms (BoC).3 The following outlines their allegations.4\n[5] The claimants were born in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (\"KSA\") of parents who are stateless Palestinians, and they are also all stateless Palestinians.\n[6] The principal claimant travelled on a Lebanese travel document issued to him as a stateless Palestinian and his wife travelled on an Egyptian travel document issued to her as a stateless Palestinian. Their only country of habitual residence is the KSA, as they have never resided in Lebanon or Egypt.\n[7] The claimants no longer have any legal right to return to the KSA, as their residency visas expired. Even if they did, the claimants allege that they would suffer inordinate discrimination, cumulatively amounting to persecution in the areas of education, health care, employment specifically and just generally in interacting with Saudi citizens. In addition, the female claimant does not want to adhere to the strict dress code imposed by society and government policy upon women in the KSA. Furthermore, she is politically opposed to the restrictions on women in the social sphere, including the ban on women driving or going out without a male escort.\n[8] The claimants had visas to the United States of America (US), travelled there but after three weeks or so entered Canada as exceptions to the safe third country regulation, being stateless Palestinians, and made their claim at the Port of Entry in Windsor.\nANALYSIS\n[9] In order to qualify as a Convention refugee or person in need of protection, a claimant must demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution on a Convention ground or risk of serious harm in one country of former habitual residence and must also show that he is unable to return to each of his other countries of former habitual residence.\n[10] On a balance of probabilities, I find that the claimants established their personal identities and that they are stateless Palestinians whose last country of habitual residence is the KSA based on the testimony and copies of their travel documents found in Exhibits 1 and 10. In addition, I find that the claimants established they have no other country of habitual residence available to them.\nSubjective Fear\n[11] The subjective fear relates to the existence of a fear of harm in the mind of the claimant. The objective basis requires there be a valid basis for the fear.5 Both subjective fear and an\nobjective basis for it are crucial elements for a claim to succeed. In Kamana,6 Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer held that the panel's finding that the claimant had not credibly established the subjective element was reasonable and:\nThe lack of evidence going to the subjective element of the claim is a fatal flaw which in and of itself warrants dismissal of the claim, since both elements of the refugee definition - subjective and objective - must be met.\n[12] Failure to seek the protection of another country which is also a signatory to the Convention may be a significant factor to consider but is not in itself determinative. Voluntarily leaving a country where the claimant could safely live is another example of behaviour that can cast doubt on a claimant's subjective fear.7\nThe delay in making a claim to refugee status is not a decisive factor in itself. It is, however, a relevant element which the tribunal may take into account in assessing both the statements and the actions and deeds of a claimant.8\n[13] The principal claimant came to the United States of America (US) in 2013 for a few weeks to visit his relatives in Michigan. He never had the intention to remain. While there, he never investigated, researched or enquired about asylum in the US or Canada. The claimant returned to the KSA because he was engaged to marry the female claimant and because his mother had serious medical issues. He also testified that he had not yet become fearful of his status in the KSA because the Saudization policy was not being fully enforced at that time. I find this explains why the claimant returned to the KSA, but does not give credence to his alleged fears in the KSA.\n[14] The principal claimant testified that he spoke with his relatives in North America - a paternal uncle in Alberta, and an uncle by marriage in Michigan. As a result, the claimant testified he obtained US visas with the intention of coming to Canada to make a claim. The claimants all\ntravelled on US non-immigrant visas and stayed with his maternal aunt and her family in Michigan. While there, the claimant stated he spoke with his cousins, who allegedly asked immigration consultants about making a claim for asylum in the US. He was informed that any such claim would be costly, take a long time and there was only a limited chance of success. For that reason, the claimants crossed into Canada at Windsor and made their claims. He did not apply for a Canadian visa.\n[15] I note, although not technically required, the principal claimant's Albertan uncle did not receive him in Canada. In fact, the claimant has neither seen his uncle or his family since arriving by going to visit him there nor has his uncle or family come to Ontario to visit the claimants. The claimant is more in touch with his relatives in Detroit, to the extent that his aunt, a permanent resident of the US came to Toronto to provide child care for the minor claimant during the hearing. The claimant stated that he did not go west because he wants to be independent and pursue education opportunities, but he might go someday to see his uncle in Edmonton. I find that the presence of family in Canada was not a motive for the claimants coming to Canada. I also find the Act's objective of family reunification is not relevant to these claims.\n[16] It is not the delay in claiming or failure to claim in the US that would be decisive; it is a claimant's explanation, or lack thereof, that can be decisive.\n[17] One must remember that the adult claimants are university-educated professionals, and the principal claimant has experienced international travel. Both adults were educated in Jordan.\n[18] The claimant did not provide any evidence from the persons consulted in the US or Canada as to why he was advised not to make claims in the US, although permitted to stay until XXXX 2016.\n[19] I suggested to the claimant that he was \"asylum-shopping\", and asked why he would leave a country where he had legal status (the US) to come to a country where he had no status (Canada). He then repeated it would take a long time in the US, it would be costly, his chances as\na stateless Palestinian would be \"very limited\", and that the visa was valid for only three months (it is actually valid for six months9). He did not respond when I asked if he had anything to show me that an asylum claim in the US would take a long time, would be costly, and the chances are limited. At this point, I concluded my questioning of the claimant and noted for Claimant's Counsel that the seeming lack of subjective fear might be determinative.\n[20] The Claimant's Counsel asked the claimant the same question and received the same answer: the claimants did not make claims in the US because it was \"too costly\", \"took too long\", and their chances of success were \"very limited\". The claimants did not provide any evidence of the length of time asylum claims take for stateless Palestinians in the US, the likely cost, or in what sense their claims had a limited chance of success. The claimant admitted he never researched whether they could take advantage of free legal services. When asked, the principal claimant admitted he did not know how long the claim process might take, what it might cost, or in what sense their chances were \"limited\". He testified that his Canadian uncle told him that he would have a better chance of success in making their claims in Canada.\n[21] In Madoui,10 an Algerian claimant failed to claim during 19 months in Italy. He had been told by friends that he had little, if any, chance of obtaining refugee status in Italy. Despite statistics in evidence showing that similar claims were rarely accepted, the Board was not satisfied that the subjective component had been met and the Court saw no error in the Board's assessment.\n[22] In Mekideche,11 when the Board asked why the claimant did not claim refugee status during his two years in Italy, he testified that it was because he believed that Algerian refugees would be denied and returned to Algeria. This belief was based on news reports that other European countries were not receptive to Algerian refugees. Noting that he travelled throughout Europe with false documentation before arriving in Canada, the Board stated that this was a risk\nthat a person who feared persecution would not take. The Court found no error in the Board's conclusion that these two issues showed an absence of a subjective fear of persecution.\n[23] In Leul12 at paragraphs 7 and 12, Mr. Justice Muldoon writes the following:\nOne might observe that he passed through Amsterdam and that The Netherlands is a convention refugee signatory, but apparently he did not think to claim refugee status there.\n...Just as I would not wish to send back to his country a person who stood in jeopardy of a reasonable chance of persecution, so I just do not wish to leave in Canada a person who isn't entitled to be here; a person who passed through a country which was a signatory to the convention and did not think to claim refugee status there.\n[24] Furthermore, as stated by the Federal Court in Ahoua,13 at paragraph 16, \"... a negative finding regarding subjective fear may render the assessment of the objective aspect of the complaint superfluous and may in itself warrant the dismissal of the claim\". Also, in Ortiz, Mr. Justice O'Keefe held that a finding the claimant lacked subjective fear due to his failure to apply for asylum in the US is sufficient, alone, for the Division to reasonably deny the refugee claim:14\n[27] Issue 2\nDid the Board err by finding that the applicant lacked subjective fear by not claiming asylum in the United States?\nThe Board found that the applicant had not made serious efforts to apply for asylum in the United States during the one and a half years that he lived there.\n[28] Failing to apply for refugee status in a foreign state is a factor which the Board is entitled to consider in assessing the applicant's subjective fear (see Baykus v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2010 FC 851 (CanLII) at paragraph 19, Alvarez Cortes v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2010 FC 770 (CanLII) at paragraph 20).\n[29] The applicant submits that the Board did not acknowledge that he had a friend inquire about the asylum process in the United States, that he attempted to legalize his status through a visitor visa or that the acceptance of Colombian applications for asylum in the United States is low and refugees in the United States are not granted permanent residence as quickly as in Canada.\n[30] However, the Board's finding that there was a lack of serious effort on the part of the applicant to apply for asylum is reasonable despite the applicant's submissions. As Mr. Justice Yvon Pinard held in Bobic v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2004 FC 1488 (CanLII) at paragraph 6, an applicant's reasons for not claiming refugee status in a foreign country must be valid in order to avoid an adverse inference. Serious efforts require more than having a friend inquire about the asylum process. As Mr. Justice Roger Hughes held in Stojmenovic v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 2010 FC 873 (CanLII) at paragraph 5, that \"a refugee claim should not be looked at simply as one of many choices as to how best to seek status in Canada.\" The applicant's submission that he did not apply for asylum because it would be granted more easily in Canada or because he would gain permanent residence faster in Canada are not valid reasons for negating the adverse inference that he lacked subjective fear by not applying for asylum in the United States. A finding that the applicant lacked subjective fear due to his failure to apply for asylum in the United States is sufficient, alone, for the Board to reasonably deny the refugee claim (see Goltsberg v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2010 FC 886 (CanLII) at paragraph 28; Gamassi c. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l'Immigration) (2000), 2000 CanLII 16473 (FC), 194 F.T.R. 178at paragraph 6). [Emphasis added by me]\n[31] Because of my finding on Issue 2, I need not deal with the remaining issues as an applicant needs to have a subjective fear in order to succeed in a refugee claim.\n[25] As Ortiz was decided since IRPA was enacted in 2002, the finding that a claimant needs to have a subjective fear in order to succeed covers both sections 96 and 97(1).\n[26] The conclusion that I have arrived at is that the adult claimants lack the requisite subjective fear and I need not deal with the remaining issues. Also, following the direction from Mr. Justice O'Keefe of the Federal Court, I find these claims fail under both sections 96 and 97 of the Act.\nCONCLUSION\n[27] Having considered all the evidence, and based on the above analysis, I determine the claimants are not Convention refugees and not persons in need of protection. I therefore reject their claims.\n(signed)\n\"James V. Railton\"\nJames V.

The reasons are as follows.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimants are husband and wife. The allegations are set out in the Basis of Claim forms (BOC)2 of the claimants and in their oral testimony and can be summarized as follows. The principal claimant is a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of the Youth wing of the UNM political party in his area and was also active in the UNM. The \"Georgian Dream\" political party attempted to recruit him to their side. The principal claimant refused and as result he was physically assaulted a number of times and threatened with death. The claimant was also threatened with death due to the principal claimant's activities. The principal claimant believes that he was also fired from his job at XXXX XXXX XXXX in part due to his political affiliation.\n[4] The claimants obtained USA visas through the aid of an agent in order to depart Georgia. They entered the USA and subsequently made a claim for protection at the Port of Entry.\nANALYSIS\n[5] The determinative issue in this case is credibility.\nIdentity\n[6] The claimant's identity as nationals of Georgia is established through their passport.3\nCredibility\n[7] A claimant's testimony is presumed to be true unless there are valid reasons to doubt its truthfulness.4 The existence of contradictions, discrepancies, and implausibilities in the evidence of a claimant is a well-accepted basis for a finding of a lack of credibility,5 and the failure to include relevant and important incidents in a BOC, which are then revealed at a later stage in the refugee proceedings can negatively affect the applicant's credibility, if a reasonable explanation is not provided.6 When assessing credibility the Panel is entitled to rely on its rationality and common sense.7\n[8] In assessing credibility, the Panel is cognizant of the many difficulties faced by a claimant in establishing a claim, including cultural factors, the milieu of the hearing room and the stress inherent in responding to oral questions through an interpreter. The Panel has also considered that the claimants are educated, each having a University degree from XXXX XXXX University8. The principal claimant worked in the equivalent of a management capacity position as Youth Wing coordinator9. The Panel also takes note that the claimant was employed as a XXXX10. The Panel has also taken these considerations into account in arriving at a negative credibility finding.\n[9] The Panel finds that the claimants have not provided sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence with respect to central elements of their claim. There were a number of inconsistencies, omissions and negative inferences in the evidence of the claimants. The Panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants are not credible or trustworthy witnesses. The Panel's reasons are as follows.\n[10] The principal claimant omitted from his BOC narrative that he was in hiding while waiting for the USA visa. He was asked the reason for this omission and explained that he did not include it in his BOC narrative because he did not leave his city. He just stayed in his own apartment. The Panel does not find this to be a reasonable explanation. The fact that the principal claimant did not continue his everyday activities and stayed in his apartment because he did not want to reveal himself is a central element of the claim as it underscores his subjective fear. The Panel also notes that the principal claimant himself did not volunteer this information, but provided this information only to a direct question from the Panel. He had the benefit of Counsel and an interpreter. Furthermore, the hearing of this claim was conducted over two sittings. The principal claimant was asked this question at the commencement of the first sitting. He therefore had the time to provide this information, but did not do so. The Panel finds that this undermines the principal claimant's general credibility and specifically undermines whether the principal claimant was in hiding during this period.\n[11] The principal claimant could not recall the exact date that he went into hiding. He recalled that it was at the end of XXXX 2015, but does not recall the exact date. He explained that he was under stress and had to think of many things. The Panel does not find this to be a reasonable explanation. This was a singular event as he no longer ventured forth from the apartment. He had the benefit of Counsel and an interpreter. Furthermore, the hearing of this claim was conducted over two sittings. The principal claimant was asked this question at the commencement of the first sitting. He had the time to provide this information, but did not do so. The Panel notes that the claimant noted other specific dates, such as the specific date he was contacted and threatened11 specific dates for the beatings12, the date of the murder of Erosi Kishmavili13 and the date the claimants left Georgia for the USA14 . The Panel finds that the lack of this exact date undermines the principal claimant's general credibility and specifically undermines whether the principal claimant was in hiding.\n[12] There is an inconsistency as to the principal claimant's travel history. According to the claimant's evidence, the principal claimant travelled to Turkey and Baku, Azerbijan. Aside from this they have not travelled outside of Georgia before travelling to the USA. According to the USA visa application, the principal claimant travelled to Germany, France, Italy and Greece. 15 The principal claimant stated that the agent submitted all documents for the USA visa and he does not know what documents were submitted.\n[13] The Panel does not find this to be reasonable explanation. The claimants signed the USA Visa application forms and also attended at the interview at the USA Embassy where they by necessity were required to answer questions. Furthermore, it is reasonable to conclude that proof of the travel history of the claimants would have been requested by the USA authorities. The Panel finds that this undermines the general credibility of the claimants, undermines the claimants travel history, undermines whether the USA visa applications were submitted through an agent with fraudulent information and undermines the alleged reasons that the claimants fled from Georgia.\n[14] Both claimants have lost their previous passports. The principal claimant stated that he did not remember where his previous passport was and the claimant stated that her previous passport most likely expired and she lost it. They explained that they obtained new passports issued just prior to their departure for the USA because neither one of the claimants could find their previous passport. The Panel finds that the travel noted on the USA visa application form would raise the issue of re-availment and the failure to make a claim in those democratic countries. The loss of the previous passports seems fortuitous, as it prevents the Panel from confirming this information. The Panel draws a negative inference from the lack of the very documents that could show that the principal claimant did not in fact travel to Germany, France Italy and Greece. The Panel finds this undermines the claimants' general credibility, undermines the principal claimant's travel history and undermines their subjective fear.\n[15] There is an inconsistency as to the final destination in leaving Georgia. The principal claimant stated that the plan was to leave Georgia, to go somewhere safe and ask for shelter. The principal claimant's evidence was that he was willing to go anywhere. The principal claimant stated that it was the agent who decided on the USA. The principal claimant also stated that he wanted to go to a country where they could not find him and he wanted to go to a democratic country. He further stated that he did not inform himself of other options. He did not know and he was under stress. The actions of the claimants are not consistent with this plan, as they do not explain why no protection was sought in the USA or why the claimants did not avail themselves of the opportunity to immediate leave Georgia to a country that did not require a visa for Georgian citizens, some of which are in fact democratic countries such as Israel, Ukraine, Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Turkey, Moldova, Brazil16. In fact, the claimant's came specifically to Canada. The claimants are both educated persons. The principal claimant had the acumen to find a smuggler. Yet, without informing themselves of other options, they paid a large fee to a smuggler and the principal claimant remained in hiding for approximately four months waiting for the USA visa. The Panel finds that this undermines the claimants' general credibility, specifically undermines whether the principle claimant was ever sought for recruitment, threatened and beaten by the Georgian Dream party and undermines their subjective fear.\n[16] The Panel had before it the USA visa application.\n[17] The claimants were asked to explain inconsistencies in their work profiles. According to the USA visa application, the principal claimant is the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Ltd and he was not previously employed.17 According to the documents completed at the time of the claim for protection, he was the Youth Wing XXXX for the UNM from January 2012 to December 2015 and he was previously employed as Cable TV operator.18 He stated that the UNM position was a full-time, paid position. According to the USA visa application, the claimant is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX19. According to the documents completed at the time of the claim for protection, she is a XXXX XXXX XXXX.20\n[18] The principal claimant was asked to explain inconsistencies regarding the date he completed his University Degree. The USA Visa application gives the completion date as XXXX XXXX 2012.21 According to the documents from the time of the claim for protection, the date is XXXX 2012.22\n[19] The claimants explained that the agent submitted all the information required for the USA visa application and they do not know what information was submitted. The Panel does not find this to be a reasonable explanation. The claimants signed this documents attesting to the truth of it, were interviewed by a USA Official and signed the USA visa applications declaring that no one aided them in completing them. The Panel finds that this undermines the claimants general credibility, specifically undermines their employment history, specifically undermines whether the principal claimant was employed with the UNM and was ever sought for recruitment, threatened and beaten by the Georgian Dream party and undermines their purpose in coming to Canada.\nDelay\/Failure to claim\n[20] The Panel refers to Pepaj23\n\"The Board was entitled to impugn the applicants' credibility based on the applicants' delay in claiming refugee status, and their failure to claim at the first opportunity: Toma, para 18; Mahari v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 999 at para 27.\n\"The applicants submit they have a reasonable explanation for the delay and failure to claim; however, the only explanation provided was that the applicants \"wanted\" to come to Canada for its \"very good refugee protection\". This is not an explanation that justifies the applicants' failure to claim in the numerous safe countries they travelled through. It was therefore reasonable for the Board to conclude that the applicants' behaviour was inconsistent with the fears alleged\"\n[21] The claimants delayed in leaving Georgia for approximately four months, during which time the principal claimant was in hiding, when in fact other alternatives were available to the claimants. The principal claimant stated that he did not know and also he relied on the agent who told him he could for certain obtain a visa for the USA. The Panel does not find this explanation reasonable nor does the Panel find this course of action reasonable in these circumstances. The claimants were fleeing from threats of death. The principal claimant had also already been severely beaten a number of times by Georgian Dream party members and could not count on the police for protection as they had not acted to protect him. These are dire circumstances. Yet the claimants did not inform themselves of procedures and other options for leaving Georgia in order to remove themselves from danger. The Panel notes that the claimants are educated persons24. The principal claimant had the acumen to rise to the position of Coordinator of the Youth Wing. The claimant was a Reporter, who by the very nature of her work would make inquiries and substantiate information. In addition, the principal claimant had travelled to Turkey before and knew no visa was required. He also had the acumen to find a smuggler. Yet the claimants waited to obtain a visa for the USA, went to the effort of having documents and information submitted that may not have been genuine and paid a smuggler a fee, all the while the principal claimant remained in hiding, when they could have left immediately to a number of countries that do not require a visa for Georgian nationals and so taken themselves out of danger. The Panel finds that this undermines the claimants' general credibility, undermines their subjective fear and specifically undermines whether the principal claimant was ever sought for recruitment, threatened and beaten by the Georgian Dream party and also undermines their purpose in coming to Canada.\n[22] As Simpson J. said in Cruz v. Canada (MCI)25, delay is an important factor in the assessment of a refugee claim because it addresses the existence of a subjective fear of persecution which is an essential element of a convention refugee claim. A refugee claim should not be looked at simply as one of many choices as to how best to seek status in Canada.\n[23] The Panel finds that the delay in leaving Georgia undermines the general credibility of the claimants, undermines their subjective fear and specifically undermines whether the principal claimant was ever sought for recruitment, beaten and both claimants threatened with death by the Georgian Dream party.\nFailure to make a Claim in the USA\n[24] Failing to apply for refugee status in a foreign state is a factor the Board is entitled to consider in assessing the applicant's subjective fear.26\n[25] The claimants' evidence is that they arrived in the USA on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and made a claim for protection at the Port of Entry on December 1, 2015. The claimants were asked the reason they did not make a claim for protection in the USA. The principle claimant stated he was confused when he arrived in the USA. He did not know what to do. He was under stress. He did not know how to start the process. He called his uncle in Canada, who suggested he come to Canada and make a claim for protection.\n[26] The Panel does not find this explanation reasonable. The claimants were fleeing from threats of death. The principal claimant had been in hiding for approximately four months before he and the claimant left Georgia. These would seem to be dire circumstances. The Panel has also considered that the principal claimant stated that all he wanted was to leave Georgia and find a safe, democratic country. He did not care which country he went to. The USA is a democratic country that would have afforded the claimants access to a protection process and safety from the death threats. The Panel finds that in these circumstances this is not a reasonable explanation for not making a claim for protection in the USA.\n[27] It is reasonable to assume that persons fleeing for their lives would make a claim for refugee protection at the first available opportunity. The Panel draws a negative inference from the failure to make a claim for protection in the USA and finds that this undermines the claimants overall credibility, undermines their reason for leaving Georgia and is not consistent with a subjective fear.\nCredibility Conclusion\n[28] On the basis of the above-noted credibility findings, negative inferences and omissions, the Panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants are not credible and trustworthy witnesses. The Panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants are in fact the persons set out in the USA visa applications and that the principal claimant was not employed by The UNM, was not active in the UNM, was not sought by Georgian Dream for recruitment, was not threatened and beaten and that the claimants are not being threatened with death by the Georgian Dream. The Panel does not believe these events occurred as alleged. The Panel finds that the claimants have fabricated these events in order to bolster their claim for refugee protection.\nCONCLUSION\n[29] Accordingly, the Panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants have not established their claim on the basis of credible and trustworthy evidence and have not established the central element of the claim, that the principal claimant is targeted for death by members of the Georgian Dream political party and that the claimant is also therefore in danger.\n[30] Furthermore, the Panel finds that this general lack of credibility extends to all relevant evidence emanating from his testimony.27\n[31] Whether this claim then was based on Section 96 or 97 it would fail owing to this lack of credibility.\n[32] The Panel therefore finds that the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n[33] The Panel finds that the claimants have not established that there is a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground or that on a balance of probabilities the claimants would personally be subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment upon return to Georgia.\n[34] The Panel therefore rejects this claim.\nNo Credible Basis\n[35] Furthermore, in accordance with Section 107(2) of the IRPA, the Panel concludes that there was no credible or trustworthy evidence upon which the Board could have determined that the claimant is a Convention refugee or person in need of protection, and therefore there is no credible basis for the claim.\n(signed)\n\"H.

Due to the multiple issues and decisions rendered the panel has for the purposes of these reasons has prepared separately from the other family members for the ease of the claimants.\n[3] XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX did not have evidence of custody of four of his children, so the hearing of February 11, 2016 was adjourned giving him the opportunity to obtain this information. Which was forwarded prior to the hearing of April 6, 2016, the panel accepts that the children's mother had knowledge and granted approval of their travel to and remaining in Canada.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] Details of the elder female claimant's allegations can be found in her Basis of Claim (BOC) form.2 The elder female claimant alleges she faces persecution due to her being a stateless Palestinian. She was granted a Jordanian passport but that was taken away from her in 2011 when she travelled from Mecca, she is unsure why it was taken.\n[5] The elder female claimant alleges she faced persecution due to her daughter XXXX who had attacked a Jewish man in 1991. The elder female claimant had been summoned to appear before the Israeli authorities in a police station in Jerusalem. She was interrogated about XXXX assault, after questioning her for several hours, she had been released. She was called twice more for questioning. The elder claimant's home had been searched by the Israeli authorities for evidence of XXXX activities. XXXX was sent to prison for the offense and while in prison had been involved in another violent crime. During this time the elder female claimant was interrogated by the Israeli authorities she was given a paper in Hebrew and asked to sign it, her fingerprints were taken.\n[6] XXXX was released in 1997 and returned to XXXX to live with the claimant. The elder female claimant lived at her brother's. During this time there were many instances whereby homes were searched by the Israeli authorities, the family often questioned. In one incident, a car bomb killed an Israeli soldier. The elder female claimant and her family were questioned. The elder female claimant was taken to an Israeli compound and questioned; in the room was a noose. There were threats made against her son if she did not tell the authorities what they wanted to know. The claimant was released after much time and threats.\n[7] The elder female claimant's second husband died in 2002 or 2003. Her first husband returned from the U.S.A. in 2005 or 2006 and remained with her for three months. He then returned to the U.S.A. to return to his wife. The claimant experienced endless difficulties in the West Bank. Her daughter, XXXX, moved to Jerusalem in 1992 but was refused an Israeli identity card. The elder female claimant had little contact as XXXX feared returning to the West Bank and not being able to return to her husband and home in Jerusalem. The elder female claimant applied for an entry card multiple times and was always refused. The elder female claimant was only able to visit on sporadic occasions.\n[8] In 2013, she obtained a permit to enter Jerusalem but only managed to visit twice when the permit was destroyed by a border guard.\n[9] In XXXX 2011, the elder female claimant's son, XXXX, returned from a trip to the U.S.A. when the authorities came to their home in the middle of the night to look for him. The authorities slashed the furniture, and beat XXXX, throwing her grandson, XXXX, against a wall when he went to aid his father. The soldiers destroyed their home. XXXX faced continual harassment at the hands of the Israeli authorities due to her daughter XXXX. XXXX had married a man called XXXX XXXX XXXX in 2003. Daoud was involved in the resistance movement and was involved in the killing of Israeli soldiers. After this incident he disappeared, so XXXX was often stopped and questioned about XXXX whereabouts. The Israeli authorities came to their home to search and question them.\n[10] In 2014, XXXX told the elder female claimant to come and join him in the U.S.A. As she had an American visa she did travel to the U.S.A. and visit her brother in Chicago arriving in January 2015. After two months XXXX was stressed as their refugee claims were not progressing, he did not have a work permit. The elder female claimant needed medicine and her son could not afford the cost, so she returned to XXXX for treatment. She left the U.S.A. in XXXX 2015 and return to wait in XXXX.\n[11] In December 2015, XXXX contacted her and told her that they were planning to come to Canada to make refugee claims. He told her to return and join them. The elder female claimant returned on December 4, 2015. She travelled with her son to Canada to seek refugee protection at the Canadian Border.\nMinister's Intervention\n[12] The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration intervened on issues of credibility. The Minister did not come to the hearing and put the credibility concerns about the money and issues about the sister to the claimant.\nCounsel's Submissions\n[13] Counsel submits that the elder female claimant faces persecution at the hands of the Israeli Defence Force (IDF) and Jewish settlers in the area. Her persecution is based on the actions of her daughter XXXX husband. The elder female claimant testified she had problems travelling between her home and that of her one of daughter's in Jerusalem. In addition, there is violence in the area with sometimes guns being fired near or at her home. The elder claimant testified she does not want to live alone and would face persecution due to being elderly and female. In her submission, Counsel for the claimant attempted to place the claimant within a social group with a well-founded fear of persecution, namely Palestinian women. She submitted that as an elder Palestinian woman she is a vulnerable person who cannot live alone in the West Bank without a protector. As such, this claimant has a heightened risk as both an elder female and a Palestinian. It was suggested that children and elderly women, as the most vulnerable persons caught up in unrest in the West Bank, are therefore the most at risk. According to Counsel, being an elderly, Palestinian woman gives the claimant a profile which is a particular risk and therefore not generalized.\n[14] The panel paid special attention to Guideline number 4 dealing with female refugee claimants fearing Gender-based persecution. The panel was acutely aware of the need to determine whether there existed any link between this claimant's gender, the persecution she fears, and the definition of Convention refugee.\nDETERMINATION\n[15] The panel finds that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\n[16] The determinative issue in these claims are country of reference, credibility and well-foundedness of the fear. In making this assessment, the panel considered all the evidence, including the oral testimony, documentary evidence entered as exhibits and Counsel's submission.\nIdentity\n[17] The elder female claimant's identity is established by the personal identity documents filed.3 As such the panel accepts that she is a stateless Palestinian.\nCountry of Reference\n[18] The panel notes that the elder female claimant has resided in West Bank of the Occupied Territories. The panel notes that the elder female claimant had identified in her Schedule A that she has only resided in the West Bank from 2005.4 The panel will accept that her primary address was that in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX West Bank. The Federal Court has suggested in Maarouf5 that, at a minimum, the following factors should be considered in assessing what constitutes \"a country of former habitual residence\": whether the person was admitted into the country for the purpose of continuing residence of some duration (without necessitating a minimum period of residence), and whether there was a significant period of de facto residence. Further, the claimant does not have to be legally able to return to a country of former habitual residence. In light of the various factors, the panel determines that the Palestinian Occupied Territories is the former habitual residence for this claimant.\nCredibility\n[19] It is the duty of this panel to determine if there is sufficient reliable and trustworthy evidence to establish the allegations submitted by the elder female claimant. Her testimony is presumed to be truthful unless there are reasons to call into question the reliability of the elder female claimant's testimony; this includes omissions from the elder female claimant's previous statements and submissions. As to the Minister's intervention, other than referring to XXXX the Minister makes no allegations as it relates to this claimant. The panel finds the reliability of the elder female claimant's allegations can further be called into question by inconsistencies between the fear the claimant alleges to face and her behaviours that are inconsistent with those allegations.\nAffidavit\n[20] The elder female claimant provided an amendment to her BOC by way of an affidavit filed after the hearing. Counsel submits this was due to her advanced aged. The panel does not accept this explanation. The elder female claimant provided a lengthy BOC narrative in excess of 50 paragraphs. The information provided in the amendment was not brought forth during the hearing or even mentioned; she had been questioned by both Counsel and the panel and made no mention of any of this information, other than to state that settlers - Jewish people come to her home and rob it. The panel can accept that her age may have made it difficult to recall some information but this is considerably more than some, to omit any mention of an assault by settlers or the destruction of a vehicle by the settlers, the intervention of the police and soldiers is not credible. The panel makes a negative inference and grants no consideration to this information particularly in light of the finding that she returned to XXXX and lived there for more than six months while her son await information on his refugee process in the U.S.A.\n[21] The panel does not accept the elder female claimant's particular allegations of what occurred to her in the West Bank, in 2005 to 2006. In addition, the claimant is no longer a young Palestinian, and thus, is less likely to be targeted by Israelis.\nRe-availment\n[22] The panel finds that the elder claimant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution. The panel has reviewed the documentary evidence and notes that the article reviews attacks and actions on Palestinians by Israeli settlers, and the Israeli authorities, and the negative impact of the new border fence. It also sets out that there are restrictions on mobility for Palestinians, including by checkpoints. There are also demolitions of home by the Israeli authorities. With the control of movement, this results in negative economic impacts in terms of employment and business. There has also been confiscation of reported lands. Yet this did not stop the elder female claimant's return to the West Bank from March to December 2015. She had left the country with her son but returned to seek medical attention, although she applied for asylum in the U.S.A. The panel notes she alleged that the family did not have the monetary means to pay for the XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX however the panel notes that the son did a monies but elected to send his mother home to the West Bank as she had medical coverage. This is not the actions of persons who truly fear harm. The fact she returned to her home and lived there for six months goes to not just the subjective but objective fear. The claimant's re-availment in the face of alleged persecution undermines the credibility of her allegations and brings her subjective fear into question.\n[23] The panel does not find it credible that the claimant would knowingly put herself in harm's way by returning to the country where she faced persecution. To leave a country whereby she was safe with her son and his family, there was no evidence before the claimant to suggest the situation had changed in West Bank while she was visiting the U.S.A. The panel finds that this behaviour is inconsistent with a person who actually fears for her life. The Supreme Court of Canada has established that a successful refugee claim must meet both subjective and objective components.6 Subjective fear is therefore a necessary component of a well-founded fear of persecution.\n[24] The panel finds that the elder female claimant's allegedly self-endangering actions contradict her fear and make her motivations suspect. Considering that the claimant had the capability to leave Palestine, had previously done so, had family in the U.S.A., the panel finds that the elder female claimant's reasons for returning to XXXX and delaying her departure until XXXX 2015 are not credible and this delay undermines the allegations that the settlers and the IDF represent a credible threat for the elder female claimant.\nWell-Founded Fear\n[25] The panel notes that the elder claimant was allowed to enter and remain in the West Bank, then later leave to join her son in Canada, thus there is nothing before the panel to suggest the elder claimant was of interest to IDF.\n[26] The panel has considered the elder female claimant's testimony of living alone. The panel notes that the elder claimant lived with her son but by her son's own testimony mostly he travelled and remained outside of the West Bank for a number of years, returning frequently either to Egypt to live with his wife or to Jordan. The panel notes that she had medical coverage and a home to return to and as mentioned above had done so prior to coming to Canada.\n[27] The panel has considered the issue of the elder female claimant's profile based on her past difficulties with the IDF. The documentary evidence7 suggests that the elder claimant's profile is not one that would bring the attention of the IDF even with her testimony that she had been detained a number of years previously. Nothing in her evidence suggests that she is of interest to the IDF.\n[28] As to violence against women, the documentary evidence summarizes most of the violence is committed by family members. The violence targeting those who protest is generalized during protests, nothing was presented to state this claimant was specifically targeted other than in the 1990s due to her daughter XXXX. Even that seems to have lessened for this particular claimant as she was allowed to travel in Jerusalem, a route not normally given to Palestinians who are suspected to be linked to terrorists or resistant fighters. The panel accepts this access was revoked but the claimant still remained and returned to the West Bank after the revocation The objective evidence shows the violence is a produce to hostilities between the warring factions, including the militant groups and the IDF, operating within the West Bank.\n[29] The panel notes that the elder female claimant did not give any evidence in regards to fearing persecution due to her gender it was more due to being Palestinian and the actions of her daughter, the actions of the IDF in trying to locate her son-in-law and the continued treatment of the Palestinians by the Israelis. The panel does not find that the totality of the elder female claimant's circumstances give rise to a well-founded fear of persecution or risk of harm.\n[30] The panel finds that nothing in the documentary evidence suggests that as an elder female the claimant could not live alone as she has in the recent past in the West Bank. The documentary evidence before the panel is summarized by the U.S.A. Department of State. Country Report on Human Rights Practices which states, \"Human rights problems under the PA in the West Bank included abuse and mistreatment of detainees, poor and overcrowded detention facilities, prolonged detention, and infringements on privacy rights. Restrictions on freedom of speech, press, and assembly continued. There were limits on freedom of association and movement. Corruption, violence against women, and societal discrimination were serious problems. At times the PA failed to condemn incidents of anti-Semitic expression. Abuse of children and discrimination against persons with disabilities also were serious problems. Discrimination based on sexual orientation and HIV\/AIDS status persisted. There were some limits on worker rights, and there was forced labor. Child labor, including forced labor, also remained a serious problem.\"8 There is a great deal of documentation on these issues. However, to summarize, Palestinians do suffer from restrictions in their day-to-day lives in the West Bank, which can be a serious inconvenience and lead to negative economic consequences, this is not unique it appears to target all or most people who reside in the West Bank. As well, if individuals are perceived by Israel as a security threat, Israeli soldiers can act much more toughly, although under significant control by the Israeli military. This is not the case for the elder female claimant, the panel finds that simply by virtue her being an elder female Palestinian, there is not a serious possibility that she will be subject to persecution in the West Bank \/ Palestine.\n[31] There is insufficient evidence to conclude that this claimant would be targeted outside of what the general populace within the West Bank face as a part of the hostilities between the parties. The panel does not find that the elder female claimant would face a serious possibility she would be persecuted because of her gender should she return to the West Bank. Thus, the panel finds that simply by virtue of her being a female Palestinian, there is not a serious possibility that she will be subject to persecution in the West Bank and Palestine.\n[32] Based on her ability to leave, return and leave again, there is nothing before the panel to suggest that this particular claimant is of interest to the IDF, the reviewing documentation indicates that those of interest would not be allowed to easily leave, return and leave again. The panel has considered the allegations of fearing the settlers but the panel does not find this fear to be specific to the claimant. Nothing was put before the panel to suggest that the settlers have targeted her home or herself, this is a general fear due to the unrest. The panel does not find that the totality of elder female claimant's circumstances give rise to a well-founded fear of persecution or risk of harm. The elder female claimant may face some harassment and questioning into her absence by border officials at checkpoints, should she return to XXXX, because of the circumstances of that region. She may have a difficult life in XXXX but, sadly, this is as all Palestinians do there. The panel does not find it give rise to the level of persecution or risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\n[33] The panel recognizes the elder female claimant wishes to remain with her son however she had a home to return to and it appears her family members residing in XXXX or in the West Bank two brothers and two daughters. However, not everyone facing a risk to life, or a cruel of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment will be found to be a person in need of protection, as section 97(1)(b)(2) of IRPA specifically excludes those people who face a risk that is faced generally by other individuals in or from that country.\n[34] There is nothing in section 97 of the IRPA that requires the Board to interpret what \"generally\" means as applying to all citizens. The panel notes that the difficulties the elder female claimant testified and wrote about are those experienced by the general population in the West Bank. The panel does not find it rises to the level of persecution and agrees with the United Kingdom Home Office assessment that, \".....the difficulties faced by Palestinians in the Occupied Territories (economic situation, food insecurity, travel restrictions etc.) taken cumulatively are not such that the minimum level of severity for persecution or serious harm is reached, nor is the minimum threshold for a breach of a returnees\" rights under Article 3 reached.\"9 In the circumstances of this particular case, the harm feared by the elder female claimant does not amount to persecution or to a personalized risk to her life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture. It did not prevent her from returning and obtaining medical treatment, nor did it prevent her from staying in her home and living until contacted by her son.\n[35] Therefore, the panel finds that the elder female claimant has not established, on a balance of probabilities, that she faces a well-founded fear of persecution by either the settlers or Israeli authorities if she were to return to Palestine. Finally, as the claimant has not established that she would face risk under the lower test in section 96, consequently, her claim has not been established on the higher, more likely than not, test under section 97. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the risk faced by the claimant is not personal to her but one that is faced by others in that country. 10\n[36] The panel, therefore, finds that the elder female claimant is not person in need of protection as defined in section 96 or 97 of the IRPA.\nCONCLUSION\n[37] Having considered all the evidence, and based on the above-noted analysis, the panel finds that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is not a Convention refugee as she has not established that there is a reasonable chance or serious possibility that she will face persecution for a Convention ground or, on a balance of probability, she will face a risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture, believed on substantial grounds to exist, should she return to her country of former habitual residence, the Palestinian Occupied Territories, the West Bank.\n[38] The panel rejects this claim pursuant to both section 96 and 97 of the IRPA.\n(signed)\n\"B.

Although he travelled on an Egyptian document, the claimant never lived there and cannot enter Egypt without permission. The claimant's wife is a Jordanian citizen living in Kuwait who, the claimant alleges, cannot sponsor him to Jordan. The claimant, although Palestinian, has no right to enter Israeli-occupied Palestine.\n[4] Although born in Kuwait, the claimant has no permanent resident status in Kuwait, because his parents were Palestinians. Palestinians are discriminated against in Kuwait with respect to education, jobs, health benefits and other necessities of life. The claimant studied business in Syria but did not complete his degree and does not have status there.\n[5] Because the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) supported Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, the Kuwaitis adopted anti-Palestinian policies after the Gulf War, and expelled many Palestinians who had status elsewhere. The claimant had no status elsewhere, and he was detained for a month in 1991 as he did not have a residency permit. The claimant eventually obtained a residency permit, after he found a sponsor (kafala) for employment in Kuwait, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, from 1992 to 2007, as a XXXX XXXX.\n[6] The claimant travelled on a visitor's visa to the United States of America (US) in 2007 and worked illegally for an XXXX XXXX XXXX company for a few months. The claimant then returned to Kuwait, where he found a sponsor to open an XXXX XXXX XXXXbusiness. His sponsor, XXXX XXXX, was connected to a very powerful Kuwaiti family. The sponsor did not respect the claimant; he insulted him publicly daily and forced him to work very long hours.\n[7] In 2012, the business was doing very well and the claimant approached the sponsor for a raise, which the sponsor refused. The claimant threatened to take his business acumen and knowledge of the business to open a competing business. The XXXX sponsor threatened the claimant, saying he had friends in the police and security apparatus, and threatened to replace him with other foreign workers for half of his pay. The claimant earned XXXX dinars per month and his rent alone was XXXX dinars per month, leaving him nothing for other expenses.\n[8] Shortly after this, the sponsor's connections started to harass the claimant. They forbade him to open a competing business and to leave Kuwait. He spoke over the phone to people about his plans and people seemed to know; he considered that his phone was tapped and that he was constantly watched and followed. Because of his sponsor's connections, and because of the attitude of Kuwaitis to Palestinians, there was no one he could complain to. His friends deserted him.\n[9] On the advice of his wife, the claimant applied for another US tourism visa, which was issued on XXXX XXXX 2015. The claimant arrived in the US on XXXX XXXX 2016, and stamped in for the usual six months duration, to XXXX XXXX 2016. The claimant drove from Chicago to Detroit and crossed into Canada at the Windsor Tunnel where he made his claim for protection.4\nDETERMINATION\n[10] The panel finds that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. The panel also finds that should the claimant return to Kuwait he would not be subjected personally to a risk to his life or to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. Further, on substantial grounds there is no danger of torture.\nIDENTITY\n[11] On a balance of probabilities, the panel is willing to accept that the claimant is a stateless Palestinian whose country of habitual residence is Kuwait, based on his testimony, and the Egyptian travel document, which contains a Kuwait residency permit.\nANALYSIS\n[12] The determinative issue in this case is the credibility of the evidence as submitted. On this issue, the panel is guided by the Federal Court of Appeal case in Sellan5 which stated the following:\nWhere the Board makes a general finding that the claimant lacks credibility, that determination is sufficient to dispose of the claim unless there is independent and credible documentary evidence in the record capable of supporting a positive disposition of the claim. The claimant bears the onus of demonstrating there was such evidence.\n[13] Furthermore, the Federal Court notes the following:\nThe Board is in a much better position than a reviewing court to gage the credibility and plausibility of a refugee claimant's story. A credibility finding is not a finding of mixed fact and law. It is a finding of fact, pure and simple. Findings of fact made by the Board may only be interfered with by a reviewing court if the finding was made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it (see the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, paragraph 18.1(4)(d)). Indeed, it was Parliament's express intention that administrative fact finding would command this high degree of deference (see Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Khosa, 2009 SCC 12, [2009] S.C.J. No. 12 (QL) at paragraph 46).\nThus, credibility findings of the Board are to be reviewed against the statutory standard of review provided for in paragraph 18.1(4)(d) of the Federal Courts Act (see Diabo v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2004 FC 1772, [2004] F.C.J. No. 2168 (QL) at paragraph 3).\n[14] In examining the evidence in this claim, the panel was not presented with sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence that the claimant, as a stateless Palestinian, working in Kuwait, would not be able to maintain his status there.\n[15] The panel finds the claimant is not credible regarding Kuwait for several reasons. Firstly, the claimant's problems did not begin in 2014 or 2015 but allegedly go back to the 1990s. Nevertheless, the claimant did not seek asylum in the US during the time he was there in 2007. He did not even make enquiries at that time, but returned to Kuwait. This is discussed below under subjective fear. Secondly, the documentary evidence provided by the claimant shows the power of the XXXX family he alleges he fears; one could find that this family is not only wealthy but well-connected politically. However, the panel finds the claimant has not connected the documents on the XXXX family to his situation in Kuwait.\n[16] The claimant alleges he started an XXXX XXXX XXXXbusiness with a sponsor by the name of XXXX in Kuwait, who may or may not be connected to the powerful XXXX family in the documents. This means the claimant washed and cleaned cars. This is a business he learned in the US. He says it is lucrative but has no records of this business: \"there is nothing because he dealt with secret services\" and \"there is no paper trail\".\n[17] As a Palestinian, he could not own a business so he worked for his sponsor for low wages. It is not credible that, after several months, the sponsor would not know all the workings XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and be able, on a whim or otherwise, to fire the claimant and hire someone for even lower wages, as threatened. This is one part of the evidence the panel found credible. The panel does not find it tenable that a powerful Kuwaiti family would care about a XXXX XXXX XXXX sufficiently to bring to bear the weight of the security apparatus of the state and finds the claimant exaggerated his importance to the business or the threats he received. Even if it were true that the claimant learned the business in Chicago, including the \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX different parts of the XXXX, including the engine\", as alleged, I find this is not such secret or arcane knowledge that it would not be possible for the sponsor and new employees to pick up. The claimant admitted that this was not the only business in Kuwait - there were two or three other car detailers.\n[18] Also, the claimant alleged the sponsor paid him XXXX dinars a month, all of which he spent on rent. This is not tenable, either. A person cannot survive for nine years without any income after rent - one must buy groceries, at the very least. The panel has drawn an adverse inference from this testimony. In Sung,6 the Federal Court stated,\nThe other observation which might be made is that in the realm of a claimant's credibility, contradictions are not the exclusive factual source on which the presumption of truth in the claimant's evidence, as so ruled by the Federal Court of Appeal, may be rebutted. A tribunal may also conclude that a claimant's evidence is implausible, or improbable, or dubious, or untenable, or unreliable, or absurd, or unconvincing.\n[19] If in fact the claimant feared for his life as of 2012 as alleged in the BoC narrative, the panel does not believe the claimant would be able to continue working for three years, and obtain a US visa, given the alleged risk to his life. If the claimant is remotely on the radar of the authorities, which the panel does not believe is the case, the claimant would not likely have been able to leave Kuwait without any problems. This negatively impacts the claimant's evidence as submitted and the panel makes a negative credibility finding as a consequence.\n[20] Given the concerns raised in this claim as it addresses the credibility of the evidence, the panel was not sufficiently convinced that the claimant encountered problems as alleged and that he suffered and would continue to suffer persecution as a result if required to return to Kuwait.\n[21] The claimant has the responsibility to prove he has an objectively identifiable risk in Kuwait keeping in mind the Convention definition. The claimant has not met his burden, in the panel's view. Simply, after reviewing all the evidence, inclusive of counsel's submissions as it pertains to a well-founded fear of persecution or that the claimant is in need of protection pursuant to section 97 of the IRPA, there has not been a successful argument made to suggest a positive determination in this regard, especially as the claimant failed to establish a subjective fear of returning to Kuwait.\nSubjective Fear\n[22] The subjective fear relates to the existence of a fear of harm in the mind of the claimant. The objective basis requires there be a valid basis for the fear.7 Both subjective fear and an objective basis for it are crucial elements for a claim to succeed. In Kamana,8 Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer held that the panel's finding that the claimant had not credibly established the subjective element was reasonable and:\nThe lack of evidence going to the subjective element of the claim is a fatal flaw which in and of itself warrants dismissal of the claim, since both elements of the refugee definition-subjective and objective-must be met.\n[23] Failure to seek the protection of another country which is also a signatory to the Convention may be a significant factor to consider but is not in itself determinative. Voluntarily leaving a country where the claimant could safely live is another example of behaviour that can cast doubt on a claimant's subjective fear.9\nThe delay in making a claim to refugee status is not a decisive factor in itself. It is, however, a relevant element which the tribunal may take into account in assessing both the statements and the actions and deeds of a claimant.10\n[24] The 'delay' in this case is in failing to make a claim in the US in 2007, returning to Kuwait that year and remaining there for another nine or so years, and then leaving Kuwait again in 2016 to go to the US, a signatory to the Refugee Convention11 and a safe third country, and finally coming to Canada, where he did not have status to enter or remain.\n[25] It is not the delay in claiming by failing to claim in the US and coming to Canada that is decisive in these claims, it is the principal claimant's explanation or lack thereof that is decisive.\n[26] The panel asked the claimant whether he had a work permit in the US in 2007. He admitted he did not. When asked why he risked working illegally in the US, which would have put him in danger of being deported to the country he allegedly fears, the claimant said he only worked for a month and he learned the business XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Clearly, from this answer his intention all along was to return to Kuwait. This is the country in which the claimant alleges he suffered discrimination amounting to persecution in education, health and employment, and experienced daily insults and threats, all because of his ethnic origins. The panel further notes that the claimant delayed leaving Kuwait for about three years after the alleged problems of 2012, without providing a reasonable explanation. The panel finds this explanation not sufficient to rebut the presumption that someone fearing persecution would leave and claim asylum at the first opportunity. The claimant did not leave on a timely basis either prior to 2007 or after 2012, returned after a sojourn in a refugee-accepting country for nine more years and failed to claim when he found himself again in the US.\n[27] The claimant did not consult with the US immigration services while he was still legally in the US in 2007 or in 2016. Also, the claimant did not consult with immigration counsel while in the US in either 2007 or 2016. His explanation for this failure is two-fold: he did not want to jeopardize his [visitor] visa in 2007, and because he \"wanted to come to Canada\", as he has a sister here. The panel had to remind the claimant that the question concerned the 2007, not the 2016 trip to the US. When the panel pointed out he did not come to Canada in 2007 to visit his sister or for any reason, the claimant stated that he wanted to go back to Kuwait as his family was there.\n[28] The panel notes the claimant left his wife and children in Kuwait in 2016, as well, and fails to understand the difference, noting the credibility concerns found above. The panel finds the claimant's returning to Kuwait, after working in the US in 2007, shows a lack of subjective fear and furthermore his return to Kuwait after being in the US with a valid visa undermines his credibility.\n[29] The panel further notes that the claimant has a sister in Kansas, as well as one in Montreal, apparently. The claimant stated he did not go to visit his US sister in 2007 or 2016, as he is not close to her. It is hard to see the closeness of a relationship with the sister in Canada, either, as he did not visit her or she him, nor did he need her help in claiming protection in Canada, he stated. I find, as a result, that having a sister in Canada he has not visited is not much different than a sister in the US he did not visit, which gave him no advantage in claiming protection here. As a result of this testimony regarding the two unvisited sisters, I have drawn an adverse credibility inference.\n[30] The panel further noted that it is one thing to appreciate a decision to return, even if not fully accepting it, but it is another thing for a claimant, when in fear of persecution and other serious harm, to fail to even make enquiries or conduct research on how to remain in the US legally, or obtain immigration status more permanently. The claimant stated in reply that he had consulted an immigration office in Kuwait, but it was always about Canada. The panel asked the claimant if he had ever, in 2007 or since, applied for a Canadian visa and he admitted he had not. The panel noted the claimant had applied for and received visas for the US and Nicaragua, but not Canada, because the Kuwaiti immigration consultant told him that Canada only provides permanent resident visas for people with university degrees. The claimant did not seek immigration advice in 2016, either.\n[31] The panel notes that by 2007, the claimant had already suffered discrimination with respect to education, job opportunities, pay levels, health care, and he had experienced appalling conditions while detained in a Kuwaiti prison, for being in the country without permission allegedly for years. Yet, the claimant not only worked illegally in the US risking deportation to the very country he states he fears, but also and more significantly, he returned to Kuwait for another nine years, thus effectively re-availing himself of that country's protection. I find this not only indicates the claimant lacks the requisite subjective fear, but these facts also undermine the claimant's credibility.\n[32] The panel finds the claimant remained in the US until XXXX XXXX 2016, after driving from Chicago to Detroit and entering Canada via the Windsor Tunnel. The claimant continues to live in Windsor, Ontario. The claimant stated he wanted to come to Canada because he has a sister here. The panel pointed out that his alleged sister lives in Montreal, and he admitted that he has never gone to Montreal to visit her nor has she gone to Windsor to visit him. The only evidence that the claimant provided that he has a sister in Montreal is his say-so. There is nothing in the record to indicate that anyone in Canada shares the same father or mother with him. The Border Services Officer did not allow the claimant into Canada on the basis of a proven anchor relative in Canada, as is the case for many, but because he is a stateless Palestinian, the claimant is exempt from the safe third country provisions, without which a claimant is returned to the US. The claimant has friends in the Chicago area. Whether he has a sister in Montreal or not is not determinative, for the reasons below.\n[33] While the panel can appreciate that the claimant would feel more comfortable in coming to Canada because he has a family member in this country, that in and of itself does not mean the claimant should not have or could not have taken the opportunity to advance a claim in the US and await their determination given his life was at risk based on the problems as described in 2015, that being before entering the US with a six-month visa. The claimant's lack of action in this regard also puts his claim in disrepute.\n[34] On the issue of not claiming in the US, the panel notes the following Federal Court of Canada case law, Matos Quintana,12 which states:\nConsidering the obvious lack of credibility regarding the event at the centre of the claim, it was not unreasonable to not grant any probative value to all the documents submitted by the applicant. (Satinder Pal Singh) (3) It was not unreasonable to determine that the fact that the applicant did not claim refugee status in the United States-a country where he spent three months and for which he had a five-year visa-could undermine his credibility.\n[35] The Federal Court13 also found the Refugee Protection Division (the Division) did not act unreasonably in finding the claimant's failure to claim refugee protection during his stay in the US before arriving in Canada undermined his credibility, even if the claimant's intention all along had been to come to Canada, even if the claimant has relatives in Canada and is totally alone in the US:\nThere was no legal impediment to the Applicant remaining in the US and filing an asylum claim in the US; ...\n[The] explanation, in the Court's view, is an unacceptable reason to delay seeking asylum in another country and strongly indicates a lack of subjective fear of persecution. As stated in Olaya v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 913 (CanLII), the mere fact that an applicant has one relative living in Canada is not a sufficient basis to overcome the fact that he or she did not claim refugee status in the US \"as quickly as possible\" (reference is also made to Gilgorri v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 2006 FC 559 (CanLII) at para 24 to 27).\n[36] In Madoui,14 an Algerian claimant failed to claim during a 19 month stay in Italy. He had been told by friends that he had little, if any, chance of obtaining refugee status in Italy. Despite statistics in evidence showing that similar claims were rarely accepted, the Board was not satisfied that the subjective component had been met and the Court saw no error in the Board's assessment.\n[37] In Mekideche,15 when the Board asked why the claimant did not claim refugee status during his two years in Italy, he testified that it was because he believed that Algerian refugees would be denied and returned to Algeria. This belief was based on news reports that other European countries were not receptive to Algerian refugees. Noting that he travelled throughout Europe with false documentation before arriving in Canada, the Board stated that this was a risk that a person who feared persecution would not take. The Court found no error in the Board's conclusion that these two issues showed an absence of a subjective fear of persecution.\n[38] In Leul16 at paragraphs 7 and 12, Mr. Justice Muldoon writes the following:\nOne might observe that he passed through Amsterdam and that The Netherlands is a convention refugee signatory, but apparently he did not think to claim refugee status there.\n... Just as I would not wish to send back to his country a person who stood in jeopardy of a reasonable chance of persecution, so I just do not wish to leave in Canada a person who isn't entitled to be here; a person who passed through a country which was a signatory to the convention and did not think to claim refugee status there.\n[39] The conclusion the panel has arrived at is that the claimant lacks the requisite subjective fear, and his claim fails under section 96 of IRPA. On this same reasoning, the failure to claim asylum on two occasions in the US without a persuasive explanation means the principal claimant is not credible with respect to his fear of returning to Kuwait for the reasons he alleged, and his claim fails under section 97(1) of IRPA, as well. Furthermore, as stated by the Federal Court in Ahoua,17 at paragraph 16, \"... a negative finding regarding subjective fear may render the assessment of the objective aspect of the complaint superfluous and may in itself warrant the dismissal of the claim\". Also, in Ortiz, Mr. Justice O'Keefe held that a finding the claimant lacked subjective fear due to his failure to apply for asylum in the US is sufficient, alone, for the Division to reasonably deny the refugee claim:18\n[30] However, the Board's finding that there was a lack of serious effort on the part of the applicant to apply for asylum is reasonable despite the applicant's submissions. As Mr. Justice Yvon Pinard held in Bobic v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2004 FC 1488 (CanLII) at paragraph 6, an applicant's reasons for not claiming refugee status in a foreign country must be valid in order to avoid an adverse inference. Serious efforts require more than having a friend inquire about the asylum process. A Mr. Justice Roger Hughes held in Stojmenovic v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 2010 FC 873 (CanLII) at paragraph 5, that \"a refugee claim should not be looked at simply as one of many choices as to how best to seek status in Canada.\" The applicant's submission that he did not apply for asylum because it would be granted more easily in Canada or because he would gain permanent residence faster in Canada are not valid reasons for negating the adverse inference that he lacked subjective fear by not applying for asylum in the United States. A finding that the applicant lacked subjective fear due to his failure to apply for asylum in the United States is sufficient, alone, for the Board to reasonably deny the refugee claim (see Goltsberg v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2010 FC 886 (CanLII) at paragraph 28; Gamassi c. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l'Immigration) (2000), 2000 CanLII 16473 (FC), 194 F.T.R. 178at paragraph 6).\n[31] Because of my finding on Issue 2, I need not deal with the remaining issues as an applicant needs to have a subjective fear in order to succeed in a refugee claim.\n[40] As Ortiz was decided since IRPA was enacted, the finding covers both sections 96 and 97(1), according to the Federal Court.\nCONCLUSION\n[41] Having considered all the evidence, inclusive of the documentary evidence and the submissions from the claimant's counsel, the panel finds that the claimant is not a Convention refugee as he has not established that there is a reasonable chance or serious possibility that he would be persecuted for a Convention ground or there would be a risk to his life or he would be subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment should he be required to return to Kuwait in a forward looking analysis. On substantial grounds, there is no danger of torture should the claimant return to Kuwait. The panel rejects this claim pursuant to both sections 96 and 97(1) of the IRPA.\n(signed)\n\"James V.

She is claiming refugee protection in Canada pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). 1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The details of the claimant's allegations were documented in her Basis of Claim Form (BOC)2 and in her oral testimony. The claimant fears a risk of harm from the Ethiopian government because of her political opinion.\n[3] The claimant joined the Semayawi Party (Blue Party) in XXXX 2013. The claimant's fianc\u00e9 was also an activist with the Blue Party and has a long history of political activism with the Kinijit and the Unity for Democracy and Justice political organizations. The claimant's fianc\u00e9 has been imprisoned multiple times for his political activism. The claimant was detained on two separate occasions in XXXX 2015 for her association with her fianc\u00e9's political activism and for being a member of the Blue Party. After the claimant was released from her second detention the claimant made arrangements to flee Ethiopia. The claimant left Ethiopia on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and arrived in Canada on December 3, 2015.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] The panel determines that the claimant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of IRPA.\n[5] The determinative issues in this claim are identity and credibility as it relates to identity.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity and Credibility\n[6] Numerous credibility concerns arose with respect to the claimant's identity documents as well as with the claimant's testimony. The panel finds the claimant has not provided reasonable explanations for the credibility concerns and therefore finds the claimant is not a credible witness.\nPassport\n[7] The claimant presented her passport to establish her identity.3 The claimant testified that she has not had any previous passports. The claimant explained that her passport was applied for and obtained through her employer, Ethiopian Airlines. The claimant explained that after she completed her six month training period with XXXX Airlines, she and the other trainees in her training group handed over their documents and their employer, XXXX Airlines, then proceeded to obtain passports for the claimant and her fellow employees.\n[8] The panel notes that the claimant's passport was issued on XXXX XXXX, 2010. The claimant states in her Schedule A (IMM 5669) form and in her BOC that she began working for XXXX Airlines in XXXX 2011. The claimant testified that she began her job with XXXX Airlines in XXXX 2011. The claimant was asked how she could have completed six months of training with XXXX Airlines and then obtained a passport through XXXX Airlines by XXXX XXXX, 2010 when her BOC, Schedule A form, and oral testimony all indicate she did not begin working for Ethiopian Airlines until XXXX 2011. The claimant hesitated, asked to view her passport and XXXX Airlines identity card, and after a long pause, stated that \"for sure the process is through the XXXX Airlines\". The claimant then went on to state that she is certain she obtained her passport through XXXX Airlines and that the date she provided in her forms and her testimony, namely XXXX 2011, as her start date with XXXX Airlines is \"a mistake\". Later in the claimant's testimony the claimant further explained that she began her training with XXXX Airlines prior to XXXX 2011 and that XXXX 2011 was when she started \"working\" for XXXX Airlines. The claimant also explained that her training period with XXXX Airlines, prior to when she began \"working\" for XXXX Airlines, consisted of full-day training days where individuals could not miss even a single day of training. The claimant testified that she began her full-time training with XXXX Airlines, which lasted for six months, prior to XXXX 2011 and after she completed this training period, she was appointed to work for XXXX Airlines in XXXX 2011. The claimant confirmed that she obtained her passport after she completed her training. The claimant insists that she obtained her passport through her employer, XXXX Airlines. The claimant stated it was only after she completed her training that XXXX Airlines obtained her passport for her.\n[9] The panel finds the claimant has not provided a reasonable and logical explanation for how she obtained her passport. There is no indication in the claimant's BOC or her Schedule A form that she began working or training with XXXX Airlines prior to XXXX 2011. Rather, the claimant's Schedule A form clearly indicates that the claimant was working as a receptionist for XXXX Hotel until XXXX 2011 and that she then began working for XXXX Airlines in XXXX 2011. The claimant described her six month training with XXXX Airlines, which took place prior to XXXX 2011, as an intensive training period which consisted of full-day training days during which one could not miss even a single day of training. Yet, the claimant clearly indicates in her Schedule A form that up until XXXX 2011 she was working as a receptionistXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimant explained that her forms should have been corrected. To that end, the panel notes that the claimant did in fact submit amendments to her BOC and to her Schedule A form, on January 29, 2016, prior to her first hearing; however, none of these amendments relate to her employment history. Given that BOC amendments and Schedule A amendments were submitted prior to her hearing, there is clear evidence before the panel that the claimant reviewed her forms prior to her hearing date. In that context it is reasonable to expect that the claimant would have submitted amendments to her Schedule A form with respect to her employment history at the same time she submitted her other amendments. The claimant did not do so. The claimant signed her Schedule A form declaring that the information she gave was truthful, complete, and correct. The claimant had the guidance and assistance of her counsel in completing her Schedule A form. The panel finds that the claimant has not provided a reasonable explanation for why her testimony is inconsistent with her Schedule A as it relates to when she began working with XXXX Airlines. The panel finds that the claimant's lack of credibility as to when she began working for XXXX Airlines undermines her credibility as it relates to how and when she obtained her passport. The panel finds that there is insufficient persuasive evidence before the panel that is reliable and trustworthy to find that the claimant did in fact begin working with XXXX Airlines, whether as a trainee or as an appointed employee, prior to XXXX 2011. The panel finds that the claimant's testimony is not consistent with how and when her passport was issued. The panel finds the claimant is not a credible witness.\n[10] Even if the panel were to accept the claimant's testimony, namely that the claimant did begin training with XXXX Airlines prior to XXXX 2011, the claimant's testimony is that she did not complete her training until XXXX 2011. The claimant's testimony is also that she did not obtain her passport until after she completed her training. Again, the panel notes that the claimant's passport was issued on XXXX XXXX, 2010, that is, before she allegedly completed her training. Again, the panel finds that the claimant's testimony is not consistent with when her passport was issued. The panel finds that the claimant has not provided a reasonable explanation for how and when she obtained her passport. The panel finds the claimant is not a credible witness.\n[11] The panel finds the claimant did not testify in a straightforward manner. The only explanation before the panel for how the claimant obtained her passport is that she obtained her passport through XXXX Airlines who procured the passport on behalf of the claimant. The panel finds there is insufficient persuasive evidence that it is reliable and trustworthy to find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant was actually working for, or training with, XXXX Airlines at the time of the issuance of her passport. The panel therefore finds that there is no reasonable explanation that is credible and trustworthy to establish on a balance of probabilities how the claimant obtained her passport. The panel finds there is insufficient persuasive evidence to establish the veracity and authenticity of the passport disclosed by the claimant. The panel gives the passport no evidentiary weight with respect to establishing the identity of the claimant.\nResident Identity Card\n[12] At the outset of the second sitting, the claimant disclosed her resident identity card.4 The claimant's resident identity card was issued on XXXX 30, 2014 and lists her address as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimant states in her Schedule A form that she had been residing XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, since at least December 2005. When asked for an explanation with respect to the inconsistency in her address, the claimant stated that the information in her Schedule A form should have been corrected and that although she informed her counsel of the error, her counsel indicated that it was too late to amend it. The panel finds the claimant has not provided a reasonable explanation as to why her address on her resident identity card is inconsistent with her Schedule A form. The panel notes that the claimant had previously provided an amendment to her Schedule A form on January 29, 2016 which clearly indicates that the claimant had an opportunity to review her form; however, no amendments to her address were submitted. The claimant signed her Schedule A form declaring that the information she gave was truthful, complete, and correct. The claimant had the guidance and assistance of her counsel in completing her Schedule A form. The difference between the address in the claimant's Schedule A form and the claimant's resident identity card is not simply a matter of a single discrepancy in one number, but both the XXXX and the house number sections of the claimant's address are inconsistent between the two documents. There is no reasonable explanation as to why the claimant would provide two completely different answers for her XXXX and house number in her Schedule A form and her BOC. The panel finds the claimant's inconsistent evidence regarding her address undermines her credibility and the reliability of her resident identity card.\n[13] The claimant testified that she had been living at her fianc\u00e9's residence at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX since February 2014. The claimant's resident identity card was issued on XXXX XXXX, 2014, well after the claimant had moved. The panel asked the claimant why the claimant's resident identity card indicates her address as of XXXX XXXX, 2014 as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX when she had moved nine months prior. The claimant explained that she did not change her address on her resident identity card because although she resided with her fianc\u00e9 at his address, they were not married at the time and it was not her permanent address. The panel finds the claimant has not provided a reasonable explanation for the inconsistencies in her testimony and resident identity card. There is no documentary evidence before the panel which indicates that the resident identity cards in Ethiopia are only to record \"permanent\" addresses or that the address recorded on one's resident identity card is dependent on one's marital status in any way. The panel finds the claimant's inconsistent evidence for her address undermines her credibility and the reliability of her resident identity card.\n[14] Given the inconsistent information in the claimant's resident identity card with the other evidence before the panel, the panel finds there is insufficient evidence to find that the resident identity card disclosed by the claimant is a document that was issued based on information that is reliable and trustworthy. The panel finds there is insufficient persuasive evidence to establish the probative value of the claimant's resident identity card. The panel finds the claimant is not a credible witness in this regard and gives the resident identity card no evidentiary weight with respect to establishing the identity of the claimant.\nEthiopian Civil Aviation Authority identity card and XXXX Airlines employee identity card\n[15] The claimant disclosed an Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority identity card and an XXXX Airlines employee identity card.5 There is no documentary evidence before the panel that such documents are recognized as primary identity documents by the Ethiopian state authorities. There is no documentary evidence before the panel which establishes how an applicant's identity is verified and what identity documents and security checks, if any, are required before an Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority identity card and an XXXX Airlines employee identity card are issued to an individual. Neither card has any discernable date of issue. The panel gives the Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority identity card and the XXXX Airlines employee identity card no evidentiary weight in establishing the identity of the claimant.\nBlue Party identity card\n[16] The claimant disclosed a Blue Party membership identity card.6 There is no documentary evidence before the panel that such documents are recognized as identity documents by the Ethiopian state authorities. There is no documentary evidence before the panel which establishes how an applicant's identity is verified and what identity documents and what security checks, if any, are required before a Blue Party membership identity card is issued to an individual. There are no security features associated with the card. The panel gives the Blue Party membership identity card no evidentiary weight in establishing the identity of the claimant.\nThe claimant's identity\n[17] In considering all the evidence before the panel, the panel finds that serious credibility concerns have arisen. The panel finds the claimant is not a credible witness and that the presumption of truthfulness does not apply in this instance. The claimant has provided conflicting evidence regarding her residence history and employment history which impacts directly upon her credibility as it relates to her primary identity documents and ultimately, her identity. The panel finds the claimant has not provided reasonable explanations for those credibility concerns. Given the claimant's lack of credibility and the lack of evidence to establish, on a balance of probabilities, the veracity and authenticity of the claimant's primary identity documents, the panel finds there is no probative evidence before the panel upon which the panel can establish the claimant's personal and national identity. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has not established her identity.\nCONCLUSION\n[18] In considering the totality of the evidence the panel finds the claimant is not a credible witness and has not met the burden to establish her identity, on a balance of probabilities as, required by Section 106 of IRPA and Rule 11 of the Rules.\n[19] The panel concludes that the claimant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection and therefore rejects her claim.\n[20] In rejecting the claim, the panel determines there was no credible or trustworthy evidence on which the panel could have made a favourable decision, given the claimant's lack of credibility and the lack of independent, credible evidence linking the claimant to potential persecution or a risk of harm under section 96 and 97 of IRPA. In accordance with section 107(2) of IRPA the panel determines that there is no credible basis for this claim.\n(signed)\n\"A. Jung\"\nA. Jung\nConcurred in by:\n(signed)\n\"L. Gamble\"\nL. Gamble\nApril 21, 2016\nDate\nDISSENTING REASONS\nINTRODUCTION\n[1] These are my dissenting reasons in the claim for refugee protection in Canada of XXXX XXXX XXXX (hereafter \"the claimant\"). The claimant claims to be a citizen of Ethiopia. She is claiming refugee protection in Canada pursuant to section 96 and section 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).7\nDETERMINATION\n[2] This claim was heard by a three-member panel on March 22 and April 6, 2016. My colleagues have reached a final decision rejecting this claim. The determinative issues, in their views, were identity and credibility as it relates to identity.\n[3] For the reasons that follow, I am respectfully unable to concur in their determination. I disagree with the decision of my colleagues on the interlocutory matter of whether or not to hear more evidence as discussed below. The evidence in question, if credible, may have impacted my findings on the issues of identity and credibility. As such, I do not concur with the final determination of my colleagues, nor am I able to reach a different final determination without having heard the evidence in question.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] I rely on the Presiding Member's account of the basis of the claimant's allegations.\nANALYSIS\n[5] The claimant testified that she obtained her passport through her employer, XXXX Airlines. According to the claimant's testimony, this is a XXXX XXXX XXXX company. The claimant alleges a fear of persecution or a risk to life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment at the hands of Ethiopian authorities.\n[6] At the second sitting of this matter, the claimant testified that when she approached Canadian immigration authorities to make her claim, she was advised that she was wanted by the RCMP (in the claimant's words, police at the airport). The claimant testified that she entered Canada on an XXXX Airlines flight as cabin crew. She testified that immigration authorities told her when she made her claim that her employer had reported her missing, and that she should report to the police. She testified that she did so, and advised the police that she had made a refugee claim. She testified that she was advised that the police wished to confirm her safety and that they would not disclose to anyone the location of the shelter at which she was staying.\n[7] Counsel requested the opportunity to seek evidence corroborating these facts. This request was denied, though the panel reserved the right to reconvene the hearing if further evidence was necessary.\n[8] My colleagues have reached a final determination in this claim, finding that sufficient evidence had been heard to make a determination on the issue of identity.\n[9] The panel heard a significant amount of testimony about how and when the claimant obtained the passport presented to Canadian immigration authorities when this claim was made. I find that the claimant's testimony was, at times, unclear and confusing. This affects my assessment of her credibility. However, I am unable to make findings with respect to credibility and identity without examining what additional evidence may have been sought to corroborate the claimant's method of entry into Canada as cabin crew or the fact that her employer, XXXX Airlines, reported her missing.\n[10] As a result, I am unable to make a final determination and abstain from doing so.\n(signed)\n\"L.

He is claiming protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) against the People's Republic of China (\"China\").1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The alleged circumstances underlying the claim are contained in the Claimant's Basis of Claim (\"BOC\") form,2 and are supplemented by the Claimant's oral testimony and supporting documentation.\n[3] The Claimant was born on XXXX XXXX, 1985 in XXXX XXXX XXXX, India.3 Both of his parents were born in Tibet, China; his father was born in XXXX 1953 and his mother was born in XXXX 1956. His parents left Tibet for India in 1959 with the Claimant's grandparents in response to China's occupation of Tibet.\n[4] The Claimant has resided in India for his entire life. He completed studies in XXXX and was employed as a XXXX at a hospital where he worked amongst the local Tibetan community.\n[5] The Claimant has never resided in or travelled to China. He testified that he has family that remain in China, although he does not have contact with them. He alleges that he fears deportation to China as he does not have any permanent status in India. He testified that he has never applied for citizenship in India.\n[6] The Claimant exited India on his Indian Identity Certificate, which contained a United States visa, on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and arrived in Canada on February 2, 2016 via the United States. He claimed for refugee protection upon his arrival at the Canadian border. He alleges that he fears persecution in China on the basis of his political beliefs for his activism against China's annexation of Tibet and on the basis of his religious beliefs as a Tibetan Buddhist who follows the Dalai Lama. He also states that he does not have a right to return to India.\nDECISION\n[7] For the reasons that follow, the Panel determines that the Claimant is not a Convention refugee, nor a person in need of protection. Therefore, the claim is rejected.\nANALYSIS\n[8] The determinative issue in this case is national identity\/country of reference.\nIdentity\n[9] The Claimant's personal identity is addressed through his testimony and the supporting documentation filed, including a true copy of the Claimant's Identity Certificate issued by the Republic of India.4 The original Identity Certificate was seized by the Canada Border Services Agency at the time the Claimant made his claim for refugee protection, and so the Panel did not inspect the original document.5 However, there was no aspect on the face of the Identity Certificate that caused the panel to doubt its genuine nature. Also, while it is not determinative, the United States entry stamp indicates that the document was accepted as genuine upon the Claimant's entry into the United States, through which the Claimant travelled to the Canadian Port of Entry at Fort Erie.6 Further, the totality of the evidence with respect to identity is found to be satisfactory. The Panel, therefore, finds that the Claimant has established his personal identity.\n[10] The issue of national identity will be addressed below with respect to the country of reference. However, as per the Claimant's testimony and the information in the Identity Certificate, the Panel accepts that the Claimant was born in India in 1985.\nNational Identity\/Country of Reference\n[11] Refugee protection will be denied where it is within the power of the claimant to obtain citizenship in a safe country.7 There is a division in the applicable jurisprudence as to whether Tibetans born in India between 1950 and 1987 have a practical right to citizenship in India.8 Counsel provided thorough and fair submissions on the issue. The Panel has fully considered those submissions and the case law cited therein, as well as the whole of the relevant evidence in deciding this matter.\nRight to Indian Citizenship\n[12] Section 3(1) of the Indian Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003 states as follows:\nExcept as provided in sub-section (2), every person born in India,\n(a) on or after the 26th day of January, 1950, but before the 1st day of July, 1987;\n(b) on or after the 1st day of July, 1987, but before the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003 and either of whose parents is a citizen of India at the time of his birth;\n(c) on or after the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003, where\n(i) both of his parents are citizens of India; or\n(ii) one of whose parents is a citizen of India and the other is not an illegal migrant at the time of his birth, shall be a citizen of India by birth.9\n[emphasis added]\n[13] On the face of the above statute, the Claimant should be considered a citizen of India by birth, or at least have an ostensible right to citizenship, as he was born there in 1985. However, practical realities must also inform the issue of nationality.\nCountry Conditions Respecting Indian Citizenship\n[14] Indian authorities appear, at least historically, to be reluctant in recognizing Indian citizenship of Tibetans born in India between 1950 and 1987.10 The United States' Department of State-issued Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2015 stated that, \"Tibetans sometimes faced difficulty acquiring citizenship although they met the legal requirements.\"11 There are a number of reported instances where authorities have refused to issue Indian passports to ethnic Tibetans born in India between the relevant dates, which required formal intervention by the courts.12 In three reported instances of court intervention, in 2010, 2013, and 2014, India's High Courts, located in Delhi and Karnataka, recognized the Indian citizenship of the Tibetan applicants and ordered the issuance of passports.13 The Panel notes that the Claimant's home state in India is XXXX. However, despite the 2010 and 2013 High Court rulings, at least, Indian authorities remained resistant and continued to routinely deny passports.14 In order to access relief through the courts, applicants must reportedly retain legal counsel at a cost of approximately 100,000 rupees, which is not realistic for the \"vast majority\" of Tibetans.15\n[15] The Panel notes that on February 7, 2014, the Election Commission of India directed state governments to permit Tibetans born in the January 26, 1950 to July 1, 1987 timeframe to vote.16 However, some state governments resisted the Election Commission's order in favour of the Indian Home Ministry's statement that the Election Commission lacked the authority to make such an order.17 In any event, hundreds of Tibetans did register and participate in voting.18\n[16] In a May 2014 article in The Guardian, an associate professor in the Department of Politics and International Relations at the University of Westminster in London indicated that India's Ministry of External Affairs often follows a \"more accommodative approach\" while the Ministry of Home Affairs has taken a skeptical attitude when it comes to Tibetans.19 It was also noted in the same article that individual Tibetans have had to resort to the Indian court system in order to obtain rights and recognition.20\n[17] The Panel has also reviewed the numerous country condition documents submitted by counsel related to the issue of citizenship recognition for Tibetans born in India.21 Some of the documents in the package are relatively dated and are of limited assistance given the unfolding circumstances in India; however, the Panel notes that there are also more recent articles in the 2013-2015 timeframe included in the materials. Essentially, these articles echo the country condition documents already canvassed above by the Panel.\n[18] The various actors within the Indian government appear to hold different views on the matter of citizenship. The judicial branch, on the evidence before the Panel, appears to consistently recognize a right to citizenship for those ethnic Tibetans born in India during the relevant timeframe. The election authorities also appear to recognize the citizenship of such individuals. Within the executive, the Ministry of External Affairs and the Ministry of Home Affairs also appear to take contrary views on the matter. However, what is clear on the country conditions is that there is a rapid evolution in the area. The trend is in the direction of recognition of citizenship for those ethnic Tibetans born between 1950 and 1987, given the series of favourable Indian High Court decisions in 2010, 2013, and 2014, as well as the Election Commission's instruction to state governments to permit voting in February 2014.\nThe Claimant's Actions\n[19] As noted, the Claimant testified that he had never applied for citizenship in India. When asked why he had not done so, he stated that he did not have a birth certificate that confirms his birth in India as he was born at home instead of a hospital; he stated that without a birth certificate, he is ineligible to apply for Indian citizenship.\n[20] The Claimant was asked if he had applied for a birth certificate; he stated that he had attended to the birth registrar and learned that he could not obtain a birth certificate because of his home birth. When asked if he had learned whether he could use alternative documentation to prove his date and place of birth, he stated that he was only told he needed a birth certificate issued by the Indian government and that without such a document, obtaining citizenship would be very difficult.\n[21] The Panel notes that the Claimant's Identity Certificate, issued by India,22 states both his birth date of XXXX XXXX, 1985 and his birth place in XXXX XXXX XXXX, which is in India.23 The Identity Certificate is an international travel document that is akin to a passport.24\n[22] The Claimant states that he had learned about the birth certificate issue through consulting with an Indian lawyer and by speaking to acquaintances, including those who had made previous attempts at securing citizenship. A copy of an opinion letter purportedly from an Indian lawyer was tendered as an exhibit, which states that the Claimant does not have a birth certificate and would, therefore, be denied citizenship.25 The Panel assigns the letter little weight on this issue as the writer does not make reference to any statutory, case law, or other circumstances in supporting the view that a lack of a birth certificate would result in a denial of citizenship. The letter also does not address whether alternative documentation would be accepted, which is a live issue here given that the Claimant possesses Indian government-issued documentation that confirms his date and place of birth. Further, the writer was not presented as a witness to permit the Panel to examine the basis for the opinion. While the Panel appreciates that an in-person appearance would not be practical given the writer's location in XXXX, India, there are alternative methods of attendance, such as by telephone.\nCanadian Jurisprudence\n[23] As noted, there is a division in the jurisprudence applicable to the issue of citizenship recognition. The various decisions are predicated on fact patterns that are similar or essentially identical to the issue faced by the Panel in this decision. A number of Federal Court decisions have found that the acquisition of citizenship in India is not automatic or fully within the control of the applicant.26 In Dolma, Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer stated the following:\nIn my view, an obligation on refugee claimants to show that they applied for and were refused citizenship in a particular country would constitute a narrowing of the refugee definition in the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and section 96 of the IRPA. The proper question is whether, on the evidence before the Board, there is sufficient doubt as to the law, practice, jurisprudence and politics of the potential country of nationality such that the acquisition of citizenship in that country cannot be considered automatic or fully within the control of the applicant, not whether they have tried and been refused.27\n[emphasis added]\n[24] However, other recent Federal Court decisions have taken a contrary, or at least a differently nuanced, view of the issue. In Tashi v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), Madam Justice Mactavish recognized the evolving developments respecting the issue of citizenship for ethnic Tibetans born in India between 1950 and 1987; she went on to find it reasonable for the Refugee Protection Division below to conclude that such individuals do have a right to citizenship in India.28 In Dolker v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), Mr. Justice Hughes stated in obiter as follows:\nNonetheless, it is disturbing that, in a case such as the present, where the Applicant was born in India and peaceably living there, she took absolutely no steps to acquire full Indian citizenship. Certainly, if reasonable steps had been taken and pursued, a failure to secure such citizenship would have gone a long way toward bolstering a claim for refugee protection in Canada.\nWith all due respect to Justice Russell, there is nothing in Williams that says an Applicant need not even apply for citizenship. Williams, at paragraph 22, speaks to whether it is within the control of a person to acquire citizenship. Nothing in that case encourages an Applicant not to make reasonable efforts to secure such citizenship.\nWilful neglect or even neglect to apply for citizenship where a person has a right to apply should not serve as an invitation to try your luck in Canada. There would be good grounds for a certified question if the issue was not obiter. As this discussion is obiter, as I have found that the finding that the Applicant had Indian citizenship was reasonable, I will not certify a question.29\n[emphasis original]\n[25] Finally, in Tretsetsang v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), Mr. Justice Mosley expressly declined to follow the decision in Wanchuk, wherein it was found that the acquisition of Indian citizenship for ethnic Tibetans born during the relevant timeframe was outside of their control because of resistance by the Indian government. Mr. Justice Mosley stated in Tretsetsang as follows:\nI cannot agree with the applicant. Section 96 of the IRPA plainly refers to \"countries of nationality,\" not to countries of nationality where an individual can assert all of his nationality rights without impediment. The Indian legislation is unequivocal that the applicant is a citizen by birth. Two state high courts in India have endorsed that view. The applicant cannot allege that he is not an Indian citizen because some officials might discriminate against him and deny that he is a citizen - no matter how persuasive the evidence of discrimination may be.\nIf the applicant requests citizenship documents in India, such as a passport, and is denied, he can bring a court challenge similar to the ones described in the documentary evidence. In Williams, at para 27, the Court of Appeal held that an applicant must make attempts to acquire citizenship in any safe country where it is available to him. The same would seem to apply to the enforcement of rights to which the applicant is entitled by law, as a citizen, notwithstanding efforts at obstruction by officials. By the applicant's own admission at the RPD, he has never made any attempt to acquire or enforce rights of Indian citizenship. He merely speculates that he will not be able to succeed, despite the legislation and jurisprudence in his favour. In my view, he cannot claim protection in Canada without making any effort to avail himself of Indian nationality, to which he is entitled as a matter of law in that country.\nThis is where I must, with respect, decline to follow Wanchuk. At para 10 of that decision, Justice O'Reilly expressed the view that obtaining Indian citizenship was a \"mere possibility\" for a similarly situated applicant, since it might require litigation. That does not, in my view, amount to the level of the \"intolerable burden\" that Justice Russell found to apply in Hua Ma in light of the one child policy and other considerations in China. Nor is it consistent with the teachings of Williams. Applicants are expected to take reasonable steps to acquire or enforce any citizenship rights which are available to them. A right which is enshrined in legislation and has been enforced by the courts amounts to more than a \"mere possibility.\" There is nothing unreasonable about expecting the applicant to take legal action if his state of nationality attempts to deny his rights.30\n[emphasis added]\n[26] Since the decision in Tretsetsang, a third Indian High Court decision, in Delhi, has issued a decision that recognized the citizenship of an ethnic Tibetan born in India in the 1950 to 1987 timeframe.31\nAssessment\n[27] The Panel agrees with the approach as set out in Tretsetsang. In the Panel's view, the analysis there gives the fullest effect to the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in Williams. It is incumbent upon an individual to attempt to avail oneself of citizenship that is available to him or her. Obstacles and inconvenience, in itself, is insufficient to overcome this obligation.32\n[28] Section 3(1) of the Indian Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003 is clear; the Claimant is a citizen of India by birth as he was born in India on or after January 26, 1950 and prior to July 1, 1987. The objective country condition materials indicate that there has been a shift in circumstances and that the rights conferred by India's citizenship laws are indeed being recognized, despite obstacles posed by some components of the Indian government. This recognition is occurring in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government. In fact, in 2013, the Indian High Court in the Claimant's home state in India, XXXX, enforced the right to citizenship of ethnic Tibetans born in India during the relevant timeframe.33\n[29] While the Panel recognizes that there is no prima facie obligation upon a refugee claimant to first apply for citizenship in a particular country, there is an obligation, as noted, to make an attempt to avail oneself of the citizenship that is available to him or her. Like in Tretsetsang, the Claimant here has taken no active steps toward availing himself of the citizenship conferred upon him by statute. Consultations with acquaintances, and even legal counsel, are not attempts at availing oneself of citizenship. Here, there were no circumstances that prevented the Claimant, a sophisticated individual on his own evidence, from approaching the Indian government in pursuit of securing citizenship. Instead, after peacefully residing in India for approximately thirty years, he travelled to Canada to claim for refugee protection. He simply believes that he will be unsuccessful in obtaining Indian citizenship due to reported obstacles. In any event, as per Tretsetsang, the possibility of litigation is insufficient to take the access to citizenship outside of the Claimant's control.\n[30] The Panel notes that the Claimant indicated that his lack of a birth certificate and an apparent inability to now obtain one prevents him from pursuing citizenship. He testified that he had been told through his consultations that a birth certificate was necessary or he would face difficulties in securing citizenship; for the aforementioned reasons, the opinion letter purportedly from a lawyer was assigned little weight on the birth certificate issue. As noted, the Claimant possesses an Identity Certificate issued by the Indian government that reflects his date and place of birth, and so he possesses documentation wherein the Indian government acknowledges that he was born in India during the relevant timeframe for citizenship. As well, the Claimant did not take active steps to pursue the matter directly with the Indian government. Further, as already canvassed, difficulties in securing citizenship do not invalidate the requirement to pursue it where it is available. In Tretsetsang, the Claimant also did not possess a birth certificate but possessed other government-issued documents that established his date and place of birth.34 The court there found that it was reasonable to find that such circumstances would not \"negate\" Indian citizenship rights.35 The Panel is of the same view in this case and finds accordingly.\n[31] For all of the above reasons, the Panel concludes that India is the appropriate country of reference in this claim. The Claimant's only concern with respect to India is that he fears deportation to China, which was predicated on his views of his status in India. As per the findings here, it is within the Claimant's control to address that status. There were no arguments made in the case at bar respecting whether the Claimant faced a serious possibility of persecution in India. The Panel finds that there is insufficient evidence to establish that the Claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution in India.\nCONCLUSION\n[32] The Panel concludes that the Claimant is not a Convention refugee, pursuant to s. 96 of IRPA, as he does not face a serious possibility of persecution in India. As there is no further evidence that the Claimant would satisfy the risks delineated pursuant to ss. 97(1) of IRPA, which requires a higher standard of risk than s. 96 of IRPA, the Panel further finds that the Claimant is not a person in need of protection in India. Therefore, the claim is rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Robert L. Gibson\"\nRobert L.

The first occurred in XXXX 2014. Mr. XXXX travelled to Canada on a student visa the following January and returned to Ukraine immediately after his course ended. A second assault occurred in XXXX of 2015. He returned to Canada in June 2015. He made a refugee claim in January 2016.\n[4] In addition to his Basis of Claim form, Mr. XXXX presented a package of documents including education and medical documents, call up notices and supporting letters from his mother and his boyfriend, XXXX XXXX.3 He later submitted an affidavit from his aunt, XXXX XXXX,4 documents confirming that he had recently joined the 519 Community Center,5 and an amendment to his Basis of Claim narrative.6\n[5] Mr. XXXX testified at the hearing, held over the course of two sittings on 29 March 2016 and 28 April 2016. Before the second sitting, he submitted a further package of documents including two photographs and a printout of Skype screenshots showing calls with XXXX XXXX.7 The matter of military service had only been raised in the Basis of Claim narrative as being related to the claimant's sexual orientation. To confirm this, at the beginning of the first sitting of the hearing the Panel asked the claimant if he had any other objection to military service. He replied that he did not.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] The Panel finds that the claimant is not a Convention refugee nor is he a person in need of protection. The determinative issue is credibility.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[7] When the claimant first made his refugee claim, he presented his passport, issued by the government of Ukraine in his name. A copy of the passport was included with the package of documents sent to the Refugee Protection Division by Citizenship and Immigration Canada.8 The Panel finds that this is sufficient to establish his identity as required under s. 106 of IRPA.\nCredibility\n[8] The country condition documents, both those included in the Refugee Protection Division's index and counsel's package, establish that sexual minorities face more than a mere possibility of persecution in Ukraine including discrimination in many aspects of life and assaults due to their sexual orientation.9 The documents also report that the state does not protect persons facing this risk and that state agents are sometimes the source of harassment. While there may be some variations between, for example, attitudes in rural locations as opposed to in more urban locations, the risk of persecution due to homophobia exists throughout the country. As a result, the only issue raised at the hearing was the credibility of the claimant's alleged sexual orientation.\n[9] While statements given under oath are presumed to be true, that presumption can be rebutted by contradictions or inconsistencies in the evidence.10 In reviewing the evidence the Panel \"may also conclude that a claimant's evidence is implausible, or improbable, or dubious, or untenable, or unreliable, or absurd, or unconvincing.\"11 The Panel \"also is entitled, in assessing credibility, to rely on criteria such as rationality and common sense.\"12 The claimant has the onus of producing evidence to prove the facts alleged. The test to be used in assessing the credibility of that evidence is balance of probabilities.\n519 Community Centre\n[10] The evidence in support of the claimant's alleged sexual orientation included much to which the Panel could reasonably accord little or no weight. The main example of this is all the documentation presented to show that the claimant had joined the 519 Community Centre LGBT Refugee Support Group. This included his membership card (which was sent to his lawyer rather than the home where he had lived at all times while in Canada since first coming here in January 2015),13 a membership letter and an orientation record,14 and proof that he had had attended there, as confirmed by a photograph showing him with two persons, whom he did not know, taken at the Centre.15 The Panel notes that the 519 Community Centre is a public facility open to anyone who wishes to join, for whatever reason. Merely having a membership card, in and of itself, is not an indication of the cardholder's sexual orientation. The reasons for joining and the activities the claimant participates in are more reliable indicators. At the first sitting the claimant testified that he had he had found out about the 519 Community Centre on the internet in November 2015 because he was looking to socialize more. The Panel asked how he had searched the internet to find the 519 Community Centre. He replied that it was hard to say. At the next sitting, in response to the same question from his counsel, he testified that he had been confused when asked by the Panel but now he thinks he remembers that he had searched \"gay lesbian community in Toronto.\" The Panel notes that he gave no indication that he was confused by the question when asked by the Panel. The claimant did provide some detail about a meeting for refugee claimants at the 519 Community Centre he had attended a few days before the first sitting of his hearing. The Panel then asked about the people he socialized with. The claimant was unable to provide anything more than vague information about the people he claimed to have met there and socialized with. He testified that he did not even know if they were refugee claimants. Considering that he was at the 519 Community Centre for a meeting of LGBT refugee claimants new to Canada, it seems highly implausible that the question of immigration matters would not come up. The Panel then asked if he had asked any of the people he socialized with at the community centre to testify at his hearing, and he replied that he never told them about it and that this was his right since it is a private matter. When his counsel asked him the same question at the next sitting, he replied that he would not want them to know, would not want to share this. This is inconsistent with his testimony that he had joined to meet other members of the LGBT community and socialized at a support group for LGBT refugee claimants. Considering all the above, the Panel gives no weight to any of the evidence regarding the 519 Community Centre. The Panel also finds that the claimant was not truthful when he testified about the people he met there. It is more likely that any involvement with the Centre by the claimant was primarily to create evidence to present in this claim and is not an indication of his sexual orientation.\nMs XXXX affidavit\n[11] Regarding the affidavit from the claimant's aunt, XXXX XXXX, again, questions arise which affect the weight to be given to the document.16 In paragraph 4 of the affidavit Ms XXXX states that because of the problems the claimant was having in Ukraine his mother had asked for her help to find a way for the claimant to stay in Canada. In the same paragraph she also states that the claimant's mother told her not to talk with his father about the claimant's sexual orientation. According to the claimant's narrative his father knew about his sexual orientation, and arranged for him to come to Canada, after he had been convinced of this solution by Ms XXXX XXXX17 In his testimony at the first sitting, he also testified that his aunt had insisted that he come to Canada. This presents what appears to be an inconsistency between the affidavit and other sources of evidence. The Panel asked the claimant if he could explain and he could not. The Panel asked the claimant why his aunt was not here to support him and he replied that she had a medical appointment on the day of the hearing. The Panel then asked if any efforts to have her appear some other day and he replied that she had submitted her evidence. When the hearing resumed a month later counsel informed the Panel that Ms XXXX was in Ukraine. This leaves the Panel's concerns regarding Ms XXXX affidavit unanswered. The Refugee Protection Division often hears evidence, usually by telephone, from people who cannot be physically present, as experienced counsel well knows. The failure to arrange to have Ms XXXX address concerns about apparent inconsistencies between her affidavit and other evidence and also to provide details regarding parts of her affidavit which lacked detail, such as her reported discussions with the claimant about his sexual orientation, causes the Panel to give less weight to this affidavit than may have otherwise been accorded and therefore the affidavit adds little to the Panel's analysis of the credibility of the claimant's allegations.\nLetter from claimant's mother\n[12] The letter from the claimant's mother is brief and adds nothing by way of detail - it states that she recalls he was beaten in XXXX and makes a reference to \"what kind of orientation you have\" - and therefore adds nothing to the credibility assessment. The Panel considers the claimant's testimony on his parents' reaction to hearing about him and XXXX to be a much stronger indication of the credibility of the allegations. In his narrative, The claimant states that after the assault in XXXX, his parents were informed about his relationship with XXXX. He reports that they were shocked and his father called him names.18 When the Panel asked at the first sitting who had told his parents, the claimant replied that he did not know but suspected the police officer he and XXXX had reported the assault to. The Panel then confirmed that he had not asked his parents how they found out and they had not told him. He stated that he had more serious problems at the time and then proceeded to recite the paragraph in his narrative on this event. The Panel then asked what was said in this conversation with his parents and the claimant first said only \"my mother's reaction.\" The Panel asked a second time and the answer was limited to \"they said that I.\" The Panel then asked a third time and, to ensure there was no ambiguity in the question, included \"who said what.\" The claimant answered that he could only recall that his father called him names. The Panel then asked if he could recall anything specific and he replied that it was a long conversation. Considering that this conversation was relatively recent, and it was the first time his sexuality was discussed with his parents, the Panel does not consider it reasonable that the claimant can provide no information about it than beyond reciting what was already stated in his narrative.\nRelationship with XXXX\n[13] Mr. XXXX alleged that he was in a relationship with XXXX from XXXX 2014. In his narrative, he states \"In XXXX 2014, however, suddenly I met XXXX XXXX, who worked as a bartender in a nightclub in XXXX XXXX XXXX.\"19 At the hearing the Panel asked the claimant about meeting XXXX. He testified that he noticed XXXX at a night club and talked to him and liked him but didn't get acquainted and that then, in the middle of XXXX he approached XXXX and started talking, introduced himself and suggested they meet the next week. The claimant then proceeded to recite the balance of the same paragraph in his narrative.20 He then went on to recite the following paragraph of his narrative regarding problems XXXX was having with his neighbours.21 The Panel clarified the claimant's testimony on interaction with XXXX and he testified that they had been talking with each other over the course of three months before XXXX 2014. The Panel asked him to explain why his narrative described the relationship as starting when they \"suddenly\" met in XXXX when he was now testifying they had been talking for three months before that date. The claimant replied that it must be a mistake by the interpreter. The Panel notes that if this had simply been a mistranslation, it had never been corrected before the matter was raised by the Panel at the hearing even though another paragraph of his narrative was amended to add a detail.22 The Panel does not accept this explanation for the inconsistency. Considering that this relationship is alleged to be recent and to be the only same sex relationship the claimant has been involved in, his inconsistency regarding how it began is significant and impugns his credibility on the matter of the existence and nature of this relationship. Reciting paragraphs of the narrative while being unable to provide little beyond what was in the narrative is an indication that the events in the story are not something the claimant experienced but rather that the story itself was fabricated for the purposes of this claim.\n[14] To corroborate the relationship with XXXX, the claimant submitted an email from XXXX.23 It is brief with no detail. It states, in part, that the email is being sent \"as your lawyer requested,\" that the writer \"is always ready to help you in any way I can,\" that \"It is very difficult to remember those beatings in XXXX\" and that he is very glad that the claimant \"can freely feel yourself as a bisexual.\" He finishes with an expression of hope they will meet and be together. The email does not make any direct mention of the alleged relationship between him and the claimant, although one could be inferred. If the relationship was as alleged and the events alleged had occurred it would be reasonable for the letter to provide more detail. XXXX was not called as a witness (which, as noted, previously, could have been done by telephone) so no clarification or further detail was available to the Panel at the hearing.\n[15] After the first sitting of the hearing, the claimant submitted a printout of a call log showing that he was in regular contact, via Skype, with XXXX since XXXX of this year.24 While this document does confirm contact, the Panel notes that every page of the log shows the same sequence of calls to the same persons, in the same order only on different dates. This only came to the Panel's attention after the hearing and, therefore, the claimant was not asked to comment on this fact. There may be a reasonable explanation. What is clear, however, is that, assuming this log is genuine, it shows that the claimant was having the same frequent contact with several people; therefore, the Panel can give little weight to this log as an indication that the relationship between the claimant and XXXX was as alleged.\n[16] Considering the inconsistency in the claimant's evidence regarding the start of the relationship; the limited information contained in, and therefore the limited value to be ascribed to, the email from XXXX; and limited value of the call log, the Panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has not met his onus of showing that he was in a same sex relationship with XXXX as alleged in the claim.\nRe-availment and XXXX 2015 incident\n[17] The claimant returned to Ukraine in March 2015 immediately after his English course in Canada finished. The Panel asked him why he returned to Ukraine, considering what he reported having experienced in the previous year. He answered that he missed XXXX. As stated above, the Panel finds that the relationship between the claimant and XXXX was not as alleged, therefore, this explanation for returning to Ukraine is not reasonable. This re-availment is not consistent with a fear of persecution.\n[18] Counsel submitted that even if the re-availmant to Ukraine were not found to be reasonable, the incident of XXXX 2015 gives rise to a new basis of claim. The allegation made in the narrative that the claimant and XXXX were assaulted in XXXX 2015 was corroborated by a medical extract issued in XXXX 2015.25 There are two concerns regarding the document itself. The claimant testified that while this document had been at his parents' house, it was not sent with the other supporting documents but was received later. No explanation was given for this. The claimant said he did not know. The second concern arose when the Panel asked the claimant if it had been issued for any particular reason. The claimant replied that in Ukraine these documents are issued as a matter of course when someone is injured. The Panel then asked if one was issued for the XXXX 2014 incident. One was not.\n[19] At the first sitting of the hearing, the claimant submitted an amendment to his narrative.26 The amendment added an additional detail to his recounting of the XXXX 2015 incident, i.e. that he had fallen unconscious briefly. The Panel asked why this detail had been added. The claimant said that he thought it was important to add it. At the next sitting his counsel followed up on this answer. He replied that he had added it after discussion with counsel. Counsel then suggested that he had added it on the \"advice of counsel\" and the claimant agreed with this answer. This does not, in any substantive way, answer the question asked. The Panel does note, however, that this detail was contained in the late arriving medical document. In the absence of a reasonable explanation for the amendment, the Panel finds it was most likely added to bring the narrative into accordance with the newly arrived medical document. Considering the lack of explanation for why the document was received late even though it was allegedly available last June; or why it had been issued, which is inconsistent with the document presented to corroborate the previous year's incident; and taking into account country condition documents which state that fraudulent documents are easily available in Ukraine,27 the Panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that this document is fraudulent, fabricated for the purposes of this claim and that the incident it was presented to corroborate did not occur. Therefore, the explanation for re-availling to Ukraine in March 2015 and returning to Canada several months later is not credible and the credibility of the overall claim is impugned.\nCONCLUSION\n[20] Considering the many credibility findings on matters related to the core issue in this claim, the Panel does not accept as credible the claimant's statement that he is bisexual and therefore the claim is rejected. The credibility assessment also applies to any claim under s 97(1) of IRPA.\n[21] Taking into account the credibility findings on the claimant's testimony and on the documents presented in support of the claim, the Panel also finds, on a balance of probabilities, that this claim was invented as a means to gain access to Canada and is, in accordance with s 107.1 of IRPA, a manifestly unfounded claim.\n(signed)\n\"D.

Consequently, the Principal Claimant and the Minor Claimants are claiming refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The Principal Claimant alleges that she fears returning to China as a result of the Family Planning Office (FPO) requiring her to be fined and sterilized as a result of her alleged breach of the China's former one-child policy.\n[3] The Principal Claimant alleges having had her second son in 2012, in violation of the one-child policy at the time of his birth. She alleges that she managed to keep this information hidden from Chinese authorities until fall of 2015.\n[4] The Principal Claimant alleges that in November 2015 she told the Family Planning authorities about her second child in an attempt to have him registered once she found out that the country's one-child policy was changing. In consequence, the Principal Claimant alleges that she was issued a fine by the FPO and was ordered to undergo sterilization.\n[5] The Principal Claimant alleges that she and Minor Claimants left China upon learning of the FPO's demand that she be sterilized. From there, the Claimant alleges that she hired a smuggler who assisted her in making arrangements to come to Canada.\nGENDER GUIDELINES\n[6] In assessing this claim, the Panel was cognizant of the Chairperson's Gender Guidelines.2 The Panel is aware that cross-cultural misunderstandings may occur when gender-based claims are assessed by the Board. As such, throughout the hearing and while making a decision on these claims, the Panel remained conscientious of the impact that social, cultural, traditional and religious norms can have on the testimony of those alleging fear of gender-based persecution.\nDETERMINATION\n[7] The Panel finds that the Claimants have not demonstrated that there is a serious possibility of persecution in China, nor that they are persons in need of protection. As such, the Panel dismisses these claims for the reasons that follow.\nISSUES\n[8] The issues to be considered by the Panel are the following:\n1. Have the Claimants proven their identity?\n2. Are the Claimants credible?\n3. Have the Claimants proven there is a serious possibility of persecution, or a risk to their lives, or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or torture if they are returned to China?\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[9] The Panel is willing to accept, on a balance of probabilities, that the Principal Claimant's identity has been proven as a result of having examined a certified copy of her Resident Identity Card (RIC),3 which was seized upon claiming for refugee protection.4\n[10] The Panel is also satisfied regarding the identity of the Minor Claimants as a result of the certified true copy of their birth certificates on file, the original of which were seized by Citizenship and Immigration Canada.5\nWere the Claimants credible?\nYoungest Claimant's birth outside one-child policy\n[11] In this instance, the claims revolve around the youngest Claimant's status as a \"black child,\" or as a child born to the Principal Claimant outside of the one-child policy. The Principal Claimant alleges that the authorities did not know about her second-born child until she informed them of him in late XXXX 2015, when she sought to have him registered.\n[12] However, Exhibit 1 of the Claimants' file before the Panel includes a certified copy of both Minor Claimants' birth certificates. The Principal Claimant alleges that these are genuine documents and that she obtained these birth certificates within a few days of each child's respective birth.\n[13] When asked why she alleged that Chinese authorities had no knowledge of the birth of the youngest Claimant when he was has a genuine state-issued birth certificate, the Principal Claimant stated that she bribed a friend who worked at the hospital to keep information of his birth away from the family planning authorities. However, when asked, the Principal Claimant had no additional information regarding how the hospital employee kept the FPO from finding out about the birth of her second child.\n[14] Furthermore, when asked by the Panel how she was certain that the authorities did not find out about the birth of her youngest son, given that his birth certificate had clearly gone through government channels and stamped by the Ministry of Health, the Principal Claimant stated that she paid her contact at the hospital to ensure that the family planning officials did not find out about the Minor Claimant's birth. Again, the Principal Claimant has no explanation as to how this was accomplished.\n[15] The Panel draws a negative finding of credibility against the Claimants and their allegations as a result of the existence of the youngest Claimant's birth certificate on file, issued days after his birth in 2012.6\n[16] According to the birth certificates before the Panel and the testimony of the Principal Claimant, she gave birth to both of her sons at the same hospital within their district in China. When asked how she obtained the youngest Claimant's birth certificate, the Principal Claimant stated that it was given to her by hospital staff. When asked why she obtained a birth certificate for her son if he was born outside the one-child policy, the Claimant stated that it would be necessary if she was going to register the child. When asked if she was planning on registering him, she stated that she was considering registering him at a later date.\n[17] As noted, the Minor Claimant's birth certificate contains a seal of the Chinese Health Department. Consequently, it is clear that the Chinese authorities were aware of the Minor Claimant's birth around about the time he was born. As such, the remaining question before the Panel in this instance is whether to accept the Principal Claimant's explanation of bribing a hospital staff member to ensure that news of her son's birth did not reach the Family Planning office, or whether the minor Claimant has a legitimate birth certificate because he was not born outside of the one-child policy as alleged by the Principal Claimant.\n[18] In weighing the documentary evidence before it with the Principal Claimant's testimony, the Panel has several concerns with the explanation put forward by the Claimant to explain the existence of her child's state-issued birth certificate while simultaneously alleging that his birth was unknown to officials.\n[19] While it clear that corruption is an issue in China, the Claimant's explanation of being able to bribe one employee in order to ensure that the FPO did not learn of her child`s birth ignores the fact that the Principal Claimant's file - including medial history - would have been handled by many staff members and doctors at the hospital. While not determinative in this instance, it seems unlikely that providing a bribe to one individual could guarantee that the youngest claimant's birth remained a secret from the FPO.\nLack of Subjective Fear\n[20] Even more than its concern regarding the implausibility of this bribe, however, the Panel has concern regarding the Claimant's decision to have her second son - allegedly in breach of the one-child policy - at the same hospital in which she gave birth to her first child.\n[21] The Principal Claimant also spoke of going into hiding while pregnant because she was afraid of giving birth to her youngest outside of the one-child policy. However, the Panel finds it inconsistent that the Principal Claimant would take such drastic precautions during her pregnancy to avoid having her pregnancy discovered - such as going to hide throughout her pregnancy - only to face a serious risk of having her pregnancy discovered upon returning to give birth at the same hospital at which she had her first child.\n[22] The Panel finds that this course of action is not in-line with the Claimant's alleged fear for her son and her family as a result of having a second child outside of the one-child policy and her actions and choices regarding the location of her youngest child's birth are suggestive of a lack of subjective fear.\n[23] Furthermore, the Panel finds that the Principal Claimant once again acted in a fashion that demonstrated little subjective fear when she approached the police - and subsequently the family planning officials - seeking to have her son registered in late XXXX after hearing that the one-child policy was changing. The Panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the Principal Claimant would not take positive action towards this end if there was a possibility of endangering her and her children. While the Claimant alleges that she believed having two children was legal at that point, the Panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, that the Claimant would not reasonably take such an action before assuring herself that doing so would not place her or her sons in harm's way. Once again, such actions seem contrary to the Claimant's allegations of taking precautions surrounding her son's birth and his alleged status as a \"black\" child.\n[24] As such, based on the evidence before the Panel, especially the birth certificate of the youngest Minor Claimant, as well as the internally-inconsistent actions of the Principal Claimant as regards alleged subjective fear. The Panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the youngest Minor Claimant was not born outside of the one-child policy as alleged by the Principal Claimant, but rather was born within an exception to the policy. As such, the Panel finds that the Principal Claimant is not wanted by family planning officials in China as she has alleged. The Panel draws a negative finding of credibility with regard to the Principal Claimant as well as her allegations of the youngest Minor Claimant being born outside of the one-child policy in China.\nFPO Letter\n[25] Credibility problems also arise regarding the Claimants' allegations as a result of the letter that the Principal Claimant alleges she received from the FPO after reporting the youngest Minor Claimant's birth to the family planning officials in 2015. The Principal Claimant entered this letter into evidence before the Panel.7 The letter states that the Principal Claimant must pay a fine of 60,000 RMB and requires that she undergo sterilization within three months and to provide evidence thereof to the authorities.8\n[26] Family planning laws in China are established at the national level, but in terms of regulation and enforcement, the implementation of these laws varies by province and by locality, in terms of regulations and enforcement.9 The Panel notes that forced abortions and sterilizations are banned at the national level in China.10 Moreover, the Regulations of Guangdong Province on Population and Family Planning (\"Guangdong Regulations\") do not set out mandatory abortion or sterilization procedures for families that have out-of-plan births.11\n[27] Nevertheless, the country documentation before the Panel suggests that some mandatory sterilization and abortion procedures were carried out in Guangdong province as recently as 2009 and 2010,12 and possibly into 2012.13 The Panel is unaware of any documentary evidence before it indicating any such occurrences since 2012.\n[28] The Guangdong Regulations state that those having children outside of the family planning policy will be charged social compensation fees which can reach 10 times a person's annual disposable income.14 According to the US DOS report, those who had an unapproved child faced such measures as social compensation fees, job loss or demotion, or loss of promotion opportunities.15\n[29] The Panel further finds that there is insufficient evidence before it to establish that the Principal Claimant would be subject to forced sterilization if she returns to China. The Panel notes that the documentary evidence before the Panel states that in cases of families that already had two children, one parent was often pressured to undergo sterilization.16 However, the Panel notes that the alleged pressure to undergo sterilization referred to in the documentary evidence is distinguishable from receiving a written order demanding sterilization and proof thereof, as is being alleged by the Principal Claimant.\n[30] Furthermore, the Panel notes that the family planning authorities are aware that the Principal Claimant's husband died in 2014. The Principal Claimant alleges that she told the family planning authorities about the loss of her husband in an attempt to avoid sterilization, but was allegedly told she had to undergo sterilization nonetheless as a punitive measure for breaching the one-child policy.\n[31] While the Panel acknowledges the mixed evidence regarding family planning rules and practices in China, the Panel nonetheless finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the Principal Claimant's violation of family planning rules as alleged could result in the imposition of social compensation fees, pursuant to the Guangdong Regulations.17 The Federal Court has found that the imposition of such fees is not, in and of itself, persecutory.18 Furthermore, the Panel notes that the Guangdong Regulations do not indicate that penalties rising to the level of persecution under the Convention would be imposed for the non-payment of social compensation fees, if the Principal Claimant were unable to pay.19\n[32] Furthermore, due to the illegality of forced sterilization in China, the Panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, even if the Principal Claimant were pressured to undergo sterilization as stated in the US DOS report, the country documentation does not support the Principal Claimant's allegations that she received a written order requiring sterilization and demanding proof within three months. This is especially so where the Principal Claimant's husband has previously passed away, and the authorities have been made aware of this fact.\n[33] Furthermore, the Panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, given the illegality of forced sterilization in China, government authorities - even if making such a demand - would likely not make such a demand in writing as alleged by the Principal Claimant, for fear of reprisal; this is especially so since China's family planning policies have been relaxing as of late, to the point that the one-child policy no longer exists as of early 2016. Indeed, there is not adequate evidence before the Panel to demonstrate that the she would be punished retroactively for the birth of her child outside of the one-child policy. However, based on the country documentation before it, the Panel finds that, on the balance of probabilities, if the Claimant were to be punished for retroactively breaching the one-child policy, it would more likely than not result in a fine, or social compensation fees.\n[34] When considering the Principal Claimant's allegations of potential persecution - including sterilization - in the context of the country documentation before it, the Panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the Claimant has not been ordered to undergo a sterilization procedure as alleged. Consequently, the Panel makes a negative finding regarding the Principal Claimant's credibility and the credibility of her allegations on this basis.\nPassport and Boarding Passes\n[35] The Principal Claimant was unable to provide any proof of the Claimants' travels to Canada, testifying that they used fake Hong Kong passports to enter Canada. The Principal Claimant states that these passports - as well as all boarding passes - were kept by the smuggler she hired to help her leave China.\n[36] When asked for any other proof of travel, including any luggage tags, the Principal Claimant stated she had only one checked bag, for which she had thrown out the luggage tag.\n[37] Mr. Justice Nadon (as he then was), in Elazi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2000 CanLII 14891 (FC), stated the following about the importance of the passport and air ticket in a refugee claim:\nI take this opportunity to add that it is entirely reasonable for the Refugee Division to attach great importance to a claimant's passport and his air ticket. In my opinion, these documents are essential to establish the claimant's identity and his journey to come to Canada. Unless it can be assumed that a refugee status claimant is actually a refugee, it seems unreasonable to me to ignore the loss of these documents without a valid explanation. In my view, it is too easy for a claimant to simply state that he has lost these documents or the facilitator has taken them...20\n[38] Mr. Justice Nadon further noted that :\nMinimizing the importance of the passport and air ticket as documents to be produced or ignoring their non-submission for all sorts of reasons in my opinion only serves to encourage all those whose only purpose is to take advantage of a system which is intended solely to enable genuine refugees to come to Canada.21\n[39] As noted in Elazi, above, corroborative evidence of a Claimant's travel - such as passports or boarding passes - is important to establish the Claimants' journey to Canada. The lack of this documentation before the Panel means that there is no corroborative evidence regarding the Claimants' journey in this instance.\n[40] The Panel draws a negative inference regarding the Claimants' credibility as a result of their inability to provide the Panel with any corroborating evidence regarding their journey from China to Hong Kong to Canada.\nConclusion on Credibility\n[41] According to Dan-Ash v. Minister of Employment and Immigration (1988), 93 N.R. 33 (F.C.A.), contradictions or discrepancies in the evidence of a refugee Claimant is a well-accepted basis for a finding of lack of credibility. As noted by Mr. Justice Hugessen at page 35:\n\"unless one is prepared to postulate (and accept) unlimited credulity on the part of the Board, there must come a point at which a witness's contradictions will move even the most generous trier of fact to reject his evidence [Emphasis added].\"22\n[42] The Federal Court of Appeal held in Sheikh v. Canada that a general finding of a lack of credibility on the part of the Claimant may conceivably extend to all the relevant information emanating from his or her testimony.23 In this case, the Panel has found the Claimants' allegations and testimony contains several credibility concerns that lead the Panel to make a finding of a lack of credibility against the Claimants and their allegations. As the Panel finds the Claimants' allegations lack credibility for the reasons noted above, by extension, the Panel finds that it cannot give weight to the documents provided by the Claimants to corroborate their claim, including (but not limited to the alleged notice of penalty and sterilization.24\n[43] Furthermore, the Panel's concerns with regard to these documents are even greater in a context where falsified documents are prevalent in China. For instance, a criminal justice professor from Xavier University specializing in Chinese policing noted in correspondence with the Immigration and Refugee Board's Research Directorate that \"[t]here is little question that fraud of all kind[s], including ID fraud, is a major problem in China.\"25 An official at the Canadian embassy in Beijing has noted that there are \"consistent reports\" of document fraud in China.26 Furthermore, the same official has noted that the province of Guangdong is \"considered particularly high-risk for fraudulent documents.\"27\n[44] The Panel notes that the proof before it of the Claimants' alleged breach of the one-child policy in China consists of testimony and documentary evidence that the Panel has discounted on the grounds of credibility concerns as explained above. As such, the Panel finds that the Claimants have not demonstrated a subjective well-founded fear of persecution upon their return to China.\nMinor Claimants\n[45] In this instance, the Minor Claimants' claims - and alleged \"black\" status on the youngest claimant - are tied to the Principal Claimant's alleged breach of the one-child policy. As the Panel has determined that the Principal Claimant has not proven the breach of the one-child policy as alleged, that Panel finds that the Minor claimants would not suffer any consequences as a result of this alleged breach upon their return to China.\nCONCLUSION\n[46] Having found that the Principal Claimant has not demonstrated that she breached the one-child policy in China or that she is being pursued by the FPO as alleged, the Panel finds that the Principal Claimant and the Minor Claimants can return to the People's Republic of China without facing a serious possibility of persecution pursuant to section 96 of IRPA, or a risk to their lives, or of torture, or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment pursuant to section 97 of the IRPA. Consequently, these claims are rejected.\n[47]\nThe Panel has made several negative findings regarding the Principal Claimant's testimony and her allegations in this case. Furthermore, there are no reliable documents before the Panel to corroborate the events that the Principal Claimant alleges to have occurred. As previously noted, the Minor Claimants' claims are dependent upon the allegations alleged in the Principal Claimant's claim. As such, the Panel finds that there is no credible or trustworthy evidence upon which the Panel could have come to a favourable decision. Consequently, the Panel finds that these claims have no credible basis pursuant to ss. 107(2) of IRPA.\n(signed)\n\"Alison J. Kennedy\"\nAlison J.

He travelled to Canada on an Egyptian-issued travel document for Palestinian refugees, which gives him no right to enter or live in Egypt without specific permission in the form of a visa.\n[4] The claimant has eight years of primary school and four years of secondary school education. He worked in a XXXX XXXX in Kuwait City, arranging flights, accommodation and performing the other usual services of a XXXX XXXX.\n[5] A XXXX of the royal family - the XXXX of the Crown Prince of Kuwait - retained his services to assist in the planning and execution of a holiday with several girlfriends to London. He provided the services promptly, efficiently and above the call of duty in XXXX 2014. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was so grateful that she gave him a bottle of scent on her return from her trip. Over the next year, XXXX and the claimant became close after she continued to use his services and after they spoke to and texted one another, such that by XXXX 2015, the two started to see each other socially. They went to places the royal family would not likely see them, as her family would be very angry if they discovered she was seeing a Palestinian who is not a Kuwaiti.\n[6] The intimate relationship continued until XXXX 2016, when suddenly and without explanation, the claimant lost contact with XXXX. On or about XXXX XXXX, 2016, an unidentified male called the claimant at work, and asked for him by name. After the claimant identified himself, the caller told him as he had been seeing the caller's sister, he should consider himself dead. As he was seeing a member of the royal family, he believed that the caller would be able to carry out the threat, and also that the claimant would have no recourse to the authorities, especially as a stateless Palestinian.\n[7] The claimant went into hiding with his friend, XXXX. The claimant's sister, XXXX, advised him that XXXX had told her that he should go into hiding as XXXX brother, XXXX, would kill the claimant. He also learned that XXXX had looked for the claimant at his place of work and at his mother's home, putting the latter in great fear.\n[8] The claimant already had a visa to visit the United States of America (US) from his work, so he purchased a ticket to the US, and flew from Kuwait via Turkey, to the US arriving there on XXXX XXXX, 2016. He did not have a problem in leaving Kuwait as there were not any notices regarding his departure. After landing, the claimant travelled to Buffalo, where he waited for his interview by the Canadian authorities, on or about April 6, 2016. The claimant entered Canada as an exception to the Safe Third Country Agreement, as he has a nephew here.\nDECISION\n[9] I determine that the claimant is not a Convention refugee, as his story is not credible. I also determine that should the claimant return to his home country of Kuwait, he would not be subjected personally to a risk to life or to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. Further, on substantial grounds, there is no danger of torture to the claimant.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[10] On a balance of probabilities, I find5 that the claimant established he is a stateless Palestinian whose only country of habitual residence is Kuwait.\n[11] The claimant, although ethnically Palestinian, has never lived in Palestine. Although he carries an Egyptian travel document, I concur with Claimant's Counsel that this document gives him no citizenship or resident rights in Egypt.\nBackground Information\n[12] Claimant's Counsel provided an article on the Kuwaiti ruler, Sheikh Sabah IV Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, who is the 15th Ruler, 5th Emir and the Commander of the Military, of Kuwait. The article states that he was sworn in on January 29, 2006 after confirmation by the National Assembly of Kuwait. According to the article he is the fourth son of Sheikh Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah6 and the heir apparent is his brother, Nawaf Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah.\n[13] The rules of succession for the Emir state that the successor must be a:\n[h]ereditary Amirate, the succession to which is limited to the descendants of Mubarak Al-Sabah. The Heir Apparent must be designated by the reigning Amir within one year, at the latest, from the date of his accession. The nomination must be approved by a majority of members of the National Assembly, sitting in special session. Nomination as Heir Apparent is limited to persons who are thirty years of age on the date of his proclamation (AD), of sound mind, and the legitimate son of Muslim parents.7\n[14] The history of the ruling family goes back several centuries:\nThe ruling family of Kuwait is of ancient lineage, being ruling tribal Shaikhs for upwards of five centuries. Like their neighbours, the Saudis of Arabia, and Al-Khalifa of Bahrain, the Sabah are a section of the 'Aniza tribe. The Saudis belonging to the Masalikh sept, the Khalifa and Sabah to the 'Amartat'. ... 1938 proved a momentous year, oil was struck for the first time. By 1959 the trickle of income from oil had risen to an estimated \u00a3150 million p.a., providing an income beyond the wildest dreams of any Kuwaiti. ... Ever increasing oil income prompted enormous development and social improvement. However, external pressures began to press upon Kuwait, particularly after the fall of the Shah of Iran in 1979. Saddam Hussain of Iraq began to flex his muscles I the region, forcing Kuwait to abandon its non-aligned policy. Repeated claims to Kuwait, nascent since the days of King Ghazi, now became more vociferous and belligerent. He invaded in 1990, expecting world opinion to ignore his aggression. The Iraqi invaders were repulsed by a coalition of countries led by the US and Saudi Arabia in 1991.8\n[15] The heir apparent is also known as the Crown Prince.9 His children and grandchildren are princes and princesses. The Al-Sabah family rules Kuwait, which has a low freedom index.10 According to the US Department of State,\nKuwait is a constitutional, hereditary emirate ruled by the Al-Sabah family. While there is also a democratically elected parliament, the emir holds ultimate authority. The 2013 parliamentary elections were generally free and fair, although some opposition groups boycotted them. Civilian authorities maintained effective control over the security forces. ...\nOther human rights problems included reports of security force members' abusing prisoners and protesters, most with impunity; arbitrary arrest and extrajudicial deportation of foreign workers; limitations on freedoms of press, association, worker rights, and religion; and restrictions on freedom of movement for certain groups, including foreign workers and bidoon. Women, as well as bidoon and other noncitizens, faced social and legal discrimination. Domestic violence against women remained persistent, as did violence against domestic workers, all of whom were noncitizens.11\nIncidents of so-called \"honour killings\" do occur in Kuwait. Under Article 153 of the Penal Code, honour killing is criminalised, but with significantly lower penalties than would otherwise be the case for murder. If the (male) perpetrator kills his daughter, wife, sister or mother in a fit of rage, having discovered that she had committed an act of zina (unlawful sexual relations), the maximum penalty is three years' imprisonment or a fine. By contrast, murder is otherwise punishable by the death penalty or life imprisonment.12 [citations omitted]\nNexus and Issues\n[16] Nexus was identified as an issue at the outset of the hearing. Claimant's Counsel submitted that the claimant has a nexus because he is of Palestinian nationality. However, I find the claimant's alleged fear in this case is not linked to race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or a recognized membership in a particular social group. The claimant's fear of XXXX is clearly not related to a Convention refugee reason or ground, but is related to potential criminality, as XXXX allegedly threatened to kill the claimant for \"seeing\" his sister.\n[17] The fact that the claimant is Palestinian is not why the claimant was allegedly being sought by XXXX, rather it is because the claimant had been intimate with XXXX sister and sullied the family's honour. Unlike women who fear gender-related violence, such as his alleged girlfriend, the claimant, as a male, is not a member of any recognized social group under section 96 of the IRPA.\n[18] I take note of the decisions by a different panel of this Division who rejected the claims of two of the claimant's brothers, which came down to being stateless Palestinians in Kuwait. These decisions are found in the material provided by the Minister.13\n[19] Criminal threats and actions have been found in many Federal Court decisions to have no nexus to the Refugee Convention.14 This is the reason I have determined that the claimant is not a Convention refugee, under section 96 of the IRPA.\n[20] The balance of these reasons is an analysis of the claim under section 97 of the IRPA. The issue in this claim is that the claimant lacks credibility, on a balance of probabilities.\nCredibility\n[21] In order to be determined to be a person in need of protection, the evidence must establish that the claimant's removal to Kuwait, his only country of habitual residence, would subject him, personally, either, (a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or (b) to a risk to life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\n[22] In assessing the credibility of the evidence presented by the claimant, I am mindful of the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Maldonado15 wherein the Court stated, in part, that \"when a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there be reason to doubt their truthfulness\".\n[23] The evaluation of the credibility and probative value of the evidence must be made with regard to the totality of the evidence, including what is generally known about the conditions and laws of the country the claimant is from,16 as well as the experiences of similarly situated persons in that country.17 In assessing the claimant's credibility, I have also considered the decision in Orelien18 wherein the Federal Court of Appeal held that it is necessary for the claimant to establish that his or her evidence is probably credible or trustworthy, not just possibly so. I took into consideration the various factors that could affect the claimant's testimony including cultural differences, testimony given through the filter of an interpreter and hearing-room anxiety.19\n[24] As Claimant's Counsel submitted, much of the evidence from the claimant turns on whether that evidence is found plausible. He further submitted that adverse plausibility findings must be made in only the clearest of cases. He submitted that the claimant had been consistent throughout, from his Canada Border Services Agency interview, to his BoC narrative, to his testimony and other evidence presented.\n[25] However, the Federal Court and Federal Court of Appeal remind us that a panel does not have to accept a witness's testimony simply because it was not contradicted at the hearing. A panel is entitled to make reasonable findings on implausibilities, common sense and rationality, and may reject evidence if it is not consistent with the probabilities affecting the case as a whole.20 I am also cognizant of a case from the British Columbia Court of Appeal, which stated:21\nIn short, the real test of truth of the story of a witness in such a case must be its harmony with the preponderance of the probabilities which a practical and informed person would readily recognize as reasonable in that place and in those conditions.\n[26] Taking into consideration the conditions in Kuwait in 2016, the position of the ruling royal family, and the situation of the claimant, a XXXX XXXX, I find that the allegations made by the claimant are not in harmony with the preponderance of the probabilities which a practical and informed person would readily recognize as reasonable, for the following reasons.\n[27] I found the following credibility problems in this claim which caused me to doubt the evidence that has been put forward: the allegation that a royal XXXX would personally retain the services of a XXXX XXXX, rather than use a person on the family staff; the allegation that a woman from the ruling Al-Sabah family would choose a Palestinian as a XXXX XXXX, rather than a Kuwaiti; the allegation that a royal woman in her twenties would travel with girlfriends to London without a male escort; the allegation that such a woman would provide a gift to a XXXX XXXX XXXX the allegation that a royal XXXX would be seen in public with a Palestinian; the allegation that the claimant and XXXX could slip away to promenade and to water-ski publicly, much less to meet on a tryst, not only once but for a period of over a year; the allegation that a royal XXXX would want to exact personal revenge, instead of just calling on the family's personal security unit or even the state secret police to deal with the claimant; the allegation that a royal XXXX would warn the claimant by telephone at least 24 hours before allegedly calling on him; the allegation that a royal XXXX would personally look for the claimant at his office and his mother's home; the absence of consequences to the claimant's family; and, finally, that the claimant was able to leave Kuwait on his own passport, without being stopped by the authorities at the behest of a royal XXXX.\n[28] I do not look at the problems in the evidence set out in the previous paragraph from a Canadian perspective or with respect to Canadian cultural norms, but from what I have gained from hearing numerous gender-related claims from the Middle East, and in particular claims from conservative Islamic countries, such as Kuwait. Each of the allegations may be possible, but they are not probable,22 especially in the aggregate in light of the country conditions in Kuwait.\n[29] Claimant's Counsel's submission that a lusting man is not able to reason properly may also be true, and it may be a reasonable explanation for a weekend fling, once or twice, but it does not explain the alleged behaviour of this putative Kuwaiti XXXX and her Palestinian lover for over a year. If it were true, that the claimant and his XXXX were able to hide this intimate relationship from the royal family and\/or the secret police in a resort, yet more unlikely, by going out in public for walks, water-skiing, and birthday parties, is not tenable in light of the country conditions as found in the evidence. In Sung,23 the Federal Court stated,\nThe other observation which might be made is that in the realm of a claimant's credibility, contradictions are not the exclusive factual source on which the presumption of truth in the claimant's evidence, as so ruled by the Federal Court of Appeal, may be rebutted. A tribunal may also conclude that a claimant's evidence is implausible, or improbable, or dubious, or untenable, or unreliable, or absurd, or unconvincing.\n[30] If, as the claimant asserted, a scion of the royal family, XXXX, was seeking to kill the claimant, I find it unlikely he would provide the claimant with any warning. Even if this is speculation on my part as to the actions of a potential killer, which it may be, it still does not explain how this disturber of royal honour would have been able to escape the country through a public airport, especially today with all the security to be found at airports. The claimant explained that his friend informed him that he was not on a watch list. This is probably true; however, I find that it is more probable than not that he was not on any watch list because he was not wanted by anyone, including the brother of a royal XXXX.\n[31] The claimant provided photographs of himself and a woman,24 but there is nothing to tie these photographs to the allegations, except for the testimony and narrative of the claimant, whom I have found to be not credible. I give the photographs no weight, as there is no objective source that identifies the people in the photograph, or what event or events they attended.\n[32] I have also reviewed the detailed, fourteen-page genealogy of the Kuwaiti royal family and found no reference to either XXXX or XXXX.25 This has led me to find that there is reason to doubt the truthfulness of the claimant. I also find the claimant has not established the existence of either a woman known as \"XXXX\" or her putative brother, \"XXXX\", at all, much less scions of the Kuwaiti ruling Al-Sabah family. I have also drawn an adverse inference from this.\n[33] I find that it is not just one allegation that leads me to find the claimant generally not credible but, as noted, the accumulation of implausible and improbable acts and omissions.\n[34] I am guided by the Federal Court of Appeal in Sellan,26which stated the following:\n[W]here the Board makes a general finding that the claimant lacks credibility, that determination is sufficient to dispose of the claim unless there is independent and credible documentary evidence in the record capable of supporting a positive disposition of the claim. The claimant bears the onus of demonstrating there was such evidence.\n[35] In this case, the claimant, in my view, has not met his onus in this regard. I also found the claimant's testimony to be at times vague, and non-responsive, from which I have drawn a further adverse inference as to the credibility of this claimant.\n[36] The claimant provided letters from a friend (XXXX XXXX his mother27 and his sister28 to corroborate his allegations, which are all, of course, self-serving. I understand as the Federal Court of Appeal commented, that it is difficult to conceive what evidence would be available to a claimant in Canada that would not be self-serving,29 I still find that I am not able to give these letters any weight after a review of the following factors.30\n[37] Firstly, the letters have not been made before a notary public or other authority to attest to the veracity of the contents. Secondly, as the authors are the mother and the sister of the claimant, there is a strong personal relationship between the writers and the claimant. Thirdly, the claimant's mother has written about matters she did not personally witness, as well as the home invasion, which she alleges she did experience. I asked the claimant why his mother would let these \"unknown men\" enter her residence; the claimant explained that she let the XXXX in because she is elderly. I do not accept this explanation. The mother was allegedly alone. It makes no sense whether in Canada or Kuwait to open the door to \"agitated\" unknown men, at any time. I also find it makes little sense that the claimant warned his brother but not his mother who was home alone, as alleged in his testimony. Finally, I find the letters carry no weight as they do not overcome the credibility concerns found by me in the claimant's evidence. This is especially true of XXXX letter as it only indicates that the claimant stayed with him for a certain period of time, which does not corroborate the claimant's allegations.\n[38] I recognize corroborating evidence is not always required. However, when credibility, like in this case, is the determinative issue, objective corroborating evidence would have been helpful in off-setting my concerns. I note the Federal Court case of Bhagat,31 which stated the following:\nCorroborating evidence is not always necessary to establish the applicant's subjective fear. The Board, however, determined that in the particular circumstances of this case, corroborating evidence of persecution was expected. An absence of corroborating evidence, then, permitted it to make a negative inference against credibility of the applicant. The respondent relies on Sheik v. Canada (M.E.I.) (C.A.), [1990] 3 F.C. 238, at page 244, for its argument that the Board did not err in law when making that conclusion:\nThe concept of \"credible evidence\" is not, of course, the same as that of the credibility of the applicant, but it is obvious that where the only evidence before a tribunal linking the applicant to his claim is that of the applicant himself (in addition, perhaps, to \"country reports\" from which nothing about the applicant's claim can be directly deduced), a tribunal's perception that he is not a credible witness effectively amounts to a finding that there is no credible evidence on which the second-level tribunal could allow his claim.\n[39] Therefore, after a thorough review of all the evidence in this case, I find that there is not a serious possibility or reasonable chance that the claimant would face persecution for a Convention ground or, on balance, is in need of protection if required to return to Kuwait, based on his testimony and the other evidence in this claim.\nCONCLUSION\n[40] Having considered all the evidence, and based on the above analysis, I find the claimant not to be a Convention refugee as the claimant has not established that there is a reasonable chance or serious possibility that he will face persecution for a Convention ground or that he will face a risk to his life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture should he return to Kuwait. I reject this claim pursuant to both sections 96 and 97(1) of the IRPA.\n(signed)\n\"James V. Railton\"\nJames V.

The determinative issues are the internal flight alternative and the lack of a particular risk.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimants state that they are citizens of Haiti. The female principal claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, states that she was attacked in XXXX 2015 because she was perceived as being a member of a wealthy family. The claimants fear all the criminals who attacked XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and those who threatened XXXX XXXX. They do not have confidence in their government because there is a great deal of crime and corruption in Haiti, and Haitian criminals act with impunity and even with the cooperation of the Haitian national police.\n[3] They state that they will not receive state protection from the Republic of Haiti and that there is no safe place for them anywhere in Haiti.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[4] The claimants' identities were established by means of their Haitian passports,1 the driver's licences for the adult claimants,2 the marriage certificate for the two adult claimants3 and their birth certificates.4 On a balance of probabilities, the panel is satisfied as to the identities and citizenship of the claimants.\nCredibility\n[5] The claimants cited two major incidents that motivated their departure from Haiti. In 2010, while the family was living in a tent following the earthquake in January 2010, armed men came into their tent and threatened the male principal claimant. The armed men left when neighbours approached.\n[6] The second incident occurred on XXXX XXXX, 2015. Claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was attacked while walking near the market. They broke her ankle. The assailants addressed her in such a way that the female claimant understood that they thought that they were attacking XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX sister-in-law. The claimants did not have any other contact with the people who attacked and injured XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[7] Claimant XXXX XXXX chose to testify on behalf of the whole family. His testimony was often vague and lacked detail.\n[8] The panel asked the male claimant whether those his family fears know the names of the claimants. He stated that yes, their assailants know their names. The panel then asked him how the assailants know the claimants' names. He stated that the criminals know his name and his vehicle. The claimant responded that almost everyone in Haiti knows his family.\n[9] The panel continued: How does almost everyone in Haiti know your family? The male claimant stated that he is known across Haiti because of his activities. The panel then asked what activities claimant XXXX XXXX is involved in that make his family known by almost everyone in Haiti. He stated that he works all over Haiti. The panel scrutinized this testimony further. Does everyone in Jacmel know the male claimant? No, he stated. Does everyone in Cap-Ha\u00eftien know the male claimant? No. Does everyone in Gona\u00efves know the male claimant? The male claimant testified, no, he is not known by everyone in Gona\u00efves. Finally, the claimant acknowledged that [translation] \"many people\" in Haiti know him, indicating that most Haitians know the names of his family members because he is from a wealthy family. The male claimant was unable to be more specific about the scope of the knowledge of his name and activities, and he was unable to clarify why so many know his name and the names of his family members, despite the fact that he was given many opportunities to explain himself on these points.\n[10] Claimant XXXX XXXX stated that, if he had to return to Haiti, he fears the criminals who attacked his family. He does not know their names. He believes that it is an organized group. He acknowledged that the group of criminals is not an identifiable group.\n[11] The claimants are unable to identify the people they suspect of targeting them, and they do not know the motives of the alleged agents of persecution. The panel finds that the male claimant's testimony was generally more credible than not, but that the testimony did not establish a well-founded fear of persecution.\nInternal flight alternative\n[12] As analyzed above, the claimants finally stated that they are not that well-known in Cap-Ha\u00eftien, Gona\u00efves, and Jacmel. Claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX stated that she made efforts to resettle in many places, without specifying which. When asked why she and her family could not move to Cap-Ha\u00eftien and find safety there, she stated that she did not feel confident anywhere in the country. She admitted that her family did not move to either Cap-Ha\u00eftien or Jacmel.\n[13] The claimants' lawyer asked the male principal claimant how the criminals who attacked his spouse could learn that the family moved to Cap-Ha\u00eftien. The male claimant stated that he does not know how these criminals would be able to find them. He then testified that the people they fear could learn about the family's move from other people because people in Haiti tell other people about newcomers. This response is merely speculation because there is no evidence that the criminals who attacked XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX were looking for her. There is no evidence that these same criminals would want to pursue her or her family, and there is no evidence before the panel indicating that the criminals who attacked the female principal claimant are in contact with people in Cap-Ha\u00eftien.\n[14] The onus is on the refugee protection claimants to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that they face a serious risk of being persecuted in their country of origin, regardless of location. The panel concludes that the claimants did not discharge their burden of convincing the Board that there is no safe place for them in Haiti. The panel also concludes that the claimants could find a reasonable place of refuge in Cap-Ha\u00eftien.\nSection 97\n[15] Claimant XXXX XXXX stated that his family is targeted because his family is financially stable. Claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX testified that her family is targeted because they are considered [translation] \"wealthy people.\" The panel notes that the claimants are the victims of criminal acts committed against them but that this is the result of an attack in which another person, the sister-in-law XXXX, was the target. The intention of those who injured the female claimant was logically to extort or steal from the sister-in-law, XXXX. The claimants cannot rely on the fact that XXXX was targeted to state that they were or will be targeted themselves. There is no evidence indicating that those who were targeting XXXX and who violently attacked claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX know the names of the claimants. It is also unlikely that they know the names of the claimants because the assailants thought that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was the sister-in-law, XXXX. The panel concludes that these claimants are not targeted by the so-called agents of persecution.\n[16] When comparing the risk faced by these claimants to the risk faced by ordinary Haitians, the risk faced by the refugee protection claimants, in light of their being the victims of attempted theft or extortion, is a risk faced generally by many Haitian people who are considered wealthy.\n[17] The panel considered Proph\u00e8te,5 in which the Federal Court, that is, the Honourable Justice Tremblay-Lamer, reviews the case law of the Court on this topic and states:\n[18] The difficulty in analyzing personalized risk in situations of generalized human rights violations, civil war, and failed states lies in determining the dividing line between a risk that is \"personalized\" and one that is \"general\". Under these circumstances, the Court may be faced with applicant who has been targeted in the past and who may be targeted in the future but whose risk situation is similar to a segment of the larger population. Thus, the Court is faced with an individual who may have a personalized risk, but one that is shared by many other individuals.\n[19] Recently, the term \"generally\" was interpreted in a manner that may include segments of the larger population, as well as all residents or citizens of a given country....\n[23] Based on the recent jurisprudence of this Court, I am of the view that the applicant does not face a personalized risk that is not faced generally by other individuals in or from Haiti. The risk of all forms of criminality is general and felt by all Haitians. While a specific number of individuals may be targeted more frequently because of their wealth, all Haitians are at risk of becoming the victims of violence.\nCONCLUSION\n[18] Based on the analysis above, the panel determines that claimants XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX are not Convention refugees, nor are they persons in need of protection on the ground that they would be personally subjected to a danger of torture, a risk to their lives or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\n[19] Claimant XXXX XXXX is a citizen of the United States. She did not make any allegations of persecution if she returned to the United States. Consequently, she is not a refugee or a person in need protection.\n[20] The panel therefore rejects the claims.\n(signed)\n\"R. K. Riley\"\nR. K.

The Panel accepts that the claimant is who he says he is, and that he is from Nigeria.\nEVIDENCE\n[3] The allegations supporting the claim are summarised in the narrative attached to the Personal Information Form, dated November 15, 2012, as supplemented by an additional narrative, filed March 24, 2014.4\nThe Claim as set out in November 2012\n[4] The claimant said, in his Personal Information Form, that he was a youth and volunteer activist in Nigeria, and active in community development projects, democracy-building and the education of citizens with respect to the electoral system. In addition to his work in Nigeria, he travelled abroad to a number of different meetings on such topics. He characterised his work as a-political, or non-political: \"I was determined not to belong or join any political party.\"5 His work was designed to expose corruption wherever it existed, he said, and to educate the public as to their rights, for instance in the electoral\nsystem. A friend who swore an affidavit in support of the claimant said that the claimant \"likes to work voluntarily for his Community and mobilise youth for sanitation since his secondary school days.\"6\n[5] The claimant said that he and some of his colleagues formed a group called the Local Youth Assembly in Nigeria, which in 2007 became active in campaigning for good governance and educating people about the electoral process. He says that one of their purposes was to prevent the ruling party, the PDP, from using young people as \"political thugs\". He said that as a result, he and others were arrested on XXXX XXXX, 2011, and released on XXXX XXXX, 2011, although they were not formally charged. He and others were kept in detention \"in order to prevent us from participating in the presidential election,\" and that during the detention they were interrogated, starved, tortured and warned not to participate in the upcoming election unless it was to support the ruling party. The claimant said that upon his release from detention, he was warned not to advocate against the PDP, or he and his family would be killed. He said that he was accused of undermining support for the PDP, and that on election day many people were attacked by PDP \"hoodlums and thugs\" and two young people lost their lives. The claimant said that he and his colleagues protested to a state commissioner, but were not allowed to speak to him, and that they wrote to the police, but there was no response.\n[6] The claimant said that a few weeks later he received phone call from another member of the Local Youth Assembly, saying that he should leave his house and run away, as thugs had killed two other members of their group, and that they (the thugs) were looking for him. He says that he decided, as a result, to stop advocating so openly and that he changed his contact information and moved to another address.\n[7] The claimant said that he went to a meeting in Germany, in XXXX 2011, at which he gave an interview to a German broadcaster, and that on his return to Nigeria, he\nwas detained for ten hours as a result. He said that he was then required to get police clearance before travelling outside of Nigeria. He said that he then traveled to a conference in Sweden, in XXXX 2012, and was the invited to an international conference in Canada, in XXXX XXXX 2012. He said that he told immigration in Nigeria that he was going for holiday in the United States. While in the US, he obtained at Canadian visa, which was granted, and arrived in Canada on September 11, 2012.\n[8] In October 2012, the claimant said he was told that an article he posted online had caused a lot of problems, and that the police ransacked an office of the Local Youth Assembly in Nigeria. He said he was told that the police were looking to arrest him because of what he had written, and that his mother also told him that the police were looking for him.\n[9] As a result of these circumstances, the claimant decided to make a refugee claim.\n[10] After making his refugee claim, the claimant said his mother told him that the police went to her house and detained his sister for interrogation as to when he would be returning to Nigeria, and that she was held for one day. His mother paid a fine to obtain his sister's release. His sister told him not to go back to Nigeria, because she had been told that the federal government had given orders to arrest him as soon as he was located.\nThe Subsequent Basis of the Claim\n[11] In March 2014, the claimant amended his claim to include new grounds. He said that in February 2014, he was part of an online discussion on a social media web-site about equal rights for people of different sexual orientations. A hard copy of a conversation was provided, in which the claimant appears to be discussing with two other individuals that \"everybody should have freedom to live, to enjoy his life.\"7 The claimant said that as a\nresult of this online discussion, he was told by his sister that a warrant was issued for his arrest for supporting and promoting gay activities, and that he would be detained upon arrival back in Nigeria. He said that people in Nigeria consider that he is gay.\n[12] The claimant filed a sworn affidavit from a friend, dated June 24, 2015, stating that: the claimant was arrested on XXXX XXXX, 2011, and released seven days later; police had gone on an un-specified date \"to our offices ... meaning ... to arrest us\"; the claimant's sister was arrested on XXXX XXXX, 2012 in his absence; and that she was released on bail paid with \"illegal money.\"8\n[13] The claimant also filed a document which he said is a letter from a friend of his, dated January 5, 2016, stating that he, (the friend,) is required to go to the police station every month \"as part of our agreement until they have you in their custody or the judge quash the warrant of arrest. I made a move to see if we can appeal to them to quash it but all effort no avail.\"9 The friend went on to say that he was told that the next action would be to publish the claimant's name in the newspaper as a wanted person that is evading arrest, and that the authorities are using this situation to extort money from the claimant's mother. The claimant's friend said that \"the issue of you being gay through your activities in Canada has also been repeatedly mentioned...\". The friend said that most people in the community believes that the claimant is gay.\nISSUE\n[14] The determinative issue in this case is credibility. The Panel finds that there is insufficient credible evidence, on either of the two principal bases of the claim, to find that the claimant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\n[15] The Panel accepts that the claimant was a youth and volunteer activist and community worker in Nigeria. The Panel does not accept, however, that there is sufficient evidence to find that the claimant was detained, arrested and abused, in the past, as he\nalleges, or at all, or that there is more than a mere possibility that he might face treatment amounting to persecution, or a risk to his life, or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture, upon return to Nigeria, either for his youth community development work and activism, or because of the online discussion regarding gay rights, or for any other reason.\nThe Youth and Volunteer Activism\n[16] There were elections in Nigeria in 2011. Election observers considered these to be \"generally credible and orderly, although marred by instances of violence, fraud, and irregularities,\"10 and that:\n[t]he elections in 2011 with presidential, National Assembly, gubernatorial and state assembly elections were the most credible elections in Nigerian history, despite a chaotic run-up with legal wrangling and violence, and shortcomings and lapses during the voting process.\nThe new chairman of the electoral commission demonstrated that credible elections can be executed. With the unprecedented use of the National Youth Service Corps at the polling stations, the commission's leadership significantly reduced malpractices at the polling stations and minimized the ability of local politicians and staff of the local commission to manipulate the results. Unfortunately, in some northern areas, a wave of violence erupted in the aftermath of the elections, which was unparalleled since the civil war (and ten of the corps members were killed in the aftermath of the elections).\nThe ruling PDP maintained its grip on power with an absolute majority in both houses of the national assembly and in most state assemblies. In addition, most PDP frontrunners in the gubernatorial elections triumphed. The electorate had given the incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan, who had never stood for election before, a mandate stronger than any previously elected head of state or government.11\n[17] The political and electoral situation in Nigeria is complex, with ongoing communal violence, Boko Haram-instigated violence, and corruption at various levels throughout various sectors of society, notably including institutions of government. Freedom of the press is limited. Political and electoral violence occur, with, for instance, the assassination of politicians in some cases,12 and intra-party violence. There is also evidence that individuals may be targeted for their work in specific political areas, or with political sensitivity, such as alleging corruption, working with certain ethnic religious groups, or taking on gender-based issues such as Female Genital Mutilation.\n[18] There is, however, little or no evidence that non-political, or a-political, organisations of young people involved in community development and institution- or democracy-building are targeted for their work. The Panel notes the reference above to individuals from the National Youth Service Corps, working at polling stations and being killed, but there is no information as to the circumstances that would allow the Panel to conclude that their situation was in any way similar to that of the claimant. There are in addition references in the country documentation of youth in the context of Female Genital Mutilation, and the radicalisation of young people, but there is very little if any reference to young people in the position of the claimant, working on community projects such as educating people on the right to vote, and sanitation, being at risk for political reasons.\n[19] A claimant does not have to fit a particular profile in order to demonstrate a need for refugee or other protection. Every case must be assessed individually. Some cases do not fit any known or reported profile. However, in the absence of any reports on people\nwho are similarly situated, the Panel will want to see from the evidence which is specific to the particular claimant that there is sufficient evidence of a credible nature to support a positive outcome.\n[20] Other than the corroborating communications from a friend and the claimant's sister, there is no documentation surrounding these events. While the friend who swore an affidavit refers to the claimant having been arrested and detained in XXXX 2011, he says nothing about any detention in XXXX 2011, or any warrant for arrest being issued after the claimant left Nigeria. The other friend, writing in January 2016, does refer to an elaborate system of police investigation, monthly reporting, and a warrant for the arrest of the claimant; however, the Panel notes that this letter is un-sworn, and does not include copies of any of the court or police documents, or any other documents referring to the circumstances the claimant says he was facing in Nigeria, or any statement that these cannot be obtained.\n[21] The claimant was asked what effort he had made to get a copy of any of the documentation surrounding police interest in him, for example a copy of the arrest warrant. He asked an immigration consultant to write from Canada to the authorities in Nigeria; she wrote to a general information email address on a web-site, and never got a reply.13 The Panel notes that the claimant did not say or suggest that he would not be able to get a copy of the arrest warrant, which according to information on file would have to be issued by a court on a complaint made on oath.\n[22] That is, this is not a case in which someone says they cannot get documentary evidence of any sort. This is a case where no reasonable efforts were made to get any kind of documentation. A single email from a consultant in Canada to an inbox on a web-site does not, in the view of the Panel, constitute reasonable efforts.\n[23] The Panel draws a negative inference from this, as there is no reason to conclude that documentation of some kind would not have been reasonably available, had the claimant taken steps to seek it out.\n[24] For these reasons, the Panel finds that there is insufficient evidence to support a positive outcome for the claim as based on the claimant's history of volunteer activism in Nigeria.\nGay Rights Statements Online\n[25] The claimant says that he has become the target of police interest since his statements online supporting equality rights for people of different sexual orientation. He\nsays that people think he is gay, and that he is advocating on behalf of the LGBTQ community. There is no question but that the rights of LGBTQ individuals in Nigeria are severely threatened, and that in some cases people are arrested and subjected to mistreatment amounting to persecution. In addition, the government has recently adopted legislation, the Same-Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Act, prohibiting same-sex marriages, and prohibiting organisations from carrying out support or advocacy work on behalf of the gay and lesbian, or LGBTQ, community.14\n[26] There is evidence that state authorities are in fact not using the tools they would have to pursue advocates working with the gay and lesbian community:\n...there have been few confirmed reports of persons being prosecuted and sentenced under anti-LGBT laws. There is limited evidence that the government has directly targeted or forced the closure of LGBT organisations.15\n[27]\nThis does not mean that there are not instances of violent attack on those who are or who are perceived to be, of different sexual orientations, as set out in parts of the National Documentation Package and in some of the material filed by the claimant, particularly in the immediate aftermath of the passage of the Same-Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Act, and in, although not exclusively, Islamic areas of Nigeria.16 At the same time, however, for the year 2014, after the passage of the Same Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Act,\n[s]everal NGOs provided LGBT groups with legal advice and training in advocacy, media responsibility, and HIVAIDS awareness, as well as providing safe havens for LGBT individuals. The government and its agents did not impede the work of these groups during the year.17\n[28] There is, further, no evidence that anyone thinks the claimant in gay, other than the statement in a print-out of an email the claimant says he got from his sister, which does not give any information as to the source or nature of these rumours.\n[29] To the extent that the claimant would argue that the rumours that he is gay are because he has or is perceived to have political enemies in Nigeria, the Panel does not accept this argument, as the Panel has not accepted the claim based on alleged political involved, as above.\n[30] Therefore, the Panel does not find that the evidence supports a conclusion that the claimant, whose perceived gay rights advocacy is alleged to be as described in the single online discussion he had, would be perceived either to be gay, or to be an active gay rights advocate. This is simply not a reasonable view of the evidence available in this case.\nCONCLUSION\n[31] The Panel finds that there is insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to support a positive outcome, on either of the principal bases of the claim, both the volunteer activism and the gay rights statements online discussion. For these reasons, the claimant is determined not to face a serious risk, or more than a mere possibility, of persecution, should he return to Nigeria, and not to face a risk to his life, or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture, in that country. Accordingly, the claim is denied, pursuant to sections 96, 97 and 107 of the Act.\n(signed)\n\"Carolyn McCool\"\nCarolyn McCool\nApril 5, 2016\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibit 1 (un-paginated), see IMM 5611, page 5\/10, Question 21.\n3 Exhibit 1 (un-paginated).\n4 Exhibits 2 and 2A.\n5 Exhibit 2, page 11.\n6 Exhibit 5, pp 1-3, see paragraph 4.\n7 Exhibit 2A.\n8 Exhibit 5, page 1.\n9 Exhibit 12, page 1.\n10 Exhibit 11, National Documentation Package (NDP), Nigeria, November 30, 2015, item 2.1.\n11 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 4.1.\n12 Exhibit 11, NDP, item 4.7.\n13 Post-hearing Exhibit 13.\n14 Exhibits 3 & 11, see for instance Item 2.1, Exhibit 12, pages 55-61.\n15 Exhibit 11, NDP, item 1.13.\n16 Exhibit 12, pages 31 - 48.\n17 Exhibit 11, NDP, Item 2.1.\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRPD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SPR :VB5-01476\nRPD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SPR : VB5-01476\n",

Their claims were heard on December 20, 2013, and a negative decision was rendered on January 14, 2014. An application for judicial review of that decision was allowed by the Federal Court on XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX The father, mother, and sister of XXXX XXXX XXXX came to Canada and claimed refugee protection on November 9, 2015. The claims of all five family members were joined and were heard together on April 28 and May 9, 2016. This is therefore a re-hearing of the claims of XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and a first hearing of the claims of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The son (who was the principal claimant in the original claim) was a professional XXXX XXXX in Bogota, Colombia from 2002 to 2009. After he retired he began to coach, both as a volunteer and as a professional trainer. On XXXX XXXX, 2012, the son and his wife traveled to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX celebrate the wife's birthday with her family. The next day, while the two claimants were walking, a car approached them and three men forced themselves into the car at gunpoint. The men identified themselves as members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, \"FARC\"). The son was told he had to join their organization as a physical trainer and that he had to report at the town park at 7:00 am the next day. The FARC agents told him if he did not report, he would be declared a military target. The men then dropped the couple off on the highway about a half hour walk from town. The couple left XXXX early in the morning the next day and immediately went to the airport in XXXX. They got a phone call from the wife's mother saying that three armed men had come to the house looking for the son. After searching the house for the claimant, they left a message that they were looking for him.\n[4] After returning to Bogota, the claimant continued his work as a XXXX coach. On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2012, he received a phone call threatening him and his family with being killed. The couple went to stay with an aunt (the father's sister), and on October 17, the claimant changed jobs and stopped returning phone calls. On XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, 2012, the claimants went to seek help from the District Attorney's office, but the courts were closed due to a national strike. Because of this and because the principal claimant was known throughout the country from having been a XXXX XXXX XXXX, the couple knew they could be found anywhere in Colombia and knew they had no other choice other than to leave the country. On XXXX XXXX, 2012, the claimant got another threatening phone call.\n[5] On XXXX XXXX, 2012, the claimants left Colombia and travelled to Orlando in the United States. They met a lawyer there who advised them that it would be better to claim refugee protection in Canada since they had relatives here. They arrived in Canada on December 14, 2012, and claimed protection at the border. As noted above, their refugee claim was first heard on December 20, 2013 and denied, but an application for judicial review was allowed, and the claim is being heard again.\n[6] In the meantime, the claimant's (son's) father and mother in Colombia experienced retaliation against them from the FARC. On XXXX XXXX, 2014, as the father was arriving at his house, two men with a firearm forced themselves into the house and told the father and mother that if the principal claimant did not return to Colombia so old scores could be settled, all of them would be killed. The claimants decided to move to other relatives' houses. The father tried to report to police on XXXX XXXX, 2015, but the police did not receive the complaint due to lack of physical evidence. On June 20, 2015, the father went to his house in XXXX XXXX, in Bogota, to check the mail. He found out from neighbours that suspicious-looking people had looked for the claimants at that home. He saw two people walking toward him, but managed to lose them by quickly taking a taxi away from there.\n[7] The father, mother and daughter left Colombia on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and claimed refugee protection in Canada in November 2015.\nDETERMINATION\n[8] I find that the claimants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\n[9] The claimants' identities as citizens of Colombia are established by their testimony and the supporting documentation filed, namely their passports.2\n[10] Credibility is the determinative issue in the claim.\n[11] Two areas of the claimants' evidence are key to a forward-looking assessment of risk to the claimants in Colombia. The first is the alleged identification of the son as a \"military target.\" The claimant states that because he was considered to be a military target by the FARC, the FARC will not relent in their efforts to locate and retaliate against him for his refusal to acquiesce to their alleged demands that he join them in their work. The second area of evidence that is relevant to a consideration of whether the claimants have established that the FARC retains any interest in their family involves alleged ongoing contacts from the FARC against the son and his family over the past four years after the alleged initial contact in September 2012. I do not find that the claimants' evidence about these matters, which is central to the refugee claim, is credible. Inconsistencies, omissions and behavior that is inconsistent with the claimants' statements that they feared for their lives demonstrates a lack of credibility in the claimants' allegations. In addition, the son's allegation about his having allegedly been identified as a military target following a forced recruitment attempt is inconsistent from the documentary evidence about the FARC's tactics in Colombia. These concerns lead me to conclude, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants are not credible in their allegations about alleged ongoing contacts from the FARC over the past four years.\n[12] The claimants alleged that the son was identified as a high-value target by the FARC, which led to persistent efforts to locate and harm him. In the claimants' cases, they provided testimony regarding phone calls and contacts to the son himself and to other family members and apparent surveillance of the father and mother's home as evidence of ongoing interest and intention from the FARC to follow up on their threats to the son. I do not, on a balance of probabilities, find that this evidence about follow-up contacts is credible.\n[13] Alleged follow-up contacts from the FARC include a visit to the home of the son's wife's parents on the day (XXXX XXXX, 2012) when the son was allegedly supposed to report to the FARC but left the town instead. The son himself alleged that he received two phone calls while he was in Bogota between XXXX XXXX XXXX, 2012, but no personal visits or follow-up, even though the people calling allegedly said they knew where he lived. The mother says she received a visit from FARC agents in XXXX 2013 in which two FARC agents asked her about the whereabouts of her son, stating that he could not hide from them. The father, mother and daughter state that on XXXX XXXX, 2014 two men with a firearm forced themselves into the home and told them that if the son did not come back to show his face, everyone else would be killed. Then on June 20, 2015, when the father went to check on the home, he learned from neighbours that men had been asking for information about the family (who had fled the home to live with relatives), and then he saw two suspicious-looking men walking toward him, one of whom he recognized from the XXXX 2014 incident.\n[14] With respect to the contact allegedly made with the mother in XXXX 2013, I find that omissions and inconsistencies demonstrate that this allegation is not credible. Until just prior to the hearing, the mother, the father and the daughter made no mention of this alleged incident, either while in Colombia or in their original BOC narrative, submitted in November 2015.3 This XXXX 2013 contact had not been mentioned in the son's original narrative, as it would not yet have occurred at the time he filed his refugee claim, but he did describe it in his original refugee hearing.4 In an addition to the narrative, submitted on April 26, 2016,5 two days before the present hearing, the mother stated that she realized, upon reviewing the narrative her husband prepared, that this incident was not included and she wished to add it. When asked why it was originally omitted, the father said he did not know but that they had given it to \"him,\" but appeared confused about who he had allegedly given it to. When the mother was asked why reference to this incident was not originally included in the narrative, she said that it was forgotten but later added. Later, the daughter added the explanation that this incident was regarding the son's claim and was relevant to threats specifically against him, as compared to later incidents which involved threats against the family themselves.\n[15] In addition, this alleged XXXX 2013 incident was also omitted from the notarized affidavit the father swore in Colombia on September 29, 2015, prior to his departure from the country.6 When asked why, the father said he did not know why it was omitted, but that it had escaped them. The mother said that she had consulted with her husband before the affidavit was submitted and that there was no mention of the XXXX 2013 incident because the threat was against the son and not against them.\n[16] I do not accept these explanations for a significant omission of evidence from the originally-submitted BOC and the affidavit. An alleged contact at the family home from FARC members is relevant not only to the son and daughter-in-law, but is also relevant to the circumstances of the other claimants as well. If this threat was credible, it would have been the first time the FARC would have demonstrated that they knew where the family home was, since prior to this their alleged contacts with the son had been only in XXXX and by cell phone. Even though the evidence from most of the claimants was that the FARC agents only asked about the son and did not at this time personally threaten the father, the mother and the sister, this significant encounter still related to the general background information that applied to everyone's allegations. The BOC for the three more recently-arrived claimants describes the general circumstances of the son's allegations and the original threat against him, so there is no reason to believe that evidence should be omitted if it refers to the son.\n[17] Counsel also argued in submissions that omissions prior to the date of the hearing should not lead to a negative inference, particularly as this incident was referred to both in the son's previous hearing and in a BOC amendment prior to the hearing before me. He relied on the case of Feng which concluded that there were no omissions in an applicant's PIF narrative, because in that case the \"PIF was accurate as of the date of filing, and any additions to her evidence tendered thereafter were made in the normal course of her claim proceedings.\"7 However, while this case and others clearly indicate that the RPD should consider explanations for initial omissions from evidence, the findings in that case, which involves a very brief analysis, appear to be fact-specific. Case law supports the principle that omissions from the initial PIF or BOC are relevant to a credibility assessment, as claimants have an obligation to include all relevant facts in their initial narrative,8 and that this may apply even when a claimant makes an amendment prior to the hearing.9\n[18] The alleged XXXX 2013 encounter would have been one of only three contacts made with the family since the son left Colombia. It was allegedly the first in-person contact with the family from the FARC in Bogota and allegedly involved two men identifying themselves as FARC and saying that the son could not hide from them. The claimants were thorough in their description of each of the other two alleged incidents when the FARC made contact with them. It does not make sense that the family would neglect to mention this initial contact until just a few days before the hearing.\n[19] In addition, the claimants were unclear about the contents of this alleged visit. The son and the mother stated in the hearing before me that the questioners did not know where the son had been at the time of the visit, whereas the son had stated in the previous hearing that the FARC agents had known at that time that the son had left Colombia and that he had been in the United States,10 stating that the men indicated they already knew where the claimant was.11 The claimant explained this inconsistency by saying he had misunderstood. An additional contradiction in connection with the XXXX 2013 visit was that the father stated that when he spoke to his wife the day the men came to the house, he had understood that the men said that they would kill all of them, and the father clarified that he had assumed this meant the whole family. This is very different from the testimony of the other claimants, who had specifically stated that the reason they omitted this incident from previous accounts was because there had been no threat against the rest of the claimants. These inconsistencies regarding the contents of the alleged visit further demonstrate a lack of credibility.\n[20] I conclude that the family members in Colombia had no knowledge of the son's allegation regarding an alleged visit from the FARC in XXXX 2013, and that it was only when they reviewed the transcript of the previous hearing that they realized there was an omission in their evidence, in connection with what the son had previously testified to. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the recent amendment was a last-minute attempt to realign their stories. This demonstrates a lack of credibility.\n[21] Another concern with the evidence about alleged contacts from the FARC is in connection with the timing of the alleged XXXX 2014 threat against all the claimants who were living at the family home at the time, which allegedly led to the claimants moving out of the house. When the father was asked when his daughter had moved out, he initially stated that it was 2015, rather than 2014 as indicated in the narrative. I realize that it is possible for a person to mistakenly provide an incorrect year, especially as the father was nervous at the beginning of the hearing. However, the concern is that when I asked him the same question in a different way, as a way for him to provide his testimony from his experience instead of by listing a date, and asked how long ago the move out of the home had happened, the father said it was about nine months to a year ago, which is less than half the time since the timing stated in the BOC, which would have been over two years ago in XXXX 2014. The father stated that he and his family moved out the same time as the daughter and changed back and forth from his sister's place to another relative's home every one or two months between the time of this incident and their departure from their country. He said that the family moved away and back to his sister's house a total of about four times, which would also result in a total time period of 6-8 months away from their home, significantly less than the year and eight months they had allegedly been moving around. The father's estimate of how long ago he allegedly moved from his home was different from the BOC and other evidence both when he gave a year for the incident and move, as well as when he estimated the total time period they allegedly lived moving around from place to place. I find that this inconsistency demonstrates a lack of credibility. I do not accept that the father's explanation of being nervous can account for such a difference in identifying the date or the timing of this incident.\n[22] An additional inconsistency in evidence regarding the claimants' alleged circumstances over the two-year time period when they were allegedly moving from one place to another relates to their whereabouts during this time period. The mother stated that the family had moved to three different relatives' homes, whereas the father had described moving back and forth between only two homes. When asked why she had listed three different relatives that they lived with, whereas her husband had only described two, the wife said that perhaps her husband had forgotten. I do not accept this explanation. This is not a matter of just one forgotten visit. The claimants alleged that they had been rotating between these relatives' homes for more than a year and a half, so they would have moved in and out of each place multiple times. I had specifically asked the father if they had lived with anyone other than the two families he described, and he said they had not. The claimants' inability to consistently recall the details of very recent alleged experiences and where they were living demonstrates a lack of credibility regarding this time period. Establishing this aspect of their story is relevant to the alleged XXXX 2014 threat, which was allegedly the precipitating element causing them to move out of their home.\n[23] I further find that the claimants' behavior, particularly evidenced in their delay in departure from Colombia, and in their actions while they were still in their country, illustrates that they had a lack of subjective fear, with respect to the claim pursuant to section 96, and -as behavior that is inconsistent with that reasonably expected for a person who alleges they face risk to life and risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a serious possibility of persecution, as the claimants did - their behavior provides a further indication that they are not credible in their allegations, with respect to the claim pursuant to both sections 96 and 97. At the beginning of the hearing I indicated that I already accepted the claimants' explanation in the BOC and in the previous testimony regarding their failure to claim asylum protection in the United States, namely that they had family members in Canada. However, I was clear that the subjective fear issue of delay in departure was still an issue in the claim and that the hearing would provide the claimants' opportunity to explain this delay.\n[24] The son and his wife alleged that the initial declaration of the claimant as a \"military target\" occurred on XXXX XXXX, 2012, and he stated in oral testimony that he came to the decision to leave his country permanently at the time he received the phone call on XXXX 14, when the callers allegedly told him they knew where he was. He said he and his wife applied for U.S. visas on XXXX XXXX, and that they got the visas on XXXX XXXX. They then left Colombia on XXXX XXXX, 2012. When asked why he waited for six weeks to leave Colombia after getting the visa, he said he had to make arrangements, as it is hard to get up and leave family, and they had to get things into place before they left. He pointed out that he was in hiding at that time at his aunt's home. However, the claimant's PIF indicates that after completing his job as a coach with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, 2012, he had another job XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, coaching at XXXX XXXX in Bogota.12 Getting a new short-term job, in the same city where he says he believed the FARC were aware he was living in, is not indicative of a person who is in hiding because he fears that someone is going to kill him. It is not reasonable to expect a person who genuinely fears that the FARC are trying to kill him because they have declared him to be a military target to stay in his country clearing up family business and taking a new job for several weeks, even though he had a visa and the means to depart his country.\n[25] This is similar to the situation for the parents and their daughter, who initially remained in Colombia, and who state that after threats against them in 2014 and 2015 they believed that the FARC were now intent on killing them because of their relationship to the son. After the father allegedly saw the men at his house in June 2015, the family applied for visas, which they secured in XXXX, 2015. However, they did not leave Colombia until XXXX. When asked why, they said it was because they had a lot of personal matters to clear away, considering that they were leaving their country for good. I find that while this may be a reasonable consideration for a person who is avoiding discriminatory treatment or who is looking for a better living situation, it does not make sense in the claimants' alleged circumstances. For someone who alleges they fear being killed by the FARC, the decision to remain in Bogota while dealing with their affairs is incompatible with their allegations. The claimants have family who are still in Colombia who would be able to tie up any final personal matters. If they genuinely feared for their lives, it is reasonable to expect that they would have left as soon as they had secured visas, rather than waiting another two months.\n[26] Counsel pointed to case law which cautions against blanket findings of lack of subjective fear in cases of delay in departure from one's country where there is no general issue as to credibility.13 However, in this case, my assessment of the claimants' delay in departure is in the context of a credibility analysis, and takes into account the claimants' explanations. Although counsel argued that the claimants' actions are consistent with that of someone who is fleeing for their lives, I do not agree that the claimants' explanations account for the delay.\n[27] I also find that the claimants' view regarding FARC's likely way of operating is relevant to the assessment of the claimants' credibility and their explanations for their delay in departure.\nIn the hearing I questioned the claimants about their circumstances during the time period between when the FARC allegedly identified the son as a military target in September 2012, and their subsequent departures from the country-the first two claimants in XXXX 2012, and the other three family members in XXXX 2015. I asked the claimants if they had any comments or way to account for the apparent lack of follow-through by the FARC after the death threats against the family. Counsel interrupted in the course of my questioning on this issue to clarify whether I was asking why the FARC did not actually kill the claimants. In his submissions counsel dealt at length with the problem that rises if there is unreasonable speculation about how agents of harm might operate, pointing to case law that described implausibility findings as unreasonable when they were not based on the evidence that was before the Board but on speculation.14 Counsel appeared to infer that questioning on this topic rose from a presumption that if the claimants had a valid claim, then they would not have lived to flee the country. That is not my position.\n[28] The topic of questioning, however, remains relevant to an assessment of the claimants' potential risk and to their subjective fear. As I acknowledged in my questioning, the claimants may not know the answer to certain questions regarding the behavior of their aggressors, and I pointed out to them that if they did not know the answer to a question, they should respond by saying that they did not know. However, if the claimants have information about why they may have been saved the harsh consequences that were threatened against them while they were still in their country, and about why things might be different if they were to return, then they should clearly be given the opportunity to address this in their testimony.\n[29] The claimants' understanding of this situation is relevant to the analysis of subjective fear and has a bearing on assessment of credibility. The circumstances that led me to explore the apparent lack of follow-through by the FARC, in spite of threats, relates primarily to the claimants' own perception of the reasons for their apparent safety at this time. On the one hand, the claimants made statements such as that once FARC identified a person as a \"military target\" then there was no turning back: the FARC would stop at nothing until the \"military target\" was killed. In addition, the other family members said that they believed there was substance to the FARC threat that the whole family would be killed if they did not get the son back to the country. Giving them an opportunity to explain their own thinking about why they were not harmed during this time could provide me with a further potential explanation for their delay in departure, in the context of my assessment that the claimants' explanation about wrapping up their affairs appeared to be an unsatisfactory explanation in light of their apparent perception of the risk to their lives. Counsel's interjection into the questioning expressed surprise about this topic of questioning. However, exploring areas of the claimants' understanding or thinking about an issue is what gives the member information to understand potential reasoning and to assess the overall credibility of the claimants. This is a serious issue that is relevant to a credibility analysis and is applicable to an assessment pursuant to both section 96 and 97 of the Act.\n[30] My review of the claimants' comments about these circumstances provides me with no clarification or further satisfactory explanation for the claimants' delay in leaving Colombia. Even though the family had allegedly moved to stay with relatives and they changed their commuting and work patterns, the father and daughter continued to work at their same places of employment in Bogota throughout this time period. The daughter continued her job as an XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015, and the father continued his job as a XXXX until XXXX 2015. Making minor changes to work assignments, as described by the father, does not appear to account for the alleged fear they had since the time of the alleged threats against them. Their behavior after receiving threats against them is therefore indicative of a lack of credibility.\n[31] I have also considered the claimants' descriptions of their alleged efforts to seek police protection after the alleged threats. This also relates to their mindset regarding the risk to their lives. The son had indicated that he tried to file a report at the Attorney General's office in XXXX 2012, but was unable because of the strike taking place at the time. He provided documentary evidence corroborating that there was a strike in this office.15 The claimant's PIF indicated that because the strike was still going on when they left Colombia, their only option was to leave the country. In the first hearing, when the member asked about his attempts to report, he said that after the fright they received they searched for somebody who could help them in Bogota but that nobody helped them because there were protests throughout the territory.16 These comments are confusing, considering that documentary evidence about how to report a crime in Colombia does not limit such reports to the Attorney General's office, or to in-person reports, but rather states that victims of crime can also file reports with the Administrative Security Department or with the National Police, and says that a person can complete a criminal complaint form available on the website before filing in person, or that there are options for submitting forms electronically.17 When I asked the son about these other options, he said that every department had corruption in it. The son's wife added that it takes a long time for police to act, and that the fact that there are thousands and thousands of displaced persons in Colombia who have not received the help of police demonstrates that the claimants did not have the time to wait for the police to help them in their situation before they could be killed. The son eventually stated that he and his wife had already decided to leave the country anyway, and that they had just wanted to leave documentary evidence about the threats before they left, and that they were unaware of the option to file such complaints electronically.\n[32] The claimants' comments about reporting to police, when I asked them about it, repeatedly dismissed any alternative options for reporting as being unlikely to succeed due to corruption and inefficiency. The claimants said that they had already decided to leave Colombia anyway, so there had been no point in investigating other options. This is different from the way they had previously presented their circumstances: until such options for reporting online had been highlighted, the claimants had implied that they were genuinely seeking assistance when they went to the Attorney General office in XXXX 2012, and that it was only because of the wide-ranging strike that they had been unable to get help from police. However, it appeared from their answers in the hearing before me that they had not even looked at the police website or genuinely explored ways to file a complaint: instead they now implied that the attempt to go to the Attorney General's office in person was just a formality that they never expected to get success from anyway. When I asked the son why, since he had said he did not want to go out in public, he took the risk of going in person to the office, when he had the option of filing electronically, he said he did not know about an online form. However, he said he had just wanted to go to the Attorney General to leave some evidence because it was difficult to leave his country and his family.\n[33] I find that these comments demonstrate evolving testimony about the claimants' alleged purpose in going to the Attorney General, and are not indicative of people who are engaged in an actual attempt to seek help. Had the claimants filed an online form with the police, there would be a record of their report submitted to an independent body. Their explanation for their intentions at this time demonstrates a lack of credibility. Furthermore, the father also said that his own later attempt to file a police report was refused, but he also failed to submit a report online. The notarized statement he made while in Colombia18 was not filed with police either. Although the claimants made broad statements about police corruption and risk to their lives if they reported to police, they did not explain how filing a report online would generate more risk to them than what the son had originally allegedly hoped or intended to do in allegedly going to the Attorney General's office, only to be prevented by the strike. The claimants' failure to provide reports, from any independent bodies or submitted to independent bodies, regarding their allegations leaves a gap in evidence that is not satisfactorily explained by their testimony about these matters.\n[34] I recognize that the claimants have provided letters from three family members in Colombia, relating to alleged threats since 2014 and to their allegedly staying with these relatives for the time period since then.19 However, these letters refer to the same matters which gave rise to inconsistencies in the claimants' testimony at the hearing, and they are from immediate family members who are not independent and have an interest in their family members' circumstances. I therefore give the letters little weight and find that they provide insufficient evidence to overcome the credibility issues outlined above.\n[35] In addition to the credibility issues rising from the claimants' personal evidence, I also note that, with respect to the initial alleged targeting incident, the son's experience in allegedly having been identified as a target for forced recruitment to the FARC when he was 30 years old contrasts the documentary evidence regarding forced recruitment by the FARC in Colombia, which refers primarily to forced recruitment of children. An April 10, 2013 Response to Information Request (RIR) addresses \"Recruitment methods of armed groups, including the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, FARC) (2011-March 2013)\" and deals with the time period in which the claimants say the attempt was made to forcibly recruit the son into FARC ranks. This document notes that a high percentage of FARC combatants were recruited when they were children, and that recruitment methods are typically \"making [children] fall in love, by offering them money, and by promising them a better life within their ranks.\" 20 The UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines also refer to forced recruitment of children, and identifies children with certain profiles as being at particular risk in Colombia, including boys and girls in areas where armed groups or guerrilla groups engage in underage recruitment.21 Although there may be some examples of forced recruitment of adults, my review of the documentation leads me to conclude that the likely targets of forced recruitment to the FARC would typically include indigenous persons who live in remote regions of the country or those who are vulnerable through age, poverty or social position. This does not describe the claimant, who lived in the city of Bogota, is relatively well-to-do and well educated, and had a stable home and work environment.\n[36] In questioning at the previous hearing in 2014, the member and the claimants' previous counsel highlighted the fact that other athletes the son knew who had been targeted by armed groups had been targeted for extortion, and the son was asked why he was different-that when he was allegedly targeted by the FARC it was to join their ranks, not to pay money to them. The claimant replied that because he worked so closely with the community, the FARC thought he would be a better target in order to be able to attract children for the FARC's own rank and file, to swell their ranks.22 In the hearing before me, I also asked the claimant if he had any idea why he was chosen for the role to join the ranks of the FARC, allegedly involving severe consequences for refusal. He replied that he was a sports person who worked in physical education and did volunteer work with the children in XXXX XXXX XXXX, which is where the FARC cavalry was situated, and that as a former XXXX XXXX XXXX he was a well-known public figure who could be used as a magnet to draw children into involvement.\n[37] I do not find that the claimant's allegations coincide with the kind of recruitment efforts described in the country documentation. As noted above, the claimant was not personally vulnerable and was not a resident of an affected area. As far as being used by the FARC, I agree that the UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines note that youth leaders or teachers who oppose recruitment or constitute an obstacle to recruitment of youth may be targeted by armed groups or guerrillas. I also found a reference to teachers in districts under FARC control being forced to assist in facilitating the recruitment of children to FARC.23 However, this is different from trying to force a 30-year-old man, who said he had never done anything before that to make the FARC think he supported their ideology, to actually join the ranks of the FARC as a physical trainer for them. The claimant's allegation that he was identified as a target for forced recruitment to the FARC is therefore distinguished from the kinds of recruitment activities described in the country documentation.\n[38] The claimant's allegation that he has been declared to be a \"military target\" is also inconsistent from the documentary evidence about typical circumstances for such a designation. When I asked the claimant if he had any idea why the FARC would care so much about him based on a very short one-time encounter with them, he responded that the issue was that he had been told that if he did not comply with the demand that he join the FARC he was going to be declared a military target, and that once it was said that way it is certain death. This alleged designation is therefore key to establishing his risk in Colombia.\n[39] However, documentary evidence generally describes those identified as military targets to be influential persons in opposition to FARC's operation. An April 15, 2015 RIR deals with \"What it means to be a \"military objective\" (objetivo militar), including who executes these threats and methods of issuing them; whether there is an internal flight alternative for someone who has been issued a threat; state response,\" and confirms-as stated by the claimant-that \"when a person is declared a \"military objective,\" it means that their \"life, physical integrity, and freedom are endangered.\" 24 The FARC are among the groups listed who declare people to be military objectives. But, in contrast to the claimant's circumstances, those identified as military objectives are most commonly leaders or prominent persons in a community, in particular human rights defenders. The examples of human rights defenders who were declared to be military targets included directors and presidents of organizations promoting human rights, human rights lawyers, and politicians.\n[40] Other documents also make reference to people who are targeted as military objectives of the FARC, in particular a September 2013 Human Rights Watch document addressing \"The Risk of Returning Home: Violence and Threats Against Displaced People Reclaiming Land in Colombia.\"25 This document notes that during peace talks aimed at assisting displaced persons in returning to their land, \"the guerrillas, apparently motivated by their desire to maintain control there, announced their opposition to IDPs retuning home and declared that IDP leaders were 'military targets.'\" This document also refers to journalists who covered the return efforts being identified as military targets and told they would be killed if they did not leave the city within 24 hours. Others referred to in this document included IDPs who began the trend of returning to reclaim their land and those who had spoken publicly against the work of the FARC. An additional document that refers to whether or not the FARC will pursue victims over the long term also notes that those persons who return to Colombia from abroad may be watched by such groups if they are a person considered an \"objective of high value,\" and describes re-victimization of displaced persons who try to organize in order to reclaim property that has been\nstolen from them. This document also states that\nguerrillas have a tradition of persecuting and killing public servants who have 'damaged' these organizations... or those who have openly and effectively defended political points of view that go against those of the guerrillas. There are also cases of 'executions' of former guerrilla members who had demobilized or deserted with resources belong to the organization or when they cooperate with the armed forces or security agencies.26\n[41] The claimant does not XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and that after his professional career ended in XXXX he had jobs working as a coach, as well as doing volunteer work with children. He pointed out that XXXX is one of the most popular sports in Colombia, and alleged that he continues to be featured in media reports in his country as a former member of the XXXX XXXX XXXX. However, even though I accept that the claimant was a member of the team, I find that he is embellishing his public profile at this time. He has provided a letter indicating that he was chosen as a member of the XXXX XXXX team in a Major League Championship in 2006.27 There are also advertisements for a Miami All-Stars children's XXXX camp program,28 where the claimant worked for one year in 2011-2012.29 Although the claimant points out that he is included in one of the group photos, which I accept based on his oral testimony that this was him,30 there is no mention of him by name in any of the fliers, even though other coaches are individually featured. When I asked the claimant and his father, who both said there were other media references in which the claimant was more prominently featured, why they did not provide any copies of these documents, the father said he did have newspaper clippings but only submitted the one, while the son said it was because all the recent media coverage involved television interviews, which they did not know how to secure.\n[42] I find that if the son had as high a media profile as he is alleging, there would have been more evidence he could have presented in support of his allegation. He has had years since he initially made his refugee claim to work at securing copies of alleged televised media interviews, but has not provided any, even though his alleged profile is central to his allegations. Counsel argued that the claimant was a \"natural target\" for the FARC, considering the claimant's high profile and the fact that he was a \"community leader.\" However, although the claimant is a person who has been involved in coaching children and volunteering with XXXX camps, I do not find that this establishes that he was either high profile or a known community leader.\n[43] Furthermore, the claimant has not engaged in explicit anti-guerrilla activities. There is no evidence that the claimant has publicly advocated against FARC recruitment or ideology. He is not a teacher, politician, or lawyer and cannot be considered to be a human rights activist. I have found no evidence in the independent documentation before me of a circumstance in which a person with a profile like his, who has not previously been known for work opposing the FARC, is not a displaced person from FARC-dominated regions of the country, and who had a one-time encounter with FARC agents, was identified as a \"military target\" by the FARC. In this case the claimant's allegations generally run counter to available documentary evidence and therefore appear improbable and lacking in credibility.31\n[44] With respect to the claimants' overall credibility regarding the essential elements of their claim, their evidence is therefore inconsistent from the documentary evidence regarding FARC forced recruitment methods. The claimants' allegations included inconsistencies and omissions. Their descriptions of their reasoning behind their delay in departure from Colombia did not provide satisfactory explanations for their actions. These concerns lead me to conclude that the claimants are not credible in their allegation that they are targeted by the FARC as a result of the son's refusal to comply with a recruitment attempt.\n[45] Having found the claimants to not be credible with regard to the essential elements of their claims that they face a serious possibility of persecution or risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment from the FARC in Colombia, I have considered whether there is any residual evidence to support a claim for refugee protection, including whether there are problems in Colombia based on race. Race was not proposed by counsel as a potential nexus in the claim when I canvassed nexus with him at the beginning of the hearing. Neither had this matter been raised in the original hearing The father did not raise this issue either in his BOC or in testimony until I questioned him at the hearing about whether he or his family had experienced any discriminatory treatment in Colombia based on any other factors besides their alleged issues with the FARC. The father then offered the general comment that in Colombia, there is much racial discrimination because Afro Colombians are a minority who have always felt rejection in their country. When I asked the claimant if he could describe any ways that might impact him in his ability to return to his country, he initially provided only the general response, but eventually stated that his race impacted his ability to move around, to get employment, and that when an Afro Colombian person submitted a denunciation, the police would not pay attention to him.\n[46] I realize that there is documentary evidence regarding discrimination faced by Afro Colombians and I wanted to raise this question at the hearing because of such evidence in the documents.32 However, the father's own evidence about specific concerns in his own personal situation rose only after being prompted for potential examples. With respect to employment issues, this was in response to a leading question from me, meant to spark additional spontaneous areas that he might identify. With respect to ability to move and treatment by police, these were two matters that were brought up in detail by counsel when he raised concerns about the question, prior to the claimant being able to answer the question. As I pointed out to counsel in the course of the questioning, once an issue has been highlighted by counsel as a potential aspect of discrimination, I am unable to give the same weight to the claimant's testimony about these matters as I would have had it been a spontaneous response. I therefore give little weight to the father's responses in this regard. The claimants did not spontaneously describe other specific concerns in Colombia on this basis.\n[47] Although it is not necessary for claimants to themselves raise potential grounds for persecution in order for the Board to consider evidence about such residual bases for a refugee claim, it is still relevant that the claimants had not raised the issue of racial discrimination in their narratives or as a potential basis of the claim until I asked about this matter, as it appears that they had not personally endured significant issues on this basis. Specifically with respect to state protection, even though country documents do describe discriminatory attitudes on the part of police, in the claimants' cases, according to their evidence, they had never previously tried to seek assistance from police for any matter in their country. There is no corroborative evidence of the father's one alleged attempt to secure police assistance, and-given my findings regarding credibility-I conclude that this alleged attempt to seek state protection is likely not credible. Furthermore, even in the father's testimony about this alleged police visit, he repeatedly stated that it was the lack of physical evidence available and the general issue of corruption among the police that resulted in his report allegedly not being taken, not anything to do with his being Afro Colombian. He did not give a personal description of previous circumstances in trying to seek help from police in his country that would support his comment that there was a racial discrimination problem with his access to police protection or the ability to file a report to police.\n[48] Although I do not doubt that those claimants who are Afro Colombian may have experienced some impact in Colombia from the general discriminatory attitudes toward Afro Colombians, described by the father as a general \"rejection\" of Afro Colombians, I do not find that the claimants' own circumstances demonstrate that their own access to state protection is limited by their race. No other specific issues were raised that would demonstrate that in the claimants' particular circumstances they would face treatment that would constitute persecution or that they would face a personal risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in their country based on race.\n[49] In this case therefore, because I find that the claimants were not credible in their allegations, there is insufficient additional evidence that would provide a well-founded fear of persecution or a foundation for establishing a personal risk to life, or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or danger of torture for the claimants pursuant to section 96 or 97 of the Act.\nCONCLUSION\n[50] For the foregoing reasons, I conclude that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection and I therefore reject their claims.\n(signed)\n\"Lucinda Bruin\"\nLucinda Bruin\nMay 30, 2016\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibits 2.1, 2.2, & 10.\n3 Exhibit 11.1.\n4 Exhibit 7, pp. 8, 16-17.\n5 Exhibit 11.4.\n6 Exhibit 13, p. 19.\n7 Feng v.

They claim to be Convention refugees and persons in need of protection.\n[2] Ms. XXXX XXXX was appointed as the designated representative for the minor claimant in writing in advance of the hearing.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] For the following reasons the Panel determines that the Claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. The determinative issue is credibility.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The following is a summary of allegations written in the Claimants' Basis of Claim Forms (BOCs). The Claimants allege that on XXXX XXXX, 2015, Mr. XXXX XXXX had drinks with an old friend who brought along two men unknown to Mr. XXXX XXXX. These men proposed that Ms. XXXX XXXX use her employment at XXXX XXXX to transport two suitcases from Bogota to Cali. Mr. XXXX XXXX suspected that these suitcases would contain contraband and refused. These men became angry and Mr. XXXX XXXX left. The next day Mr. XXXX XXXX received an anonymous phone call telling him to do as he was told and that he \"should not mess with the FARC\" or he will \"face consequences.\" Mr. XXXX XXXX immediately feared for his life. The next day he reported the incident to the Attorney General's office. He received a protection order which he then delivered to the local police, who filed the report on XXXX XXXX, 2015.\n[5] It is alleged that on XXXX XXXX, 2015, Mr. XXXX XXXX was attacked on his way to the bus station. He was knocked unconscious and woke up in the hospital. He was so badly bruised that he had to take XXXX days off work. After the assault Mr. XXXX XXXX told his spouse that he had been threatened back in XXXX. At this point the Claimants began making plans to get themselves to safety. They \"went into hiding.\" In the middle of XXXX they decided to flee Colombia. They had pre-existing US visas and flew to New York where they were admitted on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015. They made refugee claims at the Canadian border on December 12, 2015. They were found eligible under an exception to the Safe Third Country Agreement.\nIDENTITY\n[6] Based on their passports the Panel is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Claimants are who they say they are and that they are nationals of Colombia.\nANALYSIS\n[7] The hearing took place over two sittings, on February 17, 2016, and March 31, 2016.\n[8] In advance of the first sitting the Panel submitted a request to a research officer using a Social Media Information Request form. This generated a significant volume of posts on a Facebook account under Mr. XXXX XXXX name.1 All of these posts were available to the research staff using a computer and a regular internet connection, the same as if they were a member of the public. Mr. XXXX XXXX was shown the results and testified at the outset of the hearing that this Facebook account belongs to him and that he posted the photos. One group of photos was posted on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015, and shows Mr. XXXX XXXX on an XXXX and at some sort of social event.2 When asked about these photos Mr. XXXX XXXX testified that he took a trip with his sister to XXXX, Colombia for three days to celebrate their mother's birthday.\n[9] The Panel asked Mr. XXXX XXXX how he felt after he received the phone threat on XXXX XXXX, 2015. He testified that he felt that his life was in danger. He testified that he also felt that the lives of his wife and child were in danger at that point. He reported the threat to the police but testified that he was not aware of any protection provided by the police; they simply received the protection order and sent him home. He never followed up and the police never came to his home. The Panel asked the Claimant, given his personal knowledge of the FARC and the circumstances in which he found himself, what level of police protection he thought would be necessary to keep his family safe after the phone threat. He testified that he believed that a 24-hr police presence at his home would be necessary. The Panel asked Mr. XXXX XXXX why, if this were the situation, and if the police never even once came to his home, he would leave his wife and child vulnerable at home while he traveled with his sister after the phone threat. He responded that the purpose of the trip was to celebrate his mother's birthday. The Panel asked him if he did anything to ensure the safety of his wife and child before he left on this trip. He testified that he did not tell his wife about the threats. The Panel asked him if he thought it made sense for him to leave his wife and child at home without them even knowing that they were in danger, and with no protection. He testified that the problem started when he was beaten up. Asked to clarify when he believes his problem started, Mr. XXXX XXXX testified that in Colombia nobody believes that they will be safe just because they have reported someone to the police. He testified that his fear really set in after the physical assault in XXXX.\n[10] Mr. XXXX XXXX testified that the photo of him on the airplane was taken on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015. The Panel noted that this photo, as well as several of the ones that show him at the social event, indicate that he is in the city of Arauca. The Panel asked Mr. XXXX XXXX if it was his intention to make visible the fact that he was present in that city. He answered in the affirmative. The Panel asked Mr. XXXX XXXX why he would publicly identify the place to which he was traveling at the time he apparently believed he was in danger from the FARC. He testified that the pictures were posted by his sister. However, when he was shown that they are in his own account and his own photo album, he acknowledged that they are in his account, not his sister's. The Panel then asked him if he understands why it is a concern that he would make posts showing, first, where he can be found at that moment, and second, the fact that his family was at that moment alone without his protection. He answered in the affirmative. The Panel asked him if he could explain why he did this. He testified that when he publishes photos on Facebook, the more \"likes\" are received from other Facebook users, the more famous he feels. As for the danger, he testified that he was going because of his mother's birthday and also to tell her about the threats. The Panel asked him why he did not just tell her on the phone. He testified that he does not like telling her about personal problems on the phone.\n[11] Mr. XXXX XXXX Facebook account also shows a number of photos dated XXXX XXXX, 2015, which is the day after her was allegedly beaten to the point that he had to be hospitalized, and which caused him to go into hiding. These photos show Mr. XXXX XXXX at another social event. Asked to explain them, Mr. XXXX XXXX testified that he posted these photographs to Facebook on XXXX XXXX, 2015, but that they were actually taken at his son's baptism one year earlier. The Panel asked him why he decided to post them on XXXX XXXX, and he testified that he was afraid that something may happen to him and that he would like to leave mementoes. The Panel asked him about a second group of photos which are dated XXXX XXXX, 2012, which is the day before he was allegedly beaten. He testified that these were indeed posted on XXXX XXXX, but that they were taken at the baptism a year earlier. The Panel asked him why he posted these on XXXX XXXX and he testified that it was the same motivation as the photos posted on XXXX XXXX. The Panel asked him if he was looking to leave mementoes even before he was beaten. He answered in the negative, adding that the photos were posted on different dates. The Panel pointed out to him that he had not been assaulted on XXXX XXXX, to which he responded that the event at which he is pictured happened the year before, and that he posted the photos after his assault. The Panel asked Mr. XXXX XXXX why he decided to post photos on XXXX XXXX. He again testified that he wanted to leave mementoes. He added that before the photos were posted he did not know what was going to happen to him. Finding his overall evidence in this area unclear, the Panel asked him why he decided to post these year-old photos on XXXX XXXX, to which he responded that it was because on that day he remembered that he had these photos on his camera. The Panel asked Mr. XXXX XXXX if he posted any photos of this event at the time the event actually took place and he answered in the negative.\n[12] At the second sitting of the hearing Mr. XXXX XXXX was questioned by his counsel. He testified that only at the first sitting did he realize that his Facebook photos are viewable to the public, and that before the first sitting he believed that his photos were visible only to his Facebook \"friends.\" The Panel asked Mr. XXXX XXXX if he had changed his settings since the first sitting to make his photos private. He testified that he has not done this. As to why, he testified that he believed that the Panel would think he was trying to hide something if he made the photos private after the first sitting. Counsel asked the Claimant if he also left the photos public because he is confident that he is telling the truth, and that he will be given refugee status and will not have to return to Colombia. Mr. XXXX XXXX happily adopted this suggestion and testified that this is the reason he did not make the photos private after the first sitting. Counsel also suggested that the friend who asked him to transport the suitcases may have already seen Mr. XXXX XXXX Facebook account before the threat was made. Mr. XXXX XXXX also adopted this suggestion. Counsel then asked Mr. XXXX XXXX if, given that he has not yet been accepted, it would be a good idea to make the photos private. He testified that he had discussed the idea with his wife and they have decided to take the account down, as his wife has been telling him that he is married to her and not married to Facebook. Counsel re-directed Mr. XXXX XXXX attention to the risk posed by making his photos public, and asked him if he now understands that FARC could use this information to hurt him. He testified that he understands this. Asked if he realized this before, he testified that he did not think it was dangerous when everything was taking place.\n[13] The Panel asked Mr. XXXX XXXX if he believes his remaining family in Colombia is at risk now that he has defied the FARC and fled the country. He testified that they are in danger. The Panel pointed out that some of his publicly-posted photos identify several family members, such as his sister XXXX, by name, location, and appearance. The Panel asked Mr. XXXX XXXX if he truly believes it was better to leave this information about his family public after the first sitting out of fear that the Panel would think he is hiding something if he made these photos private. He testified that now he thinks it is a mistake.\n[14] The Panel does not find Mr. XXXX XXXX credible in the above areas. The Panel finds that in several areas his evidence is nonsensical and implausible. It does not make sense that he would travel out of his city and leave his wife and son vulnerable at a time when he believed they were in danger. It was no laughing matter at the time, as Mr. XXXX XXXX testified that the risk was so great that only 24-hr police protection at his home would make his family safe. When asked why he left them at home he offered the non-credible explanation that he was going to celebrate his mother's birthday. Asked about whether he did anything to ensure their safety, he testified that he did not tell his wife about the danger. This is patently nonsensical as not telling her would only serve to aggravate the danger she faced. When questioned further, and when the absurdity of his evidence no-doubt dawned on him, he changed his evidence and testified that the threat only set in after he had been assaulted. In the Panel's view this was simply an attempt to adjust his evidence to make it more favourable. The Panel draws a negative inference.\n[15] Further doubt is cast on Mr. XXXX XXXX credibility by his Facebook posts of his trip in XXXX 2015. The Panel does not accept that he only realized at the first sitting that the photos were public and that before this he believed they were private. This is because he only professed this error only at the second sitting. He was questioned extensively at the first sitting about why he posted the photos in a public way that FARC could see. First he claimed that they were posted by his sister, a position from which he had to resile when it was pointed out that they were in his own album. Then he testified that he feels more famous when his photos get more \"likes\" and that he was going to see his mother. If he did not realize that these photos were public at the time he posted them, in the Panel's view he would have mentioned this at the first sitting. This revelation only at the second sitting indicates to the Panel that the explanation is false. Furthermore, if Mr. XXXX XXXX were traveling at a time when he was in danger and posting photos indicating where he is going and the fact that his family is now alone, he would have taken care to ensure that his photos were not public for FARC to see. The Panel draws a negative inference.\n[16] The Panel also draws a negative inference from the photos that Mr. XXXX XXXX posted to Facebook the day before and the day after his beating. In this area his testimony was confusing and nonsensical. To begin, in the Panel's view it is not believable that Mr. XXXX XXXX, at a time when he is under heightened danger and going into hiding, would pause to publicly post photos to Facebook as mementoes. Furthermore, this explanation becomes even more difficult to believe when it is revealed that he also posted photos of this event the day before the beating. It does not make sense, if he posted photos on the 10th and was beaten the next day, that the day after his beating he would sit down to publicly post even more photos. In addition, his evidence was confusing. He first testified that he posted photos on the XXXX because he wanted to leave mementoes in case he were killed. If this were true, it makes his trip to his mother's birthday even more unbelievable, as it makes no sense that he would leave his family alone if he also thought he could be killed any time. His eventual evidence is that he posted the photos on the XXXX because on that day he happened to remember that they were on his camera. At the second sitting Mr. XXXX XXXX photos were still publicly available on Facebook. The Panel finds not credible his explanation that he believed the Panel would think he is hiding something by making the photos private. This is especially the case since he has left photos identifying his family members visible for everyone, including the FARC, to see. For what it is worth, the Panel rejects the explanations that were given in response to leading and suggestive questions by counsel. Mr. XXXX XXXX is an educated and otherwise rational man who had ample opportunity to formulate his own explanations.\n[17] The Panel asked Ms. XXXX XXXX at what time she and her husband decided that the family must leave Colombia to be safe. She testified that this decision was made when her husband was assaulted. She testified that her husband started working from home, out of fear. The Panel asked Ms. XXXX XXXX if her son continued attending school between the assault and their departure from Colombia. She testified that he did go to school during this period, and she added that he had transportation to and from school, namely a bus that carried about eight children. The Panel asked her if she thinks that FARC will hurt her son if they return to Colombia and she answered in the affirmative. The Panel asked her if she thinks her son was safe while he continued going to school after the assault. She testified that she does not know. At the second sitting Counsel asked Ms. XXXX XXXX if, now that she has thought about it, whether there was a danger in sending her son to school after the assault. She testified that after analyzing the situation, she believes that it was dangerous for him to be sent to school in this way.\n[18] The Panel does not find it credible that the minor claimant continued going to school after the assault, at a time when, according to their BOCs, the Claimants were \"in hiding.\" If the Claimants' allegations were true, it would not take hindsight to realize that it would be dangerous to send the minor to school at a time when the FARC was a threat to the entire family. Any rational person in the Claimants' shoes would recoil from the idea of sending their child to school on the school bus when the FARC is escalating their violence and the family is continuing to defy FARC by not carrying the suitcases as requested. The Claimants' conduct in this regard is entirely inconsistent with their alleged fear. The Panel draws a negative inference.\n[19] The foregoing analysis casts serious doubt on the Claimants' allegations that Mr. XXXX XXXX was threatened on XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX 2015, and that he was assaulted and hospitalized on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015. The Claimants have acted contrary to their alleged fear. They have also offered non-credible, evasive, and nonsensical testimony when asked to explain problems in their evidence. In the face of this, the Panel must assess the Claimants' personal documentary evidence and decide, on a balance of probabilities, whether Mr. XXXX XXXX was threatened and assaulted by the FARC. These documents consist of criminal complaints and a police protection document arising from the threat, and several medical documents arising from the alleged assault.3 These documents have no flaws on their face. The Panel also acknowledgeds that Mr. XXXX XXXX consented to the verification of these documents with their issuing authorities. However, the Panel was informed by the Research Directorate that they are not able to verify the authenticity of official documents in Colombia.\n[20] There is significant and recent authority from the Federal Court for the proposition that, if there are reasons to find central allegations to be fraudulent, then documents purporting to corroborate those allegations may be dismissed as fraudulent or that they may be assigned little weight.4 This is entirely sensible as all manner of fraudulent documents can be produced to corroborate false allegations. This is why the presumption that official documents are genuine is a rebuttable presumption. Following this jurisprudence, the Panel rejects the Claimants' documents, or would in the alternative assign them little weight. In the Panel's view the problems identified with the Claimant's testimony and their actions lead to a conclusion that the alleged threat and assault are fictitious. What else would explain why Mr. XXXX XXXX left his family in danger and made public postings about his whereabouts when under threats from the FARC? What else would explain his unbelievable Facebook postings the day before and after his alleged assault? What else would explain why, at a time of even greater danger, the Claimants allowed their son to continue to going to school with no extra measures to ensure his safety? How else could the Panel interpret the nonsensical and evolving explanations offered by the Claimants? The only sensible explanation is that the allegations are false.\n[21] In the alternative, the Panel would find that Mr. XXXX XXXX police reports were genuinely-issued but that they are based on a false account that he provided to the police. The reports are, strictly speaking, only evidence of statements made by Mr. XXXX XXXX to the police, not evidence of anything the police found independently during an investigation. Police reports that simply reflect a claimant's statements have little probative value where there are very serious reasons to disbelieve that claimant. The medical reports, if genuine, reflect that the Claimant was assaulted, but they do not corroborate that the FARC played a role. Therefore, Mr. XXXX XXXX testimony must be accepted and believed in order for these medical reports to corroborate an assault by the FARC. Since there are serious reasons to disbelieve Mr. XXXX XXXX, the Panel can place little weight on the medical reports.\n[22] In conclusion, regardless of whether the purported police and medical documents are rejected outright or assessed in terms of weight or specific probative value, the Panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the Claimants are not credible and that, on a balance of probabilities, their allegations are false. The Panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that Mr. XXXX XXXX was never asked to transport the suitcases and that he was not threatened or assaulted by the FARC. The Panel finds that there is insufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to establish these allegations on a balance of probabilities.\n[23] The claims are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"K.

My reasons are as follows.\nANALYSIS\n[4] The determinative issue in this case is credibility.\nIdentity\n[5] The claimant's identity as a national of Georgia is established by the supporting documentation filed.2\nCredibility\nOmission of Nikom from his BOC\n[6] In his BOC, the claimant only states that he was in one relationship in Georgia with a man named XXXX XXXX. At the hearing however, the claimant stated that he was also in an 8-month relationship with a man by the name of XXXX. The claimant was asked why he did not mention his relationship with XXXX in his BOC and the claimant stated that he did not think this relationship was important because it was a secret relationship and the relationship did not give him any problems in Georgia.\n[7] I do not find it reasonable that the claimant would not include this relationship in his BOC. I find an eight-month relationship with a man that the claimant had to keep secret out of fear of persecution to be a material component of his claim. In view of this, I draw a negative inference from the claimant failing to include this in his BOC and find that it undermines his credibility.\nContradiction in the year he met XXXX\n[8] In his BOC, the claimant alleges that he met XXXX in 2011, however, at the hearing the claimant stated that he met XXXX in 2013 while working for the XXXX company. The claimant was asked about this contradiction and he stated that there was a mistake in his BOC. He was asked if he reviewed his BOC prior to submitting it and he stated that yes he did, however he did not notice the error. I do not accept this explanation as I do not believe that the contradiction is the result in an error in the BOC. The claimant reviewed the BOC before he submitted it to the Board. Subsequent to submitting his BOC, the claimant also submitted an additional narrative where he elaborated on his allegations; in this narrative he maintains that he met XXXX in 2011. Subsequent to submitting this narrative he also submitted an \"amplified narrative\" whereby he tied his allegations to the evidence he had submitted; the claimant did not correct the date at this time.3 Given the ample opportunity provided to the claimant to correct this date and his failure to do so, I find that the date in the BOC was not an error. Rather, I find that the claimant's inability to remember that date at the hearing was the problem. As such, I find his contradiction undermines his credibility and the credibility of his allegations.\n[9] In addition to having stated that he met XXXX in 2013, the claimant also stated that he met him while working at XXXX. According to the claimant's immigration records the claimant was unemployed from May 2009 until coming to Canada. There is no mention under his personal history of having worked for XXXX. In light of the claimant's two-year contradiction as to the date on which he met XXXX, I find this inconsistency further undermines the claimant's allegations.\nLength of time he dated XXXX\n[10] At paragraph three of the claimant's BOC the claimant states that he met his boyfriend XXXX in 2011 and that he later developed a romantic relationship. In the next paragraph the claimant states that on 17 May 2013 he and XXXX participated in the International Pride parade. The claimant does not mention in his BOC when his relationship with XXXX officially began or ended.\n[11] At the hearing the claimant was asked about the length of time he dated XXXX and the claimant stated \"we continued to date for a long time.\" The claimant was asked how long, and rather than answer the question directly, the claimant stated that 'they have not had a lot of contact since he left Georgia and that they were not dating all the time.' Later during the hearing the claimant reluctantly stated that he and XXXX broke up prior to him coming to Canada.\n[12] I find the claimant's evasiveness and lack of spontaneity indicates a lack of credibility. Given that the claimant was able to remember that he allegedly dated XXXX for 8 months, and that this relationship was allegedly not important, I do not find it reasonable that he would not remember the length of time he was allegedly in the most meaningful and important relationship to his claim. As such, I draw a negative inference and find his inability to give an approximate date as to the length of his relationship with XXXX undermines the credibility of his allegations.\nLack of evidence to support his relationship with XXXX\n[13] The claimant alleges to have been dating XXXX for \"a long time,\" however he has no documentation to support the relationship. The claimant was asked if he had any evidence and he stated that he did not because they were trying to keep things confidential. The claimant was asked about text messages and he stated that they were texting each other but were erasing the messages because they did not want to be detected.\n[14] In many countries and in most circumstances I do find this to be reasonable, however in the case of the claimant I do not. The main reason is that according to the evidence the claimant was not necessarily hiding his sexuality. According to his oral testimony he allegedly was assisting a LGBTI organization in preparations for Gay Pride Parades and participating, on more than one occasion, in these parades with his partner.4 I do not find this to be evidence of a person who is actively trying to hide their sexuality from the people and the community around them. In fact, I find this to be the actions of a person who is proud of who they are, so much so, that they are willing to attend a public event with their gay partner. In light of this, I find his efforts to hide his text messages and other communications between the two of them to be inconsistent with his other activities as a bisexual man. I did ask him about this inconsistency and did not find his response to be clear or convincing and therefore it did not overcome the concern.\n[15] In addition to this, I find the claimant's oral evidence with reference to his relationship with XXXX to be tainted with credibility problems and therefore I find it all the more necessary that he provide something by way of documentation to show that XXXX exists. Therefore he was asked what efforts he made to contact XXXX to obtain evidence and the claimant stated that he had made no efforts. When asked why, he stated that he did not have XXXX contact information. I do not find this to be acceptable. In 2015, the internet provides us with a vast amount of resources by which to look someone up, the claimants failure to even attempt this, leads me to doubt the credibility of XXXX existence. Plus, the claimant provided no reasons as to why, after being with this man for a \"long time,\" he would no longer have his contact information, including social networking. In light of the credibility concerns already identified, I find the claimant's lack of documentation undermines the credibility of the relationship. I also find that any attempt to remedy the lack of evidence, particularly after two sittings and one year in the country, has been undermined not only by this temporal lapse but also by the forgoing testimony.\nClaimant's association with IDENTOBA\n[16] In his BOC the claimant alleges that on 17 May 2013 he was brutally beaten while participating in the International Pride parade. In support of this allegation, the claimant submitted a letter from IDENTOBA, an LGBTI organization which organized the parade in Georgia. In this letter, the \"Acting Executing (sic) Director\" XXXX XXXX writes, \"...it can be said directly, that the participants of our demonstration could hardly escape from death. Those, who could not escape were severely beaten and insulted. Among them was one of our supporters XXXX XXXX XXXX\"5 When asked about his support for this organization the claimant stated that he only associated with IDENTOBA on this one occasion and that he had asked his brother to obtain the letter. The claimant was not able to provide any names of people who worked for IDENTOBA, including XXXX XXXX. In light of this, the claimant was asked how the organization knew who he was in order to write the letter. The claimant stated that they had names of those who had participated in the parade. He was asked if there was any other reason that they would know him personally and he stated that they also had parades in October.\n[17] It was at this time that the panel drew the claimant's attention to the letter, and read XXXX XXXX statement, \"later we (IDENTOBA) visited him (the claimant) at the hospital, he had very severe injuries.\"6 The claimant was then asked why he did not provide the example of the organization having visited him at the hospital as evidenced that they knew him more than his participation at parades. The claimant replied that he was unconscious when they arrived at the hospital. I did not find this response to be acceptable as I did not see it having any bearing as to why he neglected to mention their visit at the hearing; particularly since it is specifically mentioned in the evidence that he rendered before the Board. As such, I again asked the claimant why he would not mention such an important fact when asked how IDENTOBA personally knew him. The claimant replied that he was waiting to mention it. I do not find this explanation to be acceptable. The claimant was asked several questions relating to his relationship with IDENTOBA and at no time did he mention that the organization visited him in the hospital, rather he opted to provide an example that was not in the evidence (that being his participation in a gay pride parade in October). I draw a negative inference from this and find that it undermines his credibility and the credibility of the letter.\n[18] I find the claimant had very little knowledge of IDENTOBA, including knowledge of anyone who works with the organization. I also find that the claimant failed to readily recall an important piece of his own evidence, that being IDENTOBA's visit to him in the hospital. By doing so, I find that the claimant has undermined his credibility and the credibility of his evidence and allegations.\nInconsistency as to when the phone calls began\n[19] At the hearing the claimant alleged that after his sexuality was discovered in May 2013 he started to receive threatening anonymous telephone calls. However, in his BOC the claimant alleged that the threatening phone calls began after the second incident in June 2013. The claimant was asked about this inconsistency and he stated that the phone calls occurred after both the first and second physical attack. The claimant was asked if this were true why he did not write it as such in his BOC. The claimant stated that he wrote it this way because the phone calls became more frequent after the June 2013 incident.\n[20] I do not accept the claimant's reasons for the inconsistency as to when the phone calls began. I find that if the phone calls began in May 2013 he would have wrote it as such, I do not find that the frequency at which they occurred would have detracted from the fact that they were occurring. As such, I find the inconsistency was not resolved and therefore undermines his credibility and the credibility of his allegations.\nOmission of vandalism on his door\n[21] At the hearing the claimant alleged that after he was attacked in June 2013, the door of his home was vandalized with \"insulting writings.\" While his BOC does mention receiving threats in writing, there is no mention in his BOC of receiving these \"writings\" on the door of his home. The claimant was asked why he did not mention that his home was vandalized and he stated that he wrote that people where threatening him in writing but did not think it was important to include that it was on his home. I do not find this explanation to be reasonable as I find it both important and material to distinguish between threats in writing and threats written on his front door. If one reads his BOC the impression is that he was receiving threatening telephone calls and handwritten letters. There is no indication that the claimant's home was being vandalized with derogatory or degrading words. I draw a negative inference from this omission as I find it to be both material and important. I find that if people where vandalizing the claimant's home with derogatory or degrading words it would be included in his BOC. The omission of such allegations impeaches the credibility of his claim.\nOmission of the use of a weapon on XXXX XXXX 2013\n[22] When asked to recall the attack he experienced on XXXX XXXX 2013 the claimant alleged that he was threatened with a knife. The claimant does not mention this in his BOC. The claimant was asked why he did not include that the attackers had a knife and he stated that he knew he had to be brief. When asked who told him this, he replied that his lawyer told him to only include the main incidents and what happened. He further added that he did not know it was that important and believed he could just state it at the hearing.\n[23] I am not persuaded by this explanation as the claimant did include that his attackers used a knife to threaten him during the XXXX 2014 attack. In light of this inclusion I reject all of the claimant's explanations for not including this detail in his account of the XXXX XXXX 2013 attack. It is clear from the BOC that the claimant is aware of the importance of including such a detail and therefore I find this omission to be material and draw a negative inference from the claimant only mentioning it at the hearing.\n[24] In light of the major omissions, contradictions and inconsistencies between the claimant's oral, written and documentary evidence, I find the claimant not to be a credible witness and do not believe what he has alleged in support of his claim. Therefore I find that he is not a bisexual man and therefore will not face persecution or a risk to his life should he return to Georgia.\nCONCLUSION\n[25] Having considered all of the evidence, the Panel determines that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection pursuant to Section 96 and subsection 97(1) of IRPA.\n[26] The Refugee Protection Division therefore rejects his claim for refugee protection.\nNO CREDIBLE BASIS\n[27] HHHHHHHaving found the claimant to be lacking in credibility with relation to the central element of his claim, that being his sexual orientation, the panel also finds that pursuant to section 107(2) of the IRPA, there was no credible or trustworthy evidence upon which a favourable decision could have been made and therefore, there is no credible basis for the claim.\n(signed)\n\"J.

She and her family had been targeted by state officials, having been perceived, due to their ethnicity, to be associated with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).\n[4] The claimant's husband was taken by authorities on XXXX XXXX, 2009, two days after he and the claimant and their families were relocated to Vavuniya National College of Education, where they were housed in a camp for displaced persons.\n[5] On the same date that her husband was taken, the claimant went to the nearby army camp to enquire about him, but officials refused to give her any information.\n[6] In 2010, the claimant and her family were resettled to the Vanni area. In that year, the claimant and her father went to the XXXX police station to enquire about her husband. They did not receive assistance and were instead detained in separate rooms by the police, who accused them and the claimant's husband of having connections to the LTTE. The two officers who were with the claimant approached her closely. One held her hand while the other pulled her hair and touched her breast. When she screamed, the claimant was slapped and she fell to the floor and begged that she not be abused. In an ensuing struggle, her top was ripped and she was beaten and left in the room. Four hours later, a higher officer told her and her father to go home and to expect a telephone call. In the call that ensued, the claimant's father was told to pay 250,000 Rupees for the release of his son-in-law. The money was paid, but the claimant's husband was not released. He has not been seen since he was taken away.\n[7] In January 2015, the claimant heard from people in her village that the newly elected government had announced its intention to release many detainees captured by the previous government. She therefore returned to the XXXX police station, where she provided a photograph of her husband and a letter appealing for his release. She was instead humiliated by a police officer, who behaved in an unacceptable way, threatening that she should not return and discarding her letter in the garbage.\n[8] The claimant also was targeted by military men who were housed in an army training camp in front of her residence. They would force their way into her house at night and cause trouble.\n[9] On one specific night, on XXXX XXXX, 2015, three men from the camp searched her house, asked for her name, checked her identity card, questioned her about why she has been searching for her husband, and, accused her husband of being associated with the LTTE. Two of the men locked her family members inside one room, leaving the claimant vulnerable to them. The claimant ran outside to scream for help. The three men left when neighbours put on their lights and approached the house. One of the men warned the claimant that he would be back to teach her a \"good lesson for opposing them.\"\n[10] On the advice of her parents, the claimant fled Sri Lanka. She left on May 25, 2015. According to other documentary evidence,3 the claimant was detained in the U.S.A. upon entering that country illegally on June 8, 2015 from Mexico. The claimant's sister and brother-in-law are in Canada and they paid for her release on bond. On August 27, 2015, the claimant presented herself to the Fort Erie Port of Entry, where she made her claim for refugee protection.\n[11] The claimant fears that if she were to return to Sri Lanka she would be arrested and detained, and therefore beaten and sexually assaulted, and that she could also be made to disappear.\nDETERMINATIVE ISSUE\n[12] The claimant has established her identity on a balance of probabilities. Although she did not produce a passport, she provided consistent information about her identity to U.S.A. officials, as indicated by the biometrics report that was received. Though the claimant's surname of XXXX has been parsed therein by U.S.A. officials as SITH for the surname, and XXXX as being one of two first names (the other being XXXX),4 I do not view this as a material inconsistency but rather reflecting the absence of any disclosure to U.S.A. officials regarding her identity, as indicated in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Record of Sworn Statement in Proceedings under Section 235(1)(b) of the Act (Record of Sworn Statement).5 I reach this finding because the claimant presented to the Canadian Port of Entry her Sri Lankan Identity Card and her Register of Births [the latter called a birth certificate by the Port of Entry and the claimant], with the former bearing her photograph.6 I also found the claimant's oral testimony about her identity to be consistent and therefore no valid reason presented itself to doubt the reliability of the identity documents presented to the Canadian Port of Entry.\n[13] The determinative issue in the claim is credibility.\nANALYSIS - Credibility\n[14] Evidence that is given under oath or affirmation is presumed to be true unless there is valid reason to find otherwise.7 I find that the presumption of truth of the claimant's affirmed testimony, that her husband was taken by Sri Lankan authorities and never seen again, is rebutted by material credibility issues that arose in her account, which she did not satisfactorily resolve. I therefore do not believe, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant's account of her husband's disappearance and the alleged incidents that were linked to the alleged disappearance, including: the claimant's (and her father's) search for her husband at military and police offices; their maltreatment by such authorities; the allegation that authorities accused them of being associated with the LTTE; the harassment conducted by military personnel that were housed in an army camp near the claimant's home [the claimant tied the alleged XXXX XXXX, 2015 incident to the account of her missing husband, alleging that the intruding soldiers asked her why she was searching for her husband]; and, that the military has made enquiries concerning the claimant's whereabouts.\n[15] In reaching my assessment of the credibility of the claimant's account, I took into consideration: the totality of the evidence adduced, including the psychological report that was presented;8 the claimant's counsel's submissions; and, the IRB Chairperson's Guidelines on Women Refugee claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution (Gender Guidelines).9\n[16] With regard to the Gender Guidelines, I kept in mind that the claimant may face special problems in demonstrating that her claim is credible and trustworthy. For example, I considered that she may have difficulty when providing testimony on sensitive matters, such as those relating to the alleged sexual assault at the police station and the encounter in her home with the men from the military training camp. I therefore focussed my questions on the circumstances that were alleged to have led to sexual assault, rather than on details of an assault. I also kept in mind the claimant's cultural and educational background. She is not well-educated and hails from a country that was affected by civil war, in which human rights abuses continue, including against women. The country condition documentation therefore lends plausibility to her account. However, the credibility issues that arose in the claimant's claim are so material that they are not allayed by such factors.\n[17] With regard to the psychological report, I considered that the account for fearing persecution relayed therein is substantially consistent with the claimant's BOC Form account.\n[18] However, as indicated in the report by the clinical psychologist who met with the claimant, he also reviewed the claimant's BOC Form narrative account. It is difficult to understand from the report what arises from his review of the written account and what arises from a direct review with the claimant. His summary10 of the claimant's experiences appears largely to paraphrase the written narrative, with the following information having been provided that I presume originated with the claimant: her husband was never involved in any political activity; \"he was a quiet and gentle man, who operated a farm;\" she was \"holding the feet of the two men\" who had taken him away when she was pleading with them for his release; her husband was crying and screaming as he was pulled away by the men; she was re-traumatized by her experience with officials in the U.S.A.; she has indicated how she presently feels; and, what she fears could happen to her.\n[19] I also observe, in regard to other documentation stated in the report to have been reviewed by the clinical psychologist, that no reference is made to the Canadian Port of Entry interview or to the interviews that were conducted by U.S.A. officials. Also, no indication is given within the report that the claimant was asked if she had ever provided an account that is inconsistent to that which was presented to the psychologist. In this regard, the psychologist indicates that: \"In the event that subsequent evidence suggests that information provided is incomplete or inaccurate, then my diagnosis, comments, recommendations and opinions expressed in the report may change.\" As indicated in my reasons, there are material inconsistencies between the claimant's written account and the Canadian port of entry account; the claimant's written account and the account of the U.S.A. interviews; and, the Canadian port of entry account and the account of the U.S.A. interviews. The clinical psychologist therefore did not have an awareness of such inconsistencies when providing his opinion.\nMaterial inconsistencies in the account of the claimant's husband's disappearance\nAs between the oral and BOC Form testimonies, and, the daughter's Register of Births\n[20] As indicated in her BOC Form, the claimant testified that her husband was taken by authorities on XXXX XXXX, 2009. Her testimony as to why she is able to recall this date is also consistent with her BOC Form. She testified that she recalls the date because he was taken on the second day after she and her husband were taken to the camp [in the context of the BOC Form, to the Vavuniya National College of Education]. The claimant testified that her husband has not been seen since he was taken by the authorities on that date and that there has been no news of him. The claimant also testified that her husband had been taken before their daughter XXXX was born and that he has not seen their daughter.\n[21] The claimant's BOC Form testimony and oral testimony regarding her husband's disappearance is inconsistent with the information in the Register of Births [which the claimant has called in her documentary index a birth certificate], that she provided in regard to her daughter.11 The claimant said that the Register of Births was sent to her in Canada by her father. According to this document, the claimant's daughter was born on XXXX XXXX, 2009 and her birth was registered on XXXX XXXX, 2009. The claimant confirmed the date of her daughter's birth in oral testimony and this date of birth is also provided in Question 5 of the claimant's BOC Form. The Register of Births indicates the father to be XXXX XXXX, being the same name of the claimant's husband as provided by the claimant in oral testimony, in Question 5 of her BOC Form, and, in the written narrative.\n[22] The inconsistency that arises as between the claimant's written and oral accounts of her husband's disappearance, and, the Register of Births, is that the latter indicates that her husband was the informant of the birth for the purpose of the registration.\n[23] The claimant was asked how it could be that her husband, who disappeared on XXXX XXXX, 2009, could have been the informant for the registration of their daughter's birth, considering that their daughter was born on XXXX XXXX, 2009 and the birth was registered on XXXX XXXX, 2009. It was also the claimant's testimony, given without regard to dates, but instead, as to what occurred first, that her husband had been taken by authorities before the birth of their daughter and has not been seen or heard of since the time that he was taken.\n[24] The original language of the Register of Births was put before the claimant. The claimant acknowledged that her husband's name is given therein as the informant for their daughter's birth. She also acknowledged that the date of registration of the birth is XXXX XXXX, 2009. The claimant reiterated that she was certain that it is in XXXX that her husband was taken. The claimant explained that she did not know how it is that her husband could be the informant. She said that the army had taken her husband, she had not signed the registration for the birth, and, she had received the Register of Births by mail from her father. She said that she therefore does not know what had happened in terms of how the information that her husband was the informant came to appear on the document. She said that perhaps the police had something to do with how the birth was registered. In later testimony, given when addressing the aforementioned inconsistency in her marital status, the claimant said that perhaps the police had taken her husband to register their daughter's birth.\n[25] Since the claimant could only speculate as to why her husband is indicated to be the informant of their daughter's birth and she said that she did not otherwise know, her explanation does not satisfactorily address the material inconsistency.\n[26] For the second sitting of her hearing, the claimant produced an affidavit from her father.12 The affidavit indicates that it is her father who had provided the information to register the claimant's daughter's birth. He produced her husband's NIC to the registration office for such purpose and explained that he had come on behalf of his son-in-law, who was \"in a situation in which he is unable to make it\". The registration official therefore insisted that, since the father of the child is alive, he would be noted as having been present to provide the information for the registration of the birth.\n[27] I do not believe the claimant's father's account on a balance of probabilities. The affidavit account does not rebut the presumption of bureaucratic regularity to show it more likely than not that an official would misrepresent the informant for a registration of births by identifying a person who was not present, rather than the person who was. Bribery was not alleged in the affidavit to be a factor to induce the misrepresentation, nor some exigency.\n[28] I also do not find it credible that the claimant had no knowledge, until the first sitting, that her husband is listed as the informant for her daughter's birth. She testified that, because of her state of mind, she had not previously asked her father about who had registered her daughter's birth and learned so only when speaking to him after the first sitting of the hearing. She also acknowledged having seen the Register of Births, dated XXXX XXXX, 2015, in Sri Lanka, but that she had looked only at its first page.\n[29] The claimant's account is not in harmony with her father's affidavit, in which it is alleged that she had waited two months for her daughter's birth to be registered because she thought that her husband would return home and be present to name their daughter. This allegation in her father's affidavit reflects the claimant's awareness about the need for a registration and her active interest in wanting to delay the registration. In such circumstances, it is not credible that she would not have been aware who had attended to the registration of the birth in the place of her husband. I also do not find it credible that the claimant would not have fully reviewed the Register of the Births that was issued on January 1, 2015, if not while she was still in Sri Lanka, then, for her hearing. According to her account, this document was mailed to her by her father to produce in support of her claim. It was disclosed to the RPD on October 15, 2015. In this regard, I note that the claimant expressed her awareness of other documents provided for the hearing, such as, for example, the Canadian Port of Entry notes and the U.S.A. interview notes, which I will reference later in these reasons.\nAs between the oral and BOC Form testimonies, and, the XXXX Officer document\n[30] The claimant produced a letter from a XXXX Officer13 in which her father, as confirmed in oral testimony, undersigned the information that is provided in the upper portion of the letter. The claimant's father indicated therein, in reference to the claimant, her husband, and their daughter that: \"Future please certify that the above family had lived in this village from the year of 1995 till 2015.05.25 and they faced many displaced.\" The date of May 25, 2015 is the date on which the claimant testified that she left Sri Lanka. The claimant's father's endorsement suggests that her husband and child were living in the same village until that date and had stopped living there thereafter.\n[31] The information provided therein by the claimant's father was read to the claimant. The claimant explained that she had spoken with her father and that he had requested the letter from the XXXX Officer to confirm that she lived in the stated village until May 25, 2015. When asked to explain, in view of her answer, why her father had mentioned that her daughter and her husband had also been living there until that date, the claimant explained that he did so to confirm that her husband is the father of her daughter. When asked why the birth certificate would not be sufficient confirmation of the relationship, the claimant explained that her father wanted to also confirm so with the XXXX Officer.\n[32] I do not find the claimant's explanation to be credible. The claimant's father had already provided at the outset of his endorsement a statement that the claimant and \"his [sic] husband XXXX XXXX has a female child name XXXX.\" On the claimant's explanation, there would be no reason for her father to then go on to say that she, her husband and their daughter had lived in the village until May 25, 2015.\nAs between the oral and BOC Form testimonies, and, an interview in the U.S.A.\n[33] The claimant has maintained that her husband was taken by state authorities on XXXX XXXX, 2009. However, according to the account of the U.S.A. Credible Fear interview, the claimant stated during her interview that her husband was taken on XXXX XXXX, 2009 and that she has not seen him since.14 The hearing interpreter confirmed that there are different Tamil words for the months of February and April, with February being \"XXXX\" and April being \"XXXX\" [any spelling errors would be mine]. The claimant explained that she was handcuffed and tense during the interview. I do not find the explanation to credibly address the material inconsistency, given that the claimant was able to tell the interviewer that she and her husband were taken into the camp on February 10, 2009,15 a date that is consistent with the BOC Form narrative.\nMaterial inconsistencies in the account of the claimant's search for her husband\nAs between the oral and BOC Form testimonies, and, the information given to the Canadian Port of Entry and to U.S.A. officials; and, as between the information given to the Canadian Port of Entry and to U.S.A. officials\n[34] The claimant indicated in her BOC Form that she went in search of her husband three times, once in each of the following years: in 2009, 2010, and in 2015. According to the notes of the claimant's credible fear interview in the U.S.A.,16 it is indicated that the claimant said that she went in search of her husband four times per year. When asked which account is correct, the claimant said that her BOC account is correct, that is, that she went three times to search for her husband. She said that she did not tell U.S.A. officials that she went four times per year, but that she went four times in total. She explained that she was handcuffed and nervous and therefore inadvertently mentioned four times rather than three times.\n[35] I do not find the claimant's explanation to be credible. At this point in her interview, the claimant's attorney was present, through a teleconference call. The attorney did not intercede to correct the record, despite an apparent awareness of the claimant's account. In this regard, the claimant's attorney had interceded earlier in the interview (as well as later in the interview) to ask the claimant questions. The attorney also interceded to inform the interviewing officer that the claimant had omitted an essential part of her account, as told by her sister and family, namely, that she had been \"sexually harmed\" on one occasion by the military, in 2010. I considered that the interviewing officer found the account to be credible, despite the omission. However, the interviewing officer would not have had information when making this assessment that the claimant would subsequently provide to Canadian officials, different information concerning her search for her husband.\n[36] In regard to the different information that she subsequently provided, the claimant told the Canadian Port of Entry Officer that she went in search of her husband on two occasions in 2010, in February, and, six months thereafter. Furthermore, the claimant's BOC Form discloses another inconsistency, that in 2010, she went in search of her husband only once, because of the terrible way in which she had been treated by the police. \"After that [she] was afraid to approach the police or to make inquiries about [her] husband.\"\n[37] The claimant said that she recalled telling the Port of Entry that she went twice in 2010 in search of her husband. When asked to explain the inconsistency, she said that the information which she gave to the Port of Entry was not correct; she had gone only once in 2010 and not again. When asked to explain why she had said otherwise to the Port of Entry, the claimant said that she did not know why, but that she had gone only once.\n[38] The claimant has not satisfactorily resolved the inconsistency, responding that she does not know why she had told the Canadian Port of Entry Officer that she had gone twice in search of her husband in 2010. I find the inconsistency to be material. It undermines the claimant's BOC Form narrative that she was sexually assaulted by authorities in 2010 when she went in search of her husband and therefore did not go thereafter, in context, until the year 2015.\n[39] I also observe that the claimant has not made any effort since leaving Sri Lanka to look for her husband, whether in the U.S.A. or in Canada, through the Red Cross, for example, or through another agency. The claimant explained that she has not done so because she is an applicant for refugee status and does not know whether she could do so before her claim is resolved. The claimant however is represented by a competent and experienced immigration counsel from whom she could have sought advice, were her allegation of her husband's disappearance true.\nMaterial inconsistencies in regard to an arrest of the claimant's father\n[40] When asked whether her father was ever arrested in connection with her husband's disappearance, the claimant responded that when she and her father went to the police in 2010 for information about her husband, they were both detained for four hours. When asked whether her father was ever detained or put into custody or questioned again after the year 2010, the claimant said that, after her arrival in August 2015 to Canada, her father was questioned at their home by the army for about one and one-half hours in regard to her whereabouts. However, according to the notes of the claimant's U.S.A. Credible Fear Interview, it is indicated that about six months prior to the interview, therefore in or about January 2015, persons in civilian clothes took her father for the day and released him after a payment of money. The claimant however said she has no recollection of having said so.\n[41] Having alleged a lack of recollection, the claimant has not satisfactorily explained the inconsistency and has not rebutted the presumption of bureaucratic regularity. I again note that the claimant's attorney was participating in the interview at this time and that the attorney raised no concerns about such information.\nMaterial inconsistency regarding the claimant's reason for leaving Sri Lanka\n[42] According to the U.S.A. interview at the Border Patrol Station in Texas on June 10, 2015,17 which predates the Credible Fear Interview that was held on June 29, 2015, the claimant stated that she came to the U.S.A.: \"[t]o reside and seek employment in New York\"; that she was heading to New York; and, that she \"was planning on staying [there] for the rest of [her] life.\" The account provided to the Border Patrol Officer undermines the claimant's account that she left Sri Lanka due to a fear of persecution and was headed to Canada, where she has a sister, to seek protection.\n[43] The claimant explained that it was suggested to her by the interviewer that she was telling lies and that her real purpose in coming to the U.S.A. was to work. She said that she declined to sign the interview notes, as the account of the interview was not correct.\n[44] I do not find the claimant's explanation to be credible. Although the interview notes indicate that the claimant refused to sign, in the absence of a valid reason to find otherwise, which the claimant has not provided, it is not credible that the U.S.A. official would, in essence, commit a fraud by making a false record of the interview. In this regard, I also note that the claimant raised no concern with other portions of the record of the interview and that the information provided therein, including her biographical information, appears to be consistent.\nVisit by the claimant's sister and brother-in-law to Sri Lanka.\n[45] At the second sitting of the claimant's hearing, she testified that her sister did not attend the hearing, because she is in Sri-Lanka with her husband since the past 25 days, to visit her ailing father.\n[46] When asked about where they were staying in Sri Lanka, the claimant testified that her sister and brother-in-law had stayed at the family home where she had been living, as well as at the home of her brother-in-law's parents. The claimant's brother-in-law was accepted in Canada as a Convention refugee, but is not yet a citizen. He sponsored the claimant's sister to Canada and she is also not a citizen.\n[47] I find that the claimant's sister's and brother-in-law's return to Sri Lanka, and, to the family home that is allegedly situated next to the army training camp, materially undermines the credibility of the claimant's account. They have returned to a country in which her brother-in-law claimed to fear persecution, and, under such basis, her sister was sponsored to Canada. On the claimant's account, they are to be there for two months, and, they do not appear to be in hiding. They had also been living in the home where, on the claimant's allegations, soldiers would barge in and cause trouble and from where the claimant had to flee to escape what would likely have been a sexual assault.\n[48] I also considered the submission that the fact that the claimant disclosed this information at her hearing, shows that she is a credible witness also in regard to her account for fearing persecution. However, had I not asked the claimant, toward the end of questioning about the basis of her claim, whether her sister is present at the IRB facilities, I do not think the return visit would have otherwise been volunteered. Also, the claimant was reluctant to say when it is that her family, who apparently left her to reside on her own in Canada, would be returning. She initially maintained that she does not know. Only when pressed in regard to why they would not have told her about their expected return, did she provide a response that they went away for two months. She explained that she could not earlier recall when they said they would be returning. However, my sense, in having heard the claimant testify, is that she was concerned about having to discuss the return visit, including detail about how long they had remained at the family home before relocating to the home of her brother-in-law's parents.\nANALYSIS - Residual profile\n[49] I have given consideration to the risk profiles that have been identified by the UNHCR, which, as recognized by the UNHCR, are not exhaustive:\nPersons Suspected of Certain Links with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)\nCertain Opposition Politicians and Political Activists\nCertain Journalists and Other Media Professionals\nCertain Human Rights Activists\nCertain Witnesses of Human Rights Violations and Victims of Human Rights Violations Seeking Justice\nWomen in certain circumstances\nChildren in certain circumstances\nLesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex (LGBTI) Individuals in certain circumstances.18\n[50] The risk profiles that have potential application to the claimant are that of \"Persons Suspected of Certain Links with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)\" and \"Women in certain circumstances.\" The claimant did not raise any other risk profile applicable to her circumstances.\n[51] In regard to the first risk profile, the UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines indicate that: \"[...] all persons living in [the northern and eastern provinces of Sri Lanka] and at the outer fringes of the areas under LTTE control, necessarily had contact with the LTTE and its civilian administration in their daily lives.\"\n[52] However, such contact alone would be insufficient to satisfy section 96, or, in the alternative, subsection 971(1) of the IRPA, as the UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines go on to state that: \"Originating from an area that was previously controlled by the LTTE does not in itself result in a need for international refugee protection in the sense of the 1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol.\" Such information would appear to be reflected also in the fact that the claimant's sister and brother-in-law have returned to Sri Lanka, where, on the claimant's account, they are staying for two months and have not advised her of any problems.\n[53] The totality of the UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines suggest that what is needed are: \"[...] previous (real or perceived) links that go beyond prior residency within an area controlled by the LTTE [which] continue to expose individuals to treatment which may give rise to a need for international refugee protection, depending on the specifics of the individual case.\" However, due to the unresolved material credibility concerns respecting the claimant's account of events, what is missing in her claim are \"the specifics of the individual case \"that\" go beyond [her] prior residency within an area controlled by the LTTE.\"\n[54] In this regard, for the reasons provided, I do not believe, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant's account of her husband having been perceived to be associated with the LTTE and taken by Sri Lankan authorities, never to be seen or heard from again. I therefore also do not believe the associated events that were alleged, including: the claimant's [and her father's] search for her husband at military and police offices; their maltreatment by such authorities during such visits; the allegation that authorities accused them also of being associated with the LTTE; the harassment conducted by military personnel housed in an army camp near the claimant's home [the claimant tied the alleged XXXX XXXX, 2015 incident to the account of her missing husband, alleging that the intruding soldiers asked her why she was searching for her husband]; and, that the military has enquired about the claimant's whereabouts.\n[55] In regard to the residual profile of \"women in certain circumstances,\" the UNHCR reports that sexual and gender-based violence against women and girls continues in the \"post-conflict phase, including in parts of the country not directly affected by the conflict\" and that there is an underreporting of such violence. While I appreciate that this description is not exhaustive, the report indicates that \"[i]nternally displaced persons, war widows, and unregistered female migrants are reported to remain particularly vulnerable.\" The claimant does not meet any of these descriptors. She is not a female migrant and though she and her family were initially internally displaced, she has indicated in her narrative account that in 2010, they were resettled. According to the dates in the claimant's Schedule A Form,19 the resettlement was to Poonagari, Chakkalai, Killinochi. The claimant is also not a war widow and her account of her husband's disappearance in 2009 is not credible on a balance of probabilities, as is likewise her account of a military training camp being situated near her home. The claimant also testified that her father, born in 1952 according to Question 5 of her BOC Form, resides in the family home [apart from his current illness that has placed in him the hospital], as do also two adult brothers, her mother, her younger sister, and, her daughter. As also discussed, the claimant's sister and brother-in-law returned to that family home. The claimant has not alleged them to have had any problems or to have communicated to her any concerns that would be relevant to her claim.\nCONCLUSION\n[56] The claimant is not a Convention refugee in accordance with section 96 of the IRPA, or, in the alternative, a person in need of protection in accordance with subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\n[57] The claim is dismissed.\n(signed)\n\"T.

Her husband, XXXX and her daughter XXXX fear that as family members of a bisexual woman, they too will face persecution.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] The Panel determines that the claimants are neither Convention Refugees nor persons in need of protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of IRPA.\nANALYSIS\n[4] The determinative issue in this case is the claimant's lack of credibility. The Panel finds the central breakdown in the claimant's credibility is that she has tendered a fraudulent document to support her and her family's allegations.\nFraudulent Medical Document\n[5] The claimant alleges that while married to her husband she began a romantic relationship with another married woman named XXXX. When XXXX husband, XXXX, discovered the relationship, he became enraged and in XXXX 2012 he and several of his friends broke into the claimant's home and physically assaulted her and her husband. The claimant alleges that XXXX threw her against a wall, whereby she hit her head on the corner. The impact, caused her to fall into a glass door which resulted in a cut to her forehead and the loss of consciousness. An ambulance was called and the claimant was transported to the hospital. The claimant alleges that she was admitted for XXXX days and diagnosed with a head injury and a concussion.\n[6] To support this allegation the claimant offered the Board a medical certificate.2 Upon examining the original document the panel instantly noticed an irregularity with the two stamps affixed to the document. It appeared that the stamps were not uniform in colour, the multicoloured look of the stamp raised the suspicion that the ink was pixelated and therefore affixed with a printer rather than a letterpress. While on break, the Panel examined the document a little closer with a magnify glass and noticed that the stamps where in fact pixelated and that the colour was not uniform. Upon returning to the hearing room, the Panel raised those concerns to the claimant and counsel and gave counsel the opportunity to view the stamps using the same magnify glass used by the Panel. Counsel did not share the Panel's findings, and stated that she saw no problems with the stamps. The Panel thereby showed her a comparison between an actual stamp (an IRB exhibit stamp) and the stamp affixed to the claimant's document, counsel still did not see the difference and objected to the Panel's conclusions. In view of counsel's reservations, the Panel sent the documents to the RCMP Forensic Science and Identification Services Laboratory for analysis. The report issued by the RCMP confirmed the Panel's initial findings.3\n[7] The report provided to the Board by the RCMP Forensic Science and Identification Services Laboratory showed that the medical certificate had been forensically analyzed using microscopy, various light sources and magnification. The results confirmed that the medical certificate \"was printed using an ink jet printing system, including all wet seals (stamps)\".4 The report also confirmed the irregularity of this result by stating \"that wet seals on official documents are normally printed with letterpress impressions, not with ink jet\".5 The results therefore confirmed that the stamps were not in fact genuine wet seal stamps and that this is not normal.\n[8] Despite noting the abnormality of the ink jet wet seal, the Forensic Specialist was not able to conclude whether the document was genuine as they did not have a genuine specimen for comparison.6 This, however, was not the Panel's intent when sending the document to the Forensic Unit, and therefore this conclusion does not impact the Panel's analysis. Rather the intent was to have the document analyzed to determine whether or not the wet seals where affixed with an inkjet printer. The report is conclusive in determining that the stamps were affixed with an inkjet printer rather than a letterpress and according to the document expert who analyzed the medical certificate it is not normal to affix such wet seals with an inkjet printer.\n[9] In a Response to Information Request (RIR) that addresses the use of medical documents in Ukraine, it is noted that medical documents are regulated by the Ukrainian Ministry of Health and that medical documents act as the official record of an individual's health condition.7 Based on this evidence the Panel finds that medical documents, cards and certificates are treated as official records in Ukraine and are therefore subject to regulations that would ensure that hospitals are applying security features using common methods, such as letterpress impressions, rather than applying official hospital seals with easily replicated inkjet.\n[10] All things, considered, the Panel did not find that hospitals in the Ukraine would be affixing stamps onto their medical certificates using inkjet printers. The claimant has provided no evidence to suggest otherwise, therefore on a balance of probabilities, the Panel finds the medical certificate to be fraudulent. The documentary evidence is clear that fraudulent documents are easily obtained and common in the Ukraine, particularly medical certificates and therefore the Panel finds it is within reason to determine that this is one such document.8\n[11] The Panel finds the medical certificate to be a material element of the claim, one which directly impacts the credibility of the entire claim. The event to which the medical certificate is to corroborate is pivotal, as it is allegedly the most significant act of persecution committed against the claimant and her family. It is also the moment upon which the claimant realized that she could not live safely in her country. By submitting a fraudulent document to corroborate this event the claimant has undermined the entirety of her allegations. The Panel finds that if this event were true and if the claimant were credible she would have no need to provide the Board a fraudulent document. By doing so the claimant has undermined the entirety of her claim and thereby undermined the entirety of her husband and daughter's claim.\n[12] Moreover, having tendered a fraudulent document, the Panel places no weight on the other documentary evidence submitted by the claimant, such as other medical evidence, photographs and letters. Having submitted a fraudulent document to the Board, the Panel also gives no weight to the claimant's involvement with LGBTI organizations here in Canada. Volunteering your time to assist with Toronto Pride and attending 519 meetings is not evidence of ones bisexuality, every person in Canada is welcome and encouraged to participate in such events and in view of the findings, the Panel finds that the claimant's involvement in no way establishes her sexual identity. Finally, by offering a fraudulent document to corroborate her allegations, the claimant has undermined the Panel's confidence in her ability to provide truthful evidence and therefore the Panel gives little weight to her oral testimony and finds that it does not overcome the concerns raised by this document.\n[13] In summary, the Panel finds that by providing the Board with a fraudulent document in support of a material element of their claim, the claimants have tainted not only their documentary evidence but also their credibility as a witnesses. In light of this finding, I determine that there is not a serious possibility that the claimants would be persecuted in Ukraine, or that, on a balance of probabilities that they would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Ukraine.\nManifestly Unfounded\n[14] Section 107.1 of the IRPA reads:\nIf the Refugee Protection Division rejects a claim for refugee protection, it must state in its reasons for the decision that the claim is manifestly unfounded if it is of the opinion that the claim is clearly fraudulent.\n[15] The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Position on Manifestly Unfounded Applications for Asylum has provided the following guidance on this topic:\n\"The Office has stated that the notion of \"clearly fraudulent\" could reasonably cover situations where the applicant deliberately attempts to deceive the authorities determining refugee status. The mere fact of having made false statements to the authorities does not, however, necessarily exclude a well-founded fear of persecution and vitiate the need for asylum, thus making the claim \"clearly fraudulent.\" Only if the applicant makes what appear to be false allegations of a material or substantive nature relevant for the determination of his or her status could the claim be considered \"clearly fraudulent.\"\n[16] Having found that the claimants provided fraudulent information to support the material and substantive element of their claim, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that their claims are clearly fraudulent and therefore manifestly unfounded.\nCONCLUSION\n[17] Having considered all of the evidence, the Panel determines that the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of IRPA.\n[18] The Refugee Protection Division therefore rejects their claims for refugee protection.\n(signed)\n\" Jennifer Daubney \"\nJennifer Daubney\nOctober 17, 2016\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96, 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b).\n2 Exhibit 8, Item 5\n3 Exhibit 12\n4 Ibid\n5 Ibid\n6 Exhibit 12\n7 Exhibit 5, Item 3.4\n8 Exhibit 5, Item 3.7\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRPD.29.1 (August 31, 2012)\nRPD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SPR : TB5-09547 TB5-09558 TB5-09562\n",

The principal claimant states that her husband, the father of the minor claimants, was killed by the MS-13. She and the minor claimants state that, if they were to return to El Salvador, they will be kidnapped and possibly killed by MS-13.\n[2] The claimants arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2016. The claimants made a claim for refugee protection at the port of entry. They completed their Basis of claim (BOC) forms on January 31st, 2016. The claimants allege that the state of El Salvador is incapable of protecting them, and that there is no safe place for them anywhere in El Salvador.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] The panel determines that the claimants are not Convention Refugees and are not persons in need of protection. The determinative issue is the lack of well-foundedness of the claim.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[4] The claimants arrived in Canada with their own passports1. The principal claimant also provided her national identity card2 and her marriage certificate3.The panel accepts that the claimants are citizens of El Salvador.\n[5] The counsel for the claimants conceded at the outset that there was no basis for a claim under s. 96 and that the claim was being presented as a s. 97 claim\n[6] The panel examined the evidence nonetheless under the lens of s. 96, in case there was a possibility of a refugee claim. After reviewing the written documentation and hearing the oral testimony, the panel concluded that the claimants could not establish that they held a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of their race, their religion, their nationality, their political opinion, or their belonging to a particular social group.\n[7] The panel rejects the claim under Section 96.\nCredibility\n[8] The principal claimant gave credible testimony. The principal claimant testified that her husband XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was a XXXX. XXXX. XXXX was extorted by the MS-13 gang in El Salvador. For approximately two years, he paid some $200 per month to the gang under threat of death if he did not pay. He reported the extortion and the threats to the police4 on XXXX XXXX, 2014. If he did not pay the extortion, he advised police that the gang threatened to kill him his wife and his children, the claimants herein\n[9] Two weeks later, in XXXX, 2014, XXXX XXXX XXXX was unable to pay, and he was murdered by MS-13. The death certificate5 indicates that XXXX XXXX XXXX died of \"XXXX XXXX XXXX trauma\". There is no direct reference in the documentary evidence to the cause of death being the murder of XXXX XXXX XXXX. According to the uncontradicted evidence of the principal claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX was beaten to death.\n[10] After the horrible and tragic murder of XXXX XXXX XXXX, the principal claimant and her children were traumatized6. The principal claimant and their three children tried to settle down and adjust to life without the head of the family. She stopped working and stayed at home to look after her children. Her children returned to school. The principal claimant acknowledged that there were no further difficulties with MS-13 from XXXX, 2014 until their departure for Canada in XXXX, 2016.\n[11] Although there was a death threat in the past issued against all family members, it appears to the panel that the threat was carried out, culminating in the death of XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, 2014. Following the murder of XXXX XXXX XXXX, there was no further contact with the MS-13 gang.\n[12] Since that time, the claimants have not been approached with demands for money. The claimants have not been threatened. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants herein are no longer under threat, and that they have been able to live peacefully and without threats from XXXX, 2014 until their departure from El Salvador in XXXX, 2016.\n[13] The principal claimant also claimed that Salvadoran authorities are now targeting children and recruiting them to fight the gangs. There was no credible or trustworthy evidence that the children in this claim were approached or that they were likely to be targeted. No documentary evidence was cited or presented to corroborate this allegation. In the absence of an objective reason for the fear of government recruitment, the fear of the claimants in this regard is merely speculative. The panel finds that this aspect of the claim is without foundation.\nPersons in need of protection - Section 97\n[14] Having rejected the claim under Section 96, the Panel proceeded to assess the claim on the basis of Section 97 of the Act. In order to establish their claims under Section 97, the claimants must establish that that there are substantial grounds to believe that they would be tortured, or at risk of losing their lives or being subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if they returned to their home country.\n[15] The nature of the risk claimed by the claimants is that they will be targeted by MS-13 because of death threats issued to the late husband and father in XXXX, 2014. The panel accepts that the husband and his family have previously been victimized by MS-13. The panel accepts that the MS-13 gang extorted the late Mr. XXXX, that his life was threatened and that his life was ultimately taken by this most violent gang. There is, however, no credible or trustworthy evidence, either in the oral testimony or in the documentation on file, showing that this particular claimant family is now or will be personally at risk if the family members were to return to El Salvador. The risks faced by this family are of the same nature and degree as those of other Salvadorans. Therefore, the panel finds that the risk of criminality facing this claimant family is a generalized risk.\n[16] The panel assessed whether, on a balance of probabilities, should the claimants be returned to El Salvador, they would be in danger of torture, or a risk to their lives or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. Given the absence of threats for some fourteen months, and given the finding of a generalized risk, the panel finds that it is more probable than not that the claimants would not face a danger of torture, or a risk to their lives or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\n[17] There are no substantial grounds to believe that the removal of this family to El Salvador would subject them personally to a danger of torture. The panel therefore rejects their claims under Sections 96 and 97 of the Act.\n[18] The risk alleged by the applicants is a random risk shared by everyone who lives in their country; it does not personally or particularly target the applicants. The situation that the applicants fear is no different from that faced by other individuals from El Salvador; therefore, they do not qualify as persons in need of protection, as set out by subparagraph 97(1)(b)(ii) of the Act.\n[19] The panel notes that the Federal Court has held that victims of crime, corruption7 or vendettas8 generally fail to establish a link between their fear of persecution and one of the Convention grounds in the definition of Convention refugee. The Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) has been upheld in its finding of lack of nexus, where the claimant was a target of a personal vendetta9, or where the claimant was a victim of crime10.\n[20] The panel finds that it is more probable than not that the claimants would not face a danger of torture, or a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, if they were to return to El Salvador.\n[21] The Panel finds that the claimants have not established their claims under Section 97. The Panel finds that the claimants have not provided sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish on a balance of probabilities that they would be tortured, or at risk of losing their lives or being subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if they returned to China.\nCONCLUSION\n[22] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel determines that the claimants have not established that there is a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground or that, on a balance of probabilities, they would personally be subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if they were to return to El Salvador.\n[23] The panel therefore concludes that the claimants XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, are not Convention Refugees, nor are they persons in need of protection, and the Division rejects their claims.\n(signed)\n\"R.

They threatened her cousin XXXX XXXX. Her cousin knew that they were Al-Shabaab and that they were going to force them to marry Al-Shabaab fighters, and that if they did not comply, that Al-Shabaab would kill all of them. Al-Shabaab told them that they would be returning to the area of Marka in a couple of days. The claimant and her cousin left Marka before Al-Shabaab returned. Her cousin took her to a safer place in the city until he could make arrangements for her departure from the country.\n[3] The claimant alleges that she left her mother, 2 brothers, and younger sisters, who were between the ages of XXXX and XXXX behind in Marka. The claimant's sisters would be safe in Marka because they were too young for marriage.\n[4] The claimant alleges that prior to these problems her father was working in Saudi Arabia since 1991. In Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, her father's sponsor threatened to take away one of his children unless her father returned to continue with his work. The claimant's father could not return to work because he was ill. He was suffering from cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. The claimant's father passed away in Somalia on XXXX XXXX, 2012.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] The panel finds that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee in accordance with section 96 nor a person in need of protection in accordance with section 97(1)(a) and (b) of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\n[6] The determinative issues in this claim for refugee protection are identity and credibility.\nIDENTITY AND CREDIBILITY\n[7] I find that the claimant has produced insufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that she is a citizen of Somalia. Furthermore, I find, based on the lack of sufficient credible evidence to establish her nationality as a Somali citizen, that the claimant is not who she claims to be. Therefore, I find that this undermines the claimant's credibility in whole.\n[8] Section 106 of IRPA states:\nClaimant without Identification\nCredibility\nThe Refugee Protection Division must take into account, with respect to the credibility of a claimant, whether the claimant possesses acceptable documentation establishing identity, and if not, whether they have provided a reasonable explanation or have taken reasonable steps to obtain the documentation.\n[9] The applicable RPD Rule is as follows:\nDocuments Establishing Identity and Other Elements of the Claim\nDocuments\n11. The claimant must provide acceptable documents establishing their identity and other elements of the claim. A claimant who does not provide acceptable documents must explain why they did not provide the documents and what steps they took to obtain them.\n[10] In the Yip decision, the Federal Court held that the claimant has the fundamental obligation to establish his or her identity on a balance of probabilities.2 In Behary, the Court held that identity is a critical, threshold issue.3 In the Kante decision, the Court affirmed that the claimant must come to a hearing with all of the evidence that he or she is able to offer and believes is necessary to prove the claim.4 In the Husein decision, the Federal Court held that once the panel concluded that the identity of the claimant has not been established, it was not necessary to analyze the evidence any further.5\n[11] Justice Judith Snider articulated the proper approach to the issue in Su v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), at paragraph 3:\nProof of identity is a pre-requisite for a person claiming refugee protection as without it there can \"be no sound basis for testing or verifying the claims of persecution or, indeed for determining the Applicant's true nationality\" (Jin v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FC 126 at para 26, [2006] FCJ No 181 (QL); see also Liu v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2007 FC 831 at para 18, [2007] FCJ No 1101 (QL)).\n[12] And at paragraph 9,\nAs noted by the Board, the RIC is \"the most important document to establish a claimant's identity.\" While the Principal Applicant attempted to explain why she did not have her RIC, the point remains that she did not have this important document that could have established her identity.6\n[13] The BOC form contains the following instructions:\nAttach two copies of any documents you have to support your claim, such as travel documents (including your passport) and identity, medical, psychological or police documents. (Emphasis Added)\n[14] As with many claims from Somalia, identity is a central issue as it is known that the Somali government has not issued identity documents since the outset of the war in 1991.7 Furthermore, since large parts of Somalia have not been subject to any central administration or government for many years, they do not have access to any official government-issued documents such as passports, birth certificates or national identity cards.\n[15] It is also established that the issue of identity is tied to the issue of credibility. In assessing the credibility of a claimant and their actions, a panel is entitled to rely on its rationality and common sense. While the panel is aware that the sworn testimony of a claimant is presumed to be true unless there are valid reasons to doubt it, in this case, the panel finds that the claimant's actions and evidence are not credible for a person having a genuine fear of persecution or who is obliged to establish her identity.\n[16] In the decision in Li8, Madam Justice Dawson stated:\n[7] Mr. Li argues that the Board erred by connecting its negative finding about his failure to substantiate his travel itinerary with the issue of his identity...In my view, the Board did not err as alleged. The Board's analysis of Mr. Li's identity was related to its assessment of his credibility. It was not patently unreasonable for the Board to draw a negative inference regarding Mr. Li's credibility based upon the fact that he had no passport, plane ticket, or boarding pass. Those documents would have provided, at least, evidence about where Mr. Li's journey to Canada commenced. See, for example, Elazi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2000] F.C.J. No. 212, and Kazadi, cited above\n[17] The burden therefore rests on the claimant to establish, with credible and trustworthy evidence, on a balance of probabilities, that they are who they say they are, and that they are a national of Somalia. The lack of Somali government issued identification is, in and of itself not grounds for a negative inference or a negative finding on identity. The panel does not expect the claimant to have sought identity documents from a government that does not exist. It does, however, rest on the claimant to use other reliable documents or credible testimony to establish their identity.\n[18] The claimant was asked if she had any identity documents in her possession at the time that she crossed over the US\/Canada border into Canada. She said that she had her birth certificate and marriage certificate with her when she crossed over the border. The claimant was asked if the birth certificate which she carried with her when she crossed over the border was an original document. The claimant was asked where the original of her birth certificate was located. She said that her husband was in possession of her original birth certificate. The claimant produced the document which she claimed was the original. The panel examined the document carefully and noticed that it was a photocopy and not an original document. The panel asked the claimant again where the original document was located. The claimant said that this document, which she had just produced at her hearing, was the only document that she currently had in her possession. The claimant explained that when she got married to her husband in the United States and went to apply for her marriage licence in Detroit this was the document that she presented to them. She said that during the time that she was in the United States she did not have in her possession a Somali passport or any other travel document. The claimant tendered into evidence a copy of her marriage licence.9 The panel finds that this document has no probative value in terms of establishing the claimant's personal and national identity. It only confirms that she married XXXX XXXX, her husband, in the state of Michigan. It does not prove that she is who she claims to be or that she is a citizen of Somalia. In short, this documentary information is inconclusive and insufficient for the purposes of establishing her identity.\n[19] The claimant was asked how she came into possession of her birth certificate. She said that some people sent it to her. The panel asked the claimant who sent the document to her in Canada. She said that some neighbours of hers in Saudi Arabia sent her the document. She said that since she could not go to Marka and get her birth certificate on her own she had her Saudi neighbours make arrangements to get it for her. The panel sought clarification from the claimant. The claimant was asked if she had approached her neighbours from Saudi and had asked them to obtain her birth certificate for her from Marka, Somalia. The claimant said that she asked them for help because she did not have any identity documents. She said that at first they refused but after she begged them they agreed to get these documents for her. The claimant was asked how someone from Saudi Arabia would be able to obtain her birth certificate on her behalf. The claimant said that her Saudi neighbours were from Somalia and had connections there and because of that would be able to obtain the birth certificate for her. The claimant was asked if her Saudi neighbours were originally from Marka. She confirmed that they were. The panel asked the claimant how her Saudi neighbours would have been able to get her birth certificate from Somalia for her. She said that she did not know what steps they took in order to get her birth certificate for her.\n[20] The panel does not believe that her Saudi neighbours obtained her birth certificate from Somalia on her behalf. The panel finds that it is not likely that her Saudi neighbours would have been able to obtain the claimant's birth certificate from Somalia given the claimant's absence from the country. According to documentary evidence10,\n\"[A]lthough no Somali authorities register births or issue official birth certificates, certain certificates are issued in connection with births in hospitals. There is currently little or no possibility of verifying such certificates. Prior to 1991, mainly hospital births were registered. In order to obtain a birth certificate, a person would have to approach the municipal administration, which in turn would create a family file and allocate a family number. The applicant, would have to bring two attending witnesses from the clan\/sub-clan, with good knowledge of the applicant.\"\n[21] The panel finds that this documentary evidence casts a further shadow of serious doubt on the authenticity and reliability of the document which the claimant purports to be her legitimate and genuine Somali birth certificate. The panel asked the claimant how the birth certificate was sent to her in Canada by her Saudi neighbours. She said that they emailed it to her. The panel re-examined the birth certificate which the claimant produced at her hearing. Upon closer examination, the panel noticed that it appeared to be a scanned or electronic document. The panel asked the claimant again if she had any idea as to the steps her Saudi neighbours took in order to get her birth certificate from Somalia. The claimant said that she did not know and didn't really expect that they would be able to get her birth certificate for her. The panel asked the claimant if she had kept the email communication by which the birth certificate had been sent to her in Canada in her email account. She said that she did not keep the email which was sent by her Saudi neighbours which contained her birth certificate as an attachment. The panel finds that email communications are not secure and can be intercepted or hacked into or manipulated. This is common knowledge. It is not clear where this scanned or electronic document purporting to be the claimant's Somali birth certificates originates from. The claimant did not even produce as evidence at her hearing a copy of the email which allegedly was sent to her by her Saudi neighbours which contained her birth certificate as an attachment. The panel finds that this raises serious concerns about the reliability, authenticity, and trustworthiness of this document.\n[22] The panel noticed that there were further anomalies in this document for which the claimant was unable to provide a reasonable, cogent or logical explanation. According to the scanned or electronic copy of the claimant's birth certificate, the claimant was born in Marka, Somalia on XXXX XXXX, 1989. The documentary evidence11 in the NDP indicates that Marka is situated in the province of Gedo, in the Lower Shabelle region of Somalia. Furthermore, the document indicates that it was issued in Mogadishu on October 10, 1989 by the Mayor of the local government in Mogadishu in the Anagraph Department. The document evidence indicates that in 1991 the central government administration collapsed and that the country descended into an all-out civil war. The panel finds, therefore, that it stands to reason that before 1991 there would have been in place local municipal government administrations which were fully operational and functional in different regions across the country of Somalia. The panel finds it very bizarre that the claimant's birth certificate was issued by the Mayor's office in Mogadishu even though the claimant was not born in Mogadishu and the government of Siad Barre was still in power and the machinery of government was still operational. The panel finds it reasonable to expect, in these circumstances, that the claimant's birth certificate would have been issued by the local governmental administration or municipality in the city of Marka in the province of Gedo.\n[23] The claimant has provided no persuasive documentary evidence to demonstrate that before the beginning of the civil war in Somalia in 1991 that the local governmental authority and Mayor of Mogadishu was issuing birth certificates for children born in the city of Marka. Given this historical perspective and the timing of the issuance of the claimant's birth certificate by the Mayor of the local city government in Mogadishu, the panel finds that this seriously calls into question the reliability and trustworthiness of the scanned or electronic copy of the claimant's birth certificate. The panel asked the claimant if she could offer any meaningful explanation or insight into why her birth certificate would have been issued by the Mayor's office of the local government in Mogadishu even though she was born in a different city and region of the country, namely Marka, in the Lower Shabelle region. The claimant was unable to provide any reasonable explanation.\n[24] The panel discovered another anomaly with respect to the contents of this document purporting to be an authentic and genuine Somali birth certificate. The document is signed by the Mayor, Ku Xigeenka Duqa Qeybta Arimaha Bulshada, and dated October 10, 1989. The panel finds that the name of the Mayor identified in the document is not consistent with the names of the Mayors who were in power in the local city government in Mogadishu during this time period in Somalia's political history. In Exhibit 9, there is a Response to Information Request, SOM30876.E, dated 12 January 199912. According to this research,\n\"on January 1990 Ali Ugas Abdulle (also Ali Ugas Abdullah) was replaced as Mayor of Mogadishu by Said Umar Afrah. Said Umar Afrah also appears as Sayyid Umar Haji Muhammed. On 17 September 1990 President Siad Barre approved Ahmad Jilicow (also Ahmed Jilao) as the new Mayor of Mogadishu.\"\n[25] The panel asked the claimant if she was born in a hospital or at her family's home with the assistance of a mid-wife. The claimant said that she was born at home. The panel finds that since the claimant was born at home with the assistance of a mid-wife and not in a government hospital or medical institution it is highly unlikely or implausible that the claimant's birth would have been registered at any local government office, be it Marka or Mogadishu, such that it would have become a matter of public record. This fact also raises serious credibility concerns about the authenticity and reliability of the claimant's birth certificate.\n[26] Accordingly, for the reasons already mentioned, the panel gives the claimant's birth certificate no weight. This document is highly suspect, given the anomalies identified and the lack of any reasonable explanation by the claimant. The panel finds that the claimant's birth certificate is fraudulent or was fraudulently obtained in order to support and sustain a refugee claim against the country of Somalia. The panel notes that the documentary evidence indicates that,\n\"[A]ccording to Sabahi, a news website that covers the Horn of Africa and is sponsored by the United States Africa Command, a forgery system for identity documents has 'flourished' in Somalia for over two decades, but the Somali government is beginning to 'take steps' to combat this problem.\"13\n[27] The claimant made an asylum claim in the United States which was rejected. The claimant's asylum claim documents14 were tendered into evidence at her hearing. Although the claimant's name appears on all of the asylum claim documents, there is no indication what if any efforts were made by US immigration authorities to verify her personal and national identity. For that reason alone, I find that the US asylum claim documents are not very probative in terms of establishing the personal and national identity of the claimant. Therefore, the US asylum claim documents are inconclusive and do not sufficiently establish, on a balance of probabilities, the personal and national identity of the claimant. Accordingly, the US asylum claim documents are given very little weight.\n[28] The claimant tendered into evidence a copy of her late father's death certificate.15 The panel finds that this document has no probative value in terms of establishing the personal and national identity of the claimant. It does nothing more than show that he died on XXXX XXXX, 2012 in Marka, Somalia. Since this document has no real relevance or bearing on the claimant's personal or national identity in Somalia, the panel gives this document no weight. The death certificate does not place the claimant in Somali at any time in the past nor does it establish that the claimant is who she claims to be. Furthermore, since the claimant's birth certificate is highly suspect, it is not clear whether the man referred to in the death certificate is in fact her biological father.\n[29] The panel asked the claimant if she had any idea as to when her father was born. She said that she did not know but thought he might have been around 60 years of age when he passed away. The panel asked the claimant for her mother's date of birth. She said that she did not know. The panel asked the claimant why she did not know her own mother's date of birth. She said that there is no birth certificate but thought that her mother was probably in her 50's. The panel asked the claimant to explain this answer, given that she had provided an exact date of birth for her mother in her BOC form, which was XXXX XXXX, 1966. Her explanation was that when she and her husband were completing the form they were calculating or trying to figure out what her mother's date of birth might have been. The panel asked the claimant how they came up with the exact day and month of the year that they thought her mother was born, namely XXXX XXXX. The claimant denied that she had included such information on her BOC form. She said that the only date of birth which she and her husband came up with for her mother was 1966 and that she did not indicate that her mother was born on XXXX XXXX. However, upon close examination of the claimant's BOC form, it is clear that the date of birth that was provided for her mother was XXXX XXXX, 1966.\n[30] Furthermore, at the commencement of the hearing the claimant gave a solemn affirmation indicating that all the information that she had provided was complete, true, and correct. The panel notes, additionally, that the claimant signed a declaration on her BOC form indicating that everything in the form was translated to her and that it was all complete, true, and correct. The panel asked the claimant why her BOC form indicated that her mother was born on January 1st, if in fact she had never included this information on the BOC form. She said that it might have been a mistake. The panel asked the claimant if all the information in her BOC form had been translated to her from the English language into the Arabic language. She confirmed that all the information had been translated to her. The panel asked the claimant why she signed the BOC form if it contained an error. The claimant said that she must not have been paying attention to these details and had made a mistake. The claimant's explanation as to why her BOC form explicitly states that her mother was born on XXXX XXXX, 1966 even though allegedly she didn't provide this information on her form, defies incredulity. The panel does not believe her testimony that she did not indicate on her BOC form that her mother was born on XXXX XXXX. On the contrary, the evidence establishes that the claimant did in fact indicate explicitly on her BOC form that her mother was born on XXXX XXXX.\n[31] The panel finds it implausible that the claimant would not have been able to provide the exact dates of birth of for her biological father and mother and only give rough estimates, if in fact it were true that she was related to them by blood. The fact that the claimant was unaware of the exact dates of birth for her biological parents raises serious doubts and concerns regarding the claimant's true personal identity and true nationality. The claimant is alleging that she is the biological child of Somali parents and that she was born in Marka, in the Lower Shabelle region of Somalia. Despite this allegation, the claimant did not know when her parents were born and was incapable of coming up with their dates of birth with any degree of specificity. The panel finds that this difficulty in the claimant's evidence undermines her credibility as it relates to her personal and national identity.\n[32] When the first sitting of the claimant's refugee hearing commenced on May 19, 2016, the claimant testified in the Arabic language. When the hearing resumed on June 23, 2016, the claimant was provided with a Somali interpreter for a portion of the hearing. The claimant testified in the Somali language for approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour. Although it is clear that the claimant is also able to speak in the Somali language, the panel finds that this factor, on its own, is insufficient to establish the claimant's personal and national identity on a balance of probabilities. The Somali language is spoken not only in Somalia. It is spoken to many other countries around the world, including Ethiopia and Kenya. Although the claimant is proficient in the Somali language, that on its own doesn't prove that the claimant actually lived in Somalia for any period of time or that she is a citizen of Somalia. By way of analogy, for example, a Canadian citizen who was born in Canada might be able to speak a foreign language, such as German, Italian or French but may never have set foot in these countries and may never have worked or lived or gone to school in these countries. Moreover, such a Canadian citizen would not automatically acquire the citizenship of these other foreign nations simply by virtue of being able to speak the native language of that particular country. Likewise, in this particular case, just because the claimant is able to speak Somali doesn't actually place her in Somalia at any time in the past nor does it establish that she enjoys formal citizenship rights in Somalia.\n[33] The claimant was asked to identify the clan family and sub-clans that she belonged to in Somalia. She said that she is from the Drogabaga clan which is part of the Reer Hammar tribe. She said that her clan family was a small clan and that it included clans such as the Shanshiya, Hatin, and Ashraf. She said that her clan was considered to be a minority clan. She said that her clan did not have any weapons or money and that the clan originated from the Marka area of Somalia. The claimant said that traditionally and historically the occupations of members of the Reer Hammar included operating food and tailoring businesses. The claimant said that her clan was located mainly in Marka. The claimant mentioned that there were other other clans living in the vicinity of Marka which included the Habir Gadir and the Abgal clans. She said that they were majority clans. The claimant said that after civil war broke out members of her clan were targeted by the larger and more powerful clans.\n[34] Although the claimant's testimony regarding her clan genealogy and lineage, its culture, history, customs, traditional occupations, geographic location, and religious practices, was generally consistent with the objective country documents16, the panel find that the claimant's knowledge in this regard, in the context of the country documentation, was very limited and superficial at best. The claimant was able to identify her main clan family and mentioned a few of the sub-clans that were part of her clan family. However, when asked questions about her clan's traditions, customs, religious practices, and history, her testimony was vague and lacking in terms of specific details. She said that members of her clan were in the food and tailoring businesses and that women in her clan were famous for making sweets, such as biscuits and cakes. The claimant spoke about her clan's religious practices in generalities and outlined some basic principles of the Sunni Muslim faith with regard to marriage, a woman's role in the traditional Muslim household, and not going outdoors on their own unless accompanied by their father or mother. The panel finds that the claimant's limited knowledge regarding her clan lineage, genealogy, culture, traditions, and history, could have easily been learned by researching the information online on the internet. Information about clan genealogy and lineages and history is widely disseminated over the internet and easily accessible by any member of the public. The panel, therefore, finds that the claimant's limited knowledge regarding her clan lineage and genealogy and history is inconclusive and is insufficient to establish, on its own, the claimant's personal identity and nationality as a Somali citizen, on a balance of probabilities.\n[35] The claimant testified that she was born in Somalia in 1989 and lived in Marka for approximately one year between 1990 and1991. She said that in 1991 her family fled Somalia and went to live in Saudi Arabia. The claimant said that she and her family lived in Saudi Arabia between 1991 and 2012 which represents approximately 20 to 21 years. The claimant was asked if she had any documentation to show that she lived in Saudi Arabia for 20 to 21 years. She said that she did not have any documentation in her possession to show that she had lived in Saudi during the 20 to 21 years. The claimant was asked if she made any attempts to have her friends in Saudi look for Saudi documentation that would show that she had lived and gone to school in Saudi Arabia. She said that she asked Saudi friends to look for these documents but that they came up empty handed. She said that they went to her previous home in Saudi but could not find any documentation, and that they had noticed that everything in their home had been removed.\n[36] The panel finds it hard to believe that the claimant would not have in her possession, after some 20 to 21 years of living in Saudi Arabia, any documentation to show that she lived, worked, and went to school in Saudi Arabia before returning to Somalia in 2012. The claimant said that she and her family were deported back to Somalia by the Saudi authorities in 2012. The claimant was asked if she had any documents to show that she and her family were deported back to Somalia in 2012. The claimant said that she did not have any documentation to substantiate her allegation that the Saudis deported her and her family back to Somalia in 2012. The claimant said that the Saudi authorities issued her family a deportation order and that the document was given to her father. The panel asked the claimant if she was in possession of this document. She said that her father used to have this document. The panel asked the claimant what happened to the document. She said that the deportation letter was not an important document for her family and she said that her father, who was the head of the family, used to have this document but she did not make any efforts to try to find the document. The panel asked the claimant if she asked her Saudi friends or her family or relatives in Somalia to try to look for the document. The claimant said she did not ask them any more to look for the document. The panel asked the claimant whether she could ask her friends in Saudi and relatives in Somalia to try to find the document. She said that she didn't think that would be possible. The claimant then said that her father had this document in his possession at the time of his death in Somalia and that her uncle in Somalia might be able to access the document. The claimant said that after she and her family were deported to Somalia from Saudi Arabia in 2012 that her uncle picked her up from the international airport in Mogadishu.\n[37] The claimant produced no documentation from her uncle, such as a letter, which would have been very helpful in terms of establishing and placing her whereabouts in Somalia in 2012 after she and her family were allegedly deported to Somalia from Saudi Arabia. The panel finds that the failure of the claimant to produce such critically important documentation, which goes to the heart of the central issue of the claimant's national and personal identity, further undermines her credibility and castes further doubt on her true personal and national identity. The panel finds that it is reasonable to expect, in these circumstances, that if the claimant had in fact been deported to Somalia and had lived the past 20 to 21 years in Saudi Arabia, that she would have made substantially greater efforts to obtain supporting documentation which established her whereabouts in Saudi Arabia and would have placed her in Somalia after she and her family were allegedly deported there in 2012.\nCONCLUSION\n[38] Given the claimant's failure to provide sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to establish, on a balance of probabilities, her personal and national identity as a Somali from Marka, in the region of Lower Shabelle, the panel determines that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee within the meaning of Section 96 of the Act nor a person in need of protection under Subsection 97(1). Her claim is therefore rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Robert Bafaro\"\nRobert Bafaro\nJuly 28, 2016\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96, 97(1) (a) and 97(1)(b).\n2 Yip, Fu On v.

The adult claimants are husband and wife and have two minor children. The claims were heard jointly, and all the claimants relied on the BOC narrative of the female claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (\"female claimant\"). The female claimant acted as the designated representative for the minor children, and provided all of the testimony in this claim. Her husband was given the opportunity to testify, and confirmed that his wife's evidence was correct and that he accepted it as his own, and said he had nothing further to add.\n[4] The claimants are citizens of Yemen. The female claimant indicates that she is opposed to Houthis and that she denounced their activities on social media. Additionally, she alleges that she is at risk because she worked for the now defunct United States (US) embassy in Yemen, and was targeted as a US supporter and western sympathizer.\n[5] She alleges that she received threatening phone calls, and that the family's car and home were vandalized. The claimants fled to Egypt where they remained for almost one year, and they then travelled to the United States on US visas. They thereafter left the United States and travelled to Canada where they claimed refugee status.\n[6] The claimant insisted that her hearing proceed in English, and testified that her command of English was equal to her command of Arabic. The proceeding accordingly proceeded in English with the Arabic interpreter on standby.\nDETERMINATION\n[7] The panel finds that the claimants have not established that there is a reasonable possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, or that, on a balance of probabilities, they would personally be subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if they were to return to Yemen.\nOverview of country conditions: Yemen\n[8] Yemen is a republic with a constitution that provides for a president, a parliament, and an independent judiciary. Former president Saleh stepped down in 2012 when voters elected President Hadi in an election generally considered to be free and fair. The transitional government sought to expand political participation to formerly excluded groups, including women, youth, and minorities.1\n[9] Progress ended when Houthi rebels, backed by former president Saleh, staged an armed takeover against the government in 2014 which led to its exile. Houthi-Saleh rebels seized the presidential palace and other government buildings in Sana'a. The Houthis placed President Hadi under house arrest, and Prime Minister Khaled Bahah and his cabinet resigned. The Houthis and their supporters illegally disbanded parliament and attempted to establish the appointive Supreme Revolutionary Committee as the highest governing authority. President Hadi requested Arab League and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) military intervention, invoking Article 51 of the UN Charter, and fled the country the following day. A Saudi-led coalition thereafter launched air and ground operations against the Houthi rebels.2\nBackground: Houthis\n[10] The Houthi conflict is led by the Houthi family, a prominent Zaydi religious clan who claim to be descended from the prophet Mohammed.3 Houthis believe that Zaydi Shiism and the Zaydi community have become marginalized in Yemen4 and are a regional separatist movement.5\n[11] The internationally recognized government-in-exile lacked the capacity to enforce laws protecting against human rights abuses, particularly after its exile in March.\nInternal conflict\n[12] The government-in-exile exercised limited control over military and security forces due to Houthi rebel influence. Competing family, tribal, party, and sectarian influences also affected the government-in-exile's ability to control military and other security forces. During the year military and other security forces loyal to the government-in-exile battled with Houthi-Saleh forces. Groups affiliated with the former regime, and armed groups operated outside the law and committed human rights abuses. Da'esh, emerging in Yemen this year, claimed responsibility for a series of attacks on Houthi-affiliated Shia mosques. Nonstate groups committed significant abuses while engaged in internal armed conflict. These groups include: Houthi-Saleh rebels; tribal militias; resistance forces; militant secessionist groups; and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).\nCREDIBILITY\n[13] The panel is mindful of the challenges faced by a claimant when establishing their claim including cultural factors, nervousness, and the unfamiliar milieu of the hearing room. It also considered the age, education and background of the claimants when assessing their credibility. At the time of the hearing, the female claimant was XXXX years old, had 15 years of education, and said that she worked in XXXX XXXX at the US embassy in XXXX. Her husband was XXXX years old, and worked for a XXXX company in Yemen.\nTravel Route\n[14] The claimants went to Egypt after they left Yemen. They arrived in Cairo on May 15, 2015 and resided there until April 1, 2016 when they left Egypt and flew to the United States using their US visas.6 They subsequently left the United States without making an asylum claim and travelled to Fort Erie on April 7, 2016 where they made a refugee claim. 7\nEgypt\n[15] In her BOC, the female claimant describes her family's residence in Egypt as follows: \"We made efforts to stay in Egypt, however our efforts were not successful. My husband failed to extend his status in Egypt.\"\n[16] The female claimant was asked what status she had in Egypt. She said that she had a temporary resident visa, but her husband doesn't have it. She said they were trying to settle down in Egypt because her mother and uncle are there. She said they were trying to legalize their stay, and since she couldn't do that with her husband, they decided to leave.\n[17] She was asked why they didn't make a refugee claim in Egypt. She said that in Egypt, there are refugees coming from Syria, Libya, and Yemen and she thought it would take forever to stay in line and register, and she wasn't sure how the government would treat them. She confirmed that none of her relatives made a refugee claim in Egypt.\n[18] The panel noted for the claimant that she obviously knew that she could make a refugee claim in Egypt given her evidence that refugees were flowing into that country. She said yes, but said that she didn't know she had to apply in Egypt, and didn't look into detailed information about refugee status there. She said that what she read generally is that people stay in long lines and that treatment is not the same as in other places.\n[19] The panel rejects the female claimant's explanation for the failure of the claimants to make a refugee claim in Egypt. It finds on the basis of her testimony that the claimants did not make efforts to inform themselves of the refugee process in Egypt. The panel acknowledges that the line-up to make a refugee claim in Egypt may have been long, but it notes that the claimants were in Egypt for approximately one year without making a claim, and additionally chose to secure other status within the country. It finds that the claimants had ample opportunity to make a refugee claim in Egypt during that time if they wished to do so.\n[20] The panel finds the female claimant's explanation that she didn't claim because she didn't want to wait in line is trite when compared to the gravity of the persecution she alleges she faced in Yemen, and indicates a lack of subjective fear. It rejects her explanation that she didn't know how Egypt would treat them given that she acknowledged that Egypt provided a registration process for refugees, and that she didn't look into the matter further. It rejects her explanation that the treatment of refugees is not the same as in other places and finds that her failure to claim in Egypt reflects a preference for forum shopping.\n[21] The panel finds that the failure of the claimants to make a refugee claim in Egypt undermines their subjective fear under s.96, as well as their credibility under s.97 and undermines the likelihood, on a balance of probabilities, that their allegations of persecution in Yemen are credible.\nTemporary resident visas in Egypt\n[22] The claimants did not provide a copy of their temporary resident visas in Egypt. The panel is unaware of what rights to residency the claimant and her family had in Egypt, and what steps, if any were required to remain there. It draws a negative inference with respect to the failure of the claimants to provide the panel with documentation with respect to their status in Egypt given the length of their residency there.\nFailure to Claim in the US\n[23] The female claimant said that neither she nor her family made refugee claims in the US. She was asked why. She said because she had no relatives there. She said they thought that applying in Canada would be good for them because they have a family member in Canada, and it would be better to live in a family and safe place. She was asked if this was her criteria, why she didn't make a refugee claim in Egypt where she has several relatives. She said that she didn't know that.\n[24] She was asked if she wanted refugee protection from the United States. She said that she didn't think about it this way. She said she thought about protection with a family member. The panel acknowledges that the claimants have an anchor relative in Canada, however it notes that they also have anchor relatives in Egypt, and that Egypt is also a signatory to the 1951 UN Convention. The panel therefore rejects her explanation that they chose to claim in Canada, and not the US, because they have an anchor relative here when they also have relatives in Egypt.\n[25] It notes that the claimants had valid US visas when they entered the US, and that the female claimant had worked for the US embassy in Yemen. It finds that these factors could have assisted them in bringing an asylum claim in the US given that they would have had legal status during the time required to bring a claim, and relied on their former ties to the US to advance their claim. The panel finds that the conduct of the claimants in failing to claim in Egypt and the United States amounts to forum shopping. It finds that this forum shopping undermines their subjective fear under s.96 and their credibility under s.97, and the likelihood, on a balance of probabilities, that the persecution they allege they experienced in Yemen ever occurred.\nEmployment with US embassy\n[26] Although the claimant alleges in her BOC that she was a senior XXXX XXXX with the embassy, and that \"my work was considered critical to their operations,\" and that \"accommodations were made to ensure my safety, such as sending an armored vehicle to escort me to and from work,\" there is nothing from the US embassy to support these allegations about her profile. Rather the claimant submitted a \"To Whom it May Concern\" letter dated June 20, 2005 on US letterhead indicating that the writer had supervised the claimant on several occasions, and that she was a \"XXXX XXXX\" after working in XXXX XXXX, and had XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The panel assigns little weight to this letter given it was written 11 years earlier and provides no information with respect to the claimant's role or involvement with the embassy thereafter.\n[27] There is little corroborating evidence from the embassy with respect to the claimant's function or the nature of her employment with the embassy after 2005 other than a May 2016 pay slip and seminar completion certificates. The claimant submitted several certificates for IT seminars and training, some of which were issued by the US embassy. The panel finds that these certificates do not establish that the claimant's function at the embassy \"was critical to the operations\" of the US embassy. Although the panel finds that the embassy may have provided accommodations to its employees to ensure their safety, it finds that it had insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to find that these accommodations were provided to the claimant because her work was critical to the operations of the embassy or because she was targeted as a result of her work there.\nUS Embassy in Yemen closed on February 10, 2015\n[28] The US embassy in Yemen was closed on February 10, 2015. However, the claimant states in her BOC: \"I continued to work with the US Embassy until I escaped Yemen in June 2015.\" She was asked how she could work for the embassy up until June 2015 given the embassy's earlier closure.\n[29] She said when the embassy closed, all of the Americans left. She said files were destroyed, and only the military were left behind. She said they were still employees still employed by the embassy when it closed. She said local employees stayed in Yemen, and no one worked with the embassy since then, and that they were on call.\n[30] She was asked why she would be on call given the conditions she described at the embassy. She said they were still on call and were still employees. She said if they want us to do anything on line, we can do it, and that the public affairs office was still working. She said \"but for me, if the embassy was closed, and there is no one there, I didn't need to go to work at the embassy, so they are putting us on hold on their payroll and if they needed us to resume working, so we stayed on the payroll.\"\n[31] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, and the basis of the embassy closure on February 10, 20158, that the claimant ceased working for the embassy, in whatever function she may have had, on that day. The panel gives little weight to her allegation that she was on call given that the embassy was \"shuttered\" and staffers destroyed files, documents and heavier weapons.9 It acknowledges that she may have continued to receive payment from the US given the abrupt closure of the embassy on February 10, 2015, but it finds, on a balance of probabilities, and on the basis of all of the foregoing that the claimant's actual employment with the embassy ceased on February 10, 2015.\n[32] The panel acknowledges that the claimant had some form of employment with the US embassy. Other than the 2006 reference letter from a previous supervisor at the embassy, and some XXXX workshops that she had taken with the embassy, the panel finds that it did not have sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish the claimant's profile during her employment at the embassy. It finds that her testimony in this regard that was undermined by embellishment. The panel will now consider the claimant's allegations that she was targeted as a result of her employment with the embassy and her related allegations before assessing the risk associated with her former employment.\nHouthi threat\n[33] The claimant alleged that she received threats from a distant relative who is Houthi. She was asked how many phone calls she received from this distant relative.. She said one call, and one verbal face to face. She said the verbal face to face took place in March 2015. She said her uncle passed away, and they were paying condolence to her cousin at that time. She said that she saw her distant relative, Ali on her way going out. She said that he told her face to face that: \"I warned you with the continuous work with the embassy and I told you to resign, and you didn't listen. This is not good for you for not listening.\"\n[34] The claimant mentions in her BOC that she received a phone call from her distant cousin in the fall of 2014, as found at paragraph 15. She also mentions that she received \"another verbal threat from the same relative\" as found at paragraph 17. However, she doesn't mention in her BOC that he personally confronted her \"face to face\" at a family gathering in March 2015, and specifically threatened her with respect to her \"continuous work\" at the embassy. She was asked why she didn't mention this incident in her BOC. She said that she thought the word threatened was explained, and that everything she wrote in her BOC covered everything she needed, and that she didn't know she had to be that detailed.\n[35] The panel rejects this explanation. The claimant's allegation of the threat and confrontation in March 2015 is not mentioned in her BOC. The panel notes that the BOC instructions direct the claimant to \"INCLUDE DATES, NAMES AND PLACES WHEREVER possible (sic).\" As well, the claimant's BOC indicates that the information she provided in her BOC was complete, true and correct. The panel finds, in these circumstances, that the claimant understood her obligation to provide particulars of her allegations, as per the BOC instructions and her BOC declaration.\n[36] The panel acknowledges that claimants often provide details with respect to their allegations at the hearing. However, it finds that the underlying issue for which the details are later provided must be identified within the parameters of the BOC instructions. It considered the claimant's testimony that she is equally fluent in English and Arabic, and finds, on this basis, that a lack of comprehension of English was not an issue.\n[37] The panel finds that the claimant, as per her testimony, attempted to cover off an undisclosed incident in her BOC under the unspecified rubric of a threat. The panel finds this approach undermines her credibility given that her BOC declaration indicates that the information she provided in her BOC is complete, true and correct. The panel finds that the omitted information is material because it involves a threat allegedly made by a Houthi who specifically targeted her because of her employment with the US embassy.\n[38] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, given the materiality of the omission, and in the absence of a reasonable explanation for it, that the claimant fabricated her evidence that her distant Houthi cousin threatened her in person during a family gathering about her work with the US embassy.. This finding undermines the claimant's credibility.\nHow the claimant knows her distant cousin is Houthi\n[39] The claimant was asked how she knew her distant cousin, XXXX, was a Houthi. She said from his family. She said she saw his family, and they knew he was a Houthi. She was asked how she found out, and what they told her. She said that she \"was sure\" about this as a result of his phone call in which he allegedly told her to quit her work with the embassy.\n[40] The panel finds that the claimant\\s evidence that her distant cousin is a Houthi is based on his alleged phone call and noted comments to her. It finds her conclusion that her distant cousin is a Houthi on the basis of this phone call to be speculative. The panel finds that the claimant was evasive when asked to disclose how she knew her cousin was Houthi and what she allegedly learned from her cousin's family, and what they told her. The panel finds that it had insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to find that the claimant had a distant cousin who is Houthi.\nBOC Omission: threats involve work at embassy\n[41] The panel assigns little weight to the threatening call mentioned at paragraph 14 of her BOC given that the female claimant did not mention in her BOC that the caller challenged her with respect to her employment at the embassy. The panel finds the omission is material and that it goes to the heart of her claim. Nor did the claimant mention in her BOC that the caller advised her that he knew where she worked. The panel finds this omitted information is material given that it relevant to her allegation that she was targeted because of her employment at the embassy.\n[42] When asked to explain these omissions the claimant indicated that she mentioned at paragraph 14 of her BOC that the caller told her that he knew everything about her, and that this covered the omitted information. The panel rejects this explanation. It finds that this general utterance included in the BOC does not adequately explain the claimant's failure to include the noted specific omitted information in her BOC. It finds her explanation that the alleged caller's general remarks include the omitted information to be speculative.\n[43] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, given the materiality of the omitted information from the claimant's BOC, and in the absence of a reasonable explanation for the omissions, that the claimant fabricated her evidence that the caller challenged her with respect to her employment and advised her that he knew where she worked. These findings undermine the claimant's credibility and her related allegation that she was targeted as the result of her employment with the embassy.\nPrecipitating Incidents involving Houthis\n[44] The claimant alleges in her BOC at paragraph 18 that her husband's car was vandalized in XXXX 2015, and there was an attempted break in to their home in XXXX 2015. She alleges that their home was broken into and vandalized shortly afterward and the words: \"Death to America and Death to Israel, Death to the Traitor\" were written on a wall. She added that objects in her yard had been moved at the time of the attempted break in and the break-in which followed.\n[45] The panel noted for her that she didn't mention in her BOC who was responsible for all of this. She was asked if she knew. She said that from the slogan on the wall, it was clearly the Houthis, especially since she had also gotten a threat from her distant relative. She confirmed that she didn't actually know who was responsible for these incidents, but added that she was certain they did it because of the slogan. She said only her husband's car was broken where it was stationed in a row of cars, and only her house was targeted, and she was certain the Houthis did everything.\n[46] Despite testifying that she knew with certainty that the Houthis were responsible for the vandalism and attempted break-in, the claimant also testified that she didn't know who actually was responsible for these alleged incidents. The panel finds it had insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to find that the Houthis had vandalized their car or their home or that they had targeted the claimants. The panel acknowledges the claimant's testimony that the slogan found in the graffiti is associated with Houthis. However, it rejects her explanation that the graffiti meant with certainty that Houthis had been responsible for the alleged vandalism given that claimant also testified that she didn't know who was responsible for the vandalism. It rejects her explanation that the prior alleged phone call from her alleged distant Houthi cousin necessarily meant that the Houthis were responsible for the vandalism given that the panel finds there was insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to support this assumption or to make a connection between the two incidents. The panel finds for all these reasons that it did not have sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to find that the claimants had been targeted by Houthis.\nBOC Omission - Houthi threat reported to embassy\n[47] The claimant states at paragraph 15 that her distant cousin warned her that there would be \"severe consequences of continuing to work\" with the US embassy. She was asked if she reported this incident to the US embassy. She said that she reported it to the senior regional security officer.\n[48] She was asked why she didn't mention that she had reported this threat to the US embassy in her BOC. She said that she didn't know that she had had to detail everything in her narrative. The panel noted for the claimant that the threat involved the security of the embassy, and asked why she wouldn't include information of this nature in her BOC. She said she mentioned in her BOC that the embassy prioritizes the safety of their staff. She said she didn't know she had to detail this.\n[49] The panel rejects these explanations. It finds her allegation that she reported a personal threat made against her by her Houthi cousin to the US embassy is a material allegation given that it involved the safety of the embassy as well as her own. It rejects her explanation that she didn't know she had to detail everything in her narrative given the materiality of the allegation and given that she did not mention this incident in the BOC at all. It rejects her explanation that a general statement about the embassy being concerned with the safety of their staff included this incident as the panel finds this generalized statement does not disclose her allegation that she reported the Houthi threat to the embassy. The panel finds on a balance of probabilities, and given the materiality of the omission, and in the absence of a reasonable explanation for its omission, that the claimant fabricated her evidence that she reported the Houthi threat to the embassy. This finding undermines her related allegation that she received a threatening phone call from a distant Houthi cousin.\nFacebook posts\n[50] The claimant submitted Facebook posts that she wrote as found at Ex 7, pp 48-52. In these posts, the claimant writes:: \"People are dieing from weapons owned by the country. So what are the differences between Al-Houthi, XXXX XXXX (XXXX) and Saudi? All of them are destroying the country.\" She also posted: \"Shame on you Houthi for using women. Shame on you to protect yourself by using women. Where is the characters and qualities considered to be typical of men.\"\n[51] The claimant said that she also went on other web pages and chatted on webpage accounts belonging to her colleagues, on general websites and other news. She said that by other news she meant other groups on Facebook, her friends' articles, and news pages from friends' groups on Facebook.\n[52] She was asked whether the comments she made on other Facebook sites were similar to the comments she made on her own Facebook page. She said yes, and it showed her opinion, opposition and criticism.\n[53] She was asked how others would know to go to her Facebook page, and read what she had written. She said that her page is open to her colleagues, to anyone who can participate. She said that those participating would do so with tags or notes, and others from their page will see their notes. She was asked why others would be interested and drawn to her page to see what she had to say. She said she didn't know.\n[54] She added that Houthis are not tolerant of anyone who would oppose them, especially if they work with Americans, and would consider them to be traitors. She said that she is a woman, and because of her work with the Americans, she thinks that she would be targeted. She confirmed that she did not mention the US embassy in her Facebook posts.\nAnalysis\n[55] The panel notes that the claimant is not a journalist or elected official or an NGO leader, but a private citizen with a Facebook account who chats with similar users. It finds, on a balance of probabilities, and on the basis of her testimony that she didn't know how others would discover her Facebook page, that her Facebook comments would not result in her being targeted by Houthis. Despite voicing her personal opinion on her Facebook page, and chatting on other similar pages and websites, the panel did not have sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to find that the claimant would be targeted by the Houthis or anyone else on the basis of her comments on her Facebook posts. The panel assigns little weight to her Facebook posts for these reasons.\nPolitical Opinion: Women's rights\n[56] The claimant states in paragraph 9 of her BOC that she believes in and supports western values such as democracy, women's rights, freedom of speech, and the importance of the English language. She was asked if she did anything in Yemen to support these views. She said that she made comments on social websites, and had open opinions in the community. She said that given her work in a western place, there was kind of a big mingling with NGOs. She said that she participated in many gatherings or meetings, and her opinion was clear about her opposition to the opinion of the Houthis and their monstrous treatment, and the destruction they did to the country.\n[57] She said she was continuously speaking and expressing her opinion openly at any occasion where she had opportunity, and would openly talk about these views. She said that she was not an official speaker at these meetings, but that she was just talking, expressing and discussing her opinion. She was asked where she expressed these opinions other than NGO meetings. She said if there were public meetings. She was asked if she attended public meetings. She said some of them. She confirmed that she expressed her opinion about the Houthis at these public meetings.\nBOC Omission\n[58] She was asked why she didn't mention in her BOC that she made these comments at NGO and public meetings in Yemen. She said that she thought that she mentioned this in the BOC, and that's why she didn't talk much. She said that in the narrative, there is more than one paragraph in the BOC to express her views about Houthis, and she thought that would be enough. Counsel referred the panel to paragraph 12 of the BOC which indicates \"I have been vocal on social media outlets many times, expressing my strong criticism of their [Houthis] values, activities, and the brutal damage that they are causing in Yemen.\"\n[59] The panel finds that this passage does not refer to the claimant's allegations that she voiced her political views in the meetings she mentioned. It finds that these omissions are material because it concerns the claimant's alleged political opinion and profile, and her risk of persecution for those reasons. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, given the materiality of the omissions, and in the absence of a reasonable explanation for their omission, that the claimant fabricated evidence with respect to voicing her opinion at NGO and public meetings about western and feminist values. This finding undermines her credibility. It also undermines the credibility of her related allegation that she was targeted by Houthis because of her political opinion.\nGender as grounds for persecution\n[60] The claimant was asked to clarify her evidence about facing persecution because of her gender. She said that she participated with the embassy when it was open, and helped the XXXX XXXX XXXX She said that they worked with the public affairs office, to help an organization that trained ladies in the XXXX XXXX in approximately 2008-2009. She confirmed that it was culturally acceptable in Yemen for women to work with XXXX, but not XXXX XXXX which involved running XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. She confirmed that she didn't teach women to do this kind of work.\n[61] She was asked if she did anything in Yemen to support or advance the rights of women in a western type context. She said that in the past she took part as an XXXX XXXX with a cultural attach\u00e9 to help society. She said as a member of the embassy, she participated in workshops held by the embassy where she helped with translation and participated in discussion. The claimant said that she gave her opinion about women's rights and democracy as a member of the embassy, and that she participated in workshops and many social functions and parties given by the embassy, and that she was involved with items of translation, represented the embassy, and that they discussed issues the embassy was doing according to specific issues they were attending.\nBOC Omission - voicing opinion about women's rights etc.\n[62] She was asked why this information was not in her BOC. She said that she thought that what she mentioned in her narrative, there are two parts: that she was known publically at the US embassy, and that she was supporting democracy and human rights and other stuff, and she thought what she said in BOC would be enough and it could be explained at the hearing.\n[63] The panel rejects this explanation. It finds it reasonable to expect that if the female attended meetings and other events in Yemen where she expressed her opinion on women's rights and democracy that she would include this information in her BOC given that it is material to her profile and her allegation and testimony that as \"a woman, and because of my work with the Americans, I think I would be targeted.\"\n[64] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, and on the basis of the materiality of the noted omissions, and in the absence of a reasonable explanation for the omissions, that the claimant fabricated her evidence that she voiced her political opinion about women's rights and democracy at various meetings. This finding undermines her credibility. It also undermines the likelihood that her related evidence concerning her alleged profile at the embassy is credible.\n[65] The panel acknowledges counsel's submission that the claimant's alleged involvement with women's issues was not a reason why she left Yemen. The panel nonetheless finds that the female claimant advanced a feminist profile as part of her political opinion which it was required to examine, and to which it assigns little weight for the reasons given in this decision.\nLetter from Mother\n[66] The claimant submitted a note from her mother which indicates that she is \"currently a resident\" of Egypt, and that \"I certify\" that the female claimant was \"threatened by the Houthi group.\" She also indicates that \"I bear witness that XXXX XXXX joined to al-Houthi group.\"\n[67] The panel notes that the mother does not indicate the source of her knowledge or beliefs, nor does she identify the threat or \"Houthi Group\" to which she refers. Nor is her letter sworn. The panel assigns little weight to her letter for these reasons.\nLetter from Mr. XXXX\n[68] The claimants submitted a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX which indicates that the claimants lived at his house after they received threats from the Al Houthi group. The panel notes that the writer does not disclose the source of his belief that the claimants had been threatened by the \"Alhouthi group\" Nor does he provide contact information for himself with respect to what country he lives in or where he might be found. Although the writer provides a photocopy of one page of his Yemeni passport as identification, the panel found the photocopy to be blurry and partly illegible. The panel assigns little weight to his letter for these reasons.\nE-mail from Mr. XXXX\n[69] The claimant submitted an e-mail from Mr. XXXX who indicates that he worked for the US embassy in Yemen, and that he knows the claimant as a \"good colleague for everyone of us in the embassy.\" He indicates that US embassy employees had been threatened several times and were approached by anti-American groups, and that he was personally approached by the Houthis after the embassy closed.\n[70] The panel assigns little weight to this e-mail given that it is unsworn, and unsigned despite apparently being sent from the US where services such as notarization and regular mail are widely available which would add to its credibility. Although a photocopy of a Yemeni passport page was submitted in support of the writer's identity, the photocopy is of very poor quality and not entirely legible. Although the writer generally indicates in his e-mail that embassy employees had been threatened several times and were approached by anti-American groups, he does not provide further particulars, nor does he indicate that the claimant was threatened or approached by anti-American groups.\n[71] The panel acknowledges that the claimant states at paragraph 14 of her BOC that \"I would often hear that other employees were starting to receive threats from anonymous individuals\" However, the claimant does not specify in her BOC who allegedly made these threats or to whom, and the panel therefore finds that her BOC and the e-mail are not corroborative. The panel assigns little weight to the e-mail for these reasons.\nConcerns involving children\n[72] The female claimant alleges at Q.2(j) of her BOC that she is afraid that her children would be kidnapped and killed She testified that she believed this would happen as a direct threat to her, and because the security situation is not stable in Yemen. She clarified that she believed her children would be kidnapped because of her opinion about the Houthis and her work with the Americans.\n[73] The panel noted for the female claimant that she didn't mention in her BOC that the children had been threatened in any way with kidnapping or any other harm. She said that her fear was based on what happened to her by the Houthis and the threats she received caused her to worry in general about herself and her family, that they would be exposed to danger because of her opinions, and because of their beliefs that whoever works with Americans are to be considered to be traitors and spies. She said that her husband and her children would face the same risk that she does.\n[74] The panel finds that her allegation concerning her children was intended to include her family in her broader allegation that they would face harm because she allegedly had been targeted by Houthis. It finds, however, that it did not have sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to find that the female claimant was targeted by Houthis. This finding applies to her children and members of her family as well.\nEmployment at the Embassy: Risk\n[75] The panel finds that it did not have credible and trustworthy evidence to find that the claimants were targeted in Yemen on the basis of the female claimant's employment with the US embassy, whatever that employment may have been. It notes that her employment with the embassy began as early as 2005, if not earlier, and the claimant did not allege that she experienced difficulties during this period owing to her employment other than the allegations which she made in her BOC which the panel found to lack credibility.\n[76] The claimant no longer works for the US embassy. She was asked how others would know that she once worked there. She indicated that they would know if she told them. The panel finds on this basis, and on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant's previous employment with the US embassy would not be generally known to others unless the female claimant specifically told them.\n[77] Although the claimant indicated that she was proud of her work with the embassy, and would like to talk about it, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that what others could learn about her former employment depends on the willingness of the claimant to disclose this information to others and that is therefore within her control. As noted, the panel finds that it had insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to find that the claimants were targeted because of her former employment with the embassy.. It notes that the US embassy was closed on February 10, 2015, and the claimants left Sanaa four months later, without incident, and went to Egypt and failed to make a refugee claim which the panel found undermined their subjective fear.\n[78] Although the claimant alleges in her BOC that she and her family were in hiding before they left Yemen, and that they were targeted by Houthis because of her employment, the panel finds that it did not have sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to find that the claimant was targeted by Houthis. It therefore assigns little weight to her allegation that her family was in hiding as a result of being targeted by Houthis. Although the panel acknowledges the claimants fled Yemen, it finds, on a balance of probabilities, and for all the reasons given, that they did not flee because they were targeted, but left because of the deterioration of the security conditions in Yemen.\nArticles\n[79] The assigns little weight to an article submitted by counsel which indicates that a Yemeni embassy employee, who provided security to the embassy, was shot and killed by persons who may have links to al-Qaeda. The same article also indicates that previous attacks had targeted Yemeni intelligence, military and security officials, and the panel finds that the female claimant does not have these profiles. The Department of State report, 1(b) indicates that non-state actors have targeted foreigners., including those believed to be working for foreign diplomatic missions. However, the panel notes that the claimant would not be perceived as a foreigner, and that she no longer works for the embassy, nor on a balance of probabilities, would be perceived by others as having worked for the embassy for the reasons given.\n[80] The panel assigns little weight to counsel's documentary evidence which indicates that the US embassy may have been attacked by extremists in 2008 as the article also indicates that the attack may have occurred for other reasons unrelated to the embassy. It also gives little weight to a 2014 article submitted by counsel which indicates that Americans who worked for the embassy and American journalists were targeted by extremists given that the claimant is not an American and does not share this profile. It acknowledges that counsel submitted an article which indicates that unknown assailants shot at a US vehicle near the embassy containing US diplomatic personnel, but finds that as such the targets, were likely Americans, and the claimant does not share this profile.\n[81] The panel finds that it did not have sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to find that the female claimant or her family were targeted because of her employment or former employment at the embassy or that they would be so targeted if they returned to Yemen. It finds that she does not have a profile that would subject her or her family to harm if they were to return to Yemen. It finds, on a balance of probabilities, that mere employment itself at the former embassy, without any credible or trustworthy evidence of harm or targeting, and where the source of her former employment is solely dependent on disclosure from the female claimant herself, would not place her or her family at a risk of harm. It finds that non-disclosure of her former employment does not rise to the level of persecution.\n[82] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, and for all the reasons given that the risk that claimants would face should they return to Yemen is a generalized one caused by political strife in that country which would be faced generally by other individuals in or from that country. It finds that this generalized, non-targeted risk is specifically excluded from refugee protection by s.97.1(b)(ii) of IRPA.\nCONCLUSION\n[83] The panel considered all three protection grounds under sections 96 and 97(1) of IRPA and, considered the totality of the evidence cumulatively. It finds that the female claimant was generally not credible, and that the claims of the other claimants who depended on her testimony and BOC narrative was therefore also undermined. It finds her allegations were undermined by material BOC omissions and fabrication of evidence. It finds, on a balance of probabilities, and for the reasons given in this decision that the claimants were not targeted for any reason in Yemen and would face only a generalized risk of harm should they return to Yemen, and are therefore specifically excluded from protection by IRPA.\n[84] While none of the credibility concerns raised may be sufficient, each on their own to negate the claim, the cumulative effect of all of them is that the panel did not have sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence upon which to base a determination that the claimants are Convention refugees or a person in need of protection. For these reasons, all the claims are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"N. Cassano\"\nN.

He moved to India with his parents in 2007 and returned to Sri Lanka in August 2015.\n[4] Upon returning to Sri Lanka, he went to Colombo to take a seaman's course. While visiting family in Thondamanaru, his uncle was killed on XXXX XXXX, 2015 when the claimant was staying at his house. The claimant made inquiries at the army camp as he suspected army officials had killed his uncle.\n[5] The claimant was subsequently questioned by army officials and accused of being involved in his uncle's death. The claimant made a complaint to the human rights commission in Jaffna and was thereafter again questioned and threatened by army officials.\n[6] The claimant then made arrangements with an agent to leave Sri Lanka. He fears Sri Lankan army officials should he return there.\nANALYSIS\n[7] The determinative issue in this case is credibility.\nIdentity\n[8] The claimant's identity as a national of Sri Lanka is established through the supporting documentation filed, namely, a copy of his passport1.\nCredibility\n[9] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true unless there is valid reason to doubt their veracity. The determination as to whether a claimant's evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities. Having considered the claimant's testimony, the panel has credibility concerns as outlined below.\nThe claimant's documents\n[10] The claimant provides many documents2 regarding the seaman's course he took in Colombo. The documents give dates the courses were completed as well as the titles of the courses. The documents all have signatures of the officials of the institution as well as signatures of the claimant.\n[11] The documents indicate that the first course ran from XXXX XXXX to September 12 (\"food and beverage operations\"), there were courses from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, 2015 (\"proficiency in personal safety and social responsibilities\"), XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, 2015 (\"proficiency in personal survival techniques\"), XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, 2015 (\"proficiency in fire prevention and fire fighting\"), XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, 2015 (\"proficiency in elementary first aid\") and XXXX XXXX, 2015, a six hour course entitled \"proficiency in security awareness.\"\n[12] The claimant testified that the courses were held in Colombo and that he lived in a hostel associated with the school. He also testified that his uncle lived in Thondamanaru, a six hour bus ride from Colombo.\n[13] The claimant testified previously that he left Colombo to visit his uncle in Thondamanaru on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and arrived on XXXX XXXX, 2015, the day that his uncle was killed. He testified that four days after his uncle's death, he was apprehended by army officials who questioned him about his uncle's death and threatened to kill him if they saw him outside.\n[14] The panel confirmed to the claimant that the day he was picked up by army officials was four days after his uncle died and confirmed that day was XXXX XXXX, 2015. The claimant agreed.\n[15] The panel then asked the claimant why, if he was in Thondamanaru being questioned by army officials on XXXX XXXX, 2015, does one of his seaman's course certificates state that he was on course in Colombo for six hours on XXXX XXXX, 2015.\n[16] The claimant then stated that the school booked a later date for a course he had studied earlier. The panel asked how he knew this and he said they told him they would put the date of issue and that what had been taught earlier they dated later. The panel remarked that the certificate shows the date of course completion as well as the date of issue of the certificate. Both show XXXX XXXX, 2015.\n[17] The panel asked whether the dates were incorrect on the other certificates and the claimant said just the last certificate. He also testified that the last day he took courses was XXXX XXXX, 2015. The panel asked again why the certificate dated XXXX XXXX is the wrong date and all the other certificates contain the correct date. The claimant said because it is the closing date, the exams were held before and when issued, the certificate gave the closing date. When asked what he meant by closing date, the claimant said school was closing for the holidays. His counsel asked him what holidays and the claimant said he did not know. Counsel asked for the dates of the holidays and the claimant said he did not know.\n[18] The panel notes that the claimant disclosed these documents at the first sitting on June 8, 2016. He did not provide any accompanying note stating that the date on the last course certificate is incorrect.\n[19] The panel does not find the claimant's explanation of the certificate date to be credible or reasonable and draws a negative credibility inference. The panel finds that the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015 certificate casts doubt on the claimant's entire story and finds further that his explanations of the dates do not make sense.\nGeneral Credibility\n[20] The panel had difficulty understanding the account of the claimant's behaviour following the deliverance of his uncle's body. His testimony was stilted and confused. He testified that his uncle's body was delivered to the home by army officers who said they found it. The claimant then said the body was cremated and that 50-60 people were at the house. The claimant could not, however, explain how those people were alerted to the uncle's death or how they came to be at the house. The claimant was asked several times by the panel and by counsel to explain step by step what happened after soldiers dropped the body off. The claimant was unable to do that and the panel draws a negative credibility inference.\n[21] The claimant testified that he was afraid to stay in Colombo because he feared army officials would find him there. Yet the panel notes that the claimant kept returning to Thondamanaru to exactly where the army officials knew where to find him. The claimant was asked several times why he feared army officials in Colombo given his testimony that nothing happened to him there and that the army knew where to find him at his uncle's house. The claimant was unable to provide an explanation. The panel finds the testimony concerning the claimant's fear of officials to be confused and illogical and draws a negative credibility inference.\n[22] The claimant insisted he was too frightened to stay in Colombo because he feared army officials would find him, yet instead he kept returning to the house in Thondamanaru where his uncle lived and where the army officials had seen him (when they returned his uncle's body).\n[23] The panel acknowledges the difficulties of testifying in an unfamiliar milieu through an interpreter. The panel does note however, that the claimant is not an uneducated, unsophisticated or untravelled man: He has worked in India as an XXXX XXXX; he successfully completed the XXXX course in Sri Lanka; he travelled from India to Sri Lanka on his own; he travelled to Canada through Qatar, Mexico, the United States; and he is a mature adult. The panel therefore finds his testimony concerning his fear of staying in Colombo does not have the ring of truth given that no army authorities approached him in Colombo. He lived and studied there without incident. He obtained his passport there and picked up his XXXX book and all his course certificates. He did not live with family there, but on his own at accommodations associated with his school.\n[24] The panel notes that the claimant was released by army officials whom he says are interested in him owing to the suspicious death of his uncle. The panel finds on balance that if army authorities were concerned about the claimant's actions, they would not have released him from detention.\nAuthorities' interest in the claimant\n[25] The claimant was asked whom he feared and he stated the army and the police.\n[26] The claimant was asked what document he used to leave Sri Lanka in January 2016 and he testified that he used his own passport which he had obtained from officials in Colombo in January 2016.\n[27] The panel finds that the claimant left Sri Lanka using his own genuine passport. The panel finds that if Sri Lankan authorities had any interest in arresting the claimant, they could have done so at the airport in Colombo.\nThe UK Home Office report also contains information on the verification of passengers' prior criminal offenses and indicates that the Department of Immigration and Emigration (DIE) has access to an alert list. This list is said to contain \"information relating to court orders, warrants of arrest, jumping bail, escaping from detention as well as information from Interpol and the SIS computer system.\" According to the report, the DIE computer database has an alert system based on this list, but the alert system does not detail the reason for the alert, since the alert simply indicates that DIE staff must refer passengers who are flagged to the CID or the SIS. The August 2009 UK Operational Guidance Note states that immigration officers at BIA use a computer system that flags those who are \"on the wanted or stop list,\" but that there is no concrete evidence to affirm that the database contains information on every individual who has been detained by the police or army.3\n[28] The panel finds that this detail goes to the heart of his claim because his agents of fear are the army and police officials, both state authorities. The panel finds if the claimant were indeed wanted by authorities he would not have been permitted to leave legally using his own passport which he testified that he did do.\n[29] The panel notes the XXXX XXXX, 2015 claimant's complaint to the Grama Niladhari of his town. The complaint states that the claimant asked for protection on XXXX XXXX, 2015 as he was being threatened by \"army and intelligence.\" The author refers the claimant to the human rights commission.\n[30] The panel notes the document provided by the human rights commission which indicates that the claimant made a complaint on XXXX XXXX, 2016. The complaint states that the claimant fears \"that the Army will connect me with the murder of my uncle.\"\n[31] The panel finds these documents indicate that the claimant waited until just before he left Thondamanaru to complain, that he did not make a complaint when he was first questioned, and that he does not ask for any means of redress. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities and given the various credibility concerns, that the claimant made these complaints in order to obtain documents to support a refugee claim and for no other purpose.\nCONCLUSION\n[32] Accordingly the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that there is not more than a mere possibility that the claimant would be persecuted for a Convention ground or that it is likely he would be subjected personally to a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture. The claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\n\"Sarah Morgan\"\nSarah Morgan\n\"24 August 2016\"\nDate\n1 Exhibit 1\n2 Exhibit 5\n3 Exhibit 3 NDP: Sri Lanka, 29 April 2016 version, item 14.3, LKA103344.E\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRPD.29.1 (August 31, 2012)\nRPD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SPR : TB6-05103\n",

Bruyn\nBarrister and Solicitor\nConseil(s) du (de la\/des) demandeur(e)(s) d'asile\nDesignated Representative(s)\nXXXX XXXX\nRepr\u00e9sentant(e)(s) d\u00e9sign\u00e9(e)(s)\nCounsel for the Minister\nN\/A\nConseil du (de la) ministre\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The claimants, XXXX XXXX (the \"principal claimant\"), XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX (collectively \"the claimants\"), are citizens of Albania and claim refugee protection pursuant to s. 96 and s. 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)of Canada.\n[2] The claims were heard jointly pursuant to Rule 55(1) of the Refugee Protection Division rules and in this regard, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX claims are based upon that of the principal claimant, XXXX XXXX.\n[3] Pursuant to s. 167(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Act, XXXX XXXX has been appointed the designated representative of the minor claimants, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The principal claimant alleges that as a result of a disagreement over his purchase of land in his hometown of XXXX, Albania in XXXX 2000, he and his family face a risk to their life from XXXX XXXX, who is the son of XXXX XXXX (the man from whom the principal claimant purchased the land). The sale of the land was done on an informal basis and there was no paper work or official registration of the land with any official bodies.\n[5] The principal claimant alleges that he began to build a home on the land in XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX arrived at the work site and insisted that it was his land and threatened the principal claimant and his work crew. The principal claimant later determined that XXXX XXXX had died a few months previously and that XXXX XXXX had a bad reputation and his crew feared violence and retribution.\n[6] The principal claimant returned to his land in late XXXX 2001 only to find XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, a police officer, arrive and threaten him. The police officer allegedly put a gun to the claimant's head and they both said they had warned him to stay away, at which point XXXX XXXX began hitting the principal claimant with XXXX XXXX police baton. The principal claimant made it to the hospital and was there for XXXX weeks.\n[7] The principal claimant's father sent XXXX XXXX to Greece to be safe from XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX gave birth to both XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX in Greece.\n[8] The principal claimant left the hospital early, returned home and then joined his wife in Greece in XXXX 2001.\n[9] XXXX XXXX and associates allegedly went to the principal claimant's parents' home in XXXX 2001, armed with a gun, and beat up his brother, XXXX, his father, and then burnt down his family's home. After this incident XXXX was also sent to Greece to join the principal claimant.\n[10] The claimants moved from town to town in Greece to avoid being found by XXXX XXXX.\n[11] The principal claimant's brother XXXX was gravely injured in Greece on or about XXXX XXXX, 2002 and then died from his injuries on or about XXXX XXXX, 2003. The claimants allege that it was XXXX XXXX or his associates who killed him.\n[12] The claimants moved to three different places in Greece after XXXX death without incident, until XXXX XXXX, 2013 when the claimants allege that one of XXXX XXXX associates tried to kidnap their son XXXX from outside his school in XXXX, Greece. The claimants again moved elsewhere in Greece.\n[13] In 2014 the principal claimant met a man who could send the claimants to Canada using fake Greek passports. It took the principal claimant some time to amass the funds demanded by the agent, but they ultimately made it to Canada in XXXX 2016.\nDETERMINATION\n[14] The determinative issue in these claims which applies to both section 96 and section 97(1) of the IRPA, is credibility. It should be noted that the claimants have presented the agent of persecution as being a radical Muslim and that religion may be a reason for the continuing feud as they are Christian Orthodox. However, the panel has not been presented with sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to conclude on a balance of probabilities that religion is the motivating factor of the agent of persecution or that the agent of persecution is even of the Muslim faith. The claimants' allegations in this regard are not credible, considering the general lack of credibility of the basis of the claims as further discussed below. Thus, the panel confirms its finding that the claimants are not convention refugees.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[15] The panel finds that the claimants' identity as citizens of Albania is established on the basis of their testimony and Albanian passports.1\n[16] The panel finds that even though both XXXX and XXXX XXXX were born in Greece, they did not also automatically gain Greek citizenship2 and their parents did not take steps for them to gain Greek citizenship.\n[17] The panel accepts the principal claimant's testimony that the claimants did not acquire permanent residency in Greece. The testimony is corroborated by the claimants' passports, which do not contain any stamps or visas indicating any kind of official status, temporary or otherwise in Greece.\nCredibility\n[18] The central issue of these claims is credibility. Credibility is of utmost importance in these claims as the claimants have not provided reliable corroborating documentary evidence of: the alleged land sale; the existence of XXXX XXXX; XXXX XXXX reputation and his associates; that the claimants having been targeted by XXXX XXXX; injuries suffered by the principal claimant; the principal claimant's family home being burnt down (eg., photographs); or, evidence that XXXX XXXX death or the alleged kidnapping of his son was a result of actions by XXXX XXXX or his associates. Due to the lack of corroborating documents and other material credibility issues that arose but which were not resolved by the claimants, the panel does not believe such allegations save for the initial sale of land. The claimants have provided statements from several people that purportedly substantiate different aspects of the allegations noted above, however the panel discusses the lack of reliability of such documentary evidence later in these reasons\n[19] After careful consideration of the principal claimant's testimony and evidence presented at the hearing of this matter, the panel concludes that the principal claimant and the much of the evidence presented is either not credible or does not objectively establish on a balance of probabilities that certain events occurred for the reasons advanced by the claimants.\nLand Sale\n[20] The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the principal claimant and\/or his family purchased a plot of land in XXXX, Albania from the XXXX family. The claimants have not been able to provide any documentation in respect of the sale of the land, however the principal claimant has explained that it was common for land to be sold an informal manner, with registration to occur after the residence was completed. This informal method of land transfer is supported by objective documentation indicating that the vast majority of property transactions are informal.3 The panel therefore finds that the principal claimant did informally purchase the land and that there is a reasonable explanation for the lack of documentation surrounding the purchase.\nInitial incident\n[21] The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimants have not established that XXXX XXXX harmed or sought to harm the claimants, due to credibility issues and lack of corroborating documentation. The principal claimant alleged that in his second encounter with XXXX XXXX at the disputed property on XXXX XXXX, 2001, XXXX XXXX threatened him and told him that they had warned him to stay away. At this point the principal claimant testified that XXXX XXXX and the policeman, XXXX XXXX, commenced the assault. The panel questioned the principal claimant as to why XXXX XXXX didn't just kill him there and then if that was his aim. The principal claimant explained that XXXX XXXX now wanted to finish him off; that he was a malicious man and a Muslim fanatic who didn't want Christians around and further, that for XXXX XXXX, killing a person is \"like a day at the office\". The panel does not find this explanation credible. The panel finds that if XXXX XXXX was so malicious and indifferent to killing as the principal claimant describes, it would be reasonable to expect him to have killed the principal claimant when he had the opportunity. The panel does not find it credible that the agent of persecution would pursue a 15+ year vendetta against the claimants when it was within his power to settle the issue on XXXX XXXX, 2001.\n[22] Further, the principal claimant confirmed that he never went back to the property; he left Albania altogether and did not advance his claim on the land from Greece. The panel finds that the principal claimant had effectively abandoned his claim to the property. The panel finds that XXXX XXXX would at that point have had free reign over the land and there was no one to challenge his claim. The panel finds this to be a further basis that would weigh against XXXX XXXX pursuing a 15+ year vendetta that would see him allegedly pursue the claimants to Greece, due to the principal claimant initially refusing to stop working on the land when he was first warned.\n[23] The panel finds that the principal claimant has not established on a balance of probabilities that he was injured by XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX. The principal claimant testified that he was in the hospital for about XXXX weeks as a result of the assault; however he did not provide the panel with any medical documentation to confirm his injuries or his stay at the hospital. The principal claimant also did not provide the panel with any evidence of attempts to get such documents or even copies of past passports which would have at least confirmed the date he left Albania after his alleged hospital stay as compared to the alleged departure date of his wife, XXXX XXXX XXXX Further, the principal claimant's parents make no reference to the principal claimant's XXXX week hospital stay in any of their support letters. As a result, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the principal claimant was not assaulted by XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX.\n[24] The principal claimant, through his BOC narrative and his testimony alleged that shortly after he left Albania for Greece, XXXX XXXX and his associates went to his family home, assaulted his brother and father and then burnt down his family home. The principal claimant was unable to provide any photographs of his family home being burnt down or any direct evidence of this occurring at all. Rather, the claimant provided two separate statements from his mother and one from his father regarding past events involving XXXX XXXX.4 The notarized statement dated XXXX XXXX, 2016 from the principal claimant's mother, XXXX XXXX, indicates that \"...my son had a conflict with a person known by us and named XXXX XXXX...\" The statement also indicates that both her sons left Albania to go to Greece in order to protect themselves from XXXX XXXX and that they changed their location several times within Greece. She also notes the death of her son XXXX while in Greece. The panel notes that this statement only indicates that her son had a conflict with XXXX XXXX and that she does not make mention of XXXX XXXX attacking her son XXXX (while he was still in Albania), attacking her husband or burning down her house. The panel does not find it plausible that a woman\/mother whose home was burnt down and her husband and son were attacked, would fail to mention those things in her statement in support of her son's claim. The principal claimant explained that his parents are old and that his mother is forgetting things. The panel does not accept this explanation as being credible, because as the claimants have not presented medical evidence that XXXX XXXX XXXX experiencing memory problems and nor does XXXX XXXX mention memory problems in either of her statements. The panel places no weight on the principal claimant's explanation in this regard. The panel finds that if XXXX XXXX family home had been burnt down by XXXX XXXX and armed men, as alleged, then such an important or traumatic event would have been included in XXXX XXXX statement. The panel finds that XXXX XXXX omission materially casts doubt on the credibility of the principal claimant's BOC narrative and testimony in this regard, on which the other claimants also rely, such that the panel does not believe on a balance of probabilities the allegations of targeting by XXXX XXXX.\n[25] The panel finds that the statement of XXXX XXXX, dated XXXX XXXX, 20165 also fails to mention that he had been beaten up, that his son XXXX had been beaten up while still in Albania and that his house had been burned down, all at the hands of XXXX XXXX and armed men. Rather, XXXX XXXX statement goes into an explanation of recent historical events in Albania and mentions the difficulties faced by his family because of the land dispute, including the death of his son XXXX, allegedly at the hands of XXXX XXXX. The panel does not find it plausible that a man who was personally attacked, whose son was attacked along with him and whose home was burnt down by armed men, would fail to mention those things in a statement meant to support his son's refugee claim, if those events in fact happened. The panel finds that both of the principal claimant's parents fail to mention these same events in their statements. As a result, the panel finds that the principal claimant has embellished and fabricated events in both his shared BOC narrative and his testimony, such that the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the allegations of targeting by XXXX XXXX are not true.\n[26] The panel asked if the principal claimant had any evidence showing that his family home had been burnt down, such as photographs or insurance documents, to which the principal claimant testified that he did not have any photographs of the burnt house and that there was no insurance on the home. The panel finds in the absence of documentation and in consideration of the aforementioned credibility issues and the principal claimant's parents failing to mention the fire that the principal claimant's family home was not burned down by XXXX XXXX or his associates.\n[27] The claimants have also provided a jointly signed declaration letter (\"joint declaration letter\") from XXXX family members and neighbours, dated XXXX XXXX, 20166 which purports to corroborate the narrative advanced by the claimants. The principal claimant testified that these people were aware of his problems because he had told them about it while he was still in Albania and also that they had some knowledge on their own about \"the person he was dealing with\". The panel notes that it is indicated in the declaration letter that XXXX XXXX had an alias as \"Mr. XXXX XXXX\". This contradicts the principal claimant's account that XXXX XXXX was XXXX XXXX father. The principal claimant offered the explanation that people were changing their names during that period of time in Albania and that is why it might be different. Given that the principal claimant testified that the authors of the letter had their own knowledge of who he was dealing with, the panel does not give this explanation any weight in the absence of reliable corroborative evidence. The panel therefore takes a negative inference as to the credibility of the principal claimant's foundational story regarding how and who was involved in the alleged vendetta in the first place. The panel places no weight on the joint declaration letter, beyond the information that was within the declarants own knowledge, concerning the names of the people involved in the initial land transaction. The panel finds that due to the material and unresolved contradiction in the name of the alleged agent of persecution, the claimants have not credibly demonstrated on a balance of probabilities that they were targeted by any member of the XXXX family, from whom the land was purchased.\nFailure to Claim Refugee Status in Greece\n[28] The panel finds that the claimants did not attempt to claim refugee status in Greece when it would have been reasonable to do so. The principal claimant testified that he and his wife initially fled to Greece to escape XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX XXXX 2001. It is alleged that the principal claimant's brother XXXX, joined them at some point in XXXX 2001. The principal claimant testified that they did not seek refugee status Greece because they were there without status and were afraid that the police would send them back to Albania. The panel does not find that explanation to be acceptable in view of the fact that Greece is a democratic country and a signatory to the Convention on refugees. The panel finds that the claimants have not shown on a balance of probabilities that Greece would not have adjudicated the claimants' refugee claims on their merit.\n[29] Further, the claimants allege that as of early XXXX 2003, XXXX XXXX died from injuries sustained as a result of a beating at the hands of XXXX XXXX or his associates. The panel finds that if XXXX XXXX death was at the hands of XXXX XXXX or his associates, it would have been imminently reasonable at that point to seek out the protection of Greece by making refugee claims, but they did not do so. Further, the claimants did not look into the process of making refugee claims, preferring to believe that they would immediately be sent back to Albania because their status would be revealed or that their claims would fail. The panel does not find this explanation credible because the principal claimant nonetheless registered the minor claimants in different schools across Greece at different times, which suggests that they were not altogether avoiding being registered with the authorities. The panel finds that this would suggest that the claimants had some degree of comfort in approaching official bodies\/Greek bureaucracy. Therefore, the panel does not find it reasonable that a fear of authorities would have prevented the claimants from seeking protection in Greece immediately after XXXX death (if not before). The panel finds that the failure to have made refugee protection claims in Greece, for which a reasonable explanation was not provided, is further indicative that the claimants' account of having been targeted by XXXX XXXX is not credible on a balance of probabilities.\nXXXX XXXX death\n[30] While the panel finds that the principal claimant's brother did die on or about XXXX XXXX, 2003 pursuant to the Albanian death certificate found at Exhibit 10 (the claimants' narrative indicates XXXX XXXX, 2003 as does the photograph of XXXX XXXX headstone at Exhibit 12), the claimants have not established on a balance of probabilities that his death was at the hands of XXXX XXXX or his associates. To support their testimony, the claimants have provided a statement from XXXX XXXX7 which indicates that he had met XXXX XXXX at XXXX on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX prior to going to a club to celebrate XXXX birthday, when two \"people\" exited a vehicle with an XXXX license plate and approached them, demanding to speak to XXXX for 10 minutes. XXXX allegedly left with these people and did not return that evening. Mr. XXXX later learned that XXXX had been found severely injured on a building site. Both of the principal claimant's parents note in their statements that the official explanation appears to have been a workplace accident, but they strongly believe that XXXX XXXX or his associates are behind the death. The panel gives the statements of XXXX XXXX and the principal claimants' parents' no weight insofar as corroborating the basis of the claims. In this regard, the panel also notes that the Albanian death certificate in respect of XXXX XXXX XXXX leaves the headings \"Place of Death\" and \"Cause of Death\" XXXX. Given that the death certificate does not indicate place of death as Greece, the panel finds that the claimants have not provided credible and trustworthy evidence to support their allegation on a balance of probabilities that XXXX died in Greece and that he was targeted in that country by XXXX XXXX or his associates. The panel finds that with no other reliable evidence to substantiate a connection to XXXX XXXX, beyond an Albanian license plate, the link is speculative at best. As such, the panel finds that while it is satisfied that XXXX XXXX did in fact die, it does not find that he died at the hands of XXXX XXXX or his associates.\nAttempted kidnapping of XXXX XXXX\n[31] The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that XXXX XXXX or his associates did not attempt to abduct XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2013 from a XXXX in Greece as the claimants have not provided credible and trustworthy evidence to support their allegation that XXXX was targeted in that country by XXXX XXXX or his associates. The claimants have presented a letter from XXXX XXXX, a friend who allegedly witnessed the event who recalled that a man who looked about 30 years old exited a vehicle with XXXX license plates and attempted to abduct XXXX XXXX. The principal claimant confirmed to the panel that he had no other evidence to confirm that XXXX XXXX or his associates were behind the abduction. The panel notes that the claimants' BOC indicates that a knife was used during the attempted kidnapping, yet Mr. XXXX statement makes no mention of a knife. The principal claimant explained the discrepancy by suggesting that Mr. XXXX probably did not see everything that was happening because of so many parents being around. The panel does not accept this explanation and finds that if Mr. XXXX was allegedly close enough to estimate the age of the alleged kidnapper; identify XXXX license plates; and describe XXXX being grabbed by the wrist; he would also have been close enough to see whether a knife had been used. The panel finds that it would have been reasonable for such an important detail to be included in Mr. XXXX statement if the event occurred and the panel therefore finds that the credibility of the account of Mr. XXXX and the principal claimant are further compromised. As such, the panel gives Mr. XXXX statement of no weight insofar as corroborating the alleged abduction attempt and finds that the claimants' account of the abduction attempt was fictitious and advanced only to support the claimants' claims.\n[32] Additionally, the panel finds that no trustworthy or reliable evidence has been presented to show on a balance of probabilities that XXXX XXXX or his associates were aware of what XXXX XXXX looked like (as he had been born in Greece and had never been to Albania) or that his location in Greece was somehow known to XXXX XXXX. The principal claimant had no explanation for how XXXX XXXX was able to allegedly overcome the issue of being able to identify and find XXXX XXXX XXXX Further, the panel finds that the gap of more than 12 years since the alleged original precipitating land disagreement and then the 10 year gap from XXXX death, allegedly at the hands of XXXX XXXX, weighs, on a balance of probabilities, against XXXX XXXX and his associates being behind this alleged 2013 abduction attempt. The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that XXXX XXXX and his associates did not seek out the claimants in Greece.\nOngoing Threat\n[33] Given the panel's findings that neither of the incidents that occurred in Greece were related to the actions of XXXX XXXX or his associates, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no ongoing vendetta by XXXX XXXX and the claims made by the claimants are not credible.\n[34] However, in support of the ongoing nature of the threat to their life, the claimants also provided an undated, unsworn declaration from XXXX XXXX the principal claimant's mother (her second support letter), which recounted an alleged attack on XXXX XXXX, 2016, at the hands of unknown persons who were looking for the claimants. XXXX XXXX stated that she came to realize that they were sent by XXXX XXXX (without them ever identifying themselves as such) when they started asking after the principal claimant and they threatened her and threatened to kill the principal claimant if they found him. XXXX XXXX states that these men then pushed her so that she fell and suffered a chest and pelvis injury. In support of the injury, XXXX XXXX attached two prescriptions for medication to deal with her pain. The panel does not give the declaration or prescriptions any weight as the prescriptions are not supported by a medical letter or police report regarding the alleged assault. The panel also does not find it credible that this incident would have been the first time since the alleged XXXX 2001 incident (where their house was allegedly burnt down by armed men) that XXXX XXXX or his associates would have approached and attacked the principal claimant's parents if XXXX XXXX had been actively searching for the claimants over the previous 15 years. The panel therefore finds that XXXX XXXX account of the attack is not credible and that on a balance of probabilities, the attack was fictitious and advanced only to support her son's claim that there is an ongoing threat against him and his family in Albania.\n[35] Further, the panel is also critical of the prescriptions themselves in that the prescriptions were allegedly written on XXXX XXXX, 2016, but were available to be sent by fax on XXXX XXXX, 2016, for use during the claimants hearing. Furthermore, the prescriptions appear to have not been filled by XXXX XXXX XXXX despite alleged significant injuries from an assault, as the pharmacy would have otherwise kept the prescriptions to prevent their re-use. The panel therefore finds that XXXX XXXX did not suffer the injuries she alleges, otherwise the prescriptions would have been filled to treat her allegedly traumatic injuries and no longer in her possession. In any event, the panel finds that even if the prescriptions are genuine, they do not establish on a balance of probabilities that XXXX XXXX alleged injuries or ongoing pain was a result of the actions of XXXX XXXX or his associates given the panel's finding that on a balance of probabilities the attack did not occur.\nCONCLUSION\n[36] Based on the totality of the evidence, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that there is insufficient credible or persuasive evidence that there was ever a vendetta against the claimants and that there is therefore no credible ongoing threat to the claimants' lives.\n[37] The panel's credibility assessment is determinative of the claim under sections 96 and 97(1) of the IRPA. As such, the claimants do not face a serious possibility of persecution nor, on a balance of probabilities, a danger of torture, or risk to their life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Albania.\n[38] The panel concludes that the claimants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. Accordingly, their claims are rejected.\n[39] In rejecting the claims, the panel determines that there is no credible or trustworthy evidence on which the panel could have made a favourable decision. For the reasons stated, the panel accepts on a balance of probabilities that the claimants did purchase the land from the XXXX family and the principal claimant's brother is deceased. However, such evidence does not support recognition of the claims pursuant to section 96 or section 97(1) of the IRPA. Due to the material credibility concerns that the panel has discussed, which include also the lack of reliable corroborating documents and the failure to have made refugee protection claims in Greece, the claimants' account of targeting and harm arising as a result of the land purchase is not credible or trustworthy on a balance of probabilities. In accordance with section 107(2) of IRPA the Panel determines that there is no credible basis for these claims.\n(signed)\n\"D. Marcovitch\"\nD.

The claimant alleges that she is an Almighty God practitioner and a member of this banned, religious sect in China. She alleges that she learned that a co-practitioner was arrested, and she then went into hiding. She thereafter obtained a Canadian visitor's visa and flew to Canada where she made a refugee claim.\n[4] Although the claimant alleges at paragraph 2 of her Basis of Claim Form (\"BOC\") narrative that her step-father was a violent man, and that he abused her and her mother,1 she also testified that she did not fear her step-father should she return to China. The panel therefore did not consider this allegation any further.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] The panel finds that the claimant has not established that there is a reasonable possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, or that, on a balance of probabilities, she would personally be subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if she were to return to China.\nCREDIBILITY\n[6] The panel is mindful of the challenges faced by a claimant when establishing her claim including cultural factors, nervousness, and the unfamiliar environment of the hearing room. It also considered the age, education and background of the claimant when assessing her credibility. At the time of the hearing, the claimant was 24 years old. She said that she has 12 years of education which included XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. She said that she worked as a XXXX, and a XXXX XXXX in an electronic factory in China. The panel finds that the presumption of truthfulness was rebutted for the following reasons:\nOmission: The claimant resides with Almighty God practitioners in China\n[7] The claimant states at paragraph 9 of her BOC narrative that she learned in XXXX 2013 that her grandmother was injured. She quit her job in Shanghai so she could go look after her grandmother. She states at paragraph 9 of her BOC narrative that she said goodbye to her Almighty God church colleagues and they told her that they would \"send a message to the church in my hometown and the brothers and sisters would contact me.\" She said that after those two months in 2013, she got in touch with the church on XXXX XXXX, 2013.\n[8] She said from XXXX XXXX, 2015, she was living with her Almighty God brothers and sisters. The panel noted for the claimant that she did not mention in her BOC that after going to live at her grandmother's house, she went to live with Almighty God practitioners. The claimant insisted that she did mention it in her story. She then said a few moments later: \"Even though I didn't write it, that's how it happened and that's a fact, and it is true that after two months I was able to get in touch with brothers and sisters from the church and was able to continue my normal church life.\"\n[9] The panel finds that the claimant's allegation that she lived with other Almighty God practitioners only a few months before she arrived in Canada is a material allegation. It concerns the extent of her involvement with the banned church and was a recent experience. This allegation is not found in her BOC. The omission is particularly noteworthy given that the claimant mentions comparatively minor information in her BOC about her alleged relationship with other local church members at paragraph 10 of her BOC narrative.\n[10] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, and in the absence of a reasonable explanation for the omission of this material evidence in her BOC, that the claimant fabricated her allegation that she lived with Almighty God practitioners in China shortly before arriving in Canada. This finding undermines her credibility.\nArrest of co-practitioner\n[11] The claimant alleges in her BOC that a co-practitioner named XXXX was arrested. She said that she learned about this from the XXXX of the church, sister XXXX. She was asked how sister XXXX knew XXXX was arrested. She said: \"That I don't know.\"\n[12] The claimant alleges at paragraph 12 of her BOC narrative that sister XXXX rushed back to the group to tell the claimant and another practitioner that XXXX was arrested. The claimant thereafter allegedly went into hiding and then left the country. When examined by counsel, the claimant said that she believed Ms. XXXX when she told her that XXXX was arrested because Ms. XXXX is a righteous, kind and honest person. The panel finds that this character assessment does not provide a credible foundation for Ms. XXXX knowledge or belief that a co-practitioner was arrested.\n[13] The panel finds it has insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to find a co-practitioner had been arrested for these reasons. It finds that her related allegations that she was smuggled out of China following XXXX arrest depends upon her allegation that XXXX was arrested. As noted the panel finds that it has insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence that XXXX was arrested. It accordingly assigns little weight to her allegation that this incident caused her to hire an agent who smuggled her out of China.\nInternet: Discrepancy, evasiveness, plausibility\n[14] The claimant states at paragraph 11 of her BOC narrative that she and other members of her church in China \"cooperated to write the scripture. Our scripture would be made into movies which would be put on [the] Internet\". She was asked if this happened in China. She said no. She was asked where it happened. She said that she did not know. She said, at the time, she was only charged with turning the experiences of her brothers and sisters into a script. She said that she did not know where this was filmed by the church.\n[15] The panel noted for the claimant that she stated in her BOC narrative at paragraph 11, that \"the movies were put on the Internet one by one\". It also noted for her that she had not left China at this point. She was asked, given her BOC evidence, why she said that these allegations involving the movies and the internet did not happen in China. She replied by saying: \"What was put on the internet was filmed by our church, and it wasn't us who filmed it. I was only charged with transforming these experiences in the script, but beyond that I don't know.\"\n[16] She added: \"It wouldn't be in China because we were persecuted. That I could be sure, but where it was, I didn't know.\" She was asked if she saw these movies in China on the internet. She said no, but guidance people in the church showed it to them in their USB port. She said they would use devices which were not connected to the internet, such as a tablet, and watch it on that. She said that is what she meant earlier when she said that the movies were shown one by one.\n[17] She was asked if that is what she meant, why she did not mention in her BOC that the movies were shown in the manner which she described. She said, those are details, she did not think of it at the time, and she did not write it down. She was asked if she did not mean that movies were shown on the internet in China, why her BOC indicated otherwise. She said: \"The facts are how I described it just now, and if I didn't write it clearly before and it led to your misunderstanding, I apologize. What I meant to describe is what I stated just now.\"\n[18] She was asked if she meant to say what she stated just now, why she did not say this in the BOC, and why she had provided different information in her BOC. She said that maybe her expression was problematic, but what she meant to describe is what she described just now.\nANALYSIS\n[19] The claimant alleges in her BOC narrative at paragraph 11 that members of her illegal church in China would make movies about their scripture which would be put on the internet. The BOC identifies the participants in this project as including Ms. XXXX, whom the claimant identifies as the \"XXXX\" who introduced her to a local Almighty God church. The panel finds on the basis of this information that the claimant's allegations about movies and the internet occurred when she was still in China. The claimant states in her BOC narrative at paragraph 11 that \"movies were put on the Internet one by one\".\n[20] The panel finds her subsequent denial of the evidence which she provided in her BOC, namely that \"movies were put on the Internet one by one\" is contrary to her initial evidence. It finds her testimony that she did not know where the movie and internet activity happened, given the involvement of Ms. XXXX who was allegedly a XXXX of her local church which is located in China, was evasive and disingenuous.\n[21] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, and on the basis of the claimant's subsequent testimony that the internet activity \"wouldn't be in China because we were persecuted\", there was an attempt to distance herself from her own BOC evidence when she realized that her implausible allegation about uploading movies onto the internet in China was insupportable. It finds that her credibility is undermined as a result of the inconsistency between her BOC evidence and testimony with respect to the movies and the internet. It also finds that her credibility was undermined as a result of her evasive efforts to distance herself from her own evidence which she subsequently understood to be spurious and indefensible.\nGolden Shield\n[22] The country reports do not support the claimant's BOC allegation that Almighty God members, who belong to a banned group, were able to upload their movies onto the internet in China.\n[23] China's Golden Shield program has been described as:\n'a vast network of surveillance infrastructure... which monitors Chinese citizens online and offline'. A Chinese economist, author and political commentator writing in Hong Kong's Chinese-language Open Magazine, calls the Golden Shield an [translation] 'enormous telecommunication control and monitoring system' [citations omitted] 2\n[24] The economist states that the Golden Shield's firewall was developed to \"sniff out, examine, and finally delete information censored by the regime.\"3\n[25] The Laogai Research Foundation, a Washington, D.C. based organization that researches and raises awareness of human rights violations in China, including internet surveillance and censorship, states that the Golden Shield Project is \"more than a mere firewall\", rather it is \"a sophisticated surveillance system that enables the government to censor specific search requests, monitor the activities of internet users, and track dissidents offline\". Further, \"[t]he Sydney Morning Herald explains that the system is used by the authorities to 'eliminate references to politically sensitive topics' online\".4\nImplausibility Analysis\n[26] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, and on the basis of the documentary evidence, that it would not have been possible for the Almighty God sect, which is considered to be a banned and evil cult in China, to have uploaded movies about their scripture onto the internet in China.\n[27] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, and on the basis of the claimant's inconsistent evidence, and in the absence of a reasonable explanation for her changed evidence, that the claimant simply decided to change her evidence by repudiating what she had initially written in her BOC with respect to the internet and movies. The panel finds that this repudiation, absent a reasonable explanation, indicates, on a balance of probabilities, that she also fabricated her initial BOC evidence about the movies and internet.\n[28] It finds her subsequent evidence that what she in fact meant was that Almighty God members used a USB port to view the movies is not credible given that she failed to mention this allegation in her BOC, and provided inconsistent information about the internet in her BOC.\n[29] It rejects her explanation that the USB allegations were mere details that did not need to be included in the BOC as they contradicted her BOC allegations about the same issue. The panel finds that a plain reading of her BOC evidence about movies being uploaded onto the internet suggests that this information was initially intended to emphasize the risks her local church faced in China. It finds that her subsequent attempt to downgrade her BOC internet allegations to the use of a USB port is another example of her fabrication of evidence.\nDeception\n[30] The panel finds that this all of her fabrication: her initial BOC evidence about the internet, and her subsequent evidence about the USB ports was calculated to deceive the panel. It finds that her repeated fabrication with respect to the alleged practice of her faith in China seriously undermines her allegation that she was an Almighty God practitioner in China. It finds that her repeated fabrication about aspects of her Almighty God practices in China undermine the likelihood, on a balance of probabilities, that her related evidence with respect to being an Almighty God practitioner are credible. The panel finds that her willingness to lie about her alleged Almighty God activities and practices in China seriously undermine her allegation that she was an Almighty God practitioner in China.\n[31] The claimant again attempted to deceive and manipulate the panel when she said that the information in the BOC may have led to the panel's misunderstanding, but what she really meant was that a USB port had been used to view the movies.\n[32] The flaw with this explanation is that her BOC indicates that \"the movies were put on the Internet one by one\"5 and no mention is made in the BOC of her alternative USB explanation. When asked to explain this further discrepancy, the claimant merely insisted that perhaps her expression had been problematic, but that her evidence about the USB, which the panel finds was inconsistent with her BOC evidence, was in fact her true evidence. The panel finds that her attempt to distance herself from her BOC evidence, and her suggestion that the panel had misunderstood her evidence, as she attempted to repudiate it and to neutralize the harm her own BOC evidence had caused, was very deceptive and manipulative. These findings undermine the claimant's credibility and the bona fides of her claim.\nLetter from Toronto XXXX\n[33] The claimant submitted a letter purportedly written by a member of an Almighty God house church in Toronto.6 The writer, XXXX XXXX, identifies herself as \"a XXXX of the Church of Almighty God in Canada.\" She states: \"I write this letter to certify\" that the claimant is a member of the Almighty God church.\nNo address\n[34] The letter contains a square logo found at the top, right hand corner of the letter which contains the words \"The Church of Almighty God.\" Below this logo is a website address: \"http:\/\/www.holyspiritspeaks.org\" and two phone numbers. The panel noted for the claimant that the letter did not provide an address for the house church in Toronto. She was asked why there was no address on the letter. She said: \"We are a home church, we don't have a fixed address.\"\n[35] The panel rejects this explanation. It notes that the letter did not provide any address at all including a revolving one. It finds that the absence of an address or location for the alleged house church in Toronto undermines its trustworthiness. Although the letter's phone numbers and website address add some degree of reliability to the letter, the absence of an address where Ms. XXXX, the alleged XXXX, or the house church is located in Toronto, and where Ms. XXXX, as per her letter, purportedly made first-hand observations about the claimant, undermines its genuineness. As well the panel notes that the letter is not sworn, and that no identification was provided for Ms. XXXX. Nor did Ms. XXXX attend the hearing to provide evidence about the house church in Toronto or her XXXX role. The panel assigns little weight to the letter for these reasons.\nLack of familiarity with Almighty God house churches in Toronto\n[36] The claimant was asked about XXXX XXXX who purportedly wrote the letter. The claimant testified earlier that there were seven members in total in her Toronto house church including herself. She was asked whether Ms. XXXX was one of XXXX XXXX XXXX. She said no. She was asked whether Ms. XXXX belongs to another house church or group in Toronto. She replied by saying that Ms. XXXX attends every group. She was asked how many Almighty God groups there are in Toronto. She said she did not know. She was asked why she would not know this, particularly given that the community is so small. She said: \"Yes, the community is small, but there are people joining. It is something I didn't ask the XXXX.\"\n[37] The panel finds the claimant's lack of familiarity with Ms. XXXX, with respect to what house church she belonged to, or more generally how many house churches exist in Toronto, undermines the likelihood, on a balance of probabilities, that she is a genuine Almighty God practitioner in Toronto. It finds her assertion that Ms. XXXX attended every group lacks credibility given that she also said that she did not know how many Almighty God house churches exist in Toronto. The panel finds that her lack of familiarity with respect to house churches in Toronto undermines her ability to assert that Ms. XXXX visited them all.\n[38] The panel finds it is reasonable to expect that the claimant would have some knowledge about how many house churches there were in Toronto given the small size of this religious community in China and Canada. These findings undermine the claimant's credibility and the likelihood that she was a genuine Almighty God practitioner in Canada.\nHot line number: BOC omission\n[39] Ms. XXXX letter further states that \"XXXX XXXX XXXX, 2016, We got her [the claimant's] first call through the hotline of the Church of Almighty God. We met with her on XXXX XXXX, 2016.\"7 The claimant arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2016, and confirmed that she called the hotline number on the same day she arrived. She was asked how she was able to make contact with the Toronto house church immediately upon her arrival.\n[40] She said: \"In China, we were shown videos by the XXXX, and at the end of the videos, there were contact numbers for each country. So, I found the hotline number from the end of that video.\" She was asked why she did not mention this information in her BOC. She said it was a detail that she didn't think of, and didn't write it then.\n[41] The panel rejects this explanation. It finds that her ability to immediately contact an Almighty God house church in Toronto through a purported hotline number on the same day she arrived in Canada requires some explanation. The panel finds it reasonable to expect that if she had seen this information about Canada when viewing a video in China, that she would mention this material information in her BOC given that it permitted her to make contact with her alleged house church in Canada.\n[42] It finds this important link between information she saw in China which brought her to the house church in Toronto is more than a mere detail. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, given the materiality of the omission, and in the absence of a reasonable explanation for it, that the claimant fabricated her evidence that she had seen the Canadian hotline number in a church video in China. This finding undermines her credibility. It also undermines the genuineness of Ms. XXXX letter and provides credible evidence that this letter, and its contents, are fraudulent.\n[43] The panel finds that this fabrication is simply one of many involving her alleged faith as an Almighty God practitioner. It finds her willingness to repeatedly lie about her alleged religion seriously undermines the likelihood, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant was a genuine Almighty God practitioner in China or in Canada.\nDelay in Claiming\n[44] The claimant left China on XXXX XXXX, 2016, and signed her BOC on XXXX XXXX, 2016. She was asked why she delayed in making her claim. She said that she did not delay in making her claim. She added that she needed to prepare all of the materials, and that took some time.\n[45] The panel noted for the claimant that she said she contacted the hotline number on the same day she arrived in Canada. She was asked why she had not made her claim earlier given her immediate contact with the alleged Toronto house church through the hotline number. She said that she really was using all the time to write her story and prepare her evidence and documents. She said she was preparing, and did not delay.\n[46] It notes that the claimant, according to her evidence, allegedly made contact with an Almighty God house church on the same day that she arrived in Canada. During her examination, counsel asked the claimant when she started working on her refugee claim. She said I really do not remember. Her counsel asked her how she knew that she had to write a story. She said: \"When I got here, I was told by the brothers and sisters that if you want status here, you have to apply for refugee status.\"\n[47] Counsel asked the claimant whether someone from the broader church told her this or someone from her own group XXXX XXXX. She replied other sisters, and clarified they were not in the group. She said these sisters helped her to find a lawyer probably at the beginning of May, and that she started filling out forms before she went to see the lawyer.\n[48] The panel acknowledges that the claimant testified, when asked by her counsel, that she lived in fear when practicing her alleged religion in China, and that she was also fearful when she entered Canada. However, it rejects the suggestion that the claimant's delay in claiming was due to fear, which is undermined by the immediate support and immediate advice she received from her \"brothers and sisters\" that she had to make a refugee claim to obtain status in Canada. The panel rejects her explanation that she only learned about the need to obtain counsel later on for the same reasons.\n[49] The panel finds that the claimant failed to provide a reasonable explanation for her delay in claiming. It finds that this delay undermines her subjective fear under s. 96 of IRPA and her credibility under s. 97.\nPhotos\n[50] The claimant submitted several photos in support of her claim8 which were allegedly taken in Toronto. The photos depict young women seated around a table looking at books and each other. One photo shows the young women seated at the table, bending their heads. She was asked what she wanted the panel to understand from these photos. She said this is the life of their church, and that after coming to Canada, she continued to gather with her brothers and sisters. The panel noted for the claimant that there were no men in the photo. She said that was correct.\n[51] The panel finds that the photos do not evince more than what they pictorially depict, namely young women looking at books and each other, seated at a table with their heads bent. It finds it is unable to conclude on the basis of the photos themselves or the claimant's description of the meaning she says they represent, that the claimant is a genuine Almighty God practitioner.\nXXXX\n[52] The claimant was asked to tell the panel about all of her Almighty God activities in Canada. She said gathering with sisters, performing as a group XXXX, nothing else. She was asked what she did as a group XXXX. She said just gather my brothers and sisters and consume the Words of God. The panel notes that the Words refer to an Almighty God religious tome. She confirmed that there were no brothers in her particular house church in Toronto. She was asked what made her a XXXX.\n[53] She said because it just happened that the church needed a person to hold that position, and the XXXX of the church saw that she had a fast understanding of the church's teaching, and she understood it purely, and she had love for her brothers and sisters.\n[54] She was asked about her activities as XXXX. She said that she just tried to observe whether her sisters had any concerns and she would try to find Words of God to communicate with them. She said through the format of gathering, she tried to resolve the brothers' and sisters' concerns. She confirmed that there were no brothers in her group.\n[55] The panel asked the claimant whether the young women in the photo, seated at the table, had made refugee claims. She said no, and that they were not in the process of applying for refugee status. She then said that she did not know whether they had applied for refugee status.\n[56] She was asked how she could say she did not know about this given the small size of the group, and her earlier testimony that she was the XXXX, and her responsibilities included responding to their problems. She said that she was the XXXX of this group, but what she was responsible for was the problems they had in their lives, the aspect of their life that would lead them to God.\n[57] She was asked whether being an illegal Almighty God practitioner in China, banned as an evil cult, was a problem they had in their lives. She said that she was only communicating with them regarding their concerns and problems with God's Words, and they gathered for the purpose of glorifying God, and those were the issues that concerned her. She said how they arrived in Canada does not have anything to do with their beliefs, so she did not ask them.\n[58] The claimant testified that there were only seven members, including herself in the house church in Toronto. The panel finds, in these circumstances, that ignoring how the women in her small group had come to Canada, in her alleged role of XXXX, and what their needs in this country might therefore be, is disingenuous.\n[59] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant as an alleged member and XXXX of a small Toronto house church with only XXXX XXXX, who studied together, would likely know whether the others had claimed refugee status, particularly given that the claimant alleged that, as XXXX of this group, she was responsible for addressing their concerns.\n[60] It finds it reasonable to expect, on a balance of probabilities, that if refugee status and an alleged persecutory past on the basis of religion concerned any of her alleged Toronto co-practitioners that the claimant, as alleged XXXX, would be aware of these concerns. It rejects her explanation that her concerns as XXXX involved application of the Words, a religious tome, given that refugee status in Canada on the basis of religion is also a religious issue, and would concern the serious issue of whether they could remain in Canada.\n[61] It acknowledges that the claimant had some sundry information about her alleged co-practitioners, and that she indicated that her duties as XXXX were spiritual in nature. However, the panel finds that the claimant's alleged lack of knowledge with respect to the critical issue of whether her alleged co-practitioners could remain in Canada on the basis of their faith and personal histories of possible persecution undermines her allegation that she served as their XXXX.\nFaith and knowledge\n[62] The panel acknowledges that the claimant had some familiarity with the Words, a religious tome associated with the Almighty God faith. However, it finds it reasonable to expect that she would have some knowledge about the Almighty God faith given that she said she read the Words.\n[63] It finds that mere familiarity with the Words or similar publications is insufficient to support a finding that the claimant is a genuine Almighty God practitioner given that anyone can read the Words and report on what they have read without being a genuine Almighty God practitioner.\n[64] The panel rejects counsel's submission that the claimant \"testified sincerely and deeply about her faith.\" Rather, it found the claimant was generally not credible including the issue of her faith. It finds that her persistent mendacity, evasiveness and her repeated efforts to mislead the panel, in one instance, directly referring to the panel's confusion to obfuscate her own mendacity provides a reliable indicator with respect to the overall fraudulent nature of this claim.\n[65] The panel finds that the claimant did not provide credible and trustworthy evidence with respect to her alleged faith particularly when counter-balanced with her general lack of credibility, particularly where it pertained to matters involving her alleged religious practice. It assigns little weight to the song she insisted on singing at the end of the hearing which she said gave testimony to God given that she had obviously planned to sing the song, and the gesture was rehearsed and lacking in genuineness.\n[66] The panel rejects counsel's submission that the documentary evidence confirms the plausibility of the claim. The claimant has a burden to establish a link between the general documentary evidence and her own specific circumstances.9 The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, and for the reasons given, that the claimant failed to credibly establish a link between her alleged personal circumstances and the documentary evidence.\n[67] It also finds that if the claimant had symptoms of any psychological distress similar to post-traumatic stress disorder, that these symptoms are unrelated to, and do not have their genesis in persecution, nor did they impede her ability to provide evidence at the hearing.\nCONCLUSION\n[68] The panel considered all three protection grounds under sections 96 and 97(1) of IRPA and considered the totality of the evidence cumulatively. It finds that the claimant was generally not credible. It finds her evidence was undermined by fabrication, evasiveness, inconsistency, BOC omissions and an attempt to mislead and deceive the panel. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, and for the reasons given, that the claimant was not an Almighty God practitioner in China and is not a genuine Almighty God practitioner in Canada.\n[69] The panel finds that her allegations that she is an Almighty God practitioner are false and that they were contrived to advance a fraudulent refugee claim. The panel therefore finds that the claim is manifestly unfounded pursuant to section 107.1 of the IRPA, and rejects her claim.\n(signed)\n\"N. Cassano\"\nN.

He is an unaccompanied minor and claims refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\n[2] XXXX XXXX was appointed as the claimant's Designated Representative by the Refugee Protection Division.\n[3] In assessing this claim, the panel is cognizant that the claimant is an unaccompanied minor and acknowledges that such cases raise unique concerns and may warrant special attention in the determination of his claim. In this regard, the panel has carefully considered the Chairperson's guidelines with respect to child refugee claimants.2 A request to have the claimant designated as a vulnerable person was denied; however accommodations to allow reverse order questioning was allowed.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The details of the allegations are articulated in the claimant's Basis of Claim Form (\"BOC\")3. In summary, the claimant fears returning to El Salvador because of the Mara 18 gang, also known as the Barrio-18 gang.\n[5] The claimant has provided a detailed account of the problems he faced in El Salvador. He was teased and picked on at school. He also described problems he had at school with XXXX XXXX, who is allegedly the son of a Mara 18 gang member. The claimant alleged that XXXX and his friends bullied him and the bullying became worse in the last two years. XXXX made a veiled threat about finding people in black plastic bags after a dispute at a school tournament. The claimant's father confronted XXXX after he refused to allow the claimant to play in the tournament.\n[6] The claimant also alleged that on his way to visit his grandmother, he was called over by four men who questioned why he was in the area. The claimant alleged they were gang members who asked for personal details about his name and where he lived. He alleged that they made him take of his shirt and looked for tattoos. The men said nothing more to him. He then left the area and proceeded to his grandmother's home. He was very afraid and after was not permitted to go anywhere on his own. In the days that followed, the claimant alleged that he would see the gang members on the street corner in front of his home. He also alleged that they were seen at the visitation of his great-grandmother after she passed away. Relatives of the claimant were allegedly followed to their home by these gang members.\n[7] The claimant fears that he will be recruited by gang members and if he does not join, they will kill him.\n[8] The claimant also alleged that his father, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, had been threatened by a politician. This politician eventually went to prison. The claimant fears that once this politician is released, he might try to harm them.\nDETERMINATION\n[9] The panel finds that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection for the reasons that follow.\nANALYSIS\n[10] The determinative issues in this claim are nexus and generalized risk.\nIdentity\n[11] The claimant's identity is established by way of a certified copy of his El Salvadorian passport on file.4\nCredibility\n[12] The panel found that the claimant was a credible witness. He answered in a straightforward and forthright manner. He did not embellish his testimony and there were no significant inconsistencies, omissions, or contradictions. The panel did not find that the claimant was being evasive or attempting to mislead the panel.\n[13] The panel also acknowledges that in some areas of the claim, the claimant might not know the specific details given that it necessitated knowledge of the motivation of his father. Although the panel raised issues of his failure to claim in the United States of America, his reavailment to El Salvador and a delay in leaving El Salvador, the panel did not take a negative inference given his age and that he was simply following his father's instructions and advice.\nNexus\n[14] The panel finds that the claimant does not have a nexus to the Refugee Convention and that the risk alleged is one that is generalized.\n[15] In order to effectively advance a claim for protection as a Convention refugee, there must be a connection between the claimant's fear and at least one of the five enumerated grounds of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. Having heard the allegations of risk if returned to El Salvador, the panel finds that the risk feared by the claimant relates to criminal activity and not to persecution.\n[16] The claimant fears that he will be harmed by the gangs that are prevalent in El Salvador. He fears that he will be recruited by gangs and if he refuses, he will be harmed or killed. While the panel acknowledges that he was bullied by Jonathan whose father is allegedly a gang member, there was insufficient evidence, on a balance of probabilities, that it was more than mere bullying that is common in schools and with school-aged children. Furthermore, there is nothing to suggest that the bullying was linked to any of the grounds set out it the Refugee Convention.\n[17] The panel further acknowledges that the claimant alleged that his family had been threatened by a politician who had past dealings with his father. The claimant fears reprisals from the politician. The panel finds that the claimant has not provided sufficient evidence regarding any risk faced in this regard. There is no information as to when this person is to be realised from prison, other than that he had been sentenced to prison for nine years. Moreover, no evidence was provided regarding what had transpired between the claimant's father and the politician. There is insufficient evidence to establish a link to the Refugee Convention based on any reprisals the claimant may face at the hands of the politician. Furthermore, any risk of harm at this time is speculative. No evidence was provided that this person, who was not named, has uttered threats against the claimant.\n[18] The claimant alleged that he was walking to his grandmother's home when he was called over by men he believed were gang members. There was no evidence before the panel that the claimant was called over for any particular reason other than territorial. Gangs are reported to be extremely territorial and exercise extraordinary control over their territories.5 The gang members are required to \"look, listen, and keep quiet.\"6 They face many gang-imposed restrictions, for example, \"on who they can talk with and about, what time they must be inside their homes, where they can walk or go to school, who they can visit and who can visit them, what they can wear, and even ... the colour of their hair.\"7 The claimant testified that if someone comes from another area, they check to see who you are and if you are a member of another gang. In the case at hand, the gang members were determining whether the claimant, who was a stranger in the area, belonged to a rival gang.\n[19] The Federal Court has determined that victims of crime,8 corruption,9 or vendettas10 generally fail to establish a link between their fear of persecution and one of the Convention grounds. In the case at hand, the panel finds that the claimant has not established such a link. Consequently, the claim fails under section 96 of the IRPA.\n[20] The claim was analyzed pursuant to section 97(1) of the IRPA because the fear alleged by the claimant was not linked to any of the Convention grounds.\nGeneralized Risk\n[21] In an analysis under section 97 of the IRPA, claimants must demonstrate a personalized risk of torture or a personalized risk to their lives or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. A generalized risk need not be experienced by every citizen in the country11 and does not have to affect everyone in the same way.12\n[22] In the case of the claimant, he has had problems with schoolmates, one of whom has a father who was thought to be a gang member. The claimant also had an encounter with individuals he believed to be members of a gang. They asked him some questions and ordered him to remove his shirt to see if he had any tattoos; he was eventually allowed to leave. They said nothing more to him. The claimant testified that he is not part of a gang, has never been part of a gang and has not been recruited to join a gang. However, he fears that he could be recruited. He also fears that he will be killed.\n[23] The documentary evidence indicates that El Salvador is the country with the highest homicide rate in the world. In 2015, there were 6,640 homicides, this can be broken down to 103 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants.13 Furthermore, \"[t]he vast majority of homicide victims are reported to be male and between the ages of 15 and 34.\"14 In 2012, El Salvador reportedly had \"the highest rate of homicide victims among children and adolescents aged 0 to 19 years per 100,000 population of any country in the world\".15\n[24] Despite its size, \"El Salvador is the nation reported to be the most affected by the violence of street gangs.\"16 It also has the highest concentration of gang members of any country in Central America, \"hundreds of local street gangs are reported to operate in both urban and rural zones, with between 30,000 and 60,000 active members in total.\"17 The gangs are responsible for an increase in violence over the past two years.18 It is reported that from January to mid-November 2015, 65 percent of the murders registered in the country were committed by gang members.19\n[25] Gangs in El Salvador engage in illegal activities such as, but not limited to, drug trafficking, assassination for hire, extortion, and kidnapping. They recruit children in schools and within their communities \"to perform illicit activities related to the arms and drug trades, including homicide.\"20 It is also reported that few areas, if any, are immune from violent crime.21\n[26] The panel, having carefully considered the documentary evidence, finds that the claimant faces a risk that is generally faced by all people in El Salvador. The general conditions in El Salvador suggest that all people in El Salvador face some type of risk. While the claimant alleged that the men who called him over know his name and where he lives, the panel finds that this does not mean that his risk is now personalized. The issue of recruitment is one faced generally and is part of the modus operandi of the Mara 18 and other gangs that operate in El Salvador. A generalized risk does not have to affect everyone the same way.\n[27] In Proph\u00e8te, it was held that because the risk of all forms of criminality is general and is felt by all Haitians, the claimant did not face a personal risk that is not faced generally by others in his country. The Court stated, \"[w]hile a specific number of individuals may be targeted more frequently because of their wealth, all Haitians are at risk of becoming the victims of violence.\"22\nCONCLUSION\n[28] In light of the foregoing, the panel finds that the risk of harm alleged by the claimant is generalized and is one faced generally by others in El Salvador. The panel finds that the claimant has not satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground or that he would personally be subjected to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture if returned to El Salvador.\n[29] The panel finds that the claimant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\n[30] Therefore, the panel rejects this claim.\n(signed)\n\"N.

The respondent alleged that in XXXX 2005 he was detained by police for XXXX weeks and seriously mistreated during his detention. The case was heard by the Refugee Protection Division of the Board on June 4, 2007. The original panel concluded that the respondent was a Convention refugee and granted a positive determination on August 1, 2007.2 However, counsel for the Minister alleges that the respondent obtained his status as a Convention refugee as a result of directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts relating to a relevant matter.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] After considering the Minister's evidence the panel allows the Minister's application under section 109 of the Act. The panel determines that the decision of the Refugee Protection Division on August 1, 2007 conferring refugee protection on the claimant is nullified.\nSection 109 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act\n[3] The Minister has the burden on the balance of probabilities of proving that the respondent directly or indirectly misrepresented or withheld material facts to a relevant matter.\n[4] Section 109 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act reads:\nThe Refugee Protection Division may on application by the Minister vacate a decision to allow a claim for refugee protection if it finds that the decision was obtained as a result of directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts to a relevant matter.\nANALYSIS\nThe Current Application\n[5] In the Application to Vacate counsel for the Minister alleges that the respondent obtained his status as a Convention refugee by directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts relating to a relevant matter. Counsel for the Minister sought to vacate the refugee status of the respondent and relies upon the following factors based on his written submissions:3\n(1) The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) was precluded from properly assessing the respondent's refugee claim based on the issue of Exclusion 1F (b) for serious criminality in the USA.\n(2) The facts show that the respondent was convicted of Conspiracy to Commit Bank Fraud under 18 U.S.C. 371 and 1344 in the District of Minnesota on October 15, 2002.4 The respondent was committed to the custody of the United States Bureau of Prisons to be imprisoned for a total term of 37 months in prison, after which he was to be on supervised release for a term of 3 years and that he pay a total criminal monetary penalty and restitution of US$961,395.76. Upon release of his detention, the respondent was deported to Nigeria.\nWas there a withholding of material facts?\n[6] I find that the respondent withheld from the original member that he previously had status in the United States (U.S.) as an accepted asylum seeker and that he had status similar to that of other nationals in the U.S. prior to his deportation from that country; that he lived in the U.S. from 1996 until 2005, contrary to what was stated in his Personal Information Form (PIF). Most importantly the respondent did not disclose to the Minister or to the original member that he had a criminal conviction in the U.S.\nDid the facts relate to a relevant matter?\n[7] The respondent's failure to disclose to the original Board member that he had status in the U.S. and that he lived in the U.S. contrary to what is indicated in his PIF would have led the previous member into a line of questioning to test the credibility of the claimant's claim. Had the previous member been made aware that the claimant had a criminal conviction in the U.S., that member would have embarked on a line of questioning to determine whether or not the respondent was excluded from refugee protection. That member would have determined the issue of Exclusion before determining any matters relating to inclusion of the claimant's allegations relating to his fears for returning to Nigeria. Therefore, the fact that the respondent failed to disclose his criminal conviction and thus prevented the original member from investigating this matter, I find that the respondent did withhold material facts on a relevant matter central to his claim.\nWas there a causal connection between the respondent's withholding of information and the panel's positive determination in his refugee claim?\n[8] I find that there was;because the original panel did not have information about the respondent's criminal activity in the U.S., the member did not have cause to notify the Minister of the possible exclusion issue. The respondent signed his PIF as being complete, true and correct and that his declaration had the same force and effect as if made under oath. It is now determined that this was a false declaration. The IMM 5500 and IMM 5474 forms indicate in the declarations that \"I understand that any false statements or concealment of a material fact may result in my exclusion from Canada and may be grounds for my prosecution or removal.\" Furthermore, the claimant had competent counsel to represent him at his original hearing and still failed to disclose any information regarding his life in the U.S. or his criminal conviction. The original member was not able to properly consider whether the respondent had committed a serious non-political crime. The member was not able to consider whether the respondent was lacking in credibility because of his withholding of information. Not only did the respondent's withholding of information preclude the panel from considering exclusion, but it deprived the panel of the opportunity to apply the withheld facts to the matter of inclusion.\nIf the original panel had considered exclusion, would it have had serious reasons for considering that the respondent has committed a serious non-political crime outside of Canada?\n[9] This is a vacation proceeding-it is not for me to re-try that which was before the original panel. However, the exclusion-related evidence was not before the original panel. The Minister has submitted evidence showing that the respondent committed offences in the U.S., but this in itself does not lead to an automatic conclusion that the original panel would have had serious reasons to consider that the respondent committed a serious non-political crime. In my view, such a conclusion first requires an analysis of the offence and its nature, an analysis the original panel would have made had the information been before it.\n[10] The test to determine if someone has committed a serious non-political crime is set out in Jayasekara5 as regards to the seriousness of the crime, requires an evaluation of the elements of the crime, the mode of prosecution, the penalty prescribed, the facts and the mitigating and\/or aggravating circumstances underlying the conviction.\n[11] Relating to the issues at hand the panel finds the following:\nWas the offence non-political?\n[12] I see no political aspect to the offence-either as alleged by the victims or as described by the respondent-and the respondent did not attempt to argue that the offence had a political element. I find that the offence was non-political.\nWould the original panel have had \"serious reasons\" that the respondent committed a serious crime?\n[13] The Minister submits that based on their evidence, the original panel would have had serious reasons for considering that the respondent had committed serious crimes in the U.S. The fingerprint analysis from the U.S. matches the claimant's fingerprints under the alias, XXXX XXXX, who was convicted of a crime in the U.S. and removed to Nigeria.6 The claimant's Record of Deportation states that the reason for deportation is the respondent's criminal conviction for Conspiracy to Commit Bank Fraud in which he was sentenced to 37 months in prison.7 The Minister provided a copy of the United State District Court Judgement in a Criminal Case.8\n[14] The respondent's counsel submits that the respondent was charged with 23 counts for the violation of Title 18, U.S.C., sections 371 and 344, conspiracy to commit bank fraud and that counts 2 - 23 of the 2nd Superseding Indictment were dismissed. The plea that was accepted by the U.S. Attorney General refers only to the Second Superseding Indictment. Respondent's counsel submits that the conclusion that crimes attracting a maximum sentence of 10 years or more in Canada will generally be sufficiently serious to warrant exclusion is not conclusive and when considering Febles9 the Supreme Court of Canada has clarified that, while consideration of whether a maximum sentence of 10 years or more could have been imposed had the crime been committed in Canada is a useful guideline, such rule shall not be applied in a mechanistic, decontextualized or unjust manner. Council submits that the United States Attorney General agreed to a plea bargain that recognized the respondent's crime is less serious, and at the lower end of the sentencing guideline as a result of the circumstances surrounding his commission of the crime.\n[15] Considering the submissions from both counsel, I will now apply the tests as laid out in Jayasekara. 10\nElements of the Crime\n[16] The facts on which the Minister relies are as follows:\n[17] The respondent was convicted of Conspiracy to Commit Bank Fraud on XXXX XXXX, 2002 (the details of the crime are listed in the Minister's Application in Exhibit 2).11 The Minister submits that from about April 2000 until about April 2001, in the State and District of Minnesota, the respondent and his accomplices did unlawfully, willfully, and knowingly conspire, combine, confederate, and agree with each other and with other persons both known and unknown to the grand jury to commit certain offenses against the United States, that is: to execute, and to attempt to execute, a scheme and artifice to defraud federally insured financial institutions and to obtain, by means of false and fraudulent pretenses and representations, monies and funds owned by and under the custody and control of federally insured financial institutions in violation of title 18, United States Code, Section 1344. The Minister submits that in the Plea Agreement and Sentencing Stipulations12 that the respondent and his accomplice(s) conspired to commit bank fraud by contacting U.S. Bank to falsely change the address of account holders without their knowledge or consent and to have bank access devices, known as ATM or debit cards, sent to an unauthorized address (typically Qwest substations). The respondent obtained and used personal information of account holders, including but not limited to full names and addresses, account numbers, and personal identification numbers (PINs). The respondent then requested that devices and correspondence from U.S. Bank with new PIN numbers to withdraw funds from various accounts from U.S. banks, generally at ATMs.13\n[18] Counsel makes particular note that the Plea Agreement is based on information found in a second Superseding Indictment which was not included in the list of exhibits and counsel is critical that the Minister relied on a first Superseding Indictment, which not only is missing some pages, but is superseded by the second indictment as a result of supervening events. In regard to missing page(s), this is a matter which should have been brought up in the course of the hearing so that the Minister would have been given an opportunity to address any concerns counsel had and to me given the opportunity to complete the exhibit. Since this was not addressed at the hearing and only pointed out in submissions, it is little late for counsel to be making this complaint. Even so, I have reviewed the document, and it is obvious that from paragraphs 11 to 44 that the respondent's overt acts are being enumerated individually one after another, so that on a balance of probabilities if there are missing pages near the end of this document, it is likely that the missing paragraphs would be a continuation of the enumerated acts committed by the respondent. Regarding the second Superseding Indictment as listed in the Plea Agreement, again this is a matter which has been raised in the course of the hearing rather than in submissions. However, a clear observance of the Presentencing Investigation14 indicates that the charges against the respondent were divided into categories: Count 1 was the conspiracy to commit bank fraud; Counts 2 to 23 were the charges of bank fraud and aiding and abetting; and Count 24 was the forfeiture allegation in regard to the respondent's property. It seems obvious to me that counts 2 to 23 relate directly to the overt acts the respondent is charged with in the first superseding indictment, which were dropped as a result of the Plea Agreement.\n[19] Counsel submits that the panel should not rely on the Presentence Report because the report is not a full and final finding of the Court; that information obtained by the probation officers may include inaccuracies, inadmissible hearsay's and other inadmissible evidence; and\nthat officers are as susceptible to have a tough on crime public opinion as anyone else. Keeping in mind that the Board does not follow strict rules of evidence, it is clear that at the time, the presentence report was disclosed to both counsel involved in the Respondent`s Court case and that the government counsel had no objections and any objections raised by the defendant's counsel were minor and all were resolved. There are no sufficient grounds in which to reject this document. In any event, regarding the accuracy of the presentencing investigation, whether or not the respondent committed bank fraud as opposed to merely pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud, I again note that the claimant did acknowledge during the hearing that he did in fact commit bank fraud.\n[20] Based on the claimant`s testimony, based on the Plea Agreement, based on the presentencing investigation and because the respondent acknowledged his crime in the course of this hearing, it is clear that the claimant did commit bank fraud but was convicted in a plea agreement on one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud.\nMode of Persecution and Penalty Prescribed\n[21] The respondent was initially charged with bank fraud under Title 18 U.S.C. section 1344, which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years imprisonment. The District Attorney reduced the charge to the less serious offense of conspiracy to defraud the United States under section 18 U.S.C. section 371: US Code-Section 371, which carries a maximum sentence of five years. The penalty prescribed is an indictable offence in Canada and a felony in the U.S. and is, therefore, treated as a serious offence in both jurisdictions. The respondent pled guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud in violation of title 18, United States Code, 371. With his guilty plea, the respondent admits that he is guilty of each and every element of the crime charged. The respondent received 37 months incarceration along with fines and restitution - a lower sentence than he would have received if convicted of bank fraud, due to a plea bargain. Restitution calculations are $961,395.76 U.S. dollars. As part of the sentencing factors, it is plausible that the respondent might have been able to obtain a similar sentence as a result of a plea bargain in Canada.\n[22] The above offense if committed in Canada would equate to an offense under section 380 (1) (a) of the Canadian Criminal Code, namely Fraud over $5000, which is punishable by indictment to a term of imprisonment not exceeding 14 years. The respondent's fraud totaled U.S. $961,395.76. 15\n[23] The respondent served about 24 months of his 37 months sentence with 3 years supervised release and restitution and was subsequently deported.\n[24] Council submits that when considering Febles16 while consideration of whether a maximum sentence of 10 years or more could have been imposed had the crime being committed in Canada is a useful guideline; such rule shall not be applied in a mechanistic, decontextualized or unjust manner. Council submits that the plea bargain recognized the respondent's crime is less serious.\n[25] The Minister submits that the respondent has committed a serious non-political crime that falls within the exclusion 1F (b) of the Convention. He was sentenced to 37 months imprisonment (and served 24 months), after which he was deported to Nigeria from the U.S. for a crime which is similarly serious if committed in Canada. According to the terms of the plea agreement and the claimant's own testimony, the claimant received a plea agreement after he agreed to provide information about his accomplices.\n[24] Counsel submits that the guideline range for imprisonment is 46-57 months and that the was sentenced to a lower end of the sentencing guideline based on his limited involvement in the fraud scheme due to serious coercion, duress, mitigating and aggravating circumstances and the respondent's chronic addiction of alcohol and gambling that further degraded his capacity to make rational decisions. Council submits that this sentencing would be at the lower end of the range of 0 to 14 years if the offense were committed in Canada.\n[25] The respondent was sentenced to a term of 37 months (3 years plus 1 month). In addition, the respondent was given three years supervised release and ordered to pay restitution of $961,395.76. The respondent was released after 24 months for good behavior and was deported to Nigeria shortly afterwards.\n[26] The Minister submits that plea agreements are not an indicator of the seriousness of the offense; plea agreements are entered into by the courts for any reason. The respondent's counsel submits that the acceptance of the plea agreement was based on the respondent's cooperation with authorities and his acceptance of guilt at the earliest possible opportunity. I agree with the Minister on this point, that the plea agreement is not an indicator of the seriousness of the offense, since it appears that the prosecutor agreed to the plea agreement to expedite the judicial process. In addition to the factors counsel mentioned, the claimant acknowledged in the course of the hearing that the plea agreement was a result of his agreeing to provide information to US authorities regarding the accomplices to his crime. It is probable that the US authorities also obtained the plea agreement in order to further their investigation into the activities of the accomplices. This is evidence of the government's accepting a means to an end in order to obtain additional prosecutions. Again, as the Minister submits, a plea agreement in not necessarily an indicator of the seriousness of the offense.\n[27] Contrary to what counsel submits it does not appear that the claimant received a lower end of sentencing. According to the sentencing guidelines, the base offense level from the substantial offense was at level 6. The offense level increased by 14 levels because the loss exceeded $400,000 that was not more than $1 million, because the offense involved sophisticated means another 2 levels were added to the sentencing guideline. Finally, because the offense involved the unauthorized transfer or use of any means of identification unlawfully to produce or obtain any other means of an identification, the offense level is increased by another two points. The base level of the offense rose from 6 to 24. The claimant pled guilty to his conduct and received a reduction of 3 levels for a total of 21 sentencing guidelines. The claimant's original sentencing guidelines were increased by 18 levels, due to the seriousness of the crime. That the claimant was deported immediately upon serving his sentence is another indicator to how authorities in the U.S. viewed the seriousness of the crimes. Even with the plea agreement, I find that crime was still serious, since the original sentencing guidelines were raised by 18 levels before the 3 level reduction for admitting guilt. As stated earlier, even though the claimant received a reduced sentence on a reduced charge as a result of his pleading guilty, it remains that there are still serious reasons for considering that the claimant did actually commit the more serious crime of bank fraud.\n[28] No evidence was presented during the hearing that the respondent was coerced into signing the plea agreement or that the judicial process was unfair (there is the statement at the end of the presentencing investigation which indicates the respondent was not coerced). Accordingly, the panel finds that the mode of prosecution in the U.S. is fair and judicious.\nAggravating and Mitigating Factors\n[29] Counsel for the claimant submits that there are mitigating factors to consider. Council submits that the respondent had a stressful life which included news that he had a seriously ill parent and that he had suffered a traumatic loss of his common-law wife and that this produced a hard-impacting emotional repercussion and financial difficulty that caused the respondent to find help illegally. In addition to this the respondent felt responsibility for his mother's medical bills and the financial obligations of raising his four stepchildren. The respondent used chronic alcohol abuse and gambling areas and successful coping mechanisms. I find that these mitigating factors are insufficient to address the seriousness of the crime and the fact that the claimant created approximately 51 individual victims including the trauma that these victims experienced in having their identities and personal information compromised in addition to the losses the bank and the credit card companies suffered totaling nearly $1 million. The suffering and trauma faced by the claimant's innocent victims is more significant than the factors that led to the respondent's committing these crimes.\n[30] Counsel also submits that the claimant committed these crimes because he was abducted and forced into an illegal enterprise and that this is based on duress and coercion which was initiated by life-threatening scenarios threatened to him by his captors. The same threats were also given to his family who were attacked by proxy in Nigeria. Council submits that in Ruzic the court determined:\nPunishing a person whose actions are involuntary in the physical sense is unjust because it conflicts with the assumption in criminal law that individuals are autonomous and free choosing agents... It is a principle of fundamental justice that only voluntary conduct-behavior that is the product of a free will and control body, unhindered by external constraints-should attract the penalty and stigma of criminal liability. Deprive any person of liberty and branding her with the stigma of criminal liability would infringe the principles of fundamental justice if the accused did not have any realistic choice.\n[31] I agree with counsel's submissions to a point in that it is entirely possible that the respondent's initial criminal acts were based on duress or coercion. But very soon after the initial illegal acts, the respondent's argument that he did not have any realistic choice loses its force. Although it appears and that the respondent's family was attacked by proxy in Nigeria, it is also evident that the family went to the police in that country and the matter was investigated but apparently not resolved. The evidence indicates that the family was attacked on this one occasion and there does not appear to be any other threat made against the claimant's family in Nigeria, probably because he was cooperating with his accomplices. There is insufficient evidence before me to determine that the respondent's family could not receive adequate protection from the authorities in Nigeria. Furthermore, the presentencing investigation contains statements from the respondent's family that they are aware of the respondent's crime and as a result they are very sad and angry. This calls into the question the risks the family members faced in Nigeria, which the respondent suggests are part of the reasons he was coerced or forced into committing his crimes. The claimant committed illegal acts against approximately 51 individuals over a period of one year to18 months - during this time he never contacted the police to inform authorities that he had been coerced into committing criminal activities. The respondent only agreed to cooperate with U.S. authorities after he was apprehended. However, it is my finding that the claimant is not absolved of not trying to seek out state protection in the U.S. for the threats against his parents during the approximately one year to 18 months continuation of his criminal activities. In addition to this, there is evidence before me that the claimant has not been entirely credible regarding the information he provided at the hearing regarding his girlfriend accomplice and whether or not he had personally profited from the crimes he committed.\n[32] From the Presentence Investigation it can be determined that the respondent and his girlfriend and accomplice:\n...worked together to defraud U.S. Bank and its account holders of nearly $1,000,000. During this bank fraud scheme, the defendants defrauded credit card companies by using the identities of U.S. Bank account holders to obtain over $8,000 in merchandise. (Both defendants) are considered average participants in this offense and are equally responsible for the losses which total at least $961,395.76.17\nThroughout the hearing, the respondent displayed a lack of responsibility for his own actions, rather he blamed his accomplices. The respondent indicated that his principal accomplice was not his girlfriend, even though he signed the plea agreement to indicate that she was his girlfriend. The presentencing investigation indicates that the respondent and his girlfriend accomplice were making plans to move to Nigeria and build a house together. After the respondent's arrest, blueprints for a house were discovered in his home. Even with this evidence presented to the respondent, he has still denied that the accomplice was his girlfriend. There is information in the presentencing investigation to indicate that the respondent was sending money to Nigeria throughout the commission of his crimes, which the respondent denies. The respondent denied all of this even after being confronted with the evidence. Throughout his testimony, he indicated that the surveillance statements made by the U.S. Secret Service were not true. In his testimony, the respondent denied ever using his employer and their assets to carry out his serious crime, directly contradicting the reports made by the authorities who had him under surveillance according to the presentencing investigation and in his plea agreement. I accept the evidence of the US investigating authorities, who had the respondent under surveillance and who monitored the respondent taking possession of credit cards placed at his employer's business by officers of the Minnesota Financial Strike Force, since the statements of the officers are on a balance of probabilities to be independent investigators in this matter as opposed to the claimant's own uncorroborated self-serving statements. Since the respondent is not credible on a number of different matters as indicated above, I do not accept at face value that the claimant was under duress and coercion for the whole time that he committed his crimes. In the one year to 18 months that the respondent committed his crimes in order to absolve himself from his own responsibility he should have gone to the police or authorities in the U.S. and he did not.\n[33] The U.S. Bank submitted a Victim Impact Statement and a Declaration of Victim Losses18 indicating that the \"Takeovers perpetrated by the defendants they have clearly depicted their evil nature and lack of respect for the United States, its citizens and corporate businesses.\" The statement points out that the identified theft destroyed the good names and credit histories of their customers. The Bank also states that over 18 months, the defendant's fraudulent activities affected numerous victims (there were 51 victims listed in the first superseding indictment) and compromised accounts worth nearly $9 million.\n[34] Under the Specific Offense Characteristics19 the parties agree that the following specific offense characteristics apply to this case:\nThe intended loss to the victim financial institutions in this case is more than $1 million and under $2.5 million that the offense involved sophisticated means and that the offense involved the unauthorized transfer or use of any means of identification unlawfully to produce or obtain any other means of identification.\n[35] I find that there are not sufficient mitigating factors surrounding the claimant's conviction on the aforementioned criminal charges. The claimant cannot reasonably argue that he was under duress the whole time he committed his crimes, especially when there is evidence that he was profiting from his crimes. He made a choice to defraud a bank and its customers over a period of a number of months and used their victimization to attain to his own goals. This was a sophisticated crime that occurred over a period of 18 months with money diverted out of the country into other accounts in Nigeria.\n[36] The panel finds that there are serious reasons for considering that the claimant has committed a serious non-political crime outside of Canada and I find that the claimant is, therefore, excludable under Article 1 F (b) of the Refugee Convention.\n[37] The question to be answered is, are there serious reasons for considering that a serious non-political crime was committed in another country. As indicated above, consideration is given to the mode of prosecution and the penalty prescribed and a comparison, in this case, between U.S. law and Canadian law. However, in this case, the respondent acknowledged that he did indeed commit bank fraud (in his testimony, the claimant agreed that he had defrauded bank customers by using stolen ATM cards to illegally withdraw money from ATMs), even if he was only charged with conspiracy to commit bank fraud. Given that the respondent acknowledged that he committed bank fraud, the more serious of the two offenses for which he was charged, with a potential sentencing of a maximum of 30 years in the U.S., I find that this is sufficient for serious reasons for considering that a serious non-political crime was committed in the U.S. I agree with minister's counsel in quoting the Law Reform Commission of Canada that a plea agreement constitutes an agreement by the accused to plead guilty in return for the prosecutors agreeing to take or refrain from taking a particular action.\"\nPlea agreements are not an indicator of the seriousness of an offense; plea agreements are entered into by the courts for any number of reasons. It is the Minister's respectful submission that the plea agreement has no bearing on the seriousness of this offense.20\n[38] Based on this information, I find that either the respondent's own disclosure of his offences to that panel, or the panel's review of the information from U.S. authorities, would constitute serious reasons.\n[39] Had the original panel had the opportunity to consider the crimes committed by the respondent in the U.S., along with the way such crimes are treated in Canadian law, as well as a number of other factors, it would have reasonably concluded that the respondent committed serious non-political crimes outside of Canada. Had the original panel had this information before it, it would have excluded the respondent from refugee protection, pursuant to Section 98 of the Act and Article 1(F)(b) of the Convention.\nSecond prong of Section 109\n[40] The second prong of section 109 of the Act to Vacate is:\na. The Refugee Protection Division may reject the application if it is satisfied that other sufficient evidence was considered at the time of the determination to justify protection.\n[41] I do not intend to consider whether, pursuant to the Act Section 109(2), other sufficient evidence was before the original panel that might justify refugee protection.21 If a claimant is found to be excluded by operation of Article 1(F) (b), the Division cannot find him to be a refugee or a person in need of protection.\nCONCLUSION\n[42] The respondent withheld material facts relating to a relevant matter, and there is a causal relationship between this withholding of information and the positive determination of his refugee claim. Had these facts not been withheld, the original panel would have excluded the respondent from refugee protection.\n[43]\nThe Minister's application is allowed. The claim of XXXX XXXX XXXX is rejected, and the decision granting him refugee protection is nullified, as he is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n(signed)\n\"Douglas Cryer\"\nDouglas Cryer\nAugust 22, 2016\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Reasons for Decision dated August 1, 2007.\n3 Exhibit PH-1.\n4 Exhibit 2, pp 28-35.\n5 Jayasekara, 2008 FCA 404.\n6 Exhibit 2, M-1, pp. 5-9.\n7 Exhibit 2, M-3, p. 27.\n8 Exhibit 2, M-4, pp. 28-48.\n9 Febles v.

Specifically, the Minister is alleging that the respondent re-availed himself of the protection of his country of nationality. The hearing into this application was heard on October 23, 2014 , June 2nd, October 5, October 9 2015.\n[2] The respondent was present at the hearing with his counsel. The Minister's representative was also present at the hearing. The Panel also considered the post-hearing submissions and disclosure of case law made by the Respondent and Applicant.\nTHE LEGISLATION\n[3] The legislation on cessation of refugee protection is found at section 108 of the Act. Section 108 reads as follows:\n108(1) A claim for refugee protection shall be rejected, and a person is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, in any of the following circumstances:\n(a) the person has voluntarily re-availed themselves of the protection of their country of nationality;\n(b) the person has voluntarily reacquired their nationality;\n(c) the person has acquired a new nationality and enjoys the protection of the country of that new nationality;\n(d) the person has voluntarily become re-established in the country that the person left or remained outside of and in respect of which the person claimed refugee protection in Canada; or\n(e) the reasons for which the person sought refugee protection have ceased to exist.\n(2) On application by the Minister, the Refugee Protection Division may determine that refugee protection referred to in subsection 95(1) has ceased for any of the reasons described in subsection (1).\n(3) If the application is allowed, the claim of the person is deemed to be rejected.\n(4) Paragraph (1)(e) does not apply to a person who establishes that there are compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution, torture, treatment or punishment for refusing to avail themselves of the protection of the country which they left, or outside of which they remained, due to such previous persecution, torture, treatment or punishment.\nIn reaching this decision, the panel has also considered all of the materials disclosed by the parties including the following documents:\n\u2022The Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status under the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees.2\n\u2022 The Cessation Clauses: Guidelines on their Application UNHCR, (1999).3\n* CIC Manuals and operational bulletins4\n[4] The panel also considered the following case law:\n\u2022 Nsende v.

He traveled from Pakistan to Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2008 to make a refugee claim. The claimant was found to be a Convention Refugee by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) on February 15, 2011. The claimant was granted permanent residence (PR) on November 14, 2011.\n[6] The respondent was issued Pakistani passport XXXX XXXX from the Pakistani Consulate in Vancouver on XXXX XXXX, 2011. The Passport was valid until XXXX XXXX, 2012. The respondent's Pakistani passport was extended by the Pakistani Consulate on XXXX XXXX, 2011 until XXXX XXXX, 2016.5\n[7]\nThe respondent used a valid Pakistani Passport to travel back to Pakistan on three occasions. The respondent traveled back to Pakistan on XXXX XXXX, 2012 and he remained in there until XXXX XXXX, 2012. He used Passport XXXX XXXX for that travel.\n[8] The respondent used a valid Pakistani Passport to travel back to Pakistan on XXXX XXXX, 2012 and he remained there until XXXX XXXX, 2013. He used Passport XXXX XXXX for that travel.\n[9] The respondent used a valid Pakistani Passport to travel to Pakistan on XXXX XXXX, 2013 and he remained there until XXXX XXXX, 2013. He used Passport XXXX XXXX for that travel.\n[10] The facts stated above are generally not in dispute although the Minister and the Respondent disputed whether the claimant voluntarily obtained a Pakistani Passport from the Consulate in Vancouver. The Respondent takes the position that he obtained the Passport as he believed he needed to have a valid passport in order to proceed with his application for Permanent Residence in Canada. The Minister took the position that the Respondent was not directed by Canadian staff to obtain a Passport in order to become a Permanent Resident (PR).\n[11] There is also no dispute by the parties that the Respondent traveled back to Pakistan after he obtained his Canadian PR.\nALLEGATION\n[12] The Minister alleges in the application that the Respondent re-availed his country of nationality, in this case Pakistan because he obtained a Pakistani Passport, he then used the said Passport to travel to Pakistan on three occasions and that as a result of this he obtained the diplomatic protection of the Pakistani government. The Minister takes the position that the three elements of cessation under Section 108(1)(a) have been satisfied in this case.\nPRELIMINARY ISSUE\n[13] Counsel for the respondent objected to the cessation application at the outset of the hearing stating that the matter should be dismissed because the Applicant in bringing the application engaged in an abuse of process.\n[14] Counsel raised a number of issues in this case that he believed should lead to a finding that he Applicant engaged in an abuse of process. The issues included the Port of Entry (\"POE\") interview between the Respondent and Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) Officer XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX This interview took place at the Vancouver International Airport when the Respondent returned home from Pakistan on his third trip there.6 Counsel for the Respondent takes the position that XXXX did not have the authority to question the Respondent about his travel back to Pakistan. He argues that XXXX examination of the Respondent as a returning Permanent Resident to Canada was limited to confirming his identity and to confirming that he had fulfilled his residency obligation as outlined in the Act.\n[15] Counsel argues that XXXX continued examination of the Respondent after he was satisfied with his identity and residency, was not allowed and went beyond the scope of his authority. Counsel further argues that XXXX had an obligation to caution the Respondent that he was under no obligation to answer his questions once he had satisfied himself of his identity and residency. Counsel takes the position that any information obtained by XXXX beyond establishing the Respondent's identity and residency should be excluded and if it is excluded, then the Applicant did not establish a prima facie case to submit the cessation application in the first place. He also argues in the larger context of the Applicant's interaction with the Respondent that the questioning of the Respondent at the POE beyond identity and residency is the first part of the overall abuse of process by the Applicant.\n[16] The Applicant provided written submissions subsequent to the hearing that made reference to the XXXX interview.7 The Applicant takes the position that the information obtained by XXXX should not be excluded and that it does not form part of an abuse of process by the Applicant. The Applicant further states that the questions asked of the Respondent at the Port of Entry were part of XXXXs investigation that is legislatively supported by Section 15, Section 16 and Section 27 of the Act. The Applicant also states that the Respondent had an ongoing application that allowed XXXX to question him. Specifically, the application referred to by the Applicant is the sponsorship application by the Respondent for his family in Pakistan.\n[17] The Panel finds that XXXX questioning of the Applicant at the Port of Entry went beyond what was allowed under the legislation.8 The Panel finds that the Respondent was questioned about his identity and whether he had fulfilled his residency obligation as a PR. The Panel finds that once XXXX satisfied himself with the identity and residency of the Respondent, he did not have the authority to question him further unless the questions related to another piece of legislation such as the Customs Act.\n[18] The Panel finds that the Applicant cannot rely on a pending sponsorship application for the Respondent's family as a justification to question the claimant writ large on his travels back to Pakistan and the reasons for that travel. The Panel finds that XXXX had the legislative authority to question the claimant about his identity and residency. Once he had satisfied himself on those two questions, XXXX was required to admit the Respondent. The Panel finds that XXXX questions related to the Respondent's possible re-availment in Pakistan were asked without proper legislative authority. That being said, this did not preclude XXXX from asking those questions. XXXX could have asked the Respondent the same questions but he would have been required to caution him that he was under no obligation to answer them. The Panel therefore finds that the declaration from XXXX that relates to matters not directly related to the claimant's identity and residency are excluded from the evidence. The Panel will therefore not\nconsider his declaration with respect to all the information it contains related to the cessation of the claimant. Furthermore, the Panel has not considered in coming to this decision the FOSS notes9prepared by XXXX that reiterate what was contained in his declaration.\n[19] Counsel for the Respondent also takes the position that the subsequent CBSA inland enforcement interview between the Respondent and Hearings Advisor XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX should be excluded and that it forms the second part of his argument that the Applicant engaged in an abuse of process.\n[20] XXXX sent a letter to the Respondent requiring him to attend an interview. The key word in the letter sent to the Respondent is \"required\".10 The Respondent testified that he believed that he had no choice in the matter and that he was obliged to report for the interview. XXXX was asked at the hearing whether he cautioned the Respondent at the outset of the interview that he was under no obligation to answer his questions. XXXX was also asked if he cautioned the Respondent that he could have his Counsel present for the interview. XXXX testified that he believed that he informed the Respondent that he was under no obligation to answer questions and that the Respondent had a right to Counsel. The Applicant disclosed a transcript of the XXXX interview at the hearing11. Counsel for the Applicant pointed out to XXXX that the transcript was silent on these issues. XXXX then testified that he had a conversation with the Respondent before turning on the recorder and that he may have cautioned him \"off the record\". When pressed on the issue by Counsel, XXXX admitted that he could not remember whether he cautioned the Respondent.\n[21] Once again, the Applicant defends the XXXX interview on the basis of the pending sponsorship application. The Applicant takes the position that the sponsorship application is considered as application under Section 15 of the Act and as such, the Respondent was obliged to answer XXXX questions. The Panel disagrees.\n[22] In a recent decision from Federal Court,12 the Court ruled that the Minister did not have jurisdiction to question a claimant about his refugee claim after the eligibility of the claim was completed. The Minister's evidence obtained in the interview was excluded in that case. The Panel finds that this case is analogous to that case. The Applicant did not have the authority to question the Respondent about cessation without providing him first with a caution that he was under no obligation to answer XXXX questions and that he had the right to have Counsel present at the interview. The Panel finds that the pending sponsorship application by the Respondent's family is not proper justification under Section 15 to compel the Respondent to answer XXXX questions. The Panel therefore excludes the entire transcript of the XXXX interview and the Panel has not considered any of the content in making this decision.\n[23] Counsel for the Respondent further argues that XXXX actions beyond the interview were also part of the abuse of process. Specifically, Counsel refers to the Field Operation Support System (FOSS) entry by XXXX and his email to CIC staff in Islamabad.13 XXXX was questioned at the hearing about his email to Islamabad. In the email, XXXX advises the overseas CIC staff that the Respondent is under investigation for cessation and that the Respondent's may not be able to sponsor his family if his status of PR is lost.14 Counsel takes the position that\nXXXX had no authority to stop the overseas sponsorship of the Respondent's family. The panel agrees. There is no legislative authority for XXXX to suspend or in any way hinder the processing of the sponsorship application. XXXX was asked by the Respondent's Counsel under what authority he made the entry in FOSS and sent the email to Islamabad. XXXX stated that his Manager XXXX XXXX instructed him to do so. The Panel agrees with Counsel for the Respondent that there was no legislative justification to suspend or stop the processing of the sponsorship application based on a pending cessation investigation or cessation application for that matter.\n[24] Counsel for the Respondent provided documents confirming that the pending cessation application is not a ground to suspend the sponsorship application made by the Respondent. Counsel stated that he made several requests to CIC under Access to Information and Privacy (ATIP) legislation for disclosure of the overseas sponsorship file. Counsel provided evidence showing that CIC was not timely or forthcoming under the ATIP legislation. Counsel filed a complaint with the Privacy Commissioner regarding CIC's failure to disclose information under ATIP. Despite this complaint, Counsel for the Respondent did not receive any disclosure of the overseas file. Counsel argued that this failure on the part of CIC left him to speculate as to why the sponsorship application had not been processed. Counsel believed that the email and FOSS entry by XXXX was the reason for the sponsorship application not being processed by CIC.\n[25] Counsel argues that XXXX actions to email and enter the Non-Computer Based (NCB) entry in FOSS resulted in CIC not processing the sponsorship application. The failure on the part of CIC to suspend or stop the processing of the application pending the outcome of the cessation application was not legislatively justified and this constitutes an abuse of process and the cessation should be dismissed as a result of this abuse of process.\n[26] Counsel argues that the abuse of process in this case began with the XXXX interview and continued with the XXXX interview, the XXXX email overseas, the failure of CIC to disclose information under the ATIP legislation and finally with CIC suspending the processing of the sponsorship application on the basis of a pending cessation application even if this is not one of the grounds under the legislation that would justify the suspension of the processing of the sponsorship application.\n[27] The Panel acknowledges that XXXX and XXXX interview were problematic. The reasons have been mentioned previously. The Panel has taken the appropriate steps with respect to these interviews by excluding a portion of the XXXX declaration, the FOSS notes as well as excluding the entire XXXX interview.\n[28] With respect to the XXXX email and FOSS entry, the evidence before the Panel shows that he emailed CIC overseas and made the FOSS entry under the instructions of his manager. XXXX believed at the time that both actions were justified. As noted previously, the processing of the sponsorship application could not be suspended based on the pending cessation application. Although the instructions given to XXXX were wrong, what is being impugned by Counsel for the Respondent is not the entry in FOSS and the email sent by XXXX but the actions of the CIC staff overseas who suspended the processing of the sponsorship application.\n[29] Counsel for the Respondent is seeking a ruling from the Panel that CIC's actions constitute an abuse of process. The Panel does not have the jurisdiction to provide the Respondent with the remedy he seeks. The Panel's jurisdiction is limited to the application for the cessation of the Respondent's refugee status. The appropriate remedy for the Respondent with respect to CIC's failure to disclose information was to file a complaint with the Privacy Commissioner, which he did. With respect to the suspended sponsorship application, the Panel finds that the Respondent should have sought a remedy through the Federal Court by filing a writ of mandamus. The Minister agrees with the Applicant that this issue was dealt with in the Khalifa.15 The Panel therefore finds that it does not have jurisdiction to deal with the abuse of process based on CIC's suspension of the processing of the sponsorship application.\n[30] With respect to the actions of the CBSA, the Panel finds that the actions of XXXX and XXXX were problematic but that they do not amount to an abuse of process. The Court has outlined the test for a finding of an abuse of process.16 The Court stated that the cases involving an abuse of process will be extremely rare and the proceedings must be shown to be unfair to the point that they are contrary to the interests of justice. The Court goes on to say that the process must be tainted to such a degree that it amounts to one of the clearest cases.\n[31] The Panel finds that the Respondent has not met the test for abuse of process in this case. The Panel has remedied the issues with the XXXX and XXXX interviews by striking all the information that was obtained without legislative authorization or obtained through a failure to caution the Respondent that he was under no obligation to answer questions. The Panel finds that the portion of the XXXX interview that went beyond the Respondent's identity and residency as well as the XXXX interview are analogous to a recent decision17 from the Federal Court where the Court ruled that an interview by a CBSA Officer of a refugee claimant should be excluded from evidence as the Minister did not have jurisdiction to question the claimant. Although that case involved the questioning of a refugee claimant after eligibility had been completed, the Panel finds that same principle applies to this case. The Respondent when he was questioned by XXXX was making an application to enter Canada. XXXX did not have the jurisdiction under the Act to question the claimant beyond his establishing his identity and residency. Officer XXXX did not have the jurisdiction to question the Respondent as there was no pending application being made by the claimant. The Panel finds at a minimum that XXXX and XXXX should have cautioned the Respondent that he had a right to Counsel and that he was under no obligation to answer questions from the officers. The Panel further finds that the email by XXXX and FOSS entry were sent in error as the sponsorship application could not be suspended on the basis of the cessation application. The fact that the CIC officer overseas may have stopped the processing of the sponsorship application as a result of the XXXX email is beyond the jurisdiction of this Panel to remedy. The Panel finds that an application for a writ of mandamus before the Federal Court is the appropriate remedy for CIC's actions overseas. The Panel therefore dismisses the abuse of process application by the Respondent.\nTHE CESSATION APPLICATION\n[32] Counsel for the Respondent raised an objection at the hearing when the Applicant called the Respondent to testify. Counsel for the Respondent argued that the interview conducted by XXXX should be excluded with respect to all questions that went beyond the Respondent's identity and residency. Counsel also argued that the XXXX interview should be excluded in its entirety because the Respondent was under no obligation to answer XXXX questions and he failed to caution him about this at the outset of the interview.\n[33] As noted previously, the Panel has excluded a portion of the XXXX interview as well as the entire XXXX interview. Counsel for the Respondent stated that if the portion of the XXXX interview and XXXX interview are excluded, there is insufficient evidence for the Minister to establish a prima facie case for bringing the application in the first place. Counsel further argued that if the Applicant failed to establish a prima facie case for cessation, the Applicant could not perfect its case through the examination of the Respondent at the hearing. The Panel agrees that the Minister must establish that there is a prima facie case for cessation before submitting the application to the RPD. The Panel acknowledges that hearings officers that files cessation applications on behalf of the Minister has some very limited discretion. Once the Hearings Officer forms the opinion that the prima facie case for cessation exists, he must file the application. The Panel does not have the jurisdiction to go behind the motivation for filing the application.\n[34] In this particular case, the Panel disagrees with the Respondent that the Minister did not have a prima facie case for cessation once the portion of the XXXX interview and the XXXX interview are excluded. The Panel finds that in the course of XXXX examination of the Respondent at the POE, he would have needed to satisfy himself of the Respondent's identity. This would necessarily have required XXXX to examine the Respondent's travel document which in this case was his Pakistani passport. XXXX would have examined the stamps in the Respondent's passport to assess whether he had complied with the residency requirements of a PR. This would have also led XXXX to verify the Respondent's information in the CBSA FOSS system. A review of the FOSS system would have revealed that the Respondent was a Convention Refugee and that he made a claim against Pakistan. In fact, it appears that this is what led XXXX to ask the Respondent about his travel to Pakistan and other questions related to the his re-availment to the country of persecution.\n[35] The Panel finds that the Applicant would have established a prima facie case for cessation by virtue of the claimant submitting to XXXX his Pakistani passport for examination. This was followed up with the FOSS verification confirming that the claimant was a Convention Refugee from Pakistan. Had XXXX forwarded a copy of the Respondent's Pakistani passport and the FOSS information that he was a Convention Refugee from Pakistan; the Hearings Officer would have had enough evidence to establish a prima facie case for cessation. The Panel did not immediately rule on Counsel's application to dismiss the matter on the basis that the Applicant had not established a prima facie case for cessation. The Panel instead heard the testimony of the Respondent and informed the parties that a decision on this application would be made after all the evidence had been heard. Based on the foregoing, the Panel dismisses the Respondent's application as the Minister did have sufficient evidence to establish a prima case for cessation.\nDid the Minister establish the requirements for cessation pursuant to Section 108(1)(a) of the Act?\n[36] The parties both agree that the Minister has the burden of establishing the three elements for Re-availment under Section 108(1)(a). These three elements are:\n* voluntariness: the Respondent must have acted voluntarily\n* intention: The Respondent must have intended to re-avail the protection of his country of nationality\n* re-availment: The Respondent must have received such protection\n[37] On the first element of re-availment, the Applicant argues that the Respondent acted in a voluntary manner by obtaining a Pakistani passport. Counsel for the Respondent conversely argues that the actions of the Respondent were not voluntary. Counsel for the Respondent points to the fact that the Respondent received a letter from CIC related to his PR application informing him that he must provide his Pakistani passport. The Respondent stated at the hearing that he obtained a Pakistani passport because he believed he needed to. This would suggest that the Respondent did not act voluntarily in obtaining his Pakistani passport. The Panel finds that this may be the case but his subsequent actions by the Respondent with respect to his passport must also be considered.\n[38] The evidence before the Panel is that the Respondent approached the Consulate three times. He was initially refused the passport as he could not submit his previous passport to the Consular authorities. He then returned and had the passport renewed but realized shortly thereafter that it was valid for one year only. He then returned to the Consulate to have the passport validity extended beyond 1 year. The Panel notes that renewal of the passport and subsequent request to extend it beyond one year was done after the Respondent became a PR. The Panel finds that the Respondent's subsequent actions with respect to his passport were voluntarily. This was confirmed by the Respondent at the hearing where he stated that he wanted the passport in case of emergency. The Panel finds that the Applicant has established that the Respondent acted voluntarily with respect to obtaining his Pakistani passport. The Respondent's actions establish the presumption that he voluntarily re-availed the protection of Pakistan.\n[39] The second element for re-availment is intention. The Applicant submits that the Respondent intended on to re-avail. The case law18 and UN Handbook19 state that a person obtaining a passport from his country of nationality establishes a presumption that he re-availed the protection of Pakistan. Counsel for the Respondent states that beyond the Respondent obtaining a Pakistani passport, he did not have the intention to re-avail the protection of Pakistan.\n[40] Counsel argues that the Respondent waited to travel back to Pakistan. He did not travel back until he became a PR of Canada. He further argues that he Respondent varied his behavior prior to return to Pakistan and during his stay in Pakistan. Counsel points to the fact that the claimant reduced his political activity regarding a free Kashmir while he was in Canada and that he did not engage in political activity while in Pakistan. Furthermore, Counsel argued that the Respondent traveled to Pakistan as a PR of Canada and that must be a consideration for the Panel as PR status has legal implications.\n[41] The Panel accepts the Respondent's testimony where he stated that he believed that his PR Card would offer him some level of protection if he got into trouble with the authorities in Pakistan. He testified that he believed that if he were in custody in Pakistan, he could show his PR card and that the authorities would let him go. The Panel was not presented with any objective evidence to suggest that the authorities in Pakistan would treat him any differently if he were in their custody because he was a holder of a Canadian PR card. Although that may have been the Respondent's belief it does not negate the fact that he obtained a Pakistani passport and then used it to travel back to Pakistan three times.\n[42] The Panel finds that the Respondent intended to re-avail the protection of the Pakistani authorities. He obtained a Pakistani passport and used it to transit through at least four countries on his way to and from Pakistan. When he did so, he presented himself to foreign authorities as a Pakistani citizen. As noted by the Minister, diplomatic protection afforded by carrying a passport is recognized by all states. The receiving states accept the information in the passport as being accurate and they also recognize that the issuing state will accept the person back under most circumstances.\n[43] The Respondent entered and exited Pakistan on three occasions. When he did so, it was as a Pakistani citizen. He may have been carrying a PR for Canada but he presented himself to authorities as a Pakistani citizen. The Respondent stayed in Pakistan for an extended period of time. On one occasion, he remained in Pakistan for seven months. When he was in Pakistan, he remained in his home. This is the same home that the Respondent stated at his refugee hearing was surrounded by the Pakistani authorities. The claimant stated at the cessation hearing that he was discreet about his travel back to Pakistan as he did not provide advance warning to his family that he was returning. The Panel finds that this does not establish that the claimant traveled back surreptitiously or clandestinely. He did not sneak into the country. He presented himself as a citizen of Pakistan on each entry and exit. He submitted to an examination by Pakistani authorities who granted him entry into the country as a citizen of Pakistan.\n[44] The Respondent states that he kept a low profile in Pakistan but his evidence shows that he sought out medical services while he was there and that he left his home and met with people other than his family. The Respondent stated that he diminished his political activity while in Canada and that he did not express his political opinion while he was in Pakistan. The Respondent stated that he diminished his political activity in order to prevent any problems for his family that remained in Pakistan. That may be the case, but the claimant stated at his refugee hearing that he was being actively sought by the Pakistani authorities when he left and came to Canada. Moreover, the Respondent's lawyer in Pakistan produced documents at his refugee hearing to the effect that he was wanted by the authorities in Pakistan and that he faced a death sentence if he returned. The Respondent acknowledged at the cessation hearing that he came to realize that these documents were fraudulent. He was asked to explain why his lawyer in Pakistan would provide him with documents that were fraudulent. The Respondent could not provide any explanation for this. He traveled back to Pakistan three times and he remained there for an extended period of time without incurring any problems with the authorities. The Panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the Respondent did not have a subjective fear of returning to Pakistan, despite his testimony to the contrary. The Panel finds that the Respondent's actions as indicated previously establish that he did not have a subjective fear of returning to Pakistan. The Panel therefore finds that the Respondent had the intention to re-avail the protection of Pakistan by obtaining a passport and returning there on three occasions.\n[45] The Panel finds that the Applicant has established the last component under section 108(1)(a) that the Respondent actually received diplomatic protection. As noted previously, the Respondent obtained a Pakistani passport. He used the passport to return to Pakistan three times. He transited through at least four countries on his way to and from Pakistan. He was accepted as a Pakistani citizen by those countries. More importantly, the Respondent entered and exited Pakistan three times as a citizen of Pakistan. The authorities granted him entry into the country as a citizen of Pakistan. Based on the foregoing, the Panel finds that the Respondent did in fact receive diplomatic protection from the use of his Pakistani passport.\n[46] In a recent case before the Federal Court of Canada20the court confirmed the existing case law on cessation where it states at paragraph 16 that there is a presumption of re-availment when a person applied for a passport of their country of citizenship. The court goes on to state that the presumption is particularly strong when the refugee uses the passport to travel back to his country. The Court notes that some have suggested that this is conclusive evidence for re-availment. The Court states that obtaining a passport and using it to travel back to their country will result in cessation and that there are only exceptional circumstances where it would not result in cessation.\n[47] The Respondent provided the rationale for returning to Pakistan. The reasons included family illness and the desire to see his family from whom he had been separated for a significant amount of time. The Handbook at paragraph 12521 references examples of exceptional circumstances that would negate the presumption of re-availment. As noted by the Court Abadi, these exceptional circumstances refer to situations where the refugee would obtain an emergency travel document from the country of refuge. This is not the case for the Respondent. The Panel therefore finds that the Respondent did receive diplomatic protection from the Pakistani authorities.\n[48] The Panel finds that the Respondent has re-availed the protection of Pakistan because he acted voluntarily, he intended to re-avail the protection of Pakistan and he did receive protection from Pakistan.\nDETERMINATION\n[49] Based on the foregoing, the panel allows the Minister's application for cessation pursuant to section 108(1)(a) of the Act. The panel finds that the Minister has established all three required elements for re-availment. The panel therefore rejects the claim for protection of the respondent as he has voluntarily re-availed himself of the protection of his country of nationality, in this case being Pakistan pursuant to section 108(3) of the Act.\nCONCLUSION\n[50] The panel therefore concludes that the claim of XXXX XXXX is rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Daniel Tucci\"\nDaniel Tucci\n2 Mars 2016\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibit 1, item J, pages 71-75.\n3 Exhibit 1, item k, pages 76-78.\n4 Exhibit7 item 3, page 15-31.\n5 Exhibit 1.\n6 Exhibit 1, pages31-32.\n7 Exhibit 1.\n8 See XXXX declaration at Exhibit 1, pg. 31-32.\n9 See Exhibit 18\n10 Exhibit 2, tab 3.\n11 See Exhibit 19.\n12 Paramo de Gutierrez v Citizenship and Immigration 2015 FC 1198.\n13 Exhibit 12.\n14 Exhibit 12, page 3.\n15 Khalifa v.

Their claims were referred to the Board on December 18, 2015. They claim refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \"Act\").1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] For the purposes of this decision, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, whose statement forms the basis on which all four claimants rely, shall be referred to as the principal claimant. The principal claimant alleges the following.\n[3] The principal claimant is a 62-year-old Sunni XXXX from a village in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[4] In XXXX 2015, the principal claimant and his sons established a \"XXXX centre\" with the help and support of a woman named XXXX XXXX and her uncle, XXXX XXXX. The centre opened in a house owned by the principal claimant, next to his own home and operated in the evenings. There, the principal claimant, his sons, XXXX and others XXXX children irrespective of gender and faith. They hoped to address XXXX XXXX in the area and to prevent children from getting involved in the rampant drug activity in the region.\n[5] In late XXXX 2015, a Member of Parliamentary Assembly (MPA) from the Pakistan Muslim League - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and a Member of National Assembly (MNA) named XXXX XXXX, as well the village XXXX XXXX and their \"goons\" came to the claimants' home. The elected officials had sought the principal claimant's political support in the past, but were rebuffed due to the principal claimant's belief that they were profiting from the drug trade in the area.\n[6] The men demanded that the principal claimant stop XXXX Christian and Shia children and to shut down the centre, accusing him of offering Shia XXXX and trying to convert the children. The principal claimant refused and he was threatened by the men.\n[7] In XXXX 2015, the MPA and MNA organized a large gathering where attendees were told the claimants are apostates and the centre would be closed for offering Shia XXXX. The principal claimant tried to report the matter to police who stated they would not intervene.\n[8] The claimants began to receive telephone threats. These threats were reported to police to no avail.\n[9] In XXXX 2015, when the claimant and his sons were going to Friday prayers, XXXX XXXX XXXX and two armed guards stopped the claimants' vehicle and under threat told them to shut down their centre.\n[10] The principal claimant's son, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX wanted to marry. Two of her uncles did not approve of the marriage as they were friends with XXXX XXXX XXXX, who also did not approve. He threatened her parents to stop the wedding and to prevent her from XXXX at the centre.\n[11] In XXXX 2015, the principal claimant invited 40 to 50 people to the house to get support for a protest against XXXX XXXX XXXX, his activities and the PML-N. Although the locals acknowledged the problems in the area, they were fearful of taking a stand against this MPA.\n[12] XXXX XXXX XXXX, the local maulvi, the village chairperson and others found out about this meeting. As a result, the maulvi made a speech in which he accused the principal claimant and his sons of apostasy and blasphemy. After this, the claimants' home was stoned and the claimants were threatened.\n[13] On the night of XXXX XXXX, 2015, gun shots were fired at the claimants' home while they were asleep. When it was reported to local police the next morning, they refused to take a complaint against an MPA and MNA. The claimants went to report the matter at the XXXX station a couple of weeks later, but were again refused. On their way home, they were stopped by armed men who beat and threatened them if they went to police again.\n[14] The principal claimant and his sons were members of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). The principal claimant campaigned for support for the PTI who were opposed to the PML-N and their involvement in the drug trade.\n[15] On XXXX XXXX, 2015, a protest attended by the principal claimant and his sons was held against the MPA and MNA. Police stopped the procession and used tear gas and batons and made some arrests. The principal claimant and his sons escaped and hid at a relative's house for a few hours. When the principal claimant called his wife, she stated police were waiting in front of the house. The principal claimant's wife left the house that night and joined the other claimants to go to Sargodha.\n[16] XXXX and XXXX XXXX married privately in XXXX. She was unable to obtain a visa and went to XXXX while the claimants fled to the United States (U.S.) on XXXX XXXX, 2015.\n[17] The claimant's relatives' was raided by police and their relative was beaten and detained. XXXX uncle, XXXX XXXX, was assaulted and threatened to cooperate with police and XXXX XXXX XXXX. His land was unlawfully occupied and when he made demands for its return in XXXX 2015, he was shot and wounded by XXXX XXXX XXXX associates. The driver was killed.\n[18] The claimants fear that if they return to Pakistan, they will be harmed or killed by the corrupt politicians, their associates and police.\nDETERMINATION\n[19] I find that the claimants are not Convention refugees as they do not have a well-founded fear of persecution related to a Convention ground in Pakistan. I also find that the claimants are not persons in need of protection, in that their removal to Pakistan would not subject them personally to a risk to life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. There are also no substantial grounds to believe that their removal to Pakistan would subject them personally to a danger of torture for the reasons that follow.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[20] The claimants' identities as nationals of Pakistan are established by their testimony and passports in evidence. I am satisfied of their identities by these documents.\nCredibility\n[21] The principal claimant's testimony was articulate and effusive. He was able to discuss his allegations naturally without contradiction or omission and maintained the chronology of events when discussing the allegations in a non-linear fashion. There was one significant exception to this; the principal claimant's testimony faltered and he became reticent and agitated when the issue of the arrest warrants was raised.\n[22] Whereas previously the principal claimant's memory did not fail him and he was confident, on this matter he changed his testimony three times and was hesitant. When asked where he was when he discovered police had issued warrants against him and his family, he testified it was while he was in XXXX. The principal claimant then changed his testimony to state that he was in the U.S. when he became aware of the warrants. The claimant was asked how he learned of the warrants, but did not answer the question directly. When the question was asked a second time, the principal claimant responded by saying he was upset and therefore \"talking here and there,\" but again stated it was in XXXX, ignoring my question about how he made the discovery. When I reminded the principal claimant that he had earlier stated it was in the U.S., he testified he was unsure and that perhaps his son knew. A few moments later, a break was taken. When the principal claimant returned from the break, he testified that he was sure he learned about the warrants in the U.S.\n[23] The issue of where the claimants were when they discovered there were warrants for their arrest is material since the warrants were issued on XXXX XXXX, 2015 - after the claimants had left the country on XXXX XXXX, 2015. As such, the claimants could not have learned about them in Pakistan. It is notable that the principal claimant did not have clarity about where he was when he discovered this, particularly given his sharp memory about other events. A warrant for arrest is significant and implies new and heightened dangers for the claimants, not just in XXXX, but throughout Pakistan and would hamper their ability to travel. An arrest in Pakistan also carries with it the risk of mistreatment and torture in police custody and imprisonment. One would expect this to be disturbing news. It is therefore remarkable that the principal claimant could not reliably recall where he was when he discovered police throughout Pakistan could continue to pursue the family in perpetuity and that the situation would be unlikely to improve. I do not find it credible that the principal claimant could not recall this reliably. This is not the only credibility issue that challenges the warrants.\n[24] Another problem that erodes the principal claimant's credibility on the issue of the arrest warrants is the absence of specific reference to them before the warrants were disclosed into evidence.2 At the time of making their claims at the port of entry, the claimants completed various Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) forms. In the form entitled, \"Schedule 12 Additional Information - Refugee Claimants Inside Canada,\" question 9(a) asks, \"Have you ever been sought, arrested, or detained by the police or military or any other authorities in any country, including Canada? [emphasis added].\" Despite the principal claimant's statement that they learned of the warrants in the U.S., as corroborated later by XXXX XXXX testimony - in other words, before the claimants came to Canada - the principal claimant responded \"No\" to question 9(a), as did the other three claimants.3 This question is followed by 9(b) which asks, \"Have you ever committed or been charged with or convicted of any crime, in any country, including Canada?\" Again, the claimants responded in the negative. If the claimants had warrants issued for their arrest and they knew about them in the U.S., it does not follow that they would fail to reveal this at the time of making their claims when they later came to Canada.\n[25] A third opportunity arose during completion of these forms to disclose their arrest warrants. In question 6(b) of the form entitled, \"Schedule A Background\/Declaration,\" applicants are asked:\n[Have you ever] been convicted of, or are you currently charged with, on trial for, or party to a crime or offence or subject of any criminal proceeding in any other country?4\nAll four claimants responded in the negative.\n[26] The principal claimant was confronted with the contradiction at the hearing. He explained that it was a \"mistake,\" that the interpreter was by phone thereby creating an issue, and the question was not asked in reference to Pakistan. He also stated he may not have understood the question and that it was an error. He further testified that he did not understand the words, \"any country\" to include Pakistan. He also believed the question was asked in relation to terrorism.\n[27] XXXX XXXX testified that he and his family misunderstood the question and that the question was not asked in reference to Pakistan specifically. XXXX XXXX testified that the question was only asked about whether they had actually been arrested.\n[28] I do not find the claimants' explanations to be credible. Pakistan was not excluded by the questions asked. The questions are not ambiguous; they ask whether police are seeking the claimants in any country, or whether they have been charged with a crime in any country. It is unclear to me how this could be understood to exclude Pakistan. While the questions do not limit crimes to terrorism-related offences, neither are there any terrorism questions asked immediately before these questions to create confusion. The principal claimant's sons are university graduates whom I do not find would be likely to struggle to absorb these questions. The claimants' counsel was present to offer the claimants advice if they were unclear about what was being asked in the CIC forms and whether their arrests warrants were relevant. Counsel also signed a third party declaration swearing to accurate assistance in completion of the CIC forms and that the claimants understood the nature and effect of the forms. I have no reason to doubt her declaration.\n[29] If there was concern about a possible problem with the interpreter, the claimants had a duty to raise the issue. There is no evidence before me that anyone did. Phone interpreters are routinely used by the Board in refugee hearings and I do not find that this itself gives rise to an interpretation issue. It should be noted that the two brothers speak English and when XXXX was asked at the hearing to confirm that he did not require an interpreter at the port of entry, he confirmed he did not. Proficiency in English is consistent with university education in Pakistan.5 This makes the misunderstandings more dubious. If there were interpretation concerns about the experience at CIC, this could reasonably be expected to prompt further scrutiny of the completed forms afterwards, triggering notice to the Board of any detected errors. However, the claimants did not notify the Board of any errors. Thus, I do not accept the claimants' explanations as reasonable.\n[30] If the claimants had warrants for their arrest one might also expect this to feature prominently in their port of entry interviews. However, it is not specifically mentioned. The principal claimant made reference to demonstrators being arrested and his daughter-in-law's uncle being arrested after the claimants left the country. He did not refer to his own arrest warrant. XXXX XXXX stated during his interview that they planned to go back if the situation improved, but on XXXX XXXX, 2015 XXXX XXXX driver was killed and XXXX advised them not to go back. During XXXX XXXX interview, he also referenced the arrests of others and indicated that XXXX XXXX told them that police were \"after them,\" but the claimant did not indicate that police had warrants for the claimants' arrest.\n[31] The principal claimant explained that there were interpretation issues and he was not asked about warrants in Pakistan. XXXX XXXX testified that there was a dialect problem with the interpreter. He stated that they were not asked the question directly during the interview. XXXX XXXX testified that the interpreter cut them off and asked them to keep their responses short.\n[32] As discussed, if there were concerns about the quality of interpretation, the dialect, or being cut off, the claimants ought to have raised the issue, sought another interpreter, booked another appointment or notified the Board in advance of errors in the CIC forms. Furthermore, if the claimants had warrants and allege this precludes their return to Pakistan today, it is inconsistent for XXXX XXXX to have stated they had planned a return until XXXX XXXX communicated with them. Planning a return suggests that the warrants did not exist. I do not accept the claimants' explanations as reasonable.\n[33] The interview notes corroborate the answers the claimants gave on the application forms; that there were no warrants. I acknowledge that border interviews are in no way exhaustive; that information recorded by the officers is not necessarily complete, and that it appears that the claimants were not explicitly asked during the interview stage if they had outstanding warrants in Pakistan. Still, with such a significant issue it is reasonable to expect that the arrest warrants would be mentioned and noted. While the interview notes alone do not undermine the claimants' allegations about their warrants, they do not support the claimants either.\n[34] The Basis of Claim form (BOC) lays the foundation or basis for any claim. Ahead of question 2(a), it instructs claimants in bold and capital letters to include everything that is important to the claim. Given that the BOC narrative in this case is very detailed and amounts to five single-spaced pages, one would reasonably expect reference to the allegation that the family is currently subject to arrest warrants. This is particularly so since the BOC asks claimants in question 2(d) to explain why they could not live in another part of the country. The claimants maintain the warrants are mentioned. But, the reference to warrants is not a strong one. The narrative states that during a \"raid\" police came to the claimants' [relatives'] home in XXXX with a warrant and detained someone, but it is unclear whether it was a search warrant to raid the place, or an arrest warrant and for whom. It is not made clear that the claimants continue to be officially wanted by authorities. This is not itself determinative, but is significant when taken with other findings.\n[35] The arrest warrants are material for reasons already discussed. When the issue above is taken together with all of the other credibility issues pertaining to the warrants, they damage the claimants' credibility surrounding the nature of the threat against them and undermine the authenticity of the warrant documents in evidence. Fraudulent documents are commonplace in Pakistan. The European Asylum Support Office (EASO) writes:\nIn Transparency International's corruption perceptions index of 2014, Pakistan is placed 126 out of 175 countries and scores 26 for public sector corruption, putting it in the index's red zone for highly corrupt countries. High levels of corruption are reported among Pakistani authorities and are called a persistent problem. For example, police officers took bribes for registering genuine or false complaints. Corruption is said to be part of the political culture in Pakistan and cannot be ruled out in the short term...\nIt was reported that NADRA officials were taking bribes for the issuance of documents. People were being asked to pay to get their documents within days, otherwise they would have to wait for months... There was also reporting on NADRA staff taking bribes for the issuance of ID cards to militants, or for issuing fake ID cards to foreigners...6\n[36] A Response to Information Request (RIR) in evidence indicates that the availability of fraudulent documents is \"widespread\" and \"fraud and forgery\" are \"very strong industries in Pakistan\" where it is \"very easy\" to obtain fraudulent documents.7 Identification documents, medical documents, banks records, academic records and certificates, newspaper articles, as well as law enforcement documents such as First Information Reports (FIRs) are among the types available. This is supported by the Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.8\n[37] Given the serious credibility problems surrounding the warrants and the prevalence of fraudulent documents in Pakistan, I find that the warrants are not genuine. The remaining documents are insufficient to overcome this assessment; in my view the false arrest warrants discredit the claimants' remaining documents in evidence, including witness statements and news articles. As stated, the evidence supports the fact that fraudulent documents of many kinds are widespread in Pakistan and very easily obtained. In this particular case, the widespread availability of fraudulent documents combined with a lack of credibility and previous finding of false warrants is sufficient to apply no weight to the claimants' remaining documents.9\n[38] Overall, I accept that three of the claimants ran a XXXX centre and were threatened to close it by the politicians and those acting on their behalf. I recognize that these people used violence to persuade the claimants. I also accept that the claimants took part in a protest against these politicians and escaped when police broke it up. The claimants' testimony was credible on these points. However, I find that there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that these agents of persecution\/harm are trying to have the claimants arrested, or would continue to pursue the claimants if they moved to another location, as will be discussed below.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[39] I find that the claimants could live safely in other parts of Pakistan, such as Hyderabad, without a serious possibility of persecution or a risk of harm, on a balance of probabilities.\n[40] The claimants testified that they could not relocate in Pakistan because of the warrants for their arrest. They argued that when they attempted to register in Hyderabad, police there would discover their warrants by checking with XXXX police and would arrest them. Of course, the claimants were unable to credibly prove the existence of the warrants and I have found that the documents in evidence are not genuine. Therefore, I do not find that warrants preclude the claimants' relocation.\n[41] At the hearing, the principal claimant was asked whether, before the opening of the XXXX centre, he had had any problems with the police, maulvi, or MPA and MNA, to which he stated \"not at all.\" The principal claimant explained that in 2013 they had tried to garner his support during election time, but he had declined. He testified that before the XXXX centre, there had been no confrontations. The XXXX centre, the origin of the conflict, is now closed. As such, I find it unlikely that the claimants' agents of persecution\/harm would pursue the claimants on this basis because the politicians accomplished what they sought to do.\n[42] The principal claimant testified that his efforts to rally support against the MPA and MNA and the claimants' participation in the protest (where drug trade involvement by the politicians was alleged) are also the basis for a continued threat. However, I note that any political activity by the claimants prior to the XXXX centre did not engender conflict with these politicians. The political activity afterwards (starting in May 2015), including the protest, while incendiary was short-lived. The claimants are not voicing opposition to the politicians and have not for over six months. I find that their political profile is not sufficiently high to motivate these politicians to make an example of them after the fact. By remaining outside of XXXX district, any threat they may have posed has been disposed of. The claimants have vacated the area and not returned; they abandoned their property and are no longer rallying against these politicians. Neither are they trying to reclaim their land as they allege XXXX XXXX did. In my view, the claimants do not pose a long-term threat, are lower-profile and therefore, I find it unlikely that the MPA and MNA and those acting on their behalf would be motivated to pursue the claimants in Hyderabad, over 1,000 kilometres away and among six million residents.\n[43] I also do not find it likely that the politicians would be alerted to the claimants' relocation to Hyderabad. The evidence indicates that there is little in the way of police sharing of information across jurisdictions except in high profile cases.10 In addition, there is overwhelming evidence that political interference in the police force is a problem and political leaders use the police as a tool for their own gains.11 Whereas the PML-N has a stronghold in Punjab, this is not the case in Hyderabad where the Pakistani Peoples Party (PPP) governs. Sindh is this party's electoral base.12 I therefore find it unlikely that the claimants would experience problems from police in Sindh because of trouble with PML-N politicians in XXXX.\n[44] There is also insufficient evidence of police registration requirements in the documentary evidence. Any possible anti-terrorism checks do not infer that Hyderabad police would contact XXXX police, as opposed to checks with centralized intelligence agencies. If there were requirements for police in Hyderabad to check with police in XXXX on relocation, as alleged, I would expect this to be referenced in documents which normally address such issues. However, the U.S. Department of State (DOS) human rights report, which discusses freedom of movement, and the Home Office, who addresses internal relocation and mobility issues, as well as EASO's section on migration, displacement and internal mobility and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) are silent.13 The DOS terrorism report details counter-terrorism procedures and discusses centralized information sharing, but does not refer to localized police checks.\n[45] The Home Office refers to various sources in discussing relocation. One source states:\nBecause of Pakistan's size and diversity, internal relocation offers a degree of\nanonymity and the opportunity for victims to seek refuge from discrimination or violence. In most cases, there are options available for members of most ethnic and religious minorities to be able to relocate to areas of relative safety elsewhere in Pakistan. In particular, many large urban centres are home to mixed ethnic and religious communities and offer greater opportunities for employment, access to services and a greater degree of state protection than other areas.14\n[46] I also find that relocating to Hyderabad is reasonable for the claimants in these circumstances. This sizable city does not suffer from the severity of violence by which other cities such Karachi or even Lahore, and more particularly rural areas, are afflicted.15 Although residents are mainly Sindhi speakers, there is also a large Punjabi population and many languages are spoken in Hyderabad, contrary the principal claimant's assertion. Regardless, learning a new language and adjusting to a different culture is not unreasonable. Hyderabad is the capital of Sindh Province and an important business centre where a variety of industries operate. It is a major commercial centre for the agricultural produce in the region. The claimants are experienced in agriculture. The principal claimant has a high school education and his sons both hold university degrees. I find it likely that the sons would be able to sustain the family in Hyderabad.\nCONCLUSION\n[47] Having considered all of the evidence, I find that the claimants are not Convention refugees as set out in section 96, or persons in need of protection within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the Act. Their claims are therefore denied.\n(signed)\n\"Preeti Adhopia\"\nPreeti Adhopia\nMarch 1, 2016\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibit 6, pp. 11-12, 15-16; Exhibit 7, pp. 2-3, 6-7, 10-11, 14-15; Exhibit 8, pp. 2-3, 6-7.\n3 Exhibit 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 (Schedule 12, IMM 0008, question 9(a)).\n4 Exhibit 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 (Schedule A, IMM 5669, question 6(b)).\n5 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP), Pakistan, July 17, 2015, Item 2.2.\n6 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 2.2.\n7 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 3.6.\n8 Exhibit 3, NDP, Item 1.12.\n9 Nasim, Babar v.

She went to live in the Bahamas with her parents around 2004, when she was around seven years old. She remained there as a temporary resident until 2012. In 2012, the claimant and her mother made a visit to Haiti. During their stay, the claimant's mother was raped in the presence of the claimant. The assault was not reported to the Haitian police.\n[2] The claimant left Haiti and went to the United States in XXXX of 2012. She lived with an aunt and uncle in the United States, while her parents returned to the Bahamas, where they still reside. The claimant remained in Florida after her visa expired in XXXX, 2013, and came to Canada in 2016 to seek refugee protection. The claimant did not ask for asylum during her stay in the United States.\n[3] The claimant states that there is no state protection for her in Haiti, and that there is no place in Haiti where she can be safe from her alleged persecutors.\nCREDIBILITY\nDelay in claiming and failing to claim elsewhere\n[4] Other than her apparent lack of subjective fear, which is discussed at length below, the claimant was generally credible, and her oral testimony was largely consistent with her Basis of Claim (BOC). The panel accepts in particular that the claimant was present in 2012 in Haiti when her mother was sexually assaulted in the presence of the claimant.\n[5] The 'delay' in this case is in failing to make a claim in the US for four years (2012-2016), and then leaving the US, a signatory to the Refugee Convention1, and a safe third country, to come to Canada, where she also did not have status to enter or remain. It is not merely the delay in claiming by failing to claim in the US and coming to Canada that is decisive in the eyes of the panel, but also the claimant's explanation or lack thereof that is of concern.\n[6] The panel appreciates that this is a young woman with a high school education who was dependent on others for advice and support, such as her parents, who were largely absent throughout her high school years as they lived in the Bahamas and visited her in Florida once a year. The claimant also depended on her uncle and aunt with whom she was living in Florida, who had a vested interest in keeping her uninformed about her options so that they could exploit her for her cheap labour (babysitting, cooking, and cleaning). Finally, there was the social worker at the school attended by the claimant who appears to have taken a genuine interest in the well-being of the claimant and who made serious efforts to assist the claimant in obtaining status in the US after her US visa had run out. The testimony does not establish that the claimant made a claim in Canada because she sensed that she required protection, but the claimant only came to Canada after her educational options in the US were foreclosed. Mr. Justice Hughes held in Stojmenovic2 that \"a refugee claim should not be looked at simply as one of many choices as to how best to seek status in Canada.\"\n[7] The claimant's permit to remain and study in the United States expired in XXXX of 20133. The claimant turned eighteen years of age in XXXX of 2015. The claimant graduated from XXXX XXXXHigh School in XXXX XXXX, Florida, on XXXX XXXX, 20164. The claimant arrived at a Canadian port of entry on XXXX XXXX, 2016, with the intention of coming to Canada to further her education, and not intending to seek protection.\n[8] Claimant's counsel urges the tribunal to take into account that many of the decisions which placed the claimant in the situation in which she finds herself were decisions made by the claimant's parents or her guardians when the claimant was a minor. The claimant, when she was a child, should therefore not have attributed to her the responsibility for failing to claim protection in the United States or for waiting until she was 19 years of age before seeking protection, even though she claims to have been in fear of persecution since the age of fifteen. The tribunal accepts that the claimant should not be blamed for failing to claim asylum in the United States during the time she was a minor. After attaining adulthood in XXXX of 2015, however, the claimant remained a further fifteen months in the United States without making a claim for protection.\n[9] After she completed high school in the state of Florida, the claimant found that she could not pursue university studies there because her visa had expired and she was no longer in status. The claimant travelled from Florida to Canada with her uncle, her aunt, and their children. The purpose of the trip to Canada, according to the claimant in her testimony, was to seek a place where she could pursue her education. It had not occurred to her to make a claim for protection until she arrived at the Canada-US border and her uncle told her to make a refugee claim.\n[10] Counsel urged the panel to find that the claimant is not required to seek protection from the authorities in Haiti because, among other reasons, \"to impose on a sexually molested child an obligation to seek protection from state authorities where her mother herself does not is, to say the least, disturbing\"5.\n[11] The subjective fear experienced by a claimant represents the fear of harm in the mind of the claimant. The objective basis requires that there be a valid basis for the fear.6 Both subjective fear and an objective basis for it are crucial elements for a claim to succeed. In Kamana,7 Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer held that the panel's finding that the claimant had not credibly established the subjective element was reasonable and:\nThe lack of evidence going to the subjective element of the claim is a fatal flaw which in and of itself warrants dismissal of the claim, since both elements of the refugee definition-subjective and objective-must be met.\n[12] While in the United States, and after she had reached adulthood, the claimant had not sought legal counsel or even conducted research into how she could avoid going back to Haiti with any urgency. She claims that she feared being deported to Haiti by US authorities during the entire time when she was without status in the United States, namely from XXXX 2013 until her departure from the United States in 2016. The claimant was at risk of being picked up at any time after the expiry of her visa in XXXX 2013 and being deported to Haiti, and she did nothing to prevent it other than to leave for Canada in 2016. In other words, she and the adults in charge of her life did nothing to arrange for her protection for nearly three years. The claimant herself did nothing to protect herself from being deported back to Haiti for some thirteen months after she became an adult.\n[13] Failing to apply for refugee status in a foreign state is a factor the Board is entitled to consider in assessing the applicant's subjective fear. The claimant failed to provide sufficient credible and trustworthy subjective evidence to support her claim. The panel found her testimony and her evidence to be lacking in credibility with respect to her having failed to make a refugee claim in the United States. As a result, the panel finds that the claimant lacks subjective fear. As such, her testimony is not credible.\nPersons in need of protection - Section 97\n[14] Having rejected the claim under Section 96, the panel must assess the claim on the basis of Section 97 of the Act. In order to establish her claim under Section 97, the claimant must establish that, on a balance of probabilities, she would be tortured, or at risk of losing their life or being subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if she returned to Haiti.\n[15] Based on the documentary evidence before the panel, being a victim of crime and violence at the hand of gangs in Haiti is a day-to-day risk faced by citizens and residents throughout Haiti. The documents in the National Documentation Package (NDP) make this clear. A document in the NDP cites sources that report that kidnappings for ransom are the main source of insecurity in Haiti. This type of violence has been common since 2004 and is a relatively efficient means under current country conditions for criminals to get rich quickly. Kidnappers in Haiti generally act opportunistically and do not choose their victims according to race, gender, or age. Anyone who appears to be wealthy risks being a victim of kidnapping for ransom. Some sources point to victims being the wealthy. Other sources point to the threat of kidnapping effecting street vendors, and even children whose parents are then extorted. Another document in the NDP has information from a source that reports that the victims of gang violence include people leaving parties, receptions and restaurants late at night. However, some kidnappings are also carried out on streets in broad daylight. Children arriving and leaving from school were also targeted.\nWhile Haitian women face violence and rape, these dangers posed by criminals and criminal gangs in Haiti are of an apolitical nature8. The nature of the risk to this claimant is that the claimant is a possible future victim of criminality at the hands of individuals or gangs in Haiti which is a risk faced generally by nearly all residents of Haiti.\n[16] The risk alleged by the applicants is a random risk shared by everyone who lives in their country; it does not personally or particularly target the applicants. The situation that the applicants fear is no different from that faced by other individuals from El Salvador; therefore, they do not qualify as persons in need of protection, as set out by subparagraph 97(1)(b)(ii) of the Act.\n[17] The panel notes that the Federal Court has held that victims of crime, corruption9 or vendettas10 generally fail to establish a link between their fear of persecution and one of the Convention grounds in the definition of Convention refugee. The Immigration and Refugee board (IRB) has been upheld in its finding of lack of nexus, where the claimant was a target of a personal vendetta11, or where the claimant was a victim of crime12.\n[18] The panel finds that it is more probable than not that the claimant would not face a danger of torture, or a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, if she were to return to Haiti.\n[19] The risk alleged by the applicant is a random risk shared by everyone who lives in her country; it does not personally or particularly target the applicant. The situation that the applicant fears is no different from that faced by other individuals from her country; therefore, The Panel finds that the claimant has not provided sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that she would be tortured, or at risk of losing her life or being subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if she returned to Haiti.\n[20] The panel finds that the claimant has not established her claim under Section 97. Given the finding of a lack of credibility on the part of the claimant, the panel finds that it is more probable than not that the claimant would not face a danger of torture, or a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nCONCLUSION\n[21] The violence feared by the applicant arises from general criminal activity in Haiti, and not the discriminatory targeting of women in particular. The harm feared is criminal in nature and has no nexus to the Convention refugee definition.\n[22] In addition, there are no substantial grounds to believe that the removal of this claimant to Haiti would subject her personally to a danger of torture. The panel therefore rejects her claim under Sections 96 and 97 of the Act.\n[23] In light of the findings of the panel with respect to the lack of subjective fear of the claimant, the Board finds that the claimant has not satisfied her burden of establishing that there is a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground or that, on a balance of probabilities, she would be personally subjected to a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture if she were to return to Haiti.\n[24] The panel concludes that the claimant is not a Convention Refugee, nor is she a person in need of protection, and the Division rejects her claim.\n(signed)\n\"R.

Lonardi - Documents Only\nConseil du (de la) ministre\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] The claimants are XXXX and XXXX XXXX. They seek refugee protection against Afghanistan pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] Where this decision makes reference to \"the claimant,\" that means the principal claimant XXXX XXXX unless otherwise stated.\n[3] The claimants are sisters. The principal claimant, XXXX, worked as a XXXX for an XXXX called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. She was the principal agent for establishing the XXXX in Afghanistan. XXXX was involved with bringing XXXX Afghan children to the United States for XXXX XXXX. The claimant helped organize the trips, liaise with American authorities and the military, and she travelled to the United States herself. XXXX and the other siblings all volunteered with XXXX. Commencing in 2011, children and families who travelled to the U.S. for XXXX XXXX through XXXX efforts were subject to Taliban abductions. Since 2012, the claimants and their family have been targeted by the Taliban because of their work with XXXX. They received numerous death threats via telephone.\n[4] After the threats started, the claimants commenced studying in the United States (XXXX commencing in 2012 and XXXX commencing in 2013). On various occasions during their summer breaks, they returned to Afghanistan. In XXXX 2015, the Taliban targeted them again for having been \"Westernized\" at American schools. The claimant XXXX was the subject of an attempted abduction in XXXX 2015. The family received a threat letter in XXXX 2015. At the end of the claimants' school year in 2016, the claimants came to Canada and sought protection here. The claimants fear returning to Afghanistan as Westernized and educated women who have had extensive involvement with Western institutions and have faced threats from the Taliban because of it. They came to the Canadian border on XXXX XXXX, 2016 and signed their Basis of Claim (\"BOC\") forms on July 26, 2016.\n[5] The Minister has intervened in writing only on the basis of credibility. The Minister alleges that:\na. The claimant XXXX provided contradictory information to CBSA officers about her schooling in the United States, and these contradictions undermine the credibility of this claim as a whole.\nDETERMINATION AND REASONS\n[6] The panel took into consideration The Chairperson's Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution when considering the process of the hearing and the facts in this case.2 All relevant factors, such as social and cultural context in which the principal claimant found herself, along with the issue of state protection and changing country conditions were examined with consideration of the Chairperson's Gender Guidelines.\nIdentity\n[7] The identity of the claimants was established on the basis of their passports and tazkiras which were seized by the Minister.\nCredibility\n[8] This claim is not credible and it is dismissed. The panel makes this finding for the following reasons:\na. On a balance of probabilities, the panel does not find the threats alleged to be credible.\nb. The claimants' reavailment to Afghanistan was without reasonable explanation and severely undermines their allegation that they faced any threat or risk in Afghanistan.\nc. The claimants failed to seek protection in the United States without reasonable explanation and despite having ample opportunity to do so.\nd. Other family members have failed to flee.\ne. The panel makes these findings despite clear evidence of the claimants' work with the XXXX XXXX, their education in the United States, and the national documentation package which supports their profile as Taliban targets. While these are supporting factors, they do not overcome the negative inferences the panel has drawn as outlined above.\nANALYSIS\nThe Threats Alleged Were Not Credible\n[9] The threats alleged by the claimants were described in their testimony as follows.\n[10] Commencing in 2011, children who attended for XXXX XXXX in the United States and their families were targeted for abductions by the Taliban. This was still continuing at the time the claimant left Afghanistan in XXXX 2012. During that time, the claimant was aware of approximately 10 children and their families who had been affected by abductions. The claimants learned of these abductions because relatives and families of the children would call and tell them what had occurred. Abducted children were being tortured and revealing information about XXXX and the claimant. The claimant was certain that the Taliban knew about her. She was certain that if she went out without covering her face, the Taliban would certainly know who she was. The claimant and XXXX were able to hide their whereabouts from the Taliban well, which included moving the XXXX office to a new location. The claimant also explained that they were somewhat safer where they lived because it was close to the U.S. Embassy. The phone calls threats started in 2012 and were directed at the claimant and her entire family. They were coming twice per week up until she left Afghanistan. When the claimant and XXXX returned to Afghanistan in the summer of 2015, the Taliban renewed their threats with further phone calls. Both claimants and their father were receiving phone calls. In XXXX 2015, when XXXX was returning from the U.S. Embassy, approximately two blocks from her house, two men in a black vehicle attempted to put her into the car. She started screaming, and the attackers fled when crowds of people started to gather. On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015 the family received a threat letter describing that there would be no further chances.\n[11] On a balance of probabilities, the panel does not find the allegations of these threats to be credible as alleged. The claimant and XXXX were the targets of the Taliban threats. The phone calls were coming twice per week for several months, allegedly, so it could not be said that the Taliban were merely making suggestions that the claimants stop what they were doing. It is not credible that the children were being abducted and tortured, while the claimant and XXXX managed to evade harm with mere phone call threats. It is not credible that the Taliban had no knowledge of the claimant's whereabouts and the location of the XXXX organization. It is not credible that residing close to the U.S. Embassy made the claimant and her family any safer. That allegation is undermined when XXXX herself was abducted only blocks from the Embassy. The Taliban managed to torture children and their families into revealing the claimant's and XXXX phone numbers, and the claimant was certain that the Taliban could have recognized her by appearance. It is not credible that the Taliban could know all this information about XXXX and the claimant, but fail to know enough to carry out an attack against the family or XXXX directly, all the while viciously torturing the children. Counsel in submissions argued that the children were the easy targets, but the panel sees no reason to think that would have been the case. The panel finds it probable that the Taliban could have, and would have, targeted the claimant and XXXX directly if this allegation was credible. After all, they were the alleged targets of the Taliban, not the children.\n[12] The significance of this finding is that the claimants were not likely targeted by the Taliban as alleged, which was the primary basis for their refugee claim.\n[13] Furthermore, whereas the threat against the claimant and XXXX lacks credibility, all of the events that occurred thereafter also thereby lack credibility, as it is the claimant's involvement with XXXX which was the alleged catalyst for the Taliban originally turning their attention to this family. The credibility of all subsequent events also lack credibility. That finding applies specifically to the threat letter allegedly received on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and the alleged abduction attempt of XXXX in XXXX 2015.\n[14] That finding aside, in and of itself, the abduction narrative is also lacking in credibility. It is not credible that the Taliban would remain without knowledge of the family's address or whereabouts for years, and then suddenly resume their threats when the claimants came back in 2015 and be able to track and follow XXXX during a trip to the U.S. Embassy. The panel places little weight in the abduction attempt narrative and finds it not credible.\n[15] With respect to the threat letter, the panel has no reason on the face of the letter to discredit it. However, the findings above with respect to the circumstances surrounding the letter negatively impact its credibility. The panel places little weight on the letter and does not find it a reliable source to draw a positive finding regarding the alleged threat. The panel's finding regarding the letter is supported by documentary evidence which suggests that false Taliban threat letters are available for purchase in Afghanistan.3 This fact increases the probability that the threat letter is not credible.\nReavailment and Failure to Claim\n[16] The claimant attended school in the United States commencing in the fall of 2012. She worked during the summers, often on campus, and lived with friends during her summers. She travelled back to Afghanistan once between XXXX and XXXX 2015.\n[17] XXXX attended school in the United States commencing in the fall of 2013. She returned home during the summer of 2014 and 2015.\n[18] The reavailment of both claimants to Afghanistan is significant because it suggests that they had no subjective fear of returning to Afghanistan. Further, it suggests that the risk and harm alleged is not credible. Reavailment is not an action characteristic of a genuine refugee fearing persecution, nor of a person in need of protection.\n[19] The claimant explained that she originally went to study in the United States for the opportunity and for her own security to flee the Taliban. She returned to Afghanistan because she wished to visit her family. Her father was ill, and she felt that the situation may have improved since 2012.\n[20] XXXX explained that when XXXX was receiving phone call threats in 2012, she understood the threats to be directed at the entire family. She herself worked for XXXX in 2011 and 2012. Whereas the claimant was able to reside with friends and work during the summers, XXXX could not. She had to return to Afghanistan during the summers because she had nowhere else to go.\n[21] The panel rejects these explanations from the claimants. There was no supporting evidence that their father was ill, but even if there had been, it may not necessarily justify the claimants' return to Afghanistan for two months. Two months is not an insignificant or transitory amount of time. It demonstrates an intention to re-establish one's life in the country, even if temporarily before returning for school. The panel finds that the claimants' return to Afghanistan was voluntary and without concern for the alleged threat they faced. The claimant explained that she had followed the news about Afghanistan, so the panel does not find her explanation credible that she felt things in Afghanistan would be more settled or safer for her. The UNHCR Guidelines explains that the year 2015 saw the Taliban gain more control and influence throughout Afghanistan than at any time since 2001.4 While the claimant may not have been aware of the Guidelines, she was a well-educated woman who followed the news and would have known to make even cursory investigations about current safety in Afghanistan.\nFailure to Claim in the United States\n[22] With respect to XXXX allegation that she had nowhere in the United States to stay during the summers and had to reavail herself, this begs the question and leads to the next point, which is that XXXX could have resolved that concern by claiming protection in the United States. Neither claimant sought protection in the United States despite having ample opportunity to do so. The United States is a democratic country and signatory to the Convention. Both of these claimants resided in the United States for long periods of time while attending school. They would have been familiar with residing in the United States, so the panel places little weight in their explanation that they had family in Canada but none in the United States. While they may have fallen under an exception to the Safe Third Country Agreement, the circumstances suggest that they had ample opportunity and reason to seek protection in the United States, but failed to do so where they reasonably should have. Their failure to claim undermines their allegation that they fear persecution and that they are persons in need of protection.\n[23]\nThe panel took no issue with the claimants as employees of the XXXX XXXX or with their allegations as having been educated in the United States. The panel found the claimants allegations of working for XXXX and their education to be credible and well supported. The panel has considered the documentary evidence which places the claimants in no less than three high-risk target profile groups: being educated females, Westernized, and working for an XXXX dedicated to Afghanistan's improvement and development.5 The panel notes that both claimants testified in fluent English without the aid of an interpreter.\n[24] However, those positive findings are not sufficient to overcome the severe credibility findings made by this panel with regards to the alleged threat they faced, their re-availment, and their failure to claim in the United States. Simply belonging to a high-risk profile does not make one a refugee. The threat must exist to the claimant, and the claimant must have taken demonstrable steps to avail themselves of protection when they had the opportunity to do so. These claimants have not demonstrated a credible threat to themselves as they have resided in the United States for several years without seeking protection, and they have re-availed themselves to their country of alleged persecution.\nCONCLUSION\n[25] For all of these reasons, the panel finds that this claim is not credible. The claimants do not have a well-founded fear, and there is no serious possibility of persecution if they returned to Afghanistan. They are not Convention refugees. The claimants have not demonstrated, on a\nbalance of probabilities, that there is a risk to their lives, cruel or unusual treatment or punishment, or torture. They are not persons in need of protection. This claim is dismissed.\n(signed)\n\" Daniel McKeown \"\nDaniel McKeown\nSeptember 26, 2016\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96, 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b).\n2 Guideline 4, Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution: Update, Guidelines Issued by the Chairperson Pursuant to Section 65(3) of the Immigration Act, IRB, Ottawa, November 25, 1996, as continued in effect by the Chairperson on June 28, 2002, under the authority found in section 159(1)(h) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n3 National Documentation Package (NDP) for Afghanistan version 29 April 2016, Item NDP 7.10 at page 12.\n4 NDP Item 1.5 at page 10.\n5 NDP item 1.5 at pages 38, 41, and 62.\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRPD.29.1 (August 31, 2012)\nRPD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SPR : TB6-09209\nTB6-09208\n",

He was introduced to Falun Gong by his friend XXXX XXXX who said Falun Gong had helped with his health.\n[4] The claimant joined a group practice in XXXX 2015 which was raided by the PSB (Public Security Bureau) on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2016. The claimant fled the practice site and went into hiding with a friend.\n[5] While in hiding, he learned that the PSB went to his home on XXXX XXXX, 2016 seeking to arrest him. He learned that the PSB continued to go to his home seeking to arrest him.\n[6] With the help of a smuggler, the claimant left China XXXX XXXX, 2016.\n[7] The clamant fears PSB officials will arrest him because he is a Falun Gong practitioner.\nANALYSIS\n[8] The determinative issue in this case is credibility.\nIDENTITY\n[9] The claimant's identity as a national of China is established through testimony and the supporting documentation filed, namely, a copy of the biometrics page of his Chinese passport1 and a copy of his Resident Identity Card.2\nCREDIBILITY\n[10] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true unless there is valid reason to doubt their veracity. The determination as to whether a claimant's evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities. Having considered the claimant's testimony, the panel has credibility concerns as outlined below.\nClaimant's passport\n[11] The claimant alleges that because his Falun Gong practice group was discovered, the PSB want to arrest him. He indicates that he went into hiding on XXXX XXXX, 2016 and that after he did this, the PSB went to his home looking for him.\n[12] The claimant testified that he obtained the passport he used to travel to Canada in XXXX 2016. He stated that he had a passport before that he used to travel to Russia but it expired so he needed a new one.\n[13] The panel asked how he obtained the XXXX 2016 passport and he stated that he exchanged his previous passport. The panel asked where he did this and he said at the local PSB office. The panel asked what documents he gave in order to get the new passport and he said his resident card. The panel asked what else and he then said that he was not present and that he paid someone to do that for him. The panel asked who performed that service for him and he said he did not know the person.\n[14] The panel notes that according to Chinese law, citizens must apply for ordinary passports in person to the PSB and must sign the applications on site:\nA citizen who intends to go abroad for non-official purposes, such as residing, visiting relatives, studying, working, travelling or engaging in business activities, shall apply in person for an ordinary passport to the entry-exit control department of the public security organ under the people's government at or above the country level where his residence is registered.\n[...]\nThe Xinhua News Agency reports that the procedure of applying for new biometric passports remains the same as the process to apply for a traditional passport, with the exception that applicants aged 16 or over will be fingerprinted and must provide their signature (4 May 2012). Similarly, People's Daily Online writes that the conditions, time limit, and charge for applying for the ordinary epassport are [the] same as those of the past [but in the course of applying] the procedures of collecting the applicant's finger prints and the applicant signing [his or her] name on site are added.3\n[15] The evidence also indicates that applications for biometric passports require applicants to provide fingerprints:\nAccording to the identity document-checking service operated by Keesing Reference Systems, China's national passport with \"contactless chip\" was first issued in February 2012. Sources report that China began issuing biometric passports nationwide in May 2012. The passports are issued by the Ministry of Public Security. According to China Daily, an English-language daily newspaper based in Beijing, \"[s]tarting May 15 [2012], new applicants will get e-passports after storing thumb fingerprints and signatures.\" In correspondence with the Research Directorate, an official at the Embassy of China in Ottawa indicated that as of January 2015, all new passports issued by China are biometric e-passports, and non-biometric passports are no longer issued. According to sources, old non-biometric passports can still be used for travel, if they are still valid.4\n[16] The panel notes the formal procedure and security requirements citizens must comply with before a passport is issued. The panel finds on balance that the claimant was required to appear in person at the PSB office in order to obtain a passport. The panel draws a negative credibility inference from the claimant's testimony that he paid a stranger to obtain his passport for him. The panel prefers the objective evidence to the claimant's testimony and finds on balance that he would not be able to obtain a biometric passport without attending the PSB office in person.\n[17] The panel notes further that the passport was obtained in the claimant's home province of Jilin5 on XXXX XXXX, 2016. After the claimant testified about going into hiding at XXXX XXXX house in Sichuan Province on XXXX XXXX, 2016 the panel asked whether he returned to his home province of Jilin at any time following the raid. He said no.\n[18] The panel then asked how he obtained a passport in Jilin if he was in hiding in Sichuan at the time. The claimant then stated that his wife provided the unknown person with the required documents. The panel then noted that earlier in the hearing, the claimant testified that he provided his identity document to an unknown person who then obtained his passport for him.\n[19] The panel stated to the claimant that in previous testimony, he failed to say that it was his wife who gave the identity documents to the unknown person who obtained the passport. The claimant responded that the panel did not ask him. While it is true that the panel did not ask the claimant whether it was his wife who gave his identity documents to this person to obtain a passport, the panel notes that the claimant testified that he gave his documents to this person who obtained the passport for him. The claimant did not mention his wife's involvement until the panel asked how he obtained his passport in Jilin if he was at the time living in Sichuan. The panel draws a negative credibility inference from the claimant's failure to state when first asked that his wife was involved in obtaining the passport.\n[20] The panel notes further that the claimant obtained a passport after he was wanted for arrest. The panel notes the documentary evidence which indicates that criminal suspects are required to surrender their travel documents:\n1.1 Criminal Suspects under Residential Surveillance\nThe 2012 amendments to the Criminal Procedure Law of the People's Republic of China, which entered into effect 1 January 2013, stipulate that a [translation] \"suspect or a defendant under residential surveillance should comply with ... provisions which require him ... to surrender his passport or other border crossing documents, and identification documents and driver certificates, to the enforcement authority,\" among other obligations.6\n[21] The panel finds, on balance, that a new travel document would therefore not be issued to the claimant if he were indeed wanted for arrest.\n[22] The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant obtained his own genuine passport in XXXX 2016 because he was not fearful of nor wanted by Chinese authorities and the panel draws a negative credibility inference.\nTravel out of China\n[23] The claimant testified that he presented his passport in order to travel through Beijing airport and he stated that he provided it to officials.\n[24] The documentary evidence also indicates that passports are examined more than once for international travel at airports in China:\nIn correspondence with the Research Directorate, an assistant director responsible for aviation security and facilitation at the International Air Transport Association (IATA) indicated that, to the best of the source's knowledge, the departure procedure at airports in China seems to involve three steps: 1) check-in; 2) immigration; and 3) security (IATA 29 Mar. 2015). To the best of the source's knowledge, [a]t all three locations, passengers are required to show their passports. Usually, at check-in, [Advanced Passenger Information System, APIS] info are input, manually or through [the] passport [machine-readable zone, MRZ by scanning]; at immigration by physical inspection, and at security checkpoint by matching passport info with boarding card for verification, either using barcode readers on boarding pass or just a visual check (with a stamp on boarding pass). 7\n[25] The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant did not have difficulty passing through Beijing airport's many security checks because he was not wanted by authorities.\n[26] The panel notes the documentary evidence concerning the efficiency of Chinese authorities and the presence of the Golden Shield Project. The panel finds that if the claimant was indeed wanted for arrest, he would then have been discovered by authorities when he left China on XXXX XXXX, 2016 using his own passport to travel from Beijing to Toronto, as he testified that he did.\n[27] The panel notes from the documentary evidence that authorities control the exits of citizens and that criminal fugitives are flagged in the country's national computer network of policing.\n[28] The documentary evidence indicates that PSB monitors citizens' exits from China and that an individual wanted by the PSB would be noted in the computer database:\nThe current documentary evidence states that airport authorities are connected to Policenet, a PSB database of persons wanted by authorities:\nIn 10 February 2014 correspondence with the Research Directorate, the Executive Director of the Dui Hua Foundation affirmed that airport security officials have access to the Public Security Bureau of China's online database of citizens who have been convicted of crimes or are wanted by the authorities [also known as Policenet or the Golden Shield]. Similarly, the representative of the Laogai Research Foundation stated that reports on \"experiences of activists who have been detained while trying to board an international flight provide clear evidence that airport officials are connected to Policenet\" (26 Feb. 2014). A colleague of Cao Shunli, who was also prevented from travelling to Geneva for the human rights training in September 2013, later publicized her own experience at the airport in Guangdong (HRIC 11 Oct. 2013). According to the Laogai Research Foundation, the colleague indicates that when her passport was swiped by airport authorities, scanning equipment immediately made noises alerting airport officials that she was wanted by police. She was subsequently detained in the Guangdong Baiyun Airport and told that Shanghai police would not let her leave. She was then transported from Guangdong to Shanghai for detention and questioning. This woman's experience provides concrete evidence of airport officials coordinating with police departments in tracking and detaining a political dissident.\n[...]\nThe representative of the Laogai Research Foundation wrote that the Chinese government checks the passports of citizens attempting to leave the country in order to ensure that they are suitable for foreign travel. Customs officials stamp the passports of citizens approved for foreign travel. Public security officials often confiscate passports held by individuals deemed unsuitable for foreign travel. 8\n[29] The panel notes the claimant's testimony that he believes the smuggler made arrangements to get him out of the country but prefers the documentary evidence which indicates that citizens' exits from China are closely monitored:\nThe representative of the Laogai Research Foundation provided the following information:\n[T]he Golden Shield incorporates extensive tracking and control mechanisms such as real-name online registration requirements, GPS monitoring, and facial recognition surveillance technology in a multipronged approach to identify potentially disruptive individuals. Policenet, a component of the Golden Shield, stores a wealth of information on Chinese citizens and connects the various agencies and levels of command within the public security apparatus. This integrated system enables Chinese public security forces to effectively target and neutralize political dissidents.\nIn partial corroboration, the Chinese economist writing in Open Magazine affirms that \"Cisco's Policenet has been helping the [Chinese Communist Party]'s public security organs to ferret out political dissidents and Falun Gong practitioners for years.\"\nAn undated article on the website of the Ministry of Public Security, entitled \"Deepening the Implementation of the 'Golden Shield' Project,\" indicates that all police units nationwide have access to eight public security databases, including the \"National Basic Population Information Database\" (China n.d.). Also accessible through the databases is information on household registration [hukou], border exit and entry, road traffic, and criminal investigations.9\n[30] The documentary evidence indicates that passports and passengers are thoroughly examined at airports in China:\nSources report the use of facial recognition technology for staff at Beijing Capital International Airport. A 2009 article by China Daily indicates that as of September 2009, Beijing Capital International Airport has used facial recognition systems to \"stop people from pretending to be airport staff and sneaking into restricted areas.\" Similarly, the Canadian embassy official indicated that Beijing international airport has a facial recognition system \"used by airport staff passing between the secure transit and public sections of the terminal,\" as well as by \"flight crew departing Beijing, using the same queue as airport staff.\"\nAccording to the Canadian embassy official, facial recognition technology is also used at Guangzhou International Airport:\n[w]hen passengers [pass] through [the] immigration counter, they [are] photographed by a mini-camera to record each passenger's face. Facial recognition technology is applied to the images; however, it is unclear as to the total scope of the database against which the images are assessed.\nMore generally, concerning practices at main Chinese international airports, the same source explained that Chinese border officials do not take photographs of passengers upon international departure at every airport in China. In Beijing, photographs were taken in the past, but are not being taken now. If photographs are being taken (e.g., Guangzhou), they would be taken at China Immigration Inspection departure counters at airports. The only facial recognition procedure applied is a comparison between the photo on the travel document and the passenger's face.10\n[31] The panel also notes that there is systematic corruption in China and that airport officials can be bribed. The panel acknowledges that the documentary evidence does indicate that authorities in China do not always apply regulations evenly.\n[32] The panel finds however that the preponderance of the documentary evidence does state that authorities at airports and at borders conduct thorough screening of passengers. The panel notes that the claimant asserts that he is wanted for arrest. The panel notes the documentary evidence indicating that authorities in airports have access to computer systems allowing them to see if the person applying for exit is wanted by authorities. The panel prefers the unbiased country condition evidence to the claimant's testimony and finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant is not wanted by PSB authorities.\n[33] The panel finds that the claimant exited China on identity documents containing his own name and date of birth, thus confirming that the authorities were not concerned with him and therefore undermining his identity as a person who is wanted by the PSB.\n[34] The panel notes the claimant's testimony that he does not know whether his passport is genuine because he did not acquire it himself. The panel finds on balance that given the security screening at international airports and the biometric nature of Chinese passports, the claimant would be unable to pass through the many layers of security screening with a fraudulent document.\nTravel by train\n[35] The claimant testified that he travelled by train to XXXX XXXX house following the PSB raid. He testified that he bought his train ticket using his own identity documents.\n[36] The panel notes the documentary evidence which states that in China there is a strict system for purchase of train tickets; the police patrol trains; the system is used to detain fugitives; and identity documents are required to be shown:\nSources indicate that China's has had a real-name ticket system for train since January 2012. Under the real-name system, individuals must show identification in order to purchase train tickets and their names must be displayed on their tickets.\n[...]\nSources indicate that identification must be shown alongside tickets when boarding trains. The BBC reports that both tickets and identity documents are checked at entry into train stations. According to CNN Travel, a division of news network CNN that focuses on travel information. High-speed rail passengers must be prepared to show ID with their tickets both on trains and in waiting halls. CNN Travel also reports that ID must be presented for ticket adjustments and refunds.\n[...]\nAccording to sources, the real-name ticket system is used by police to identify and detain fugitives. According to sources, police reported that they had captured 375 fugitives during the 2012 Chinese New Year travel period. The Shanghai Daily also notes that police patrol train stations and that train passengers might need to present their identification.11\n[37] The panel finds that if the claimant was indeed believed to be a Falun Gong practitioner and wanted by authorities, he would have been discovered by authorities when he travelled by train to Sichuan Province. The panel notes the unbiased documentary evidence and finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant was able travel by train because authorities are not interested in him.\nIdentity as a Falun Gong Practitioner\n[38] The claimant testified that he practiced Falun Gong at home beginning in XXXX 2015 and stated that he practiced two to three times a week. He testified that he attended two group practices in China and that he has attended six to seven group practices in Canada at XXXX Park and that he also practices twice a week at home in Canada. He testified that he has read Zhuan Falun, a book by Master Li.\n[39] The panel asked him to explain how he practices at home and he said he practices for an hour in the morning. The panel asked what exercises he does and he said the second. When asked if he only did the second exercise, the claimant stated that the second is his \"most favourite.\" The panel then asked him to explain the purpose of the second exercise.\n[40] The claimant then stated that he felt very comfortable doing exercise two. The panel asked again for the purpose of the exercise and he stated that he was trying to familiarize himself with all the exercises. The panel then stated that it was because he said exercise two was his favourite that the question concerning its purpose was asked. The claimant then said the purpose of doing exercise two \"is to be more skillful with this and doing it up to more levels.\"\n[41] The panel notes from the documentary evidence that the purpose of exercise two is to feel the rotation of the law wheel, to open the body and to therefore enhance gong strength:\nThis is the second Falun Gong exercise. It is a still, standing exercise composed of four wheel-holding positions. There are few movements and each position needs to be held for quite a while. Beginners' arms might initially feel heavy and achy. After doing the exercise, though, the whole body will feel relaxed, without feeling any of the fatigue that comes from physical work. When practitioners increase the frequency and duration of the exercise, they can feel a Law Wheel rotating between their arms. Doing the Falun Standing Stance exercise frequently will help open the entire body completely, and it will enhance gong strength. Falun Standing Stance is a comprehensive means of cultivation that increases wisdom, raises a person's level, and strengthens supernatural powers. 12\n[42] The panel finds that the male claimant answered incorrectly and draws a negative credibility inference as the panel would expect someone who participated in Falun Gong activities for over a year and who claimed that exercise two was his favourite would have better knowledge of the purpose of the exercise.\n[43] The panel asked the claimant if he knew what \"righteous thoughts\" are and he said yes. The panel asked what they are and he showed the lotus hand position. The panel asked him to keep going and he showed another hand position, this time with his baby fingers pressed together. The panel asked him why one sends righteous thoughts and he said when practicing someone said to do the two positions and that one should practice the third exercise to get the celestial eye. The panel asked what this has to do with righteous thoughts and the claimant said \"that will be helpful to it.\" The panel stated \"to finding the celestial eye?\" and the claimant said yes. The panel notes that righteous thoughts have nothing to do with the celestial eye and draws a negative credibility inference from the claimant's lack of knowledge of this important concept.\n[44] The panel notes that the sending of righteous thoughts is a major tenet of Falun Gong and is noted by Master Li to be a duty of Falun Gong practitioners. The panel draws a negative credibility inference from the claimant's inability to adequately explain what they are.\n[45] The documentary evidence has information on the Falun Gong practice of sending \"righteous thoughts\" and the evidence states that Master Li has both explained and provided instructions for sending forth righteous thoughts:\nDafa disciples' sending forth righteous thoughts at this special historic period-in order to reduce the evil beings' persecution of Dafa, Dafa disciples, and the people of the world-has played a very critical role. A large number of evil beings have been cleaned out in a timely manner before the force of Fa-rectification arrives, and this has reduced many potential losses. Yet the evil beings have already seen that they're doomed, and they are acting more and more madly. Dafa disciples are now sentient beings' only, sole hope for salvation. So, in order to do Fa-rectification more effectively, while you clarify the facts you have to take sending righteous thoughts very seriously, and in a timely manner purge the evil and your own problems so that you won't be taken advantage of by the evil. At present, there are still some students who haven't really grasped the essentials of sending righteous thoughts. Some students are in the exact same state as when they do the meditation-even when they're just doing the meditation, some students are in a half asleep state, are in a state in which their minds aren't alert enough, or are in a state in which they're severely interfered with by stray thoughts-so they can't achieve a very good effect. There are also some students who, when they send righteous thoughts, specifically target in their minds one or a few evil elements, and that prevents the gong and the divine powers they send out from having the maximum effect. Of course, if the circumstances are special and you target one evil being or a few evil beings as you send forth righteous thoughts, either by yourself or together, then that's something you should do, and the concentrated power is tremendous. But when you normally send righteous thoughts together on a daily basis you should chase down the evil on a larger scale. You shouldn't target one or a few evil beings each day, each time.13\n[46] The panel notes from the objective documentary evidence that sending righteous thoughts is intended to rid the world of evil beings and to stop the persecution of Falun Dafa practitioners.\n[47] The panel draws a negative credibility inference as the panel would expect someone who had read Zhuan Falun and had been practicing for over a year would have better knowledge of the concept of sending righteous thoughts.\n[48] The panel does acknowledge counsel's submissions that the claimant has a limited education which affects his ability to read and understand Falun Gong. The panel finds, however, that the claimant has scant knowledge of two important concepts of Falun Gong philosophy and finds that without understanding of the philosophy, the panel is unable to find on balance that the claimant is a true Falun Gong practitioner.\nNo Credible Basis\n[49] The claimant's oral testimony was as a whole, on a balance of probabilities, neither trustworthy nor credible. When a panel determines not only that the evidence adduced is insufficient to establish the claim, but also that there is no credible or trustworthy evidence on which the claim could have been accepted, the \"no credible basis\" provision is used.\n[50] Section 107, subsection (2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act states:\nIf the Refugee Protection Division is of the opinion, in rejecting a claim, that there was no credible or trustworthy evidence on which it could have made a favourable decision, it shall state in its reasons for the decision that there is no credible basis for the claim.\nCONCLUSION\n[51] Accordingly the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that this claimant has not established his claim on the basis of credible and trustworthy evidence and has not established the central element of his claim: that he is a Falun Gong practitioner wanted by authorities. Whether his claim then was based on section 96 or 97, it would fail owing to this lack of credibility. The claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection and there is no credible basis for his claim.\n(signed)\n\"Sarah Morgan\"\nSarah Morgan\nOctober 12, 2016\nDate\n1 Exhibit 1\n2 Exhibit 4\n3 Exhibit 3, NDP 31 May, 2016 version, item 3.8, RIR # CHN104415.E\n4 Exhibit 3, NDP 31 May, 2016 version, item 3.24, RIR# CHN105049.E\n5 Exhibit 1, biometric page of passport\n6 Exhibit 3, NDP 31 May, 2016 version, item 10.2, RIR# CHN104783.E\n7 Exhibit 3, NDP 31 May, 2016 version, item 3.24, RIR# CHN105049.E\n8 Exhibit 3 , NDP 31 May, 2016 version, item 14.3 RIR CHN104761.E\n9 Exhibit 3 , NDP 31 May, 2016 version, item 10.4, RIR CHN104762.E\n10 Exhibit 3, NDP, 31 May, 2016 version, item 3.24, RIR # CHN105049.E\n11 Exhibit 3 , NDP 31 May 2016 version, item 3.3, RIR CHN104134.E\n12 Exhibit 3, NDP 31 May, 2016 version, item 12.33, Chapter IV: The Falun Gong Practice System.

The claimant is a citizen of China and alleges that she is an Almighty God practitioner. She alleges that she became a practitioner as a result of experiencing personal difficulties after her divorce. She alleges that a friend who was also a practitioner was arrested which caused the claimant to go into hiding. She alleges that the police searched for her and that she fled China with the assistance of a smuggler. The Minister intervened in this case on the issue of credibility.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] The panel finds that the claimant has not established that there is a reasonable possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, or that, on a balance of probabilities, she would personally be subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if she were to return to China.\nCREDIBILITY\n[5] The panel is mindful of the challenges faced by a claimant when establishing their claim including cultural factors, nervousness, and the unfamiliar milieu of the hearing room. It also considered the claimant's age, education and background when assessing her credibility. At the time of the hearing, the claimant was 48 years old. She said she had 11 years of education and worked in a supermarket before coming to Canada.\n[6] Credibility was the determinative issue in this claim. The panel finds that the presumption of truthfulness was rebutted for the following reasons.\nWhen did the PSB visits take place - what month and year\n[7] The claimant stated in her BOC that the PSB looked for her on March 10, 2015. She was asked to tell the panel when the other searches occurred. She said that she didn't remember or memorize those dates. She said she looked at the calendar when the March 10 phone call was received. She was asked why she wasn't able to give her best knowledge or recollection about when the PSB looked for her at other times. She said she didn't pay any attention or look at the calendar. She said that March 10 was the only time she looked at the calendar. She confirmed that all of the PSB visits occurred when she was still in China.\n[8] She was asked why she didn't know when the police looked for her given the searches occurred while she was still in China. She replied by saying, \"I said it was in March. I didn't say I didn't know what months.\" She was asked if she was saying that she did know when the PSB looked for her. The claimant responded by saying that her aunt told her while she was in hiding that the PSB looked for her. She then said that she thought it was in March.\n[9] She was asked why she didn't initially tell the panel that she thought the other police visits were in March when she was first asked. She said that she was thinking when the member put the question to her that the member didn't ask her which month or date those phone calls were received. It again asked her why she didn't initially tell the panel that the police visits took place in March when she was first asked the question. The claimant said: I have been thinking about this question because when it was put to me, it was not about when they came to my home, the day and month and year.\n[10] The panel noted for the claimant that this was exactly the question. She was asked if there was anything more she wanted to say. She said that she might have a different understanding to questions. She said that she got confused by questions put to her in that way and this way. She said: about when the PSB came to visit me on what day, month and year, I told you I could only look at the calendar.\n[11] The panel finds that the claimant was evasive in her testimony. It rejects the claimant's explanation that she was confused by the question as she repeated the question that the panel had asked. It finds that the claimant understood the question on this basis.\n[12] It rejects her testimony that she thought the PSB visits occurred in March because she initially testified that she didn't pay attention, didn't remember, didn't look at the calendar and otherwise didn't know when they occurred. It finds that she was unable to provide a reasonable explanation why she didn't indicate that the other police visits took place in March when she was first asked the question.\n[13] As noted, the claimant alleges that these visits took place a few months before she left China. Her refugee claim was scheduled approximately three months after she left China. The panel finds it reasonable that the claimant would be able to provide some information about when these visits occurred when first asked the question. The panel finds that the claimant's evasiveness, and her evolving testimony on a material ground of her claim undermines her credibility, and her allegation that the police searched for her in China.\nBOC Omission - why the claimant believes the PSB looked for her\n[14] The claimant testified that her son told her that the PSB looked for her at her home on several occasions, and that he was given this information by her neighbour. She was asked why she didn't mention this information in her BOC. She said that would be so redundant and so complicated. She said she didn't think it was necessary to write it that way. She said it was written like it was in the BOC to show the PSB went to look for her.\n[15] The panel rejects these explanations. It finds that it would neither be complicated or redundant for the claimant to have disclosed in her BOC that her entire belief that the PSB searched for her was based on information provided by her son who in turn obtained it from a neighbour.\n[16] The panel acknowledges that the claimant states in her BOC that she indirectly learned from her parents that the PSB had gone to her house to look for her. However, she testified that her son had given this information to her parents, and confirmed that all of her information about the police visits originated from her son who learned about it from her neighbor.\n[17] The panel finds that the basis for her belief that the PSB searched for her is material to her claim. It finds, on a balance of probabilities, and in the absence of a reasonable explanation for the BOC omission, that the claimant fabricated her testimony that she learned about the PSB visits from her son. This finding undermines the claimant's credibility.\n[18] This impugned evidence is the only source of her belief that the PSB looked for her. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, and for these reasons, that the PSB did not search for the claimant in China. It finds that the claimant fabricated this evidence. These findings undermine the claimants' credibility. They also undermine her allegation that she was an Almighty God practitioner in China given that this was the only reason PSB allegedly searched for her. These findings undermine her related allegation that the PSB arrested co-practitioners.\nHotline Number - Contradiction\n[19] The claimant left China on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and arrived in Vancouver on the same day. The claimant submitted a letter from an alleged Almighty God house church in Toronto which indicates that the claimant contacted their hotline number on XXXX XXXX, 2015. The claimant confirmed this was correct.\n[20] She was asked how she knew there was an Almighty God house church in Toronto, and that they had a hotline number. She said the church in China made videotapes, and information about the hotline number was in the videotapes. She was asked to tell the panel about the Canadian hotline number in the video. She then said there was no information about Canada in the video. She was asked to explain her contradictory evidence.\nExplanation for Contradiction\n[21] She said, in this video there is no information about Canada, but at the end of the video there are gospel hotlines for different countries. She said that it was her understanding that at the end of the video is not in the content of the video. She was asked why she would think this if this information was in the video. She said that was her understanding.\n[22] The panel rejects this explanation for her contradictory evidence. It finds that she clearly stated that the hotline number was in the video, and then changed her evidence when asked to explain it. It finds her explanation that ``at the end` did not mean in the video does not overcome her testimony that the hotline number was in the video. It finds that the claimant failed to provide a reasonable explanation for her conflicting evidence. The panel finds that this contradiction undermines her credibility. It also undermines her testimony that she saw the hotline number in a video. This finding also undermines her explanation with respect to how she was able to make contact with the alleged Almighty God house church in Toronto.\nBOC Omissions\n[23] The claimant was asked if she came to Canada with the intention of calling the hotline number. She said yes, and that she had memorized the number. She was asked why none of this information, including the hotline in the video, was in her BOC.\n[24] She said that when she wrote the story, she wrote her reasons for coming to Canada which involved the arrest of two co-practitioners which she described as a threat given one knew where she lived. She said she didn't know she should have written about the hotline number in her story.\n[25] The panel rejects this explanation. It finds that the claimant travelled to Canada with the intention of contacting an Almighty God house church in Toronto through their hotline number after allegedly seeing the phone number in a video in China. The panel finds this testimony is material with respect to her allegation that she was able to find and join an Almighty God house church in Toronto. It finds the claimant was unable to provide a reasonable explanation for omitting this information from her BOC. This finding undermines the claimant's allegation that she saw a Toronto hotline number in a video in China, and that she used it to locate the alleged house church in Toronto.\nContradiction - claimant watches Almighty God video on-line in China\n[26] The claimant was asked why the Almighty God church made a video which could easily be seized by the authorities with grave consequences for their adherents. She said that she learned from other sisters and brothers that those videos were made at remote places. The panel asked her if she meant that there was more than one video. She said not only one, rather there were many videos on line. The panel asked her if she watched the video with the hotline number on line. She said yes.\n[27] When asked to clarify her evidence, the claimant said that she didn't watch the videos on line. She was asked to explain her inconsistent evidence. She said she saw the videos after she came overseas. She said when she was in China, she watched them on a memory card on an MP4 or MP5 device.\nImplausibility - Claimant watches videos on-line in China\n[28] The panel noted for the claimant that the internet is subject to censorship by the authorities in China1 though their Golden Shield computer system.2 It noted for her that Almighty God has the status of an illegal cult3 in China and is pursued by the PSB. It noted for her that her testimony that the hotline number was available on-line in China was not only in conflict with the country reports, but based on those reports, was impossible.\n[29] Upon hearing the panel's concerns, the claimant said that she didn't finish her answer earlier. She said that the hotline number is not seen or read on line. She said she read it from a SIM card from a sister and brother who made it for them. She noted that the panel had said that Chinese authorities persecute practitioners. She asked the panel how her brothers and sisters could post a video on line. The panel rejects these explanations.\n[30] It rejects her explanation that she saw the videos after she came to Canada given that she testified that she saw the hotline number at the end of a video, and memorized that number with the intention of calling it once she arrived in Canada. The panel therefore rejects her explanation that the video is not seen on line in China, and that she had seen it on an MP4 or MP5 player for these reasons.\nImplausibility - international exchange of videos from China\n[31] The claimant then said that after the video is made in China, it is sent abroad overseas, but she didn't know where. She said that when the video was made, they didn't know the qualification of the video, whether it was qualified to the standard of God. She said it had to meet the standard, something to testify to God. She said they had to send the video abroad for examination. She said the videos were sent from China internationally through the internet.\n[32] The panel noted for the claimant that this allegation was implausible given the censorship that exists in China,4 the Golden Shield,5 and given that Almighty God is considered to be an evil cult.6 The claimant responded by saying that she doesn't know much about internet and that those who try to fulfill duties, have the method to send it abroad. She said she wasn't an expert about the internet or the method of going over the wall, to send it overseas. When asked what she meant by wall, she said: \"I don't know myself - trying to avoid being discovered by the PSB.\" She alleged that after the videos were audited overseas, they were sent back to China via the internet, then made on the card, and spread out to different sisters and brothers.\nGolden Shield\n[33] The country reports do not support the claimant's allegations that she saw Almighty God videos on-line or that videos made by this banned group7 could be sent via internet from China to international entities, and then returned by those entities to China via the internet to illegal practitioners given internet censorship that exists in China.\n[34] China's Golden Shield has been described as \"a vast network of surveillance infrastructure.... Which monitors Chinese citizens online and offline. A Chinese economist, author and political commentator writing in Hong Kong's Chinese-language Open Magazine, calls the Golden Shield an \"enormous telecommunication control and monitoring system\". 8 The economist states that the Golden Shield's firewall was developed to \"sniff out, examine, and finally delete information censored by the regime.\"9\n[35] The Laogai Research Foundation, a Washington F,C, based organization that researches and raised awareness of human rights violations in China, including internet surveillance and censorship, states that the Golden Shield Project \"is more than a mere firewall\", rather it is \"a sophisticated surveillance system that enables the government to censor specific search requests, monitor the activities of internet users, and track dissidents offline. The Sydney Morning Herald explains that the system is used by the authorities to \"eliminate references to politically sensitive topics\" online.\n[36] The Laogai Research Foundation states that \"the physical structure of Chinese cyberspace forces virtually all internet contact between China and the outside world to flow through three chokepoints\" where the authorities monitor all the transmitted information.\"\nImplausibility Analysis\n[37] The panel finds, on the basis of the country reports, that the claimant's allegations of on-line videos, and on-line traffic from a banned religion in China to international destinations and back again to China, is implausible. It finds that the claimant did not even understand her own evidence about the \"wall\" and finds this explanation to be speculative. It find, on the basis of the country reports, that the claimant's allegations concerning the videos is implausible. It finds that the claimant fabricated her evidence about the on-line videos. These findings undermine her credibility.\n[38] The panel finds that the claimant's repeated fabrication about Almighty God practices in China which she allegedly knew, or participated in, undermine the likelihood, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant's related evidence with respect to being an Almighty God practitioner are credible. The panel finds that her willingness to lie about alleged Almighty God activities in China undermine her allegation that she was an Almighty God practitioner in China.\n[39] The panel finds for all of the reasons given in this decision, and on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant was not an Almighty God practitioner in China. It finds that her related allegations that co-practitioners were arrested and that she was smuggled out of China because of her religion also lack reliability, and on a balance of probabilities, are not credible.\nHotline Number in Church letter\n[40] The panel finds that the claimant's explanation for being able to make almost immediate contact with the house church in Toronto through the hotline number lacks credibility. It finds, on a balance of probabilities, and for all the reasons given, that no such video or hotline number existed in a video in China. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant fabricated her evidence about the hot-line number to explain why she was able to make almost immediate contact with her alleged Almighty God house church in Toronto. The panel finds that the claimant was unable to provide a reasonable explanation with respect to how she was able to make immediate contact with the house church in Toronto which she describes as a an informal \"service site\" attended by approximately 4-5 people.\n[41] The hotline number is mentioned in the supporting letter from the claimant's alleged house-church in Toronto. The panel finds that reference to this problematic hotline number in this letter undermines the reliability and trustworthiness of the information it contains. The panel assigns little weight to the Toronto house-church letter for these reasons. These findings undermine the claimant's credibility, and the trustworthiness of her sur place claim.\nDivorce certificate\n[42] The claimant alleged in her BOC that she turned to the Almighty God faith as a result of the difficulties she experienced after her divorce. The panel gives little weight to this allegation given that it finds that the claimant was not a genuine Almighty God practitioner in China for the reasons given in this decision. It assigns little weight to the divorce certificate given its limited probative value in determining whether or not the claimant was a genuine practitioner.\nDomestic Abuse\n[43] The claimant alleged in her BOC that her ex-husband had beaten her in 2010 which precipitated her divorce. She was asked if domestic violence was an issue in her claim. She said that she was not aware that it was as an issue unless her lawyer raised it. She said it was the reason she embraced the faith, but not a reason for making her refugee claim.\n[44] The panel finds that domestic abuse was not an issue in this claim on the basis of her testimony. It gives little weight to her allegation that her divorce, and the reasons for it, led her to become a practitioner given that the panel finds that the claimant was not a practitioner in China.\nKnowledge\n[45] The panel acknowledges that the claimant had some knowledge about the Almighty God faith. It finds it reasonable to expect that the claimant would possess some knowledge given that she said she read \"The Word Appears in the Flesh\", a core Almighty God publication, and that she had read it in a group setting in Toronto usually twice per week. It assigns little weight to her knowledge given that anyone can obtain a relevant publication, study its contents and repeat what they have read without being a genuine practitioner.\n[46] The panel assigns little weight to the claimant's photos which show her seated with others in a study scene with books and notepads. It finds that these photos do not indicate in themselves that the claimant is a genuine adherent.\n[47] The panel rejects counsel's submissions that the claimant's testimony was forthright. It found the claimant was repeatedly evasive in her testimony. It also rejects counsel's submission that the claimant was passionate in her answers about her alleged faith. It finds that she spoke in a regular tone during the hearing, and that her comments about her faith, when considered in the cumulative context of her evidence, lacked trustworthiness. The panel acknowledges that the claimant discussed her faith, and how it helped her in very broad and general terms. It finds that this generalized discussion of her faith did not add to her credibility, when her evidence was considered cumulatively, given the concerns noted in this decision.\nSur Place claim\n[48] The hearing re-convened to give the claimant an opportunity to provide evidence with respect to her sur place claim. The claimant indicated at this sitting that she was involved as an actress in a volunteer-made movie in Toronto in which she played a small role as a fictional character. The panel accepts that the claimant had some involvement in a video on the basis of the photographs she provided of a table scene.\nLetter from Film Crew\n[49] The claimant submitted a letter from some members of the movie film crew in support of her claim. She said that the letter was written by her fellow sisters and brothers in Canada in order to confirm that she made a movie with them.\n[50] She said the movie was produced by believers of her faith in Toronto. She said they all belonged to her church in Canada. She said that the movie was about a pastor of another faith, who, after satisfying himself through asking questions, concluded that Almighty God exists.\n[51] This letter is signed by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX whom the claimant said is the leader of their house church in Toronto, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX whom the claimant said also belonged to the house church. She was asked they signed her letter, but not others who worked on the movie. She said they were the only people carrying ID cards.\n[52] In his examination, counsel asked the claimant whether perhaps these two people were more familiar with her. She said no, not particularly these two persons. She said the group of five people who signed the letter were equally familiar to her. Her counsel asked her if she was well familiar with all the five people who signed her letter. She said she knew them, but was not very familiar with them. Her counsel asked her about her interaction with the 5 signees in the context of her church. She said that in normal circumstances, \"we don't meet each other frequently. Only making the movie.\" She said she only saw the leader of her house church every other week.\n[53] The panel assigns little weight to the movie letter on the basis that the signees, according to the claimant's evidence, did not have much contact with the claimant, and on a balance of probabilities, did not know her well. It also assigns little weight to the letter given it is unsworn, and that, although identification for the writers is provided, the writers did not attend the hearing to provide evidence. The panel assigns little weight to the observations in their letter for these reasons.\nMovie\n[54] The claimant said that 36 people were involved in making the movie, and that they were all Almighty God practitioners. It noted for her that she had only provided 5 signatures on the letter. She was asked where were the other 31. She said only a few signed the letter because they are Canadian citizens or permanent residents. She was asked if the others were not Canadian citizens or permanent residents. She said that some of them have passed their hearing, but are waiting for a decision. The panel finds that the claimant's related testimony on this issue was evasive.\n[55] The claimant said she didn't know the other crew members. She was asked how many of the 36 people she knew. She said, of course she knew them. She said she met them, and if you meet someone a few times, you can know them. She was asked if she knew the name of the 36 people she worked with. She said no, only a few. She said others used nicknames. She said she only knew those who signed the letter by their real name.\n[56] The panel gives little weight to the claimant's evidence that everyone who took part in the movie were Almighty God practitioners given that she also testified that she didn't know everyone who worked on the film. It rejects her additional explanation that she knew everyone on the film was an Almighty God practitioner because the director would only recruit church members. When asked how she knew this, she said they were all unpaid volunteers, so if they were not from the church, they wouldn't contribute their time. When asked how many of the crew belonged to the church, she said the leader would know. The panel finds this testimony to be speculative and assigns it little weight.\n[57] It finds that her lack of familiarity with the crew undermines her allegation that the entire crew were Almighty God believers. It gives little weight to her allegation that the film crew would have service together on the set as an indication of their faith given the claimant did not know the persons involved in the video very well or most of their names, let alone their religious adherence. Although the claimant said that 36 people were involved in the movie, she was unable to identify more than a few by name which undermines this allegation as well as her allegation that she knew them.\n[58] It gives little weight to the video pre-dating the claimant's arrival in Toronto, in terms of an indication of the genuineness of her faith, given that the claimant's testimony about the movie was problematic and lacked credibility.\nAnalysis of Sur Place Claim\n[59] The panel finds that the claimant was not an Almighty God practitioner in China. It finds that her sur place claim was a related effort to advance a fraudulent refugee claim. It finds, on a balance of probabilities that her participation as an actress in a small, fictional role in a volunteer made movie in Toronto would not cause her to be perceived as an Almighty God practitioner by the Chinese authorities.\n[60] The panel finds that the claimant embellished her evidence with respect to the high profile nature of the movie and her allegation that it would be shown in movie theatres throughout the world. She then said it would not necessarily be shown in theatres, but it will play on a website on the internet. She said Almighty God had their own website. She was asked if anyone in China would see the film on the internet. She said, since there are strict controls, particularly for this kind of website, she guessed that not many people dared to go on this website. She was asked how Chinese authorities would find out about the film. She said they could go on the internet. She confirmed that they would have to go and look for the film to find it.\n[61] The panel finds that the movie, according to the claimant's evidence, was a project undertaken by unpaid volunteers. The claimant said the movie was not completed at the time of hearing. The panel finds that the movie, if ever completed, would not have the international profile the claimant attributed to it, and would not, on a balance of probabilities, be viewed in China given internet censorship. Nor does it find, on a balance of probabilities, that the movie would come to the attention of the authorities given that the claimant's evidence with respect to how the authorities would learn about it is speculative.\nPolitical Opinion\n[62] The panel gives little weight to the claimant's allegation that her involvement in the movie will be considered to promote the Almighty God faith, and was against China, as it is banned there. She confirmed that her role in the movie did not condemn China. She confirmed that she was playing a fictional role, but said it is based on what happens in China.\n[63] It assigns little weight to her allegation that the video would be perceived by the authorities as being against China given her small role as an actress in the movie, and that, on a balance of probabilities, the movie would not come to the attention of the Chinese authorities for the reasons given supra. It assigns little weight to her alleged political opinion for these reasons.\n[64] The panel acknowledges that the claimant said that she spoke about her religion to others in Toronto. The panel assigns little weight to this allegation given that the panel finds, for the all reasons given in this decision, that the claimant was not a genuine practitioner in China or Canada.\n[65] The panel finds that the claimant's sur place activities do not give rise to a reasonable possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, or that, on a balance of probabilities, she would personally be subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if she were to return to China.\nCONCLUSION\n[66] The panel considered all three protection grounds under sections 96 and 97(1) of IRPA and, considered the totality of all of the evidence cumulatively. It finds that the claimant was generally not credible. It finds that she fabricated evidence about the video practices of Almighty God practitioners in China as well as the video containing the hot line number in Toronto. It finds that her evidence was undermined by evasiveness, contradiction, inconsistency and implausibility.\n[67] The panel rejects counsels' submission that \"inconsistencies can appear\" as a result of \"panel going through areas more than once\". In one instance, the panel consulted the recorder to ensure that it had understood the evidence correctly after the hearing room computer malfunctioned. In other instances, it finds that the claimant's repeated inconsistent, contradictory and evasive evidence required clarification throughout the hearing. It finds there was no procedural unfairness for these reasons.\n[68] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, and for all the reasons given, that the claimant was not a genuine Almighty God practitioner in China or Canada, and that she fabricated her profile to advance a fraudulent refugee claim.\n[69] Without disbelieving every part of a claimant's testimony, a panel may find the claimant so lacking in credibility that it concludes that there is no credible evidence relevant to her claim. In other words, a general finding of a lack of credibility on the part of the applicant may conceivably extend to all relevant information emanating from her testimony. 10\n[70] While none of the credibility concerns raised may be sufficient, each on their own to negate the claim, the cumulative effect of all of them is that the panel did not have sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence upon which to base a determination that the claimant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.\n[71] Pursuant to subsection 107(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the panel finds that there was no credible or trustworthy evidence on which it could have made a favourable decision, and finds that there is no credible basis for the claim. For these reasons, the claim is rejected.\n(signed)\n\"N. Cassano \"\nN. Cassano\nMay 10, 2016\nDate\n1 National Documentation Package (NDP) version 30 October 2015, item 10.4.

Liu\nConseil du (de la) ministre\nREASONS FOR DECISION\n[1] XXXX XXXX, the principal claimant (\"Principal Claimant\"), and her husband, XXXX XXXX (the \"Male Claimant\"), are citizens of the People's Republic of China (\"China\"). They claim refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IR PA).1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The alleged circumstances underlying the claims are contained in the Claimants' Basis of Claim (\"BOC\") forms,2 and are supplemented by the Claimants' oral testimony.\n[3] The Claimants, who are married, allege that they are Falun Gong practitioners. They were introduced to the practice of Falun Gong by an acquaintance, who suggested its practice would be beneficial to the Principal Claimant's migraine issue and the Male Claimant's chronic urticaria. In August 2014, the Claimants began to practice Falun Gong exercises and learn its philosophy; in November 2014, they joined a practice group. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, the Claimants travelled to Canada on a planned holiday, leaving their daughter under the care of the Principal Claimant's mother in China. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, the Claimants' learned that Chinese Public Security Bureau (\"PSB\") officers attended at their residence on that date, stating to the Principal Claimant's mother that the Claimants were wanted for their involvement in Falun Gong. The Claimants made claims for refugee protection in Canada instead of returning to China. The Claimants continue to practice Falun Gong in Canada.\n[4] As the Panel understands the evidence, the Claimants fear being arrested and imprisoned by the PSB for their practice of Falun Gong if they return to China. They also fear that they will be unable to practice Falun Gong openly in China.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] For the reasons that follow, the Panel determines that the Claimants are not Convention refugees, nor persons in need of protection. Therefore, the claims are rejected.\nPRELIMINARY MATTERS\n[6] At the conclusion of this hearing, the Claimants were to provide further documentation with respect to the purpose of their trip to Canada. Those documents were received February 16, 2016 and entered as Exhibit 12.3 As such, those documents were taken into consideration in assessing the overall evidence.\nANALYSIS\n[7] In the context of these claims, it is necessary to consider whether the Claimants have established their identities as nationals of China, and whether, as per s. 96 of IRPA, the Claimants have established, through credible and trustworthy evidence, that they face a serious possibility of persecution in China for their alleged Falun Gong practice. Implicit in the latter issue is whether the Claimants are genuine Falun Gong practitioners. A consideration of the evidence as it relates to ss. 97(1) of IRPA is also necessary, and will be briefly set out below.\n[8] The determinative issue in this case is credibility.\nIdentity\n[9] The Claimants' personal identities and identities as nationals of China are established through their testimony and the supporting documentation filed, including copies of their passports.4 The passports were seized by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada at the time that they filed their refugee protection claims, and so the Panel was unable to examine the original documents.5 However, there were no aspects on the face of the certified true copies that caused the Panel to doubt their genuine nature. Further, the Panel examined the Claimants' Resident Identity Cards (\"RICs\"), copies of which were tendered in evidence.6 The Panel did not note any concerns on the face of those documents to cause the Panel to doubt their genuine nature. Both the passports and the RICs have some complexity of design which, in the circumstances, provides sufficient reassurances to the Panel as to their authenticity.\n[10] Therefore, the Panel finds that the Claimants have established their personal identities and identities as nationals of China.\nCredibility\n[11] Sworn testimony is presumed to be true, unless there is a valid reason to doubt its veracity. The determination as to whether a claimant's evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities, the burden of which is upon the claimant to satisfy. The Panel also notes that the entirety of a claimant's relevant evidence may be undermined if the claimant is found generally lacking in credibility.7\n[12] In assessing credibility, the Panel has considered the challenges faced by a claimant in a hearing room setting within the context of the age and background of these particular claimants. The evidence indicates that the Principal Claimant, born in XXXX 1986, has a post-secondary education in project management and worked as an assistant engineer in a heating supply company in China.8 The Male Claimant, born in XXXX 1986, has a post-secondary education in business management and computer applications;9 he worked as an engineering estimator prior to his exit from China.10\n[13] After having heard the testimony of the Claimants and carefully considering the whole of the relevant evidence, as well as the submissions of their counsel and the Minister's counsel, the Panel has the following credibility concerns.\nLack of Documentation from Chinese Authorities\n[14] The Principal Claimant alleged that the PSB attended at the Claimants' residence on three occasions: October 7, 2015, October 16, 2015, and December 1, 2015. On the first occasion, the PSB told the Principal Claimant's mother, who was at the residence, that the Claimants practised Falun Gong, asked for their whereabouts, directed that the Claimants were to report to the PSB upon their return, and searched the residence. When the PSB reappeared on October 16, 2015, the PSB asked the mother why the Claimants had not returned yet, asked what the Claimants were doing in Canada, told the mother not to hide information, and stated that they would not let the Claimants escape once caught. On the third visit, the PSB asked the mother if the Claimants had been in contact, again warned the mother not to withhold information, and again stated that there would be no escape for the Claimants. The PSB did not leave a summons or other documentation for the Claimants; the Principal Claimant confirmed that she asked her mother whether anything had been left by the PSB.\n[15] The current National Documentation Package (\"NDP\") indicates that Falun Gong practitioners are detained under Article 300 of China's Criminal Procedure Code, which addresses criminal involvement in evil cults.11 The current NDP also indicates that the authorities issue summons in criminal investigations, and summons may be left with an adult family member if the subject of interest is absent.12 However, the Panel accepts that there may be inconsistencies in this practice.13\n[16] The Panel does not accept as reasonable the Claimants' contention that the PSB did not leave any papers for the Claimants, such as a summons, another process to compel their attendance, or even contact information for an investigator, despite the PSB allegedly visiting their residence on three occasions. The nature of these visits, involving multiple attendances, demands to learn of the Claimants' whereabouts and activities, a house search, pronouncements of the PSB's determination to prevent escape, and continued warnings to the mother, all suggest a more than casual or passing interest by the PSB in the Claimants. In consideration of these alleged actions and the NDP information, the Panel finds, if the PSB were indeed in pursuit of the Claimants, that a summons or other documents indicating the PSB's interest and demands would have been left at the Claimants' residence. The Panel is guided in this finding by the Federal Court decision of Zhang v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2011 FC 654, which upheld such a finding as reasonable in circumstances similar to this matter.14 A Response to Information Request in evidence also suggests that documentation may be obtained from the PSB upon request.15 According to the Principal Claimant, she is still in contact with family in China; such individuals could potentially facilitate such a request.\n[17] In this case, there were no official documents submitted into evidence to indicate any kind of interest in the Claimants by the PSB. As such material is not in evidence, despite it being reasonably expected in the alleged circumstances, the Panel draws a negative inference upon the Claimant's evidence with respect to the alleged PSB visits.\nMultiple PSB Visits\n[18] Tied into the above issue is the Principal Claimant's evidence that the PSB attended the Claimants' home a total of three times as of the date of the hearing. According to the Principal Claimant, the Claimants exited China on XXXX XXXX, 2015; the PSB learned of their involvement, it appears, through the arrest of fellow practitioners on October 5, 2015. Based on the China exit stamps in their passports, the Claimants departed China on their own legitimate travel documents and did so by passing through a customs checkpoint.16\n[19] The current NDP indicates that freedom to exit China is not absolute.17 Under Article 12 of the Exit and Entry Administration Law of China, exit from the country is denied under certain circumstances, including instances where the citizen does not hold valid exit documents, or is a suspect or defendant in a criminal case.18 There are, however, isolated incidents of successful evasion.19\n[20] As an aid to exit control measures, border authorities have access to a PSB computer system known as \"Policenet\" or \"Golden Shield.\" The system, amongst its various capabilities, contains a database of fugitives and those convicted of offences; it appears that this database is automatically searched when border authorities scan a passport.20 More broadly, the system, designed as a vast network of surveillance infrastructure, is both powerful and pervasive in its monitoring of Chinese citizens.21 Through it, Chinese authorities are able to \"search out any Chinese citizen's photograph, work history, family background, political leanings, Internet history, and at least 60 days of emails.\"22 Further, it is also mobile and easily accessible.23 The system has been said to allow the security services to \"ferret out political dissidents and Falun Gong practitioners for years.\"24 Predictably, all police services nationwide, via the system, have access to a citizen's border exit and entry information.25\n[21] Based on the NDP information and the Claimants' recorded departure through Chinese customs, two circumstances become evident. The Claimants were not wanted by the PSB when they left China; if they were, they likely would have been detected and stopped by Chinese authorities. There is no suggestion here that the Claimants took any steps to evade detection upon their exit. Second, the PSB had access to databases that indicated the Claimants had already exited China on XXXX XXXX, 2015. The PSB apparently used their databases to locate the home address of the Claimants; even if such was not the case, the Panel anticipates that the PSB would check an easily accessible database for details on their subjects of interest.\n[22]\nThe British Columbia Court of Appeal stated in Faryna v. Chorny as follows:\nIn short the real test of the truth of the story of a witness in such a case must be its harmony with the preponderance of the probabilities which a practical and informed person would readily recognize as reasonable in that place and in those conditions.26\n[23] The PSB's behaviour in attending the Claimants' residence three times, demanding information as to their whereabouts on at least the first visit and providing continued pronouncements that the Claimants would not successfully escape, is inconsistent with an organization that excels in its ubiquitous monitoring of its own citizenry. Through its actions, the PSB essentially took steps to not only tip off their subjects of interest, who were already outside of the PSB's grasp, as to being wanted, they also provided clear incentive to never return to the jurisdiction of the PSB. In the circumstances here, the Panel rejects the testimony related to the PSB's actions as being inconsistent with the objective documentation in evidence and draws a further negative inference with respect to the alleged visits by the PSB.\nInconsistent Testimony Regarding Practice Safety Precautions\n[24] During examination of the Male Claimant respecting his practice of Falun Gong in China, he noted that his practice group did not practice the fifth exercise as it required that they take off their shoes and sit on the floor, which could make it difficult to flee from a PSB raid. The Claimant indicated that the Claimants would practice all five exercises at home. The Claimant said that he believed there was better safety at home than in the group; he explained that they did not know much about the others in the group. He was then asked why they would practice in a group if not much was known about the co-practitioners such that safety was a concern. He then noted that all of the members of the group were introduced by someone well-known and also had to be approved by the instructor. The Claimant was then asked whether the group, consequently, was a safe place for the exercises. He agreed and stated that the group took safety precautions. The Panel then asked why it was unsafe to practice the fifth exercise in the group. He stated that the PSB might approach the practice location; he also noted that everyone in the group knew the location of the practice site, but not everyone knew the location of his home.\n[25] The Claimants' BOC indicates that they were aware of the consequences of Falun Gong involvement, but appear to have taken comfort from the group's safety precautions and lack of problems since it was established three years prior to their membership.27\n[26] The Male Claimant's evidence related to the practice group's safety was inconsistent and circular. He essentially testified that the practice group was both a safe place to practice their illegal activity with carefully-vetted others and a risky place in which there was potential for betrayal by vaguely-known co-practitioners. The Male Claimant's testimony here unfolded in a manner that indicates he was attempting to reconcile two disparate areas of evidence. It is incongruent that the Claimants, both well-educated professionals who were aware in advance of the dangers of Falun Gong practice, would involve themselves in a group practice where they had concerns that a PSB raid was such a live risk that they felt unsafe to remove their shoes and sit on the floor, even when considering their assertion that practice helped with their health concerns. On the Male Claimant's evidence, it is apparent that they had a \"safer\" alternative to practice in their home. The Panel rejects the Male Claimant's evidence in this area and draws a negative inference with respect to their involvement in a practice group in China.\nPractice of Falun Gong in China\n[27] Both the Claimants displayed satisfactory knowledge of Falun Gong practice and its principles given their stage of involvement as practitioners, having started practice in August 2014. They allege that they regularly practiced Falun Gong in their home and subsequently in a group before they departed from China.\n[28] A handwritten letter from the Principal Claimant's mother was tendered, which, beyond essentially confirming the details of the BOC narrative and testimony, verified that the Claimants started Falun Gong practice in China in August 2014.28 However, the letter was not a sworn or notarized statement. Further, the writer was not called as a witness. While the Panel recognizes that there are practical difficulties in having a witness from another country attend in-person, other methods exist to permit examination, such as a telephone appearance. This was not arranged. The Panel notes that the Claimant was represented by competent and experienced legal counsel throughout the hearing. In any event, the Panel was unable to test and assess the credibility of the writer's statements. In such circumstances, the Panel assigns the letter little weight at this stage of the analysis. There was no other direct documentary evidence tendered in relation to the Claimants' practice of Falun Gong in China.\n[29] The Panel does note that a handwritten letter was tendered in relation to the Claimants' practice in Canada; the letter indicates that the writer found the Claimants' to be already skilled and knowledgeable practitioners when first meeting them, which occurred shortly after their arrival in Canada.29 For the purposes of using this evidence in assessing whether the Claimants' practiced in China, for the reasons which will be provided in detail below, this letter is assigned little weight.\n[30] A demonstration of knowledge of Falun Gong practice and its concepts, in itself, is not determinative as to whether the Claimants are indeed genuine practitioners. Insofar as the evidence that was tendered, it was information that could be learned by a non-practitioner within a reasonable period of time. As the testimony respecting the Claimants' identities as genuine practitioners in China is, therefore, inconclusive, and the limited documents in support of their practice in China have been assigned little weight, it is essential to assess the matter through the lens of the Claimants' overall credibility.\nCredibility Assessment\n[31] The Panel has drawn a number of negative inferences upon the Claimants' evidence related to the PSB's interest in them and the Claimants' involvement in a Falun Gong practice group in China. Given the constellation of negative inferences, the Panel finds that the Claimants are not credible witnesses with respect to the events leading to their exit from China. Consequently, the Panel is not persuaded that the PSB was in pursuit of the Claimants in China. Further, the Panel is not persuaded that the Claimants were involved in a Falun Gong practice group in China.\n[32] As the PSB was the alleged agent of persecution, intent on finding the Claimants for their Falun Gong practice, the issue of the PSB's pursuit of the Claimants was a central component of the claims. Additionally, the Claimants' involvement in a Falun Gong practice group in China was the underlying activity that resulted in the PSB learning of their practice; therefore, it was also a central component of the claims.\n[33] As per Sheikh,30 the Panel finds that the cumulative effect of the negative inferences and findings undermines the credibility of the Claimants in general. As a result of this negative credibility assessment and the inconclusive evidence related to their Falun Gong practice in China, the Panel finds that the Claimants were not Falun Gong practitioners in China.\n[34] Accordingly, it follows, and the Panel finds, that the letter purportedly from the Principal Claimant's mother tendered in support of their claims, and which essentially reiterated the BOC narrative, was manufactured to further the false allegations.31 The Panel notes that fraudulent documents, even of relative complexity, are widespread in China.32\nSur Place Issues\n[35] A claim for refugee protection is forward-looking. Although the Panel has determined that the Claimants are not credible witnesses with respect to the events surrounding their exit from China and their practice of Falun Gong there, it is still necessary to consider whether any sur place issues exist; that is, whether there has been a change of circumstances in Canada to bring the Claimants within the scope of s. 96, IRPA.\n[36] On a sur place analysis, there are two factors to consider: \"would the [Claimant] be identified as a Falun Gong practitioner upon return to China; and, if so identified, would the [Claimant] suffer more than a mere possibility of persecution?\"33\n[37] As the Panel understands the testimony, the Claimants practice Falun Gong in Canada and regularly attend a group practice in Milliken Park, a location in the Greater Toronto Area. In addition, the Claimants regularly study Zhuan Falun. The Claimants provided photographs and a confirmation letter with respect to their practice in Canada.34\n[38] The Claimants provided a photograph that depicts a group of approximately ten individuals in a park-like setting.35 The individuals, all wearing casual attire, are standing with their arms in a uniform pose. The Male Claimant explained that both he and the Principal Claimant were engaged in Falun Gong exercises at the aforementioned Milliken Park in or about November 2015. In a second photograph, taken around December 2015, the Claimants are depicted as distributing pamphlets, which the Panel understands were related to Falun Gong, on an urban street at Pacific Mall, which is also a location in the Greater Toronto Area.36 The Panel assigns the photographs little weight, as the photographs do not demonstrate an extended or committed involvement to the practice of Falun Gong and are rather superficial in nature. There were simply two photographs tendered, one of a small group of individuals engaged in a single gesture and the other of the Claimants holding pamphlets in front of a third person. The photographs, in themselves, are of little probative value in addressing the sur place issue.\n[39] As noted above, the Claimants also provided a handwritten letter dated December 26, 2015 from an alleged Falun Gong practitioner, in which the writer states that he met the Claimants in October 2015 in Milliken Park and noticed that they were skilled and knowledgeable practitioners; the writer asserts that the Claimants are genuine Falun Gong practitioners.37 The Panel assigns the letter little weight. It was not a sworn statement. Further, the Claimants did not call the writer as a witness, despite the writer's apparent local proximity to the hearing location and apparent interest in assisting in the proceedings. When asked to explain why the writer was not called as a witness, the Male Claimant said that he thought the letter would be sufficient and noted that he could ask the writer to attend if necessary. No application was made to allow the witness. The Panel notes that the Claimant was represented by competent and experienced legal counsel throughout the hearing. In any event, the Panel was unable to test and assess the credibility of the writer's statements.\n[40] The Claimants' evidence of their Falun Gong practice in Canada is rather limited, and, as already noted, their knowledge of Falun Gong in general, although satisfactory, is not determinative in itself. An important consideration here is the general credibility of the Claimants. The Panel is entitled to \"import its credibility findings into its assessment of an applicant's sur place claim.\"38 This is consistent with the Sheikh decision, as discussed above. The Panel has found that the Claimants are generally lacking in credibility. The Panel has also found that two central components of the claims, the PSB's pursuit of the Claimants and their involvement in a practice group in China, are untrue.\n[41] As a result of the Claimants' credibility issues and the equivocal evidence of their Canadian Falun Gong practice, the Panel finds that the evidence respecting their Falun Gong practice in Canada is a fabrication to support non-genuine refugee claims. This includes the practitioner's letter and photographs tendered in corroboration.39 Therefore, the Panel is not persuaded on the credible evidence before it that the Claimants are now genuine Falun Gong practitioners and, as such, the Panel is not persuaded that the Claimants would be practitioners upon return to China.\n[42] There was no additional, separate evidence tendered to address the potential for the Claimants to be identified by Chinese authorities as Falun Gong practitioners upon their return to China. Therefore, the Panel is not persuaded on the credible evidence before it that the Claimants would be identified as Falun Gong practitioners if they returned to China.\nPossibility of Persecution\n[43] As the Panel has found that the Claimants are not genuine Falun Gong practitioners, there is no objective basis to find that the Claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution in China.\nCONCLUSION\n[44] The Panel concludes that the Claimants are not Convention refugees, pursuant to s. 96 of IRPA, as they do not face a serious possibility of persecution in China. As there is no further evidence that the Claimants would satisfy the risks delineated pursuant to ss. 97(1) of IRPA, which requires a higher standard of risk than s. 96 of IRPA, the Panel further finds that the Claimants are not persons in need of protection. Therefore, the claims are rejected.\nNo Credible Basis\n[45] As the Panel has rejected the Claimants' credibility and the corroborating documents, and further credible or trustworthy evidence has not been provided, there is no credible or trustworthy evidence upon which the Panel could have come to a favourable decision. The Panel, therefore, finds that the claims have no credible basis pursuant to ss. 107(2) of IRPA.\n(signed)\n\"Robert L. Gibson\"\nRobert L.

She seeks refugee protection against Afghanistan pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] This claim was based on the following allegations.\n[3] The claimant, her husband, XXXX, and their son, XXXX, lived in exile in Pakistan from 1983 to 2009. The family returned to Afghanistan in 2009. XXXX was a doctor and worked in the Ministry of Public Health. XXXX worked for XXXX Group, in a project that developed women's football. Both XXXX and XXXX received threats from the Taliban in relation to their work. On October 1, 2014, XXXX was killed by a car bomb. XXXX went to the United States on a scholarship, and was thereafter accepted to Canada as a refugee on XXXX XXXX, 2015 by this Board. The claimant went to Pakistan in January 2015 with XXXX wife and children. Unable to support herself in Pakistan, the claimant returned to her home in Afghanistan after three months. Upon returning to Afghanistan, she received threatening phone calls from the Taliban. The claimant obtained a U.S. visa and came to Canada via the U.S. on XXXX XXXX, 2015. She signed her claim on XXXX XXXX, 2015.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] The panel noted identity and credibility as the determinative issues at the outset of this hearing. For the following reasons, this claim is dismissed.\n[5] On a balance of probabilities, the panel found that the claimant's identity was established based on her testimony and on the documents in the record, which included copies of a tazkira and passport which had been seized by the CBSA.2\n[6] The panel found that there were a number of serious difficulties with the claimant's evidence.\n[7] The claimant gave evidence that she told her narrative to her son, and her son interpreted and wrote the Basis of Claim (BOC).3 Despite the BOC containing many dates, such as birthdays, during her testimony the claimant could recall virtually no dates. She could not recall her own birthday, her son's birthday, the birthdays of her siblings, or her date of marriage. She could not recall whether her son had been born in Afghanistan or Pakistan. Although the BOC suggested that it had been Afghanistan, the claimant testified that it was probably Pakistan.\n[8] The panel asked why the claimant could not recall this information if she had only recently told it to her son so the BOC could be written. She stated that she told him the information long ago. When Tariq testified, he stated that he got some of the information from a relative in Afghanistan, but he could not recall the name of that relative. The panel was never able to achieve clarity on this issue of the BOC's authorship and draws a negative inference against the claimant. It is the claimant's burden to establish her case, and the panel can rightly expect the claimant to answer basic questions and provide clarity over simple items such as dates in her claim and how they came to be there.\n[9] The claimant was inconsistent and unclear about the dates that she lived in exile in Pakistan. The BOC indicated that the family lived in Pakistan from 1983 to 2009. The claimant testified, however, that the family moved back to Afghanistan once Karzai came to power. This would have been in 2002, however. When this was pointed out to the claimant, she corrected that it was a few years after he came to power, maybe halfway through Karzai's presidency that they moved back. This may have been roughly consistent with the claimant's BOC, as Karzai was in power from 2002 to 2014. While the claimant's memory difficulties may be one point to consider, the panel found the claimant's testimony on this point to be lacking credibility due to the inconsistency itself.\n[10] The claimant had a tazkira that had been issued on June 14, 2015. The panel asked why had the claimant not obtained one sooner? The claimant answered that she needed one for the Hajj pilgrimage she attended in August 2015. The claimant answered previously that \"there were no tazkiras at all. When the government ordered it, then we went to get one.\" The panel takes notice that tazkiras have been issued in Afghanistan for decades. The panel finds the claimant's answer in this respect was a deliberate misrepresentation and embellishment.\n[11] The BOC stated that the threat letter was received by her son in late 2013. However, the claimant testified, that it was approximately one year ago that her son received the threat letter. The claimant corrected herself and said maybe it was more than a year. Both of those answers, however, were inconsistent with the date on the letter itself which stated April 2013. Tariq testified that it was in approximately March 2013.\n[12] The claimant was questioned about the circumstances around the threat letter that XXXX received. She testified that it might have been received by XXXX at his office, but she was not entirely clear because XXXX typically kept things like that from her. When XXXX testified, however, he described that the letter was received by him at the house, and although he did keep things like this from the claimant, the claimant was present when it was received and when it was discussed among the family. XXXX described that the claimant was clear that the letter had been received at the home. On redirection by counsel, the claimant testified that yes, she was informed afterwards that the letter was received at the house. She was not aware where it was received because XXXX told her later. The panel finds this re-direction from counsel does not answer the inconsistency, as XXXX was unequivocally clear in his testimony that the claimant knew the letter was received at the home on the evening that it was received. The panel finds that the claimant was attempting to mislead and confuse this panel with her statement \"XXXX told me later.\" Clearly, she knew where the letter was received, and this statement was intended to distract the panel.\n[13] When the claimant asked who she went to Pakistan with, she answered that it was with her son, his wife, and their children. That is clearly contradictory to the BOC which clearly indicates that XXXX fled to Canada and never went to Pakistan. When asked to explain the contradiction, she stated she was in a dream-like state and did not understand words.\n[14] When the claimant returned from Pakistan, she started receiving phone calls from the Taliban. She told the panel she received 3 or 4 calls. Then she confirmed 3 or 4 again on questioning by her counsel. Counsel pointed out that the BOC says 7 calls. The claimant answered \"yes, either 4 or 7 or something like that. I didn't say 3.\" Counsel pointed out that yes, she did say 3, and there is a difference between 3 and 7. The claimant said yes, she received a few phone calls and that when she panics she doesn't know what she's saying.\n[15] The claimant testified that she went to the police. They told her to be careful, as they could not even protect themselves against the Taliban. On examination by her lawyer, she repeated and confirmed that she personally went to the police herself. However, the BOC stated that the claimant did not go to the police. When asked about this discrepancy, the claimant testified that she did not know. When asked why she went to the police, she stated because she was receiving the phone calls from the Taliban (which, according to the BOC, were received after she returned from Pakistan). Counsel asked if she went to the police before or after she went to Pakistan. The claimant answered that it was before, but she was not sure because her mind is not working. She said it could have been before or after Pakistan. XXXX also testified he was aware that the claimant had gone to the police, which is contrary to the BOC as well, and a significant inconsistency considering that XXXX also stated he helped the claimant write her BOC.\n[16] The claimant re-availed herself to Afghanistan on two occasions. First, she travelled to Pakistan shortly after her husband was killed, but returned to Afghanistan three months later. Her explanation was that she could not support herself in Pakistan and could not remain there. When asked about how she supported herself in Afghanistan, her answer was essentially the same, in that she moved around from one house to another, staying with others. She could not stay anywhere permanently.\n[17] The claimant then travelled to Saudi Arabia for the Hajj pilgrimage in August and September 2015, then returned to Afghanistan again. This was after the claimant had personally received threatening phone calls from the Taliban. The panel asked why the claimant did not flee with her son in January 2015. She stated that she had no idea how to do it and was only thinking about how to rescue her son at the time. It was only later that the people whom the claimant was living with began to suggest that she should try making a refugee claim, as they could not support her forever. XXXX also stated in his testimony that it was his scholarship which permitted his flight to Canada, and the claimant's refugee claim was only something they considered after some more time had passed. It was not until the claimant started receiving threats too that they realized she was also in danger. The panel questions the credibility of that statement, as clearly the threat letter targeted the entire family; furthermore, XXXX XXXX the claimant's husband, was allegedly targeted and killed. If the objective evidence is true, there should have been no question whatsoever that the entire family was in grave danger at all times.\n[18] The panel also notes that there is no objective evidence in the disclosure to link the claimant as XXXX mother. When the claimant entered Canada, XXXX retrieved her at Fort Erie. CBSA officers accepted her as an exception under the Safe Third Country Agreement on the basis that XXXX had named the claimant in his own BOC as his mother. However, there is no record that XXXX presented his tazkira, only his Ontario Health Card, his own BOC, and a copy of his own refugee acceptance notice. XXXX tazkira was also not present in the documentary evidence, even though he did present a great deal of information about himself in other forms - diplomas, transcripts, letters of reference, the night letter, and a death certificate for his father.4 The claimant's own tazkira and passport were coincidentally issued in 2015. Under the heading \"Family Members,\" there is no one listed on the claimant's tazkira.5 The panel did not question the claimant about any of these points so does not necessarily hold this adversely against the claimant. However, the panel does note that the absence of objective evidence certainly does not assist the panel, and in the result, the panel is left to rely upon the claimant's and Tariq's testimonial credibility that they are related.\n[19] The claimant testified that she has diabetes which has affected her mind. Her memory problems were also explained as trauma suffered because of her husband's death. XXXX also explained that culturally it was not normal for the claimant to face these kinds of questions. XXXX testified that with all of these circumstances combined, it is not surprising that the claimant would have poor recollection. In her submissions, counsel acknowledged the difficulties in the claimant's testimony, but emphasized that the claimant testified to the best of her ability in consideration of her limited ability and the factors that were affecting her memory. When looked at in a holistic manner, counsel submitted, there should be no credibility concerns for the panel.\nANALYSIS\n[20] Despite the very serious credibility concerns obviously apparent in the evidence, the panel must weigh those concerns against the threat that the claimant alleges, and whether it raises a serious possibility of persecution assessed against all of the evidence.\n[21] The panel notes that there was no medical evidence of the claimant's diabetes or psychological assessment.\n[22] The panel is mindful that the national documentation for Afghanistan clearly places unaccompanied women in a high-risk category for persecution and are subject to unique forms of persecution such as forced marriage.6\n[23] The panel is also mindful that a previous member of this Board has found XXXX claim to be credible.\n[24] The panel is also mindful of the unique difficulties and discrimination in day-to-day life that would be posed for an elderly unaccompanied female in Afghanistan who has suffered a traumatic experience. The panel makes reference to the Chairperson's Guidelines 4 and 8.7 Some of the relevant points from the Guidelines are as follows:\n[25] Guideline 4\n* The circumstances which give rise to women's fear of persecution are often unique to women.\n* The decision maker should consider, among other relevant factors, the social, cultural, religious, and economic context in which the claimant finds herself.\n* Decision makers should consider the fact that the forms of evidence which the claimant might normally provide....will not always be either available or useful in cases of gender-related persecution.\n* Women from certain cultures where men do not share the details of their political...or even social activities with their spouses, daughters or mothers may find themselves in a difficult situation when questioned about the experiences of their male relatives.\n[26] Guideline 8\n* Vulnerable persons are those whose ability to present their cases is severely impaired. Such persons may include...the elderly...and women who have suffered gender-related persecution.\n* Vulnerable persons frequently find the process difficult for various reasons, including language and cultural barriers and because they may have suffered traumatic experiences.\n* A person's vulnerability may affect memory, behaviour, and their ability to recount relevant events.\n* The vulnerable person may be suffering from symptoms that have an impact on the consistency and coherence of their testimony.\n* Vulnerable persons who fear persons in a position of authority may associate those involved in the hearing process with the authorities they fear.\n* A vulnerable person may be reluctant or unable to talk about their experiences.\n* An identification of vulnerability does not indicate the panel's acceptance of the alleged underlying facts. It is made for the purposes of procedural accommodation only, and does not predispose the panel to make a particular determination on the merits of the case.\n[27] The panel also notes that these Guideline considerations are not merely \"mitigating\" factors to explain difficulties in the evidence. The panel acknowledges and understands that these Guidelines are reminders that the very reason people seek refugee protection are due to the vulnerabilities themselves.\n[28] However, whether the vulnerabilities of a claimant are explained as mitigating circumstances for evidentiary flaws, or as key components that form the basis of claim itself, the panel must still find that the claim is credible in and of itself. In short, this claim simply was not. The flaws in the testimonial evidence were remarkable and pervaded almost every key aspect of the case. Where any of the inconsistencies or failures to recollect may have been explained through cultural difficulties, vulnerability, gender persecution, or psychological trauma, that rationale still does not redeem what this panel saw as attempts to evade questions, embellish, and mislead the panel as described above in the panel's review of the evidence. It remained unclear to this panel who was even the genuine author of the BOC and under what circumstances.\n[29] However, with those attempts to mislead and obfuscate the panel aside, even the nature of the recollection and inconsistency problems were not explained by the claimant's vulnerability and the Guideline considerations without further assistance, such as a psychological report or the claimant's diabetes records. Had the claimant legitimately dictated her own BOC, or if XXXX had helped her and there was even a minimal effort to have it read back to her afterwards, the panel should still be able to expect the claimant to recollect even the most basic of facts, such as:\nA. whether her son was born in Afghanistan or Pakistan;\nB. whether the family returned to Afghanistan in 2002 or 2009;\nC. where the threat letter was found, especially when, in the claimant's own words \"Tariq told me later\";\nD. whether XXXX was with her when she fled to Pakistan; and\nE. whether she went to the police or not.\n[30] Points C. and D. in particular are critically fatal to this claim, as those two points undermine the two most fundamental premises of this claim: in respect of C., the threat itself, and in respect of D., the claimant's flight as an unaccompanied woman.\n[31] This negative assessment of the evidence does not just apply to the claimant's testimony either. It applies to XXXX testimony as well. The lack of credibility in his evidence is particularly highlighted in point E. above, whether the claimant went to the police or not. It was left unexplained how both XXXX and the claimant could have made this mistake in the BOC when apparently they both worked on the BOC. Further, the panel also draws an adverse inference against XXXX inability to recall the relatives he spoke to in Afghanistan for dates in the BOC. XXXX lack of credibility on those two issues in particular does adversely impact the panel's view of the credibility of this claim overall.\nCONCLUSION\n[32] For all of the above reasons, the panel finds that this claim is not credible. There is not sufficient credible evidence to demonstrate a serious possibility of persecution against the claimant. The panel does not find that the claimant is a Convention refugee. The analysis above applies with respect to section 97 of IRPA as well. The panel does not find sufficient evidence, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is a person in need of protection. This claim is dismissed.\n(signed)\n\"D. McKeown\"\nD.

In November of the same year, the claimant was notified that he had to vacate his property within three months and that he would be compensated at an amount much lower than the assessed value of the land. The claimant attended the Xin Fang Lettering and Visiting Office on two occasions and appealed for fair compensation. On December 10, 2014, two police officers came to his home and took him to a detention centre, where they threatened to beat him to death if he went to the government office again. The claimant suffered a heart attack while in custody and had to recover at home for six months following heart surgery.\n[5] In February 2015, the claimant's land was taken from him and he contemplated suicide as a result of this loss of the only source of income for his family. On June 6, 2015, he went directly from his medical check-up to the Beijing Bureau of the Xin Fang Lettering and Visiting Office and held up a banner that called for the return of \"[his] land and [his] life.\" While he was hoping to attract the attention of officers inside the building, he ran and threw away the banner when he saw Public Security Bureau (PSB) officers from his local police force approach him. He went into hiding at a friend's home and heard from his wife that PSB officers left a summons for him to appear for questioning. The claimant hired a smuggler in July 2015 and left China on XXXX XXXX, 2015. Since his exit from China, he has heard from his wife that the PSB continues to seek him. The claimant made his claim for Canada's protection inland on XXXX XXXX, 2015.\n[6] The claimant seeks protection because of fear of harm and persecution on the grounds of imputed political opinion as a result of his stance against the land expropriation policy in China.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[7] The claimant did not submit the passport he used to travel to Canada into evidence. According to his testimony, the passport was fraudulent and retained by the smuggler who arranged the claimant's exit from China and entry into Canada. The panel was also not presented with the claimant's original Resident Identity Card (RIC), as it was seized3 by CIC at referral and a certified true copy4 of it disclosed to the Board.\n[8] At the hearing, the claimant submitted an original hukou5 for the panel's inspection, along with additional personal disclosure.6 With respect to the assessment of documents, section 106 of IRPA states:\nThe Refugee Protection Division must take into account, with respect to the credibility of a claimant, whether the claimant possesses acceptable documentation establishing identity, and if not, whether they have provided a reasonable explanation for the lack of documentation or have taken reasonable steps to obtain the documentation.\n[9] Similarly, Rule 11 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules states that \"[t]he claimant must provide acceptable documents establishing identity and other elements of the claim. A claimant who does not provide acceptable documents must explain why they were not provided and what steps were taken to obtain them.\"7\n[10] In assessing the authenticity of the claimant's documents the panel is guided by the Federal Court decision in Sertkaya,8 which asserts that it is open for the Board to consider the authenticity of documentary evidence, and the claimant's ability to obtain and use fraudulent documents. The panel is also guided by the Kazadi 9 decision wherein the Court ruled that if there are significant irregularities on the face of the claimant's key identity documents, the Board is not obliged to seek an expert assessment of those documents before determining their probative value. The panel is mindful of the Federal Court's decision in Rasheed10which asserts that while Canadian law holds that foreign documents purported to be issued by a competent foreign public official should be accepted as evidence of their contents, the Board is permitted, with valid reason, to doubt their authenticity.\n[11] For the following reasons, the panel does not accept the validity of the identity documents submitted by the claimant to establish his identity.\nClaimant's lack of a Resident Identity Card from 1991 to 2000 while residing in China\n[12] The claimant testified that the RIC, issued on January 26, 2000, was the second identity card that had been issued to him by Chinese authorities. He stated that he obtained his first card at the age of 18, in around 1981, and that the first RIC was valid for ten years, or until 1991. When the panel pointed out to the claimant that country documentation indicates that the RIC is issued to citizens of China when they reach 16 years of age,11 the claimant responded that it was 18, as that is the legal adult age in China. In addition to the inconsistency in the age at which his card was issued, the claimant also stated that after the first card expired in 1991, he did not obtain the second card, now seized by CIC, until 2000.\n[13] The panel notes that, in the absence of a valid passport, the Resident Identity Card is the most important document to establish the claimant's identity as a national of the People's Republic of China. As stated above, it is issued to all citizens of China who are over 16 years of age and serves as\na uniform legal document issued by the state to identify the status of the civilian. In compliance with legislation regulations, the items of the Resident ID Card shall include name, gender, nationality, date of birth, the address of the permanent residential place, the number of the Resident ID Card, the photo of the cardholder, the period of validity and the organization that signed and issued the card. The Resident ID Card number is the one and only lifetime code for the identity, compiled uniformly by the Public Security Bureau. The Resident ID Card and the identity code are mainly used for the identification of the status of the citizen, to safeguard a civilian's legal right and facilitate a civilian ['s] ... conduct [of] social activities.12 [emphasis added]\n[14] Taking into consideration the country documentary evidence on the official reliance on and usage of the RIC as an important identity document, the panel questioned the claimant about his ability to reside in China and engage in employment and social activities for a decade without a valid form of this key document. The claimant responded that as a farmer, he did not need it.\n[15] The panel notes that the above-referenced source goes on to indicate that after applying for a RIC in person, residents must make the card available to officials upon request:\nChinese citizens are not required to carry their identity card on their person at all times. However, when the PSB asks to check a person's identity, he\/she is obligated to present official identity documents. If unable to produce such documents, under normal circumstances, the person is allowed to return home or to his\/her work unit or any other place where his\/her identity documents are kept... However, in some cases, the PSB might detain the person until relatives or friends bring the identity documents to them.13 [citations omitted]\n[16] In light of the country documentation before it, the panel rejects the claimant's testimony as having resided in China while not in a possession of a valid RIC for nearly ten years without any need for it as unreasonable. The panel therefore draws an adverse inference in regard to the claimant's identity.\nUse of a fraudulent Hong Kong passport\n[17] The claimant did not submit the passport he used to travel to Canada into evidence. He testified that he never had a passport issued in his name nor ever travelled outside of China prior to his journey to Canada. The claimant testified that the passport cover was green, which meant that it was from Hong Kong, and that it contained his photograph and date of birth but another person's name, that of a \"Mr. XXXX XXXX XXXX.\" According to the claimant, the female smuggler who accompanied him on his flight to Toronto told him to throw the passport away and make a claim if intercepted by Canadian officials. Later the claimant stated that the smuggler told him that it was better for him to claim inland and that she kept the passport.\n[18] When asked what documents he had when he travelled out of China, the claimant testified that he travelled with no other identity documents, and that his wife had sent him all the personal documentation he presented to the Board from China when he filed his claim. This testimony is contrary to the documentary evidence which states that \"residents of mainland China travelling to Hong Kong and Macao require 'an Exit-entry Permit for traveling to Hong Kong and Macao and the valid endorsement'.\"14 In light of the security measures and customs controls as indicated in the National Documentation Package, the panel draws a negative inference regarding the claimant's identity.\n[19] The claimant testified that the only document he used was the false Hong Kong passport. This testimony is not consistent with the documentary evidence15 that indicates Chinese customs officials use computerized identity verification. The panel finds it reasonable to expect that if the claimant were using a fraudulent passport and had no other travel documents as he alleged, he would have been detected leaving China; furthermore, he would not have been allowed to leave mainland China and enter Hong Kong without an Exit-entry Permit as the appropriate endorsement. The panel finds that with the security measures and exit-entry controls in place, it would be reasonable to expect that all passengers boarding an aircraft would be subject to individual examination of their personal identity documents. The panel therefore draws a negative credibility inference with respect to the claimant's identity as a result of his testimony that is inconsistent with the objective country documentation before it.\nHousehold register (hukou)\n[20] The claimant provided a household register (hukou) in support of his personal and national identity. For the following reasons, the panel gives this document no weight in establishing the claimant's national identity. The hukou document contains minimal security features in the form of stamps and signatures by purported officials but no photographs of the individual(s) listed, holograms, or other elements more difficult to reproduce or manipulate. In addition, country documentation indicates that fraudulent documentation, including hukous, is widely available in China.16\n[21] Here the panel notes that the Federal Court has said that the Board is under no obligation to send further identity documents for forensic analysis.17 Moreover, the panel finds that the documents submitted by the claimant have less probative value, since they lack any of the safety and standard features of a national passport or even the Chinese Resident Identity Card in its more recent form. In reviewing the claimant's identity documents and the documentary evidence on the proliferation of fraudulent Chinese documents,18 and in the context of the above findings and case law, the panel gives little weight to these documents in terms of establishing the claimant's national identity.\n[22] In summary, the panel finds that the claimant has failed to provide sufficiently reliable and credible documentary evidence to establish, on a balance of probabilities, his identity as required by section 106 of IRPA and Rule 11 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules.19\n[23] The burden of establishing identity must be satisfied before the panel goes on to consider the merits of the claim and whether the claimant, in this case, faces a serious possibility of being persecuted or is a person in need of protection. In light of the previous findings and negative inferences, the panel finds on the basis of the totality of documentary evidence before it that the claimant has not established his identity.\n[24] Pursuant to subsection 107(2) of IRPA, when a panel determines not only that the evidence adduced is insufficient to establish the claim, but also that there is no credible or trustworthy evidence on which the claim could have been accepted, then the \"no credible basis\" provision is used. As the claimant's identity is the springboard for the issues within the claim, thereby going to the basis of the claim itself, the failure to establish his identity leaves the panel with no evidence on which it could make a positive finding.\n[25] On the basis of the totality of the evidence and the cumulative findings and negative inferences noted above, the panel finds that the claimant has not established his identity and has not satisfied his burden of establishing a serious possibility that he would be persecuted or that he would be personally subjected to a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture, if he were to return to China.\nCONCLUSION\n[26] Based on the foregoing analysis, the panel determines that the claimant has not established, on a balance of probabilities, his claim on the basis of credible and trustworthy evidence, and has not established the central element of the claim: that he is wanted by the PSB for protesting the unfair expropriation of and compensation for his leased farm property in China.\n[27] Considering the totality of the evidence and the cumulative effect of the credibility findings set out above the panel finds that the claimant is neither a Convention refuge pursuant to section 96 nor a person in need of protection under subsection 97(1) of IRPA.\n[28] The panel also finds that pursuant to subsection 107(2) of IRPA, the claimant provided no credible or trustworthy evidence on which a favourable decision could be made, and therefore there is no credible basis for the claim. The claim is rejected.\n(signed)\n\"M. Moc\"\nM.

The claimants claim to be citizens of Colombia. They are claiming refugee protection in Canada pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)1.\n[2] These claims were heard jointly pursuant to Rule 55 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules.\n[3] In accordance with section 167(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the Refugee Protection Division appointed the principal claimant to be the designated representative of the minor claimant for the purpose of this refugee claim.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The details of the claimants' allegations are documented in their Basis of Claim Forms (BOC)2 and in the oral testimony of the principal claimant.\n[5] The claimant fears the guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The principal claimant's son is a substance abuser who owes a debt to the FARC. The minor claimant was subjected to robbery on two occasions by members of the FARC and threatened with forced recruitment if her brother continued to evade FARC. The claimants left Colombia on XXXX XXXX, 2016.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] The panel determines that the claimants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection pursuant to section 96 and 97(1) of IRPA.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[7] The panel finds that the claimants have established, on a balance of probabilities, their personal identities and national identities through their testimony and the disclosure of their identity documents, namely their passports.3\nCredibility\nThe principal claimant\n[8] The principal claimant testified that her life is at risk in Colombia from the FARC who is targeting her and the minor claimant. There is no evidence before the panel that the principal claimant has ever been contacted or targeted by the FARC. There is no evidence before the panel that the FARC has searched for the principal claimant in the past or is actively searching for and targeting the principal claimant now. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no persuasive evidence to indicate that the FARC is interested in the principal claimant. The panel finds that the lack of evidence of any interest by the FARC in the principal claimant undermines the principal claimant's allegations that she faces a serious possibility of persecution or would be subject to a danger of torture or a risk to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment at the hands of the FARC if she returned to Colombia.\nThe minor claimant\n[9] The minor claimant has been the target of two robberies, once in October 2015 and a second time in November 2015. On both occasions the minor claimant was robbed of her personal possessions and identity documents while she was returning from school. There is no evidence before the panel that the FARC issued any threats against the minor claimant during the first incident. The principal claimant states in her BOC that after the minor claimant and her companion were robbed of their personal property, they were let go. It was only during the second occasion that the perpetrators told the minor claimant that they were from FARC and threatened that the next time they saw the minor claimant she would be forcibly recruited if her brother continued to hide from FARC. The FARC members also took credit for the first robbery against the minor claimant. The principal claimant testified that neither she nor the minor claimant had any further contact from FARC since the second robbery in November 2015. The claimants left Colombia on XXXX XXXX, 2016. There is no evidence before the panel that the minor claimant was targeted in a serious, systematic, repetitive, persistent, or relentless manner. There is no evidence before the panel that the mistreatment suffered by the minor claimant constituted a key denial of a core human right. The panel finds that while being the target of a mugging is undoubtedly a distressing and alarming experience, the panel does not find, on a balance of probabilities, that two incidents of muggings, during which the minor claimant's personal belongings were taken, and one incident of a verbal threat being issued against the minor claimant constitute \"a fundamental violation of human dignity\".4 The panel finds that there is insufficient persuasive evidence which indicates that the harm suffered by the minor claimant was sustained or was a systemic violation of her basic human rights.5 While the minor claimant does not have to establish she has been persecuted in the past, the panel notes that \"evidence of past persecution is one of the most effective means of showing that a fear of future persecution is objectively well-founded.\"6 The panel finds that the lack of persuasive evidence of persecution by the FARC perpetrated against the minor claimant undermines the claimants' allegations that the minor claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution or would be subject to a danger of torture or a risk to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment at the hands of FARC if she returned to Colombia.\nNo contact by the FARC since November 2015\n[10] The principal claimant has never had any personal contact with FARC. The minor claimant encountered FARC members on two occasions, once in October 2015 and a second time in November 2015. The claimants left Colombia on XXXX XXXX, 2016. The claimants were not contacted by FARC in any manner after the minor claimant's second mugging in November 2015, despite the fact that the minor claimant's personal identity documents were taken by FARC and furthermore, despite the fact that there is no evidence that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has been captured by FARC and presumably continues to evade FARC. The panel finds the lack of evidence of any action by the FARC to target the claimants in any way since November 2015, and furthermore the lack of action by the FARC to target the claimants in a serious, systematic, repetitive, persistent, or relentless manner undermines the claimants' allegations that they face a serious possibility of persecution or would be subject to a danger of torture or a risk to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment at the hands of FARC if they returned to Colombia.\nThe claimants' family members in Colombia\n[11] The principal claimant's mother and two half-siblings reside in Colombia. The claimants resided with the principal claimant's mother since November 2015 until they left Colombia. The principal claimant testified that neither her mother nor her siblings have had any problems with FARC or were ever contacted by FARC. The principal claimant's former common-law spouse and the minor claimant's father, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, also reside in Colombia. The principal claimant testified that he has not had any problems or contact with FARC. The claimants disclosed a statement from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and he makes no mention in his statement that he has had any problems or contact with FARC.7 The principal claimant states in her BOC that \"FARC takes action against close relatives of the persons that they are going after\". In this context, the panel finds it is reasonable then to expect that the principal claimant would have been contacted by FARC in FARC's search for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and that the principal claimant's mother and siblings would have been contacted by FARC in FARC's search for the claimants. The panel finds it would also be reasonable to expect that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX would have been contacted by FARC, given that he was the step-parent of XXXX XXXX, the former spouse of the principal claimant, and is the father of the minor claimant. Yet, there is no evidence before the panel that any of these family members have been contacted, despite the principal claimant's allegations that the FARC takes action against close relatives of persons of interest. The panel finds that the lack of action by the FARC to contact any of the immediate family members of the claimants undermines the claimants' allegations that they face a serious possibility of persecution or would be subject to a danger of torture or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment at the hands of FARC if they returned to Colombia.\nForward-looking risk\n[12] The definition of Convention refugee is forward-looking and the panel is tasked with assessing whether the claimants have good grounds for fearing persecution in the future. The panel has also carefully considered whether the claimants are persons in need of protection. The principal claimant has never been personally contacted by FARC nor has the FARC ever issued any threats against her. There is no persuasive evidence that the FARC is interested in the principal claimant. The minor claimant has been the target of two muggings and a verbal threat. The panel finds there is no persuasive evidence that the claimants have suffered harm that amounts to persecution at the hands of the FARC. The panel finds there is no persuasive evidence that the FARC is currently searching for the claimants or is currently interested in the claimants. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that there is insufficient persuasive evidence before the panel that the claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution or would be subject to a danger of torture or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment at the hands of FARC if they returned to Colombia.\nCONCLUSION\n[13] The panel has considered all the grounds of protection under section 96 and subsection 97(1) of IRPA and based on the totality of the evidence determines that the claimants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of IRPA.\n[14] Their claims are therefore rejected.\n(signed)\n\"A.

Spoken through the principal claimant and designated representative, the claimants alleged that they are at risk of serious harm in Nigeria at the hands of members of the principal claimant's husband's family - the family of the minor claimant's father - and others acting for them. They assert that they cannot expect effective State protection domestically.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] I determine the claimants not to be Convention refugees or persons in need of Canada's protection. The evidence in areas crucial to the claims lacks credibility. It has not been established on the balance of probabilities that the claimants have the experience alleged. It has not been established that there is a serious possibility that they would be persecuted were they to return to Nigeria. There is no credible basis to the claims.\nANALYSIS\n[3] In holding the hearing and in assessing and determining the claims, I have been closely mindful of the cautions and instructions set out in the Chairperson's Gender Guidelines1 and the Board's Child Guidelines.2 I have also examined and assessed the weight to be assigned to a psychotherapist'sa report filed in the claims, and the submissions of counsel rendered orally.\n[4] The principal claimant is 36 years of age and states that she is legally and traditionally married. She has one living child, the minor claimant. It is alleged that her young daughter died after a very short illness during the claimants' period of hiding in a village in Nigeria before the claimants travelled to the United States to Canada in or about XXXX 2016.\n[5] It is alleged that the principal claimant is a university graduate in the field of Public Administration. She states that she worked in that field for four years. The claimants and the principal claimant's husband lived in their family home in Benin City where the husband continues to reside at present.\n[6] The principal claimant was asked if she was a member of any organization. She cited the Administrative Staff College of Nigeria. She mentioned no other organizations and was asked if she considered a church an organization. She responded, \"okay\" and then stated that she did not know. She was prompted with the question whether she was a member of any church. She responded affirmatively citing the Living Faith Church in Lagos, Nigeria. She explained that she did not consider her church an organization. She was asked when she last worked in Nigeria outside her home. She responded, 2005. When she was asked what she did after that, she initially responded that she did nothing. When she was asked if she was raising her family, she replied affirmatively. She was then asked if she did anything else. She responded in the negative. She was asked if her husband supported her and she replied affirmatively, adding that he is a businessman. It was pointed out to the claimant later in the hearing that she had declared in a background immigration declaration3 that she had worked in at least two positions and for at least two organizations for several years from 2008 onwards. She explained that when she earlier stated that she had not worked outside the home since 2005, she misspoke and meant 2015. Although on its own, this testimony and the explanation could be found reasonable and reliable, in the context of the claims as a whole and the credibility findings herein, I reject the principal claimant's explanations in this important area of the claims. In part, this is because this claimant was specifically reminded about her earlier testimony as to her not having worked outside the home since 2005. She confirmed that this testimony was correct. In my view, her mind was specifically turned, on at least two occasions at the hearing, to the question of her employment identity at times material to the claims. I am not satisfied that it has been adequately and credibly explained why this claimant on two occasions in her hearing gave one timeframe for when she stopped working outside her home both of which remained inconsistent with her declarations made in other contexts with immigration officials in Canada. If the claimant misspoke the first time she testified in this area of the examination, she did not misspeak the second time, but rather provided confirmation when she heard her testimony being repeated to her by the panel.\n[7] In the very next area of the examination, another significant evidentiary discrepancy arose, this one much more fundamental to the core allegations in the claims, and remained inadequately overcome. Despite and following a long, well-paced and methodical examination on the minor claimant's educational level and attendance at school, and despite time and opportunity for the principal claimant to reflect on and indeed even recall her own declarations made in her Basis of Claim form and immigration declarations, her oral testimony created a sharp conflict between the crucial question of whether or not the claimants were in hiding several hours away from Benin City for some five months or more before their departure from Nigeria, and whether the minor claimant continued to be taken to and picked up from his private school in Benin City. For example, the principal claimant testified under oath that the minor claimant continued to attend school right until the time that the claimants left Nigeria. The principal claimant had testified that both her husband and she drove and that although her husband drove the minor claimant to and from school most times, she did so on occasion. When asked whether there was a vacation break at school at the time the claimants left Nigeria, she responded in the negative and confirmed that school was in progress.\n[8] The claimant was then asked if she ever went into hiding in Nigeria. She responded affirmatively stating that this was on XXXX XXXX, 2015. She stated that she did so until she left Nigeria on XXXX XXXX, 2016. She elaborated that she and the minor claimant, and for a time her daughter, hid in a few places: She was asked how many, and she responded \"about four\". She was asked if she meant four, or indeed \"about four\". She responded, \"four\", and apologized. She explained that she was counting out the places of hiding out. Although this explanation could be found plausible in other circumstances, in the circumstances of these claims, I am not satisfied that it has been established on sufficient trustworthy evidence that the principal claimant's allegations in this important area of the claims has been truthful or has any reliable basis. She was asked, for example, whether she listed all four places of hiding in her background immigration schedule;4 she responded in the negative. She was asked why she did not do so, and she stated that she did not know that she had to be so thorough. She was reminded that the schedule asks claimants to list all addresses. She explained that her thinking was that the places of hiding that she did not list were not so important as the two \"basic\" places. She repeated that she did not know that she had to be that thorough.\n[9] Although she provided some consistent testimony concerning some of the dates and places of hiding, she again gave vacillating testimony when she stated that she and her son went to Abuja City where they remained in hiding for four months; she changed her testimony during the same juncture in the examination to five months explaining that she counted the months wrong. She confirmed that Abuja is five hours from Benin City. She also testified, and provided written evidence, that in Abuja she and her son stayed at her younger sister's home. She was asked if she was not concerned that she might be found there by the agents of persecution who were hunting for her in order to force her to undertake traditional rights and to undergo circumcision. She responded initially that she was concerned. She was then asked if she was ever found at her sister's home, and she stated that she was not. When she was asked if that surprised her, she responded in the negative and then when the question was posed again, responded that she was surprised that she was not found there. She was then asked if she had any thoughts on why she was not located at her own sister's home. She responded, \"I guess, probably because I wasn't coming out\"; she added that if she had to go out, she took extreme measures and it was mostly she who was going out.\n[10] When it was pointed out to her that she had earlier stated that the minor claimant was continuing to attend school in Benin City right until the time the claimants left Nigeria, and asked if that testimony was true, she responded in the negative. She then was asked why she provided such testimony about her son's schooling earlier in the examination. She responded that most times she forgets things and things get mixed up in her mind. She added that the children had to stop school when she and the children left Benin City to go into hiding. She stated that she and the children were always afraid that if they went to school, their uncles knew where the schools were. She confirmed that if she and the children had remained in the family home in Benin City and not gone into hiding, then she and one or more of the children would have been forced to undertake rituals including circumcision and \"probably more\". She elaborated that she meant by probably more, physical torture and mental torture. She clarified that the agents of persecution wanted her and her late daughter to be circumcised.\n[11] Evidence relating to a refugee claimant's alleged place, period and fact of hiding is, in my view, generally of crucial importance in the examination, assessment and determination of the claimant's claim. I do not accept that it has been established on the balance of probabilities that there exists against the claimants or either one of them any campaign of threats or mistreatment in Nigeria.\n[12] The immigration forms generated at the time the claimants first stated their intention to make a refugee claim in Canada were completed in typewritten form, and signed by the claimant and dated.\n[13] The principal claimant stated, for example, that her Schedule \"A\" Background Declaration Form5 was typed out at her counsel's office. She stated that she was not there at the time of the typing, but that she had given her handwritten form to counsel's office and the form was then typed out and completed at the office. She confirmed that once typed out, it was presented to her for review and signature in counsel's office. She confirmed that there were then written additions to the form and further confirmed that those additions were her own. She was asked whether she handwrote those additions, and she responded affirmatively. She therefore had at least two opportunities to turn her mind to the question of these handwritten additions on the Schedule \"A\" document and confirmed that it was she who provided them on the form. Her counsel then held up the form and she then altered her testimony stating that some of the additions in handwriting are hers.\n[14] The claimant was asked why in the addresses' section of Schedule \"A\" there were no typewritten addresses of the places of alleged hiding. She responded that she did not think that she had to be so thorough. Only three addresses were originally noted on the Schedule \"A\" addresses' section, those being her family's two addresses in Benin City over the past 10 or more years cumulatively and, very significantly, her very short stay of some few days in Canada between the time of her arrival in Canada with the minor claimant and the date she signed the Schedule \"A\" document. In my view, that she, a represented principal claimant and designated representative, provided in formal, typewritten form, a very brief Canadian address but left out some four alleged places of hiding in Nigeria has not been shown to have any credible or reasonable basis. On my review of the division's version of the claimant's Schedule \"A\" document, it is clear to the naked eye that an alteration was made in the box and column within the addresses' section of the schedule where the end date was placed corresponding to when the claimant was at her final Benin City address.\n[15] In my view, based on the circumstances and the findings herein, more likely than not, when the Schedule \"A\" document was originally typed out the end date placed beside her family's last address in Benin City was XXXX 2016 when the claimants left Nigeria. An alteration was performed in my view by whiting out the XXXX 2016 end date and replacing it with the date the claimants are alleged to have gone into hiding. The principal claimant herself stated that she was not able to remember putting in the typewritten end date of XXXX 2016 for her last Benin address. She stated that she could not remember what end date was typed in to the form to reflect the time until which she stayed at her last home in Benin City.\n[16] On a careful examination of this area of the claims, it is my view that it would not make any sense for the represented claimant, or her counsel's office, to have placed in the addresses section of the Schedule \"A\" document only three addresses initially and not account for all of the claimants' time in Nigeria before leaving that country for Canada. For these reasons and the reasons stated above, it is my view that it has not been established on the balance of probabilities that the claimants were in hiding in Nigeria as alleged or at all. If they had been in hiding, more likely than not the evidence in this critical area of the claims would have been provided to the Canadian immigration and refugee authorities in a much more consistent and credible fashion and the originally typed Schedule \"A\" document, an important background declaration, would not have had the significant omissions of the alleged addresses in hiding.\n[17] In my view, it has also not been established on sufficient reliable evidence and on the balance of probabilities that the claimants traveled to the United States on their own genuine Nigerian passports, as alleged in the claims. The principal claimant was asked at her hearing whether she ever applied for any visas to any country before she came to Canada. She replied in the negative. The question was asked of her again. She changed her response and answered affirmatively not knowing why she initially stated that she had not ever applied for any visas to any countries. She stated that she did not travel to Canada on her genuine passport and was instructed to surrender her passport and the minor claimant's passport to the agent once they arrived in Florida.\n[18] The principal claimant stated that she had no relatives or friends either in Florida or in New Jersey where the claimants spent cumulatively some three weeks before proceeding, allegedly with the help of an agent, to the Canadian border. She alleged, however, that she has relatives elsewhere in the U.S. and stated that they were her husband's second cousins. She testified that they lived in Boston. She could not remember any other relatives in the U.S. She knew the U.S. to be a large country and it has not been established that her testimony is reliable when she alleges that she was too afraid of her husband's relatives who both reside in the U.S. and travel there, to make a refugee claim for herself and the minor claimant. She also testified that she was following the instructions of the agent who had advised her that Canada is a safer place than Nigeria. She alleged that the agent had also advised her to follow his instructions. Consequently, she alleged, when she arrived at the airport in Florida following her international flight from Nigeria, and was asked by an immigration officer what the purpose of her trip to the U.S. was, she responded that she and the minor claimant had come to the U.S. for a vacation. She was asked at her hearing if this was the truth. She responded in the negative. She alleged that she did not know how to make a refugee claim in the U.S. and was following the instructions of the agent.\n[19] In my view, on the examination of the totality of the evidence, the principal claimant's failure to assert a plea for international protection at the first reasonable opportunity and as soon as she and the minor claimant were out of the reach of her oppressors has not been established to have a reasonable or credible basis. The principal claimant's conduct in this regard has not been shown to have been consistent with the alleged experience, fears and risk. It has not been shown to be consistent with the conduct of a genuine refugee bearing in mind the claimants' personal circumstances. Many refugee claimants assert refugee claims at borders and in countries despite linguistic, educational and other impediments. By contrast, the principal claimant spoke and understood English6 and alleges to have graduated with a university degree in Public Administration. Although she asserted that she had neither relatives nor friends in Canada when she and the minor claimant came to Canada, it has not been established on the balance of probabilities that the claimants either left Nigeria, travelled to and through the U.S., arrived at the Canadian border or made their inland refugee claims for any refugee reasons.\n[20] There are risk profiles in Nigeria, some of which include women and children. However, these represented claimants had, and made us of their, reasonable opportunity to advance in their Canadian refugee claims the reasons why they feared returning to Nigeria. In my view, based on the claimants' representation by counsel who is a barrister and solicitor having experience in refugee matters, it may be reasonably presumed that no other fears or risks beyond those elaborated in their refugee claims exist. If they did, in my view, more likely than not they would have been included and enumerated in the refugee claims. It has therefore not been established on the balance of probabilities that the claimants have a well-founded fear of persecution in Nigeria for any Convention reason; it has not been established that there is in Nigeria a risk to their lives, risk of cruel and unusual punishment or treatment, or danger of torture.\n[21] The principal claimant also testified that she did not see any border officials because she and the minor claimant were hiding behind cartons in the back of a van driven by the agent across the U.S.-Canada border. The principal claimant stated that there was no back-up plan discussed in the event that the claimants were detected either by U.S. or Canadian officials during the border crossing.\n[22] The principal claimant testified that in her generic application form for Canada,7 the handwritten notes added to the typewritten and completed form were the immigration officer's. The principal claimant elaborated that the immigration officer was asking her questions and writing the information on to the completed form. This claimant added that the handwritten additions on to page 1 of 4 of her Schedule \"A\" background declaration were similarly those of the immigration officer. Although, based on my global findings of lack of trustworthiness of the principal claimant as a witness in the proceeding, I do not accept that it has been established on the balance of probabilities that the handwritten additions in the generic application form for Canada and page 1 of 4 of Schedule \"A\" were those of the immigration officer, my finding in this regard is in my view in consequential to the analysis and conclusions herein. What is of primary significance with respect to written additions in any of the forms, is that the represented principal claimant, herself, initially left out highly significant information at the time of the typing of the answers in the background declaration and did not adequately explain in my view, (1) why she left out those crucial allegations in the typewritten portions of the background declaration, and (2) why she additionally provided handwritten allegations as to a period and place of hiding several hours from Benin City for some five or more months before leaving Nigeria during which time the minor claimant continued to attend school in Benin City, one of the very sites of alleged persecution.\n[23] When the claimant was explaining that she did not know the process of making a refugee claim in the U.S., she added that no one had explained to her how to make a claim in the U.S. When the principal claimant, acting on her own and on her minor son's behalf, elected to altogether bypass the U.S., the world's best known democracy, and instead come illegally and secretively into Canada to seek Canadian refugee protection, she had no way of knowing, based on evidence properly before me, what degree of success these particular claims would have in the context of her conduct at times material to the claims.\n[24] Because I reject the reliability of the testimony and evidence of the principal claimant, I am not satisfied that it has been established that the supporting documents she has provided, particularly from sources highly proximate to her and having an interest in the outcome of the proceeding, are reliable on the balance of probabilities. With respect to the psychotherapist's report and the findings, diagnoses and conclusions therein, it has not been established that the psychotherapist would have come to the diagnostic findings and conclusions independently of the principal claimant's account provided to the therapist. Even if the diagnoses and observations were made independently of the principal claimant's account and allegations, no credible link has been made between the diagnoses and observations and the refugee allegations. Very serious allegations have been advanced in the refugee claims. These include a nationwide campaign and hunt against the claimants and the suspicious passing of family members.\n[25] In my view, based on the findings and analysis herein, it has not been established on sufficient reliable evidence and on the balance of probabilities that the passing of family members has a reliable connection to the refugee allegations.\n[26] Country condition documents from reliable sources, including those referred to by counsel in submissions, supports the allegation that circumcision and other rites and ceremonies continue in several parts of the country; similarly, in some or all of those parts of the country, segments of the population believe in witchcraft and pursue those suspected of being witches and practicing witchcraft. There is also indication in the country documents that police authorities at times treat such traditional matters as falling outside the scope of their jurisdiction and capacity. However, in my view, the evidentiary record does not permit me, nor in my opinion would it permit a decision-maker, to allow the claims in that there was no credible or trustworthy evidence on which to base a positive decision in the claims.\nCONCLUSION\n[27] Based on the foregoing analysis and having reviewed the evidence properly before me, the submissions and being guided by the Guidelines applicable in the claims, I conclude that the claimants do not have a well-founded fear of persecution in Nigeria for any Convention reason. I conclude that there has not been established a risk in Nigeria to the claimants' lives, risk of cruel and unusual punishment or treatment, or danger of torture. There is not a serious possibility that the claimants would be persecuted were they to return to Nigeria. There is no credible basis to the claims.\n[28]\nAccordingly, I determine the claimants not to be Convention refugees or persons in need of Canada's protection. The Division, therefore, rejects their claims and finds there to be no credible basis to the claims.\n(signed)\n\"B. Popatia\"\nB.

While born in Sialkot, Pakistan, he has lived since 2003 in Oman, as a temporary resident. This residency is based on the claimant being a sponsored dependent of his father, who in turn is sponsored by an employer.\n[3] The claimant alleges that after a Pakistani Muslim friend in Oman, XXXX XXXX XXXX, showed interest in the Christian faith, he attended a Christmas party at the claimant's home and was later brought by the claimant to a church in Oman. The friend's father found out and accused the claimant of trying to convert his son. He threatened to make false charges against the claimant in Oman, which would lead to the claimant being deported to Pakistan. He further threatened to make false blasphemy charges against the claimant in Pakistan.\n[4] Afraid of being arrested in Oman, the claimant applied for a United States visa. After receiving his US visa in XXXX 2016, he began making arrangements to leave in XXXX 2016 but on February 15, 2016, he was questioned by police about the allegations his friend's father, XXXX XXXX XXXX, made against him. He was advised that he could not leave the country during their investigation. At the beginning of March 2016, the claimant was advised by the police that they were done their investigation and he was free to leave, but that they would be keeping an eye on him in Oman.\n[5] The claimant left for the US on XXXX XXXX, 2016, and subsequently came to Canada to seek protection. A few days after his departure from Oman, XXXX XXXX XXXX called the claimant's father and said that the claimant is to stay away from Oman, Pakistan, and his son.\n[6] The claimant fears harm from XXXX XXXX XXXX in both Oman and Pakistan. He also fears being targeted by other Muslim extremists in Pakistan.\nDETERMINATION\n[7] The panel finds, for the reasons that follow, that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[8] The identity of the claimant as a national of Pakistan has been established by the supporting personal supporting documentation filed, including copies of his Pakistani passport and birth certificate,5 which also indicate the claimant's religion as Christianity.\n[9] Regarding the claimant's personal identity and the various names noted in the Introduction, the panel notes that his given name is consistently XXXX, with his last name left blank on some documents6 while elsewhere it is listed as either his father's full name (XXXX XXXX)7 or given name (XXXX XXXX,8 with the difference in spelling for the fathers given name accepted to be merely a difference in transliteration (from Urdu to English). The panel finds that the claimant's documentation all pertain to the same individual, with variations on how the last name is recorded.\n[10] Other supporting documentation provided9 also established the claimant's involvement with churches in Pakistan, and Oman, and with the Christian community here in Canada.\nCredibility\n[11] In assessing credibility, the panel is mindful of the claimant's education and background. The panel notes that the claimant is relatively young at 20-years-old. While he has completed secondary school, he has no formal work experience and little experience living apart from his immediate family.\n[12] The panel also took into consideration some of the difficulties that a claimant can face in the hearing room, including cultural factors, the milieu of the hearing room, and the stress inherent in responding to oral questions through an interpreter.\n[13] The panel notes that in assessing credibility, in addition to such concerns as inconsistencies and omissions in a claimant's testimony, a panel is entitled to make reasonable findings based on implausibilities, common sense, and rationality. In gauging credibility, the panel considered whether the claimant's alleged actions were in \"harmony with the preponderance of the probabilities which a practical and informed person would readily recognize as reasonable in that place and in those conditions.\"10\n[14] The panel had the following credibility concerns with the claimant's allegations.\n[15] The claimant was asked whether he had any pictures of his friend, and he stated that he did, but not with him now. The panel finds it reasonable to expect the claimant to have provided something to support the existence of his friend. The panel finds that the claimant has not established that he has a friend named XXXX XXXX XXXX, let alone that he brought him to a church.\n[16] The claimant was asked by the panel about whether he had thought that bringing his Muslim friend to a Christian church would be inviting problems, and he stated that he did not. The panel does not find this reasonable, given that Oman is a Muslim country and given that his friend is a Pakistani Muslim. The claimant would reasonably be aware of how the Muslim societies that he has been raised in view things like religious conversion, especially after his friend's father's alleged reaction to the Christmas party. The panel finds the claimant's alleged actions to be implausible in the circumstances and draws a negative inference from this.\n[17] The panel notes that it has before it a letter from the church in Oman. While the panel gives the letter full weight and finds it to have probative value with regards to establishing the claimants religious identity, the panel finds it to be of little probative value in establishing the claimants other allegations. The panel notes that much of the writer's information comes from the claimant himself. The panel notes as well that the author is not before it for questioning or available as a witness. The panel gives the letter little weight towards establishing the situation in Oman related to XXXX and his father.\n[18] The panel notes that while the claimant provided the church letter containing second-hand information about the problems in Oman, the claimant has not provided a statement from his father, who is in a position to provide first-hand information about the problems before the claimant left Oman, as well as the alleged calls by XXXX XXXX XXXX after the claimant left the country. The panel finds it reasonable to expect such a corroborating statement from the claimant, if the incidents set out in the allegations did in fact occur. The panel finds that the claimant has not put forward the best available evidence to establish his case.\n[19] The claimant obtained his US visa in XXXX 2016 and did not leave Oman until XXXX 2016. He was asked about his delay for departure at the hearing, and he stated, as he did in his BOC, that he was prevented from leaving Oman due to a police investigation stemming from false allegations made against him by XXXX XXXX XXXX. The panel asked the claimant whether he had any documents from the police in Oman and he stated he did not. The panel finds it reasonable to expect some documentation to be available, either from the time of investigation and clearance by police, or requested later for the claimants refugee hearing. The panel draws a negative inference from the lack of reasonably available supporting documentation.\n[20] The panel finds that the claimant has not provided sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to establish, on a balance of probabilities, his alleged problems in Oman. The panel finds these to be an embellishment to buttress his claim for protection. As such, the panel does not find the claimant to face a risk in Pakistan related to the alleged incidents in Oman involving XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[21] The panel finds that even if the problems in Oman were established, on a balance of probabilities, the panel does not find that this creates problems for the claimant in Pakistan. The panel finds that there is little beyond speculation to establish that the friend's father would know that the claimant was in Pakistan, would know where he is, or that he would have the means or motivation to have blasphemy charges brought against the claimant in Pakistan. The claimant suggested that he could also be located through Facebook, and the panel asked about the possibility of not putting his location on Facebook. The claimant then suggested that he would feed like a criminal in hiding if he did not go on Facebook and wondered about the effect it would have on his social life. The panel finds this to be a rather trivial concern, and finds there to be a difference between not identifying ones location on Facebook and living as a fugitive. The panel finds that without unreasonable restrictions, the claimant could likely keep his whereabouts unknown from XXXX XXXX XXXX. The panel finds it has not been established that Mr. XXXX would have any further interest in the claimant, once he has been removed from his sons life, which he has.\n[22] The panel notes that the claimant has been a sponsored dependent of his father in Oman and has now finished his studies, which puts his status in Oman in a precarious situation. The panel finds this likely to be the reason the claimant applied for a Canadian visa in 2015, an application the panel notes was refused.\n[23] At the hearing, the claimant indicated that he had applied in XXXX 2015 for a Canadian visa. When asked why he had looked to travel to Canada at that time, the claimant stated that he wanted to go abroad for studies. The panel asked the claimant whether he would have studied or made a refugee claim if he had received the Canadian visa in XXXX 2015. The claimant stated that the purpose was just to study and he did not have problems at that time. The panel does not find this to be reasonable or credible. The panel notes that the claimant's status in Oman, even without facing problems there, is tentative and temporary in nature, and that the only country he has permanent residence in is Pakistan. The panel further notes that in addition to his fear of problems in Pakistan stemming from the situation in Oman, the claimant also expressed concern returning as a Christian, given the situation facing Christians generally in Pakistan. As such, it would be reasonable to expect him to seek protection, like his brother who came to Canada as a student and subsequently sought protection here.11 His statement that he was not planning to do so does not ring true.\n[24] The panel notes as well that the claimant did not apply for his Canadian visa in XXXX 2015, but rather XXXX 2015,12 the same month his problems began in Oman. The panel notes that after years of living problem-free in Oman, it is not until late 2015 and early 2016 that the claimant experiences problems, concurrent with his making efforts to obtain visas to study abroad in North America. The panel finds the coincidental timing of his alleged problems and his visa applications raises questions as to the veracity of his allegations, and subsequently finds this to be in keeping with its earlier finding that the alleged problems in Oman were an embellishment.\n[25] The panel also asked the claimant about some of his actions, including his failure to claim in the US, and his multiple returns to Pakistan from Oman.\n[26] The panel finds the claimant's explanation for his failure to claim in the US to be not unreasonable, and notes that the family exception to the Safe Third Country Agreement, under which he entered Canada and filed his claim, allows individuals to seek protection where they have close family support. The panel does not draw a negative inference from his failure to claim in the US.\n[27] The panel did, however, have concerns with the claimant's multiple returns to Pakistan over the years.13 His 2012 issued passport shows trips to Pakistan from December 2012 to January 2013; in July 2013; from December 2013-January 2014; and December 2014 - January 2015. When asked about this, the claimant stated that these were only short visits and indicated that there was a difference between returning for a short visit and returning to live. While the panel accepts that it is different to return somewhere to live permanently versus going to visit for a month, the panel does not find this reasonably explains the annual visits by the claimant and his family, if there were a danger to be faced.\n[28] The panel finds the claimant and his family's actions in repeatedly returning to Pakistan to be consistent with a lack of subjective fear. The panel finds that this also raises concerns as to the objective well-foundedness of his fear as a Christian in Pakistan, as it is not reasonable that he and his family would return so often, if the general situation facing Christians presented them with a risk of harm.\n[29] The panel notes that the National Documentation Package (NDP)14 does report on a number of serious human rights concerns in Pakistan, including \"extrajudicial and targeted killings, disappearances, torture, lack of rule of law (including lack of due process, poor implementation and enforcement of laws, and frequent mob violence and vigilante justice), and sectarian violence.\"15\n[30] Sectarian violence and discrimination against religious minorities are reported throughout the documentation, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Members of Religious Minorities from Pakistan (UNHCR Guidelines).16\n[31] While the UNHCR does include Christians among potential risk profiles, they do not propose that all Christians in Pakistan are in need of international protection, but rather stated that members of the Christian community may, depending on the individual circumstances of the case, be in need of international refugee protection.\n[32] The panel notes that it has before it the Personal Information Form (PIF) and the notice of a positive decision in the claim of the claimant's brother in Canada.17 The claimant's brother's claim is based on his Christian faith, and includes details of his having been personally targeted in Pakistan. As no reasons for the decision were provided, it is unclear how much this personal targeting weighed in the decision.\n[33] The panel notes that while decisions made on family claims may be relevant in the assessment of this claim,18 the panel has insufficient information about the reasons for the decision to give it more than minimal weight in the assessment of this claim.\n[34] The panel notes that the claimant and his family returned regularly to Pakistan, even after the incidents set out in his brothers PIF, and finds that if the brother's situation presented a risk to the other family members, including the claimant, or if he were among those Christians facing persecution or other harm in Pakistan, that the family would likely not have returned as regularly as they did.\n[35] The panel notes that the country documentation indicates that Christians are generally allowed to practice their religion in Pakistan and are allowed to build churches, although there were reports of self-monitoring by some Christians to reduce the risk of creating problems with local Muslims.19\n[36] The panel reviewed the country documentation20 and finds that while sectarian violence does exist in Pakistan, and there is reported discrimination against the Christian community and incidents of persecution for some in the Christian community, the situation reported is not such that simply being Christian presents an individual such as the claimant with more than a mere possibility of treatment amounting to persecution.\n[37] The panel notes that to address some of the societal concerns facing minority groups, the government has announced it would create a national council for minorities with Christian, Hindu, Muslim, and Sikh representatives.21 There are also reserved seats for religious minority members in both the national and provincial assemblies.22\n[38] While most religious minority groups complained of discrimination in government hiring, there was a 5 percent quota for hiring religious minorities at the federal and provincial levels, although it was reported that employers did not consistently enforce this requirement.23\n[39] While discrimination against Christians in employment was reportedly widespread, with it noted that Christians had difficulty finding jobs other than those involving menial labor, it has been noted by some Christian activists that the situation had improved somewhat in the private sector and in the military in recent years.24\n[40] The panel has before it insufficient evidence to establish that any discrimination the claimant may face would even cumulatively amount to persecution.\n[41] While incidents of sectarian violence do occur, including the April 2016 bombing in Lahore,25 and so it is within the realm of possibility that religious minorities will be targeted by extremists going forward, and that as a Christian the claimant may conceivably face such harm, the situation is not reportedly such that the claimant, merely by being Christian, faces a serious possibility of persecution in Pakistan.\n[42] The panel notes that the claimant has also speculated that he could face problems returning to Pakistan as a deported person. Counsel did not address this in submissions. The panel notes that the claimant has not been deported from anywhere, and in the event of an unsuccessful refugee claim, he has the opportunity to depart voluntary and not face removal by Canadian authorities to Pakistan. Even if the claimant did not return voluntarily, there is little before the panel to establish that Pakistani officials would be aware of this or that this would create problems for him in Pakistan.\n[43] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has not satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on the basis of his Christian faith, or that, on a balance of probabilities, he would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life, or face a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, if he were to return to Pakistan.\nCONCLUSION\n[44] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant has not established that there is a serious possibility that he would face persecution for any Convention ground in Pakistan, or that, on a balance of probabilities, he would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Pakistan.\n[45] The panel finds that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. The panel therefore rejects this claim.\n(signed)\n\"J.Wagner\"\nJ.

He alleges that he is bisexual, attracted to both males and females. He also alleges that he is at increased risk because his particular caste is at odds with his wife's caste which has never accepted their marriage. He alleges that his caste was historically enslaved to his wife's royal caste. His caste is therefore ostracized and discriminated against. He is nevertheless an educated man, recently employed in banking in a senior position.\n[3] The claimant alleges that he has been a bisexual in Nigeria as far back as 1987 when he was a teenager enrolled in a catholic seminary and had his first sexual encounter with a male. He alleges that while on a visit in Canada, his aunt advised him that his current sexual partners, XXXX XXXX (\"XXXX\") and XXXX XXXX were caught in a homosexual act in Nigeria. They allegedly confessed to the community that the claimant introduced them to the practice of homosexuality. They respectively fled to Benin Republic and Togo. The claimant's wife and children thereafter went into hiding. The claimant fears for his safety in Nigeria at the hands of the community, including his wife's family, and the Nigerian police which could imprison him for 14 years due to his sexual orientation.\nPOST HEARING APPLICATIONS\n[4] After the hearing on this claim was concluded, the Board sent the claimant's counsel a copy of the U.S. biometrics match report3 which was marked received at the Board on the day of hearing (June 6, 2016) but only brought to my attention the day after (June 7, 2016). I gave counsel some time to make written submission on the post hearing disclosure. Counsel instead made two applications to recuse myself and for a new hearing de novo before a different constituted panel.4 I dismissed both applications. These are my reasons.\nApplication No. 1\n[5] The first application dated June 20, 2016, argued that I breached the duty of procedural fairness by accidently leaving the recording on during the break.5 He argues that discussions protected by solicitor client privilege took place during that time. The claimant acknowledges that upon discovering the error I promptly informed him of the mistake and that I promised to instruct the Board staff to strike the specific portion from the record. Nevertheless, the claimant still argues that he has a reasonable apprehension of bias because he has no independent means to verify that I or any Board staff persons were not in fact exposed to confidential client-counsel discussions.\n[6] This application was rejected because the claimant effectively waived any objection at the hearing. When I advised the claimant and his counsel of this error, I asked him what they wanted to do. They unambiguously stated that they wished to continue with the hearing. I advised them that I would take steps to strike this portion of the recording from the official record. I took those promised steps to strike the particular section of the recording, specifically the time portion time stamped between 14:59-15:26. I have been advised by the recording unit that they should have no problem acceding to this request. I have personally not listened to the recording in this case since I took detailed notes during the hearing. I also do not see the relevance of whether any other staff person listening to the recording because I am the only decision maker in the case. At any rate, I have no knowledge of anyone accessing the recording since the conclusion of the hearing.\n[7] I find that there is no violation of the duty of procedural fairness in this case. I do not accept that there is a reasonable apprehension of bias. The claimant's solicitor client protected discussions, if any, have not been exposed and form no part of this decision. This ground for the application was accordingly rejected.\n[8] The claimant also argued as part of the application that he was in an unfair position in the absence of the U.S. biometrics match report during the hearing because he struggled to recall his various travels. The claimant alleges that I was privy to this undisclosed information and using it to match the answers provided by the claimant and impugn his credibility. There is no basis for this argument. I did not see the U.S. biometrics match report until after the hearing. Accordingly, I could not have used this document in an unfair manner. This ground for the application was accordingly rejected.\n[9] I nevertheless, gave the claimant additional time to file written submissions on the substantive contents of the U.S. biometrics match report.\nApplication No. 2\n[10] Instead of using the additional time to provide substantive submissions on the contents of the U.S. biometrics match report, the claimant made another application, again seeking a de novo hearing.6 The claimant added a new twist to his old argument, to the effect that whether I received the disclosure a day after the hearing is irrelevant, because the disclosure is primarily to the claimant who must be able to prepare. He relies on Rule 34 which states that \"if a party wants to use a document in a hearing\" it must abide by certain timelines.\n[11] This is a repetition of the first application. The claimant was provided additional time to make substantive comments on the document, such as what evidentiary weight if any to assign it, his opinion on what the document proves or any other submission. Once the application was dismissed with reasons to follow, the claimant or his counsel simply made a new application on the same substantive grounds with slightly different arguments.\n[12] This application was dismissed on the basis of the same reasons set out above. But I will make a few more comments based on the new arguments advanced. The reliance on Rule 34 is misplaced in this instance. Rule 34 refers to a \"party\". The Board and the independent decision making Member is not a \"party\". The Board was also not \"using\" the U.S. Biometrics Report in the manner described by the claimant (to impugn credibility) when it was sent out to counsel for written submissions. It was open to counsel to take the opportunity to explain if the document should be used, if at all. Counsel could have also used the opportunity to explain what weight, if any, should be given to the report and counsel's opinion as to what this document establishes, if anything. He has not done so. Nevertheless, this document was not relied upon in reaching my decision and preparing these reasons.\n[13] It is unfortunate that the document was brought to my attention after the hearing. This is a common problem at the Board. However, I find there is no breach of procedural fairness or reasonable apprehension of bias from the post-hearing disclosure or the substantive contents of the document in this case. The application was accordingly dismissed.\nANALYSIS\n[14] The determinative issue in this claim was whether the claimant was credible witness.\nIdentity\n[15] The claimant's identity as a national of Nigeria was established by his passport which was seized when he made his refugee claim.7 His visual appearance in the hearing room was consistent with the picture on his passport.\nThe claimant tarnished his credibility beyond salvage by submitting fraudulent documents\n[16] The principle established by the Federal Court in Maldonado8 states that when a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations they are presumed true, unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness. The determination as to whether a claimant's evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities.\n[17] The claimant testified without major inconsistencies when questioned about his prior same-sex partners and his alleged sexual orientation as a bisexual. I began to question the truthfulness of his testimony when he was not able to reasonably explain the glaring deficiencies in his numerous supporting documents that went directly to heart of his story, including his first same-sex experiences as a youth. I find that the deficiencies in the documents which point squarely towards their fraudulent provenance combined with the lack of reasonable explanations lead me to conclude that the claimant intentionally sought to deceive the Board trough dishonest means. I do not believe what he says in support of his claim regarding his sexual orientation or caste identity.\nSeminary letters from the 1980's are fraudulent\n[18] The claimant testified that he had his first same-sex sexual experience at a catholic seminary in November 1987 where he was posted for apostolic training. He testified that he gradually began to have sexual relations with his same-sex roommate, XXXX XXXX (\"XXXX XXXX). He testified that he was wrecked with guilt and compelled due to his faith to confess his same sex encounters about seven (7) or eight (8) times to his priest, Father Mathew. After each confession, the priest advised him to stop. The claimant could not. The last confession took place around April 1988. The claimant testified that he was ejected from apostolic training by December 1988 due to his sexual orientation although the church sought to keep the reason for his expulsion private.\n[19] The claimant provided three (3) documents from the seminary in his disclosure, a general certificate of education dated June 1987 (\"Education Certificate\"),9 notice of apostolic training posting letter (\"Posting Letter\") dated June 2, 198710 and a notice of recall from apostolic training dated September 12, 1988 (\"Recall Letter\") (collectively \"1980's Letters\").11 Originals of all three documents were provided at the hearing. On consent, I retained the Posting and Recall Letters and respectively marked them as Exhibits 10 and 11. The claimant requested that I return the original Education Certificate to him. It could not be retained and marked as an exhibit.\n[20] I compared at the hearing the original 1980's Letters to the original Educational Certificate and asked the claimant to explain to me why these contemporaneous documents looked so different. The paper upon which the original Education Certificate appears yellowed. The edges of the Educational Certificate are somewhat rounded and there are occasional rips along the document, notwithstanding that it is laminated. The Educational Certificate is typed using an older printer or typewriter style font on a standard form. There are older printer hole-perforated tracks on either side of the document which are similarly degraded as the whole document.\n[21] In contrast the 1980's Letters are printed on paper that is brilliant white and is slightly crumpled. The edges are fairly sharp and there are no rips or other degradation. They are not laminated. Compared to the Educational Certificate, the 1980's Letters appear more modern in their printing. They are not printed on letterhead. The overall appearance of the 1980's Letters font resembles contemporary documents compared to the fonts used in the Educational Certificate. The upper left corner also includes a crest or logo in a black box, sized far too small to read the message that is written in its various parts which are any rate visually fuzzy.\n[22] The claimant explained that he used the Educational Certificate often. That's why it looks more degraded. He confirmed to me that the 1980's Letters are original12 and this is how the seminary prints its correspondence. He explained that the appearance of the 1980's Letters is different because he never had occasion to use them. They were generally in storage in an envelope in a desk or some other method of personal storage undisturbed although they were moved along with his other possessions as he moved away from the seminary, to his parents' house and then in normal course of life as he moved to other residences.\n[23] I reject this explanation as unreasonable. The 1980's Letters are purportedly almost 30 years old. Apart from the slight crumpling which appears to be due to folding, their appearance is no different than a brand new document. Compared to the original Educational Certificate, which I find is authentic; the 1980's Letters show no sign of degradation. It is unreasonable that 30 year old documents would appear brand new when they were held in an envelope in a regular residential environment without specific steps being taken to stop their normal degradation and aging. It is also unreasonable that the seminary would print its logo in such a way that it is virtually impossible to determine what it says in its messages. I find that the appearance of the 1980's Letters is not consistent with how a 30 year document should appear.\n[24] I also note that the name of the institution is different between the Education Certificate which states \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\" while the 1980's Letters state XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\" [emphasis added]. If the 1980's Letters were authentic, I would expect them to name their own institution's name accurately.\n[25] Based primarily on the markedly different appearance and quality of the original 1980's Letters from their contemporaneous original Education Certificate (which is authentic), I find on a balance of probabilities that the 1980's Letters are not authentic. I find that the claimant has provided fraudulent documents to support a material or substantive nature of his refugee claim, specifically establishing a timeline for his first same-sex experience and the consequences that flowed from it. I draw an adverse inference as to the general credibility of the claimant.\n[26] I find based on the authentic Educational Certificate that the claimant attended the seminary up until June 1987. This explains the picture of the seminary he attached to his disclosure.13\n[27] However, I find that the claimant has failed to prove with credible evidence that he was posted for apostolic training after June 1987 and later recalled in 1988 as he alleged. This would have coincided with the material event of the claimant's first same-sex experience. This leads me to doubt as to whether the claimant ever met XXXX, his first same sex partner.\nAffidavits supporting claimant's story and sexual orientation are fraudulent\n[28] The claimant provided three (3) affidavits in support of his claim sworn at the High Court of Justice in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.14 There were general problems with the three affidavits. First they are all sequentially numbered (1318, 1319, and 1320). They were all sworn on April 20, 2016. The claimant confirmed that the three affiants, all residents of southern parts of Nigeria, went up to Abuja on the same day to swear their affidavits.\n[29] Given that the affidavits were sworn on the same day, at the same court, are sequentially numbered, appear to use the same standard forms, and the narrative parts use the same fonts and layout, I questioned why there is a different a citation for the applicable legislation that governs the swearing of the affidavits in the respective narratives. The following table shows the differences:\nXXXX affidavit\nThat I made this solemn declaration conciouscly believing it to be true and correct by virtue of the Oath Laws of 2003.15\nChief XXXX XXXX Affidavit\nTHAT I make this solemn declaration consciously believing it to be true and correct by virtue of ...........16\nXXXX XXXX Affidavit\nTHAT I make this solemn declaration consciously believing it to be true and correct by virtue of the Oath laws of 1990. 17\n[Emphasis added]\n[30] The claimant did not know why the affidavits are different on this point. Counsel later suggested that perhaps because the standard court form for each affiant indicates \"Oaths Act of 1990\" that the mistake in the narrative was overlooked. I reject this explanation. I find it unreasonable that sequentially numbered affidavits, which in all respects appear to have been typed by the same person, would contain such a glaring mistake. It is also unreasonable that if the three affiants in fact signed their affidavits in close succession on the same day that this mistake would not be noticed by either the drafter or the commissioner of oaths who swore the affiants.\n[31] This mistake leads to me to doubt the claimant's story that these three affiants travelled on the same day to Abuja and swore their affidavit in close succession. While I was not prepared to simply find implausible that XXXX XXXX who has no personal connection to the other two affiants travelled on the same day as the other two affiants to Abuja, I find it unreasonable and not credible that after all three affiants travelled to Abuja and signed similarly looking affidavits in close sequence that there would be glaring mistakes and inconsistencies in what should be boiler plate language at the end of each of their narratives. I find on a balance of probabilities that these affidavits are not authentic. I draw an adverse inference as to the credibility of the claimant from the submission of fraudulent documents in support his claim for refugee protection.\n[32] I addition to the above problems, I had particular concerns with respect to XXXX affidavit, namely why XXXX would put himself at risk of criminal prosecution by declaring his same-sex sexual orientation before a government institution, the High Court. The claimant explained that both he and XXXX were aware of this risk and XXXX was initially reluctant to swear any affidavit. Swearing the affidavit at Abuja was a compromise because Abuja is far away from where XXXX lives. I reject this explanation as unreasonable because it is contradicted with other parts of the claimant's testimony. In explaining why copies of identification documents are not attached to the affidavits he provided, he stated that each affiant must provide his \"Receipt\/Bank Teller\" number which is specific to the individual and traces directly to their bank account. Accordingly, XXXX number was XXXX.18 The claimant works in banking. He would be expected to know about such things. The problem is that the claimant's explanation means that XXXX has effectively made himself traceable throughout Nigeria by his Receipt\/Bank Teller number. I find that the claimant's explanations are not consistent. I do not believe that XXXX would swear his affidavit under these circumstances.\n[33] The claimant was provided a copy of the Board's documentation in the National Documentation Package (\"NDP\") which researched whether affidavits of sexual orientation are commissioned in Nigeria ahead of the hearing.19 The document quotes sources stating:\nSources gave the view that it is not standard practice in Nigeria for a Commissioner of Oaths to swear an affidavit regarding a person's gender or sexual orientation...or for a notary public to do so...\n...\"it would be strange\" for a person to swear an affidavit about sexual orientation because these are crimes in Nigeria and would \"amount to...reporting himself or herself to the law\"20\n[34] Counsel submitted that the XXXX affidavit does not go quite as far as to declare homosexuality. It is carefully written. He urges me to focus on the following part of the Board's research document:\n...affidavits are not used in Nigeria for things [such] as swearing to...being homosexual\"...He said there is no \"need for this particular kind of documentation in the country, since there are no benefits to claim using\" such documents within Nigeria...\n[Emphasis added]\n[35] Counsel argues that XXXX swore his affidavit for purposes of use outside of Nigeria and at any rate his words were carefully put to paper. He submits that Board's research is not applicable to this case. I reject this submission. The fact is that this is an affidavit intended for use in Canada does not alter the fact that affiant has had to declare its truthfulness before a Nigerian government official at the High Court. The submission is also contradicted by Chinedu's own words where he states:\n1. THAT I am a friend of Mr. XXXX XXXX XXXX, a Nigerian citizen now seeking asylum in Canada on the bases (sic) of threats to his life as a result of allegations that he engaged in unnatural sexual conduct with other male persons when he was in Nigeria.\n2. That I first met XXXX in June 1987 when we were both posted to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Uzoagba, Ikeduru, Imo state, Nigeria for training as apostolic students under the tutelage of Reverend Father XXXX XXXX.\n3. That we were both discharged before the completion of our apostolic training course we had confessed to the priest that there were inappropriate sexual encounters between us.21\n[Emphasis added]\n[36] XXXX admits that he confessed in 1987 to inappropriate sexual contact with the claimant at the seminary. The claimant is accused of unnatural sexual contact with male persons in Nigeria. XXXX has effectively declared to have engaged in homosexual acts. I find that the implication is quite clear from reading this affidavit that XXXX XXXX like the claimant, is homosexual or bisexual.\n[37] I do not believe that XXXX would swear to the above facts in front of a government official such as a High Court Commissioner of Oaths. I find that on a balance of probabilities, this affidavit is not genuine. I find that it is in fact fraudulent. I draw an adverse inference as to the claimant's general credibility from the submission of a fraudulent document concerning his first sexual partner. I find that I have insufficient credible evidence before me to find that XXXX exists.\n[38] Accordingly, if XXXX does not exist, the claimant never experienced his first same-sex sexual experience as he alleges. This casts doubt over whether the claimant is a bisexual as a he says he is.\nConclusion on credibility\n[39] Given the serious credibility concerns arising out of the claimant's submission of fraudulent documents that go the material and substantive parts of his claim, namely the circumstances surrounding his first alleged same-sex sexual experiences, I find that the principal claimant is wholly and generally without credibility. I find that he provided fraudulent documents intended to deceive the board on the substance of his claim. Where he submitted explanations regarding these documents, they were unreasonable as discussed above.\n[40] Even without disbelieving every part of a claimant's testimony, the claimant may be found to be so lacking in credibility that the panel concludes there is no credible evidence relevant to his claim.22 The panel finds that the claimant was generally lacking in credibility and this lack of credibility extends to all of his allegations and relevant parts of his testimony. I do not believe what he says.\n[41] I find that the claimant has tarnished his credibility to such an extent that I do not believe him when he says that he is bisexual, that he was exposed by his recent male partners in Nigeria and is therefore at risk of persecution in Nigeria.\nRemaining documentary evidence insufficient to ground claim\n[42] The remaining documents do not overcome the submission of fraudulent documents discussed above and the resulting adverse credibility findings.\n[43] The claimant provided a letters of support from 519 Community Centre,23 the Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto,24 and Black CAP.25 I assign low evidentiary value to these documents because they are granted to individuals on the basis of their attendance and participation. The fact that the claimant attended these organizations' programming does not mean he is necessarily bisexual.\n[44] The claimant disclosed an email chain allegedly from his most recent partner, XXXX, where the claimant unsuccessfully attempts to convince XXXX to write an affidavit in support of his refugee claim.26 I place no evidentiary weight on this document. There are no security features on this type of communication. The emails appear between two web based email addresses operated by Yahoo, namely XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (the claimant's address) and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX (XXXXs address). Yahoo is a public web based email provider. Anyone can sign up and create an email account in any name that is chosen provided it is available with or without the use of extra characters or numbers (as seen in both addresses). This is not an independent corroborating document that establishes XXXX exists, let alone that he recently communicated with the claimant. In order to find that those alleged facts have been proven on a balance of probabilities, I must believe the claimant. Since he is not generally credible and has already shown a propensity for dishonesty with the Board, I refuse to do so. I find that there is insufficient credible evidence to establish that XXXX exists on a balance of probabilities. I also find that there is insufficient credible evidence to establish that XXXX XXXX XXXX another one of the claimant's alleged same-sex partners, exists. Accordingly, I do not believe that these people were exposed and in turn implicated the claimant.\n[45] The claimant attached to his disclosure an email from a chaplain in Nigeria who informs him that charges have been brought against him by other members of his Knights order.27 I assign this email no weight for the same reasons I assigned no weight to the XXXX email. This again is an email originating from Yahoo web mail. Anyone could have set up the address XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Like the previous email chain, I do not believe that this is an authentic email received by the claimant.\n[46] The claimant attached screenshots of text messages with his wife who is, according to the messages, enraged by the claimant's behaviour which has forced her into hiding.28 I assign these messages no evidentiary value. There are no security features on these screenshots. While I see a picture of a woman on the top left corner appearing to resemble the claimant's wife (under the tag name \"XXXX\") the texts could have originated from any communication device as long as the claimant assigned his wife's picture and tag line to the number where the text originated. Given the claimant's propensity for dishonesty in advancing his claim, I do not believe that this conversation represents anything more than an extension of the claimant's discredited story. This is not an independent document capable of shoring up the claimant's account.\n[47] Considering all of the evidence in this file, I find that there insufficient credible evidence to cure the serious credibility concerns that exist. I find that the claimant's dishonesty and failure to engage the Board with clean hands has tarnished his credibility irrevocably.\n[48] I do not believe that the claimant is bisexual. I do not believe that he had his first same-sex experience in the seminary. I do not believe that XXXX XXXX XXXX, or XXXX exist. I do not believe that the claimant was implicated of bisexuality or homosexuality in Nigeria.\n[49] Given his overall lack of credibility, I do not believe the claimant's alleged fear of persecution from his wife's family, whether it is due to his alleged sexual orientation or alleged caste. I find that there is insufficient credible evidence to establish any residual profile of risk for the claimant, such as one based on ethnic origin or caste, based on his lack general credibility and failure to deal with the Board with clean hands.\n[50] I find that his claim was clearly fraudulent.\nMANIFESTLY UNFOUNDED CLAIM\n[51] Section 107.1 of the IRPA reads:\nIf the Refugee Protection Division rejects a claim for refugee protection, it must state in its reasons for the decision that the claim is manifestly unfounded if it is of the opinion that the claim is clearly fraudulent.\n[52] The panel finds that the false representations made by the claimant relate to the central elements of his claim for protection. They substantively go to the actual story of persecution and the events that surround the persecution. They go directly to the core of the claim.\n[53] The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Position on Manifestly Unfounded Applications for Asylum has provided the following guidance on this topic:\nThe Office has stated that the notion of \"clearly fraudulent\" could reasonably cover situations where the applicant deliberately attempts to deceive the authorities determining refugee status. The mere fact of having made false statements to the authorities does not, however, necessarily exclude a well-founded fear of persecution and vitiate the need for asylum, thus making the claim \"clearly fraudulent.\" Only if the applicant makes what appear to be false allegations of a material or substantive nature relevant for the determination of his or her status could the claim be considered \"clearly fraudulent.\"29\n[Emphasis added]\n[54] In Warsame v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)30 Justice Roy stated the following about manifestly unfounded claims:\nParliament chose to require that the claim be \"clearly fraudulent\" for particular consequences to flow. That would entail that it is the claim itself that is assessed as being fraudulent, and not the fact that the applicant would have used, for instance, fraudulent documents to get out of the country of origin or to gain access to Canada. However, once making a claim for refugee protection, the applicant would have to operate with clean hands and statements in support of the claim have to be accurate or they could be held against the claimant. In other words, the claimant would be attempting to gain refugee protection through falsehoods that may make the claim fraudulent. It is the claim that must be fraudulent.31\n[Emphasis added]\n[55] I find that the claimant has not operated with clean hands. His dishonesty, evidenced by the submission of fraudulent documents happened after the claim for refugee protection was commenced and concerned the material or substantive nature of the claim.\n[56] Given the claimant's submission of fraudulent documents that are of a material or substantive nature and relevant for the determination of their claims, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that this claim is clearly fraudulent. Therefore, the panel finds that this claim is manifestly unfounded.\nCONCLUSION\n[57] Based on the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that there is not a serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted in Nigeria, or that, on a balance of probabilities, he would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Nigeria.\n[58] I find that the claim is manifestly unfounded. It was clearly fraudulent.\n[59] The Panel concludes that the claimant is not a Convention refugee. For the same reasons, the allegations do not give rise to a successful claim under section 97(1) of the IRPA. I conclude that the claimant is not a person in need of protection. I therefore reject his claims.\n(signed)\n\"Yonatan Rozenszajn\"\nYonatan Rozenszajn\nAugust 9, 2016\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n2 Exhibit 2; Exhibit 5, item 1.\n3 Exhibit 12.\n4 Exhibits 13, 14.\n5 Exhibit 13.\n6 Exhibit 14.\n7 Exhibit 1.\n8 Maldonado v.

They claim to be citizens of Venezuela from XXXX XXXX on Margarita Island and are requesting refugee protection under section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\n[2] The principal claimant was designated representative for the minor claimants.\nIDENTITY\n[3] I am satisfied that the claimants are citizens of Venezuela and as to their personal identity based on certified true copies of their Venezuelan passports.2\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The details of the claimants' allegations appear in the answers to the principal claimant's Basis of Claim form (BOC),3 and were elaborated upon orally by the principal claimant during the hearing.\n[5] To encapsulate a substantially longer narrative, the claimants are Shi'ite Muslims who have been victimized by anti-Muslim criminals in a number of incidents described in the principal claimant's BOC. All of the major incidents giving rise to the claimants' fear of persecution arising out of this situation happened in XXXX XXXX on Margarita Island between April 2016 and now.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] For the following reasons, I find that the claimants are not Convention refugees and not persons in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\n[7] For the following reasons, I find that the claimants have a viable internal flight alternative in Maracaibo.\n[8] Again, the major incidents giving rise to the claimant's fears occurred in XXXX XXXX on Margarita Island which is on the other side of the country, hundreds of kilometres away from Maracaibo.\n[9] When asked why the claimants could not return to Venezuela and live in Maracaibo now, the principal claimant testified that she is afraid of the same kind of anti-Muslim criminal attacks also happening to the claimants in Maracaibo and that the minor claimants would face anti-Muslim discrimination in school. However, I find that I am not persuaded that the claimants' fears in these regards are objectively well-founded. Given the very long distance between XXXX XXXX and Maracaibo, I find that there is less than a serious possibility that the same criminals who attacked the claimants in XXXX XXXX would pursue them all the way to Maracaibo. Moreover, while the principal claimant has testified that there is a lot anti-Muslim violence all over Venezuela, there is, in fact, little or nothing in the country documents4 before me to indicate that there so much anti-Muslim violence in Venezuela that there is a serious possibility that the claimants could face the same kind of anti-Muslim criminal attacks by different criminals in Maracaibo, or that there is so much anti-Muslim discrimination in Venezuelan schools that there is a serious possibility that the minor claimants would encounter it in schools in Maracaibo. While I do acknowledge that the country documents do indicate that Venezuela does suffer from a lot of indiscriminate, generalized criminal violence and that crime of that nature could be a serious risk for the claimants in Maracaibo, I note that Canada does not offer protection from indiscriminate, generalized criminal risks under section 96 or subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\n[10] I also find that it would not be unreasonable for the RPD to expect the claimants to relocate to Maracaibo. When asked why the claimants could not live in Maracaibo, the principal claimant did not identify any additional undue hardship risks for the claimants in relocating to Maracaibo therefore indicating that the claimants could live in Maracaibo but for their fear of anti-Muslim violence and discrimination which has been found not well-founded above. Moreover, I note that the adult claimants do have work experience with a clothing business in XXXX XXXX which presumably could provide a work experience foundation for the claimants in setting up new lives in Maracaibo.\n[11] The claimants have therefore not satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, or that, on a balance of probabilities, they would be personally subjected to a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture in Maracaibo falling with the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\nCONCLUSION\n[12] For all of these reasons, I conclude that the claimants are not Convention refugees under section 96 of the IRPA, and that they are not persons in need of protection within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\nDECISION\n[13] The claims are therefore rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Joel Bousfield\"\nJoel Bousfield\nSeptember 21, 2016\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended.\n2 Exhibit 1.\n3 Exhibit 2.\n4 See all items in Exhibit 8, National Documentation Package (NDP) for Venezuela (May 31, 2016).\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRPD.29.1 (August 31, 2012)\nRPD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SPR : TB6-09894\nTB6-09937 TB6-09945 TB6-09946\nTB6-09947 TB6-09948\n",

On February 26, 2016, the female claimant was sexually assaulted by three men with guns who wanted to steal the drug samples from her car. The female claimant and her two daughters fled to the United States soon after the sexual assault. She did not seek protection from the U.S. authorities while there.\n[7] The male claimant was attacked in front of his home in May 2016, by three men with guns who wanted the drug samples from his car. He reported the incident to the police, and at the same time, informed them of the assault on the female claimant from February.\n[8] The male claimant left El Salvador in XXXX 2016 to attend a wedding in Toronto, and claimed refugee protection soon after. In XXXX, the female claimant and the two minor claimants came to Canada and claimed refugee protection at the border.\n[9] The claimants fear further persecution at the hands of the gangs in El Salvador should they return.\nANALYSIS\n[10] With respect to the male and minor claimants, the determinative issue is credibility. With respect to the female claimant, the determinative issue is prospective risk.\nPharmaceutical representatives\n[11] The panel found the adult claimants to be credible when talking about their education and work as pharmaceutical representatives. They provided documents to corroborate their education and employment.3 The panel finds that the claimants have established that they were both employed as pharmaceutical representatives in El Salvador, on a balance of probabilities.\nMale claimant\nCredibility\n[12] The panel had material concerns about the male claimant's credibility for the reasons below.\nBehaviour that is inconsistent with someone who has a fear for their life\n[13] The panel finds the male claimant's behaviour following the February and May 2016 incidents to be inconsistent with someone who has a fear for their life. The panel also finds that this behaviour undermines the objective fear faced by the male claimant in El Salvador and demonstrates that the gangs are not looking for him as he alleges.\n[14] The male claimant testified that following the incident where he was allegedly assaulted in May 2016, he \"continued doing what habitually he did\". The panel asked the claimant if he made any changes to his routine following the incident. The panel notes that the male claimant hesitated before answering the question, then testified that he tried to change his schedule as far as what time he would arrive back at home. When asked if he made other changes, the male claimant testified no. Based on the questions asked, the claimant testified that he continued to live in the same house and drive the same car.\n[15] The panel finds that the male claimant's testimony in this regard is inconsistent with someone who has a genuine fear for their life. The male claimant alleges that he was physically assaulted by three men in front of his home, when he pulled up in his car. He alleges that the men knew his identity, threatened to assault his children, and were the same men who had previously sexually assaulted his wife. And yet the male claimant testified that he continued to live in the same home, drive the same car, work for the same company, and that he made no changes to his routine, other than to try and alter the time he got home from work. The panel would reasonably expect that a person who genuinely fears for their life would have done something more to change his routine or avoid an agent of persecution who knows where he lives and what car he drives. Consequently, the panel draws a negative inference with respect to the male claimant's credibility and his allegations that the gangs are looking for him in El Salvador.\n[16] When asked if the male claimant had problems with the gangs between when his wife was assaulted at the end of February 2016 and the alleged incident in May 2016, the male claimant testified that he did not have any problems with those same individuals. When asked if he had problems with any other gang member, the male claimant testified that he was still asked to pay money by the gangs in order to carry out his work as a pharmaceutical representative, something he was often asked to do before the February assault occurred. When asked, the male claimant testified that there were not any other incidents with gang members after May 3, 2016.\n[17] The panel notes that the claimant left El Salvador for Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2016 and that he remained in the same house, drove the same car, and worked at the same job as a pharmaceutical representative from when he was allegedly assaulted in May until he left for Canada. The male claimant has not alleged any further incidents involving the gang members during that time. The panel finds that the claimant's testimony and behaviour indicate that the gangs were not looking for the claimant in El Salvador during this time.\nRe-availments and failure to seek protection\n[18] The male claimant testified that he travelled to the United States to visit his family in XXXX 2016 and to Colombia for work in June 2016. He did not seek protection in either the United States or Colombia, and both times he returned to El Salvador and continued with his regular activities. The panel finds the male claimant's behaviour in this regard further undermines the objective fear he allegedly faces in El Salvador and demonstrates that the gangs are not looking for him as alleged.\n[19] The male claimant alleged that following the attack on the female claimant on February 26, 2016, he feared for his life and the lives of his family. The female claimant and their two daughters left for the United States on XXXX XXXX; however, the male claimant did not go with them as he could not afford all four tickets at that time. He did travel to the United States to visit them from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[20] The panel asked the male claimant if he was worried about his safety in El Salvador at that time. The male claimant testified that he was worried for his family, about how the female claimant was feeling, and about what they were going to do to all be together. The panel asked the male claimant if he thought about making an asylum claim in the U.S. The male claimant testified that he did not, as he had not thought about living outside of El Salvador until he himself felt threatened in May.\n[21] The panel finds the male claimant's explanations for why he did not claim asylum in the United States and his subsequent return to El Salvador to be not reasonable as they are not consistent with someone who has a genuine fear for their life. The panel finds that the claimant's behaviour in this regard undermines his credibility as it relates to his allegations that he fears the gangs in El Salvador.\n[22] When asked, the male claimant testified that he went to Colombia for a few days in June 2016 for work. He testified that he did not consider asking the Colombian authorities for protection as Colombia is a country that has similar problems to El Salvador. When asked, the male claimant testified that he was worried about his safety at that point but that he returned to El Salvador as he was expecting to travel to Canada soon.\n[23] As far the explanation regarding his failure to seek protection in Colombia, the panel finds the explanation unreasonable as Colombia may have crime and gang related violence; however, no one in Colombia is looking for the male claimant, and as such the claimant is not facing a personalized risk in Colombia. Moreover, the claimant has no fear of anyone in Colombia, and as such his return to El Salvador and his home, the same place he was allegedly attacked by the agents of persecution, is not reasonable. Accordingly, the panel also finds that the male claimant's failure to seek protection in Colombia in 2016 and his subsequent return to El Salvador to be detrimental to the claimant's credibility as it relates to the risk he faces at the hands of the gangs and further finds that his actions during this time suggest that the male claimant was not being sought by the gangs in El Salvador.\nSupporting documents\n[24] The male claimant submitted documents to corroborate his claim. The panel finds that any weight given to the documents is not enough to overcome the negative credibility findings made.\n[25] The male claimant submitted a medical dated May 4, 2016 which indicates that he was treated at home for injuries and prescribed medication. The panel notes that the letter does not indicate how the male claimant came to be injured, and as such, places little weight on the letter to support the allegation that the same individuals who assaulted the female claimant assaulted him.\n[26] The male claimant also submitted a copy of the formal complaint filed with the attorney general. The panel notes that the complaint lists the male claimant as being \"single\" and his profession as \"lawyer\". Given that the male claimant is in a common-law relationship with the female claimant and has provided credible documents indicating that he is a pharmaceutical representative, the panel finds these are reasons to doubt the reliability of the document.\n[27] The panel also notes that the formal complaint is not consistent with the events as described by the male claimant in his testimony or in his narrative. The formal complaint states that \"the complainant suspects these are the guys who raped his wife on February twenty six of two thousand sixteen since there were three men that his wife XXXX XXXX XXXX when she did not provide them with the medication they demanded of her\". Whereas the male claimant testified that the three men told him they had raped his wife. As such, based on the content of the formal complaint, the panel finds there is little probative value and places no weight on it.\n[28] The male claimant also provided a report from a psychologist in support of his claim. The panel notes that the psychological report is based on self-reported information, information the male claimant told the psychologist. Given the credibility issues outlined by the panel already, the panel has reason to doubt the facts underlying the report, and as such, places no weight on it in support of the male claimant's allegations that the gangs are looking for him in El Salvador.\n[29] Given the negative credibility inferences made above, and the lack of weight given to the male claimant's supporting documents, the panel finds the male claimant to be not credible with respect to his allegations regarding the risk he faces at the hands of the gangs in El Salvador.\nProspective Risk\n[30] The panel finds that the male claimant has not adduced any evidence to indicate that the gang members are currently looking for him in El Salvador. The male claimant testified that someone is taking care of their house in El Salvador and that to his knowledge, that person has never been approached by or talked to the gang members allegedly looking for the claimants.\n[31] When asked how the gang members he feared would know that he had returned to El Salvador, the male claimant testified that he would be \"forced to go back to live at the place where he was living previously\" and work at the same places. When the panel asked the male claimant why he would be \"forced to go back and live in the same place\", he testified that he did not have the resources to drastically change to something else.\n[32] The panel finds the male claimant's testimony in this regard to be inconsistent with someone who has a genuine fear for their life. The claimant came to Canada and claimed refugee protection as he allegedly fears the gangs will attack him if he goes back. He has alleged that the gang members know where he lives and in fact attacked him in front of his home. In this context, it is just not reasonable that the male claimant would move back to his previous home in El Salvador and would go back to his normal routine. As such, the panel draws a negative inference with respect to the claimant's credibility and his allegations that the gangs are looking for him in El Salvador.\n[33] Further to this testimony, the male claimant also testified that even if he moved, it would be difficult not to become victims of attacks by the gangs. The panel finds that this statement is vague and given the level of crime and gang violence in El Salvador, amounts to a general risk faced by everyone in El Salvador. The panel therefore finds that the claimant has not established that he would face a risk different from that faced by the rest of the people in El Salvador if he moved to a different area.\nEmployment and generalized risk\n[34] The panel finds that while the claimants may have been targeted by the gangs in the past due to their work as pharmaceutical representatives, they do not face a personalized forward looking risk for the reasons below.\n[35] The claimants alleged that they had both been victims of armed robbery, before, in the course of their work. The male claimant testified that \"many times\" the key hole of the car door he was driving would be damaged, that drug samples and electronic devices like his lap top and cell phone were stolen. He testified that in order to carry out his work, he sometimes had to give money to gangs. He also testified about an incident where someone had a weapon and they grabbed his cell phone. In addition, based on the questions asked, the male claimant testified that the gangs would be waiting by the doctor's office for people like him who were pharmaceutical representatives, and that they would either extort money or drug samples from them.\n[36] The panel finds that based on his own testimony, the male claimant was robbed and extorted by the gangs because of his work as a pharmaceutical representative. While this may personalize the risk he faced in El Salvador as compared to the general population who were not pharmaceutical representatives, the panel finds that the claimant has not established that he would face a personalized risk in El Salvador were he to return and work as something other than a pharmaceutical representative.\n[37] In the Manrique Galvin4 Federal Court decision, it was established that while the right to work is fundamental, the right to be a taxi driver in Mexico City is not. The panel finds that this applies equally to the male claimant's position as a pharmaceutical representative. Moreover, the Federal Court has found that refugee claimants who are able to make other reasonable lifestyle choices, including with regard to their residence and employment, and thereby free themselves from a risk of persecution or harm, must be expected to pursue those options before claiming protection.5 The panel notes that the male claimant made no effort to change jobs prior to coming to Canada to claim refugee protection.\n[38] As noted above, when asked why he would return to his old home and routine in El Salvador should he return, the male claimant testified that he did not have the means to change to something else. The panel notes that the male claimant obtained a degree in Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy6 and that while it may be difficult to find employment in El Salvador, this is not the basis for a refugee claim.\n[39] The panel asked the male claimant if he returned to El Salvador and worked as something other than a pharmaceutical representative, would the gang members still target him. The male claimant testified that he thought they probably would because they are full of hatred and resentment and they react violently when they do not get their way. The panel finds the claimant's testimony to be vague, as he has not explained why the gangs would react violently to him should he take up a different employment. When asked by his counsel if the gangs would force him to continue working as a pharmaceutical representative if he returned to El Salvador, the male claimant testified yes. The panel finds that the male claimant's answer is speculative and that the male claimant provided no information as to how he knows this or why he thinks this.\n[40] Moreover, given the negative credibility inferences made above and the panel's finding and that male claimant has not established that the gangs are looking for him in El Salvador as alleged, the panel finds that the male claimant has not established that these same individuals would force him to continue working as a pharmaceutical representative.\n[41] For these reasons, the panel find that the male claimant could return to El Salvador and work as something other than a pharmaceutical representative, thereby eliminating his risk of future harm.\n[42] For all these reasons, including the findings made by the panel with regard to the male claimant's credibility as it relates to his allegations regarding the risk he faces at the hands of the gangs in El Salvador, the panel finds that the male claimant has not established has not established a personalized risk of harm on a forward looking basis.\nFemale claimant\nCredibility\n[43] The panel finds the female claimant to have been extremely credible when testifying about the incident in February 2016 where she was sexually assaulted at gun point by three unknown men. While the female claimant was not asked to testify to the details of the incident, the testimony she provided regarding other parts of that day, the moments leading up to the sexual assault, and the impact the sexual assault had on her was straightforward, spontaneous, and detailed.\n[44] The panel notes that the claimant provided two medical reports in support of her claim. The first is a clinical report from Sandwich Community Health in Windsor, Ontario, which assessed the claimant as having \"Post Traumatic Stress Disorder to Physical Assault\". The second is a psychological report from a psychologist in Windsor, Ontario, which diagnosed the female claimant with post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety, due to the trauma she experienced. While the panel notes that psychological reports are based on self-reported information and are not determinative, the psychological report contains details regarding the sexual assault that are consistent with the female claimant's narrative and testimony. The panel finds that the two medical reports provided corroborate the female claimant's allegations that she was sexually assaulted in February 2016 by three unknown armed men.\n[45] In light of her credible testimony and the documentation she provided, the panel finds that the female claimant was physically and sexually assaulted on February 26, 2016 in El Salvador by three unknown armed men.\nFailure to claim in the United States\n[46] The female claimant went to the U.S. on XXXX XXXX, 2016, and did not make an asylum claim. She remained there until XXXX 2016, at which point she came to Canada and claimed refugee protection.\n[47] When asked about why she did not ask the American authorities for protection, the female claimant testified that she heard it would be difficult to obtain assistance and that at that point, she was not clear in her mind what to do, she just knew she wanted to stay away from El Salvador. She also testified that following the attack she was depressed, insecure and uncomfortable, and that she was not making decisions. Considering the claimant's testimony regarding her mental state following the February 2016 assault, and the corroborating psychological report, the panel finds that the claimant has provided a reasonable explanation for why she did not claim asylum upon her arrival in the United States.\n[48] In addition, the panel notes that the female claimant was in the United States legally, as she had a U.S. visa and according to the entry stamp was within visitor status until September 2, 2016, and was not at risk of removal during that time. Based on the above, the panel finds that the female claimant's failure to seek protection in the United States is not detrimental to her credibility.\nProspective risk\n[49] The female claimant left El Salvador on XXXX XXXX, 2016 and has not returned. She has not adduced any evidence separate to the male claimant to indicate that the gangs continue to look for her in El Salvador. Moreover, in light of the credibility findings regarding the male claimant as outlined above, the panel finds that the adult claimants have not adduced any evidence to indicate that the female claimant would be at risk from the gangs were she to return to El Salvador.\n[50] Given the findings made by the panel with regard to the male claimant as they relates to his allegations regarding the risk he faces at the hands of the gangs in El Salvador, the panel finds that the claimants have not established that there is a risk of harm on a forward looking basis for the female claimant, that is, a reasonable chance of persecution in regard to s. 96 of the IRPA, or, a likelihood of the harm that is set out in s. 97(1) of the IRPA.\nCompelling reasons\n[51] The panel considered whether the compelling reasons exception applied to the female claimant. Based on the male claimant's lack of credibility, and no other evidence adduced to indicate that the female claimant would be at risk, the panel cannot find that the female claimant would be at risk upon her return and as such, is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. Moreover, the panel notes that other than the passage of time, there has not been a change in circumstances in El Salvador. For these reasons, the panel finds that the compelling reasons exception found in section 108(4) of the IRPA does not apply to the female claimant.\nMinor claimants\n[52] The adult claimants allege that they fear their daughters will be the victims of gang violence in El Salvador. The male claimant testified that the men who attacked him also threatened his daughters. The panel found the male claimant to be not credible with respect to his allegations regarding the risk he faces at the hands of the gangs in El Salvador. As such, the panel finds that the minor claimants do not face that risk either.\n[53] The panel finds that the claimants have not adduced any other evidence to suggest that the minor claimants face a risk of harm at the hands of the gangs in El Salvador. Consequently, the panel finds that the claimants have not established that there is a risk of harm on a forward looking basis for the minor claimants, that is, a reasonable chance of persecution in regard to s. 96 of the IRPA, or, a likelihood of the harm that is set out in s. 97(1) of the IRPA.\nCONCLUSION\n[54] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel finds that there is not a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground should the claimants return to El Salvador, or that, on a balance of probabilities, they would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\n[55] The panel concludes that the claimants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. Therefore, their claims are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Catherine Smith\"\nCatherine Smith\nDecember 1, 2016\nDate\n1 IRPA S.C.

In this regard, the Panel has carefully considered the Chairperson's Guidelines with respect to child refugee claimants4 and women refugee claimants.5 The Panel also took into consideration some of the difficulties that a claimant can face in the hearing room, including cultural factors, the milieu of the hearing room, and the stress inherent in responding to oral questions. To accommodate for her young age, the panel reversed the order of questioning and had the claimant's counsel lead the hearing. The Panel heard testimony from the claimant, the Designated Representative (DR) and the claimant's mother, who was called as a witness via teleconference.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] The particulars of the claimant's claim are detailed in her Basis of Claim (BOC) form and were explained further in her oral testimony.6 The claimant alleged that she and her mother (who is not part of this refugee claim) were threatened (and assaulted in the case of the mother) by the criminal organization, the Urabenos when the claimant refused to join their drug dealings operations in July 2016. The risk advanced for the claimant's younger brother was potential recruitment at the hands of the Urabenos.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] The panel finds that the claimants have not established that they face a serious possibility of persecution nor on a balance of probabilities would they face a danger of torture, a risk to their lives or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if returned to Colombia.\nANALYSIS\n[6] The determinative issues in this claim for refugee protection is nexus and generalized risk.\nIdentity\n[7] The claimants have adequately established their identities as nationals of Colombia through copies of their passports and other documents on file.7\nCredibility\n[8] There is a presumption that the sworn testimony of a claimant is true unless there are valid reasons to doubt. The panel found the claimant, her paternal uncle (designated representative) and mother (witness) were credible and believes the claimant's allegations of being recently harassed and threatened by members of the Urabenos to sell drugs on their behalf.\nNexus\n[9] In order to effectively advance a claim for protection as a Convention refugee, there must be a connection between the claimant's fear and at least one of the five enumerated grounds of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. Having heard the allegations of risk if returned to Colombia, the panel finds that the risk feared by the claimant relates to criminal activity and is not linked to any of the five grounds enumerated in the refugee Convention.\n[10] Counsel submits that the Urabenos are a politically motivated criminal organization that sees those who fail to comply with their demands as a political opponent. Having considered the claimant's circumstances the panel finds that nothing in the claimant's oral or written testimony suggests that the motivation for targeting the claimant was for political gain nor was she targeted for her political views.\n[11] The Urabenos group is considered the main criminal organization in Colombia with National reach.8 They are viewed by the Colombian government to be a BACRIM (criminal organization).9 Groups such as the Urabenos are considered to be private armies whose aim is to control the drug trade and are described as franchises, with factions that work together in the interests of the drug trade and comprise all the links needed in the cocaine chain; purchasing coca base, producing cocaine, smuggling shipments nationally and internationally, and laundering proceeds.10\n[12] The panel finds that the preponderance of the information regarding the Urabenos indicates they are a criminal organization. They are responsible for perpetuating violence and crime throughout the country. Insufficient evidence was adduced to establish on a balance of probabilities that the claimant or her brothers were targeted based on a political opinion, imputed or otherwise. The claimant's testimony (as well as the DR and mother's testimony) is that she was being targeted by the Urabenos to sell `candies` (drugs) at her school. Consequently, any threats that arose, was the consequence of failing to give in to their demands of selling drugs on behalf of this organization. The panel therefore concludes that the claimant is a victim of crime or vendetta and does not provide the claimant with a nexus to a Convention ground. Consequently, the claim falls under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n[13] The claim was analyzed pursuant to section 97(1) because the fear alleged by the claimant was not linked to any of the Convention grounds.\nGeneralized Risk\n[14] In an analysis under section 97, claimants must demonstrate a personalized risk of torture or a personalized risk to their lives or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. A generalized risk need not be experienced by every citizen in the country11 and does not have to affect everyone in the same way.12\n[15] The most recent human rights report from the United States Department of State reports the following:\nIllegal armed groups--including the FARC and the National Liberation Army (ELN), as well as organized crime groups (some of which contained former paramilitary members)--committed numerous abuses, including the following: political killings; killings of members of the public security forces and local officials; widespread use of land mines and improvised explosive devices (IEDs); kidnappings and forced disappearances; sexual and gender-based violence; subornation and intimidation of judges, prosecutors, and witnesses; infringement on citizens' privacy rights; restrictions on freedom of movement; widespread recruitment and use of child soldiers; attacks against human rights activists; and killings, harassment, and intimidation of teachers and trade unionists. Illegal armed groups continued to be responsible for most instances of forced displacement in the country.13\n[16] Amnesty International reported that paramilitary groups, which the government referred to as criminal gangs (bandas, criminals, bacrim), continued to commit crimes under international law and serious human rights violations, despite their supposed demobilization in the government sponsored Justice and Peace process that began in 2005. Paramilitaries - sometimes acting with the support or acquiescence of state actors, including members of the security forces - threatened and killed, among others, human rights defenders. Reported that all parties to the conflict in Colombia such as the security forces, either acting alone or in collusion with paramilitary groups and guerrilla groups such as the FARC and ELN continued to be responsible for serious human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law, including unlawful killings, forced displacement, torture, abductions or forced disappearances and sexual violence.14\n[17] The evidence also shows that the criminal activity of the bacrim is mostly related to drug trafficking.15 The bacrim are known to kill civilians if they do not comply with the rules they have imposed on the locality they control.16\n[18] On the issue of child recruitment, the most recent human rights report from the United States Department of State reports that recruitment and use of children by illegal armed groups was widespread. The FARC and the ELN routinely engaged in forced recruitment of persons under age 18.17 The bacrim are also involved in human trafficking networks, the use of children as \"fighters and informants\" and sexual abuse of girls.18 Verdad Abierta, a website that compiles information on the armed conflict in Colombia, states that the Urabenos increases its membership through the forced recruitment of children, who are offered salaries or gifts and are employed as collectors of coca leaves, watchmen, and informers (Verdad Abierta 16 Aug. 2014). Human Rights Watch corroborates the above by indicating that, according to the Office of the Ombudsperson (Defensor\u00eda del Pueblo), the government institution that advocates for the protection of human rights in the country (Colombia n.d.b), children are forcibly recruited by BACRIM to be used as \"lookouts\" and gunmen (Human Rights Watch Mar. 2014, 22).19\n[19] Given the general country conditions and the widespread incidents of child recruitment, and threats in Colombia, the panel finds that claimant faces a risk that is generally faced by others; all people in Colombia face some type of risk. While the claimant alleged that they know her name and where she lives, the panel finds that this does not mean that her risk is now personalized. The issue of recruitment is one faced generally and is part of the modus operandi of the Urabenos and other gangs that operate in Colombia. A generalized risk does not have to affect everyone the same way. As it has been held by the Federal Court that the word generally is commonly used to mean prevalent or widespread.20 Moreover, not every victim of generalized violence will be targeted with the same frequency or in the same manner.21\n[20] The panel is aware of the documentary evidence regarding the willingness of the Urabenos to pursue and locate victims throughout Colombia, however, these efforts appear to be focused on a certain profile of persons; Judges, public prosecutors, witnesses, lawyers and other persons who participate in legal proceedings and investigations relating to violations of human rights or international humanitarian law (IHL), involving members of the public security forces or paramilitary and guerrilla groups, are reportedly at risk of being killed, kidnapped, or subjected to torture, ill-treatment and forced disappearance.22 The claimant does not fit any of these profiles. In this case, the claimant and her mother (on the claimant's behalf) were targeted by the Urabenos during a very brief period. The panel does not believe that the Urabenos are going to use the networks and resources for organized crime to pursue a fourteen year old girl they briefly targeted for recruitment in July 2016.\n[21] This finding is further strengthened by the fact that as long as the claimant and her mother complied with the gang's demand---to never return to the claimant's school, leave their home and \"keep their mouth shut\"23 --that \"nothing was going to happen\".24 Moreover, since July 2016, the gang has made no efforts to seek out the claimant or any of her relatives for any reason. None of the claimants' relatives, including her aunt who offered her shelter subsequent to the July 2016 incidents were impacted in any way.\n[22] For the forgoing reasons, the panel finds, it is more likely that the claimant was a victim of crime and there is no reason to believe that the Urabenos gang members will continue to search for her and her brothers upon their return to Colombia. Insufficient evidence was adduced that she or hers siblings were personally targeted for any other reason or that they would face a risk that is not faced generally by others.\n[23] In Prophete,25 it was held that because the risk of all forms of criminality is general and felt by all Haitians, the claimant did not face a personal risk that is not faced generally by others in his country. The Court stated, \"[w]hile a specific number of individuals may be targeted more frequently because of their wealth, all Haitians are at risk of becoming the victims of violence.\"\nConclusion\n[24] In light of the foregoing, the panel finds that the risk the claimant and her siblings face is exempted pursuant to section 97(1) (b) (ii) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). Taking into account the claimants' circumstances, the claimants have not satisfied the burden that they faced a risk that is personalized in accordance with section 97 of IRPA. Consequently, the panel finds that the claimants are not persons in need of protection.\n[25] The panel rejects this claim.\n(signed)\n\"R. MEKHAEL\"\nR.

They are both citizens of Bangladesh and share a common narrative.\n[3] The claimants allege that they fear family members who disapprove of their union, in particular one XXXX XXXX, brother of the Associated Claimant. He is described an Islamist who leads a group of likeminded fundamentalists.\n[4] To safeguard themselves from family disapproval, the claimants secretly had a non-legal marriage in August 2013 and continued to live separately. However, after three months of marriage, her family came to know of the relationship.\n[5] The Principal Claimant was threatened with being put on a killing list. His home and place of business were visited by violent fundamentalists, and his employees were attacked and beaten. He fears that his wife's brother will kill him.\n[6] The Associated Claimant was locked in her house and not allowed to complete her MBA degree. She fears that her brother will force her to marry someone else.\n[7] As the claimants believed that the police could not provide assistance, they escaped to the United States before crossing into Canada and making their refugee claims.\n[8] Submissions and documentary evidence were filed by a Canada Border Services Agency hearings officer on June 10, 2016.\n[9] The hearing into this matter took place on June 20, 2016.\n[10] Counsel for the claimants provided his submissions and additional documentation1 on June 30, 2016.\nDetermination\n[11] I find that the claimants are not Convention refugees in that they do not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention ground in Bangladesh.\n[12] I also find that the claimants are not persons in need of protection in that their removal to Bangladesh would not subject them personally to a risk to their lives or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, and in that there are no substantial grounds to believe that their removal to Bangladesh would subject them personally to a danger of torture.\n[13] My reasons are as follows.\nAnalysis\n[14] The identities of the claimants as citizens of Bangladesh are established by the copies of their passports in the evidence.\n[15] The determinative issue is credibility.\n[16] There is a presumption that sworn testimony is true, unless there is sufficient reason to doubt its trustworthiness.2 Both claimants provided testimony under affirmation, with most of the answers being given by the principal claimant.\n[17] In general, their testimony was consistent with their previously provided statements. Nonetheless, the evidence has given rise to a number of credibility concerns.\n[18] To begin with a relatively minor matter, the claimants were in the United States for about eight weeks prior to coming to Canada and making their claims. While delay is not in itself determinative of credibility, it is reasonable to expect that people who have fled situations of real danger would attempt to gain protection at the earliest practical opportunity. I find that eight weeks is sufficient time to at least commence an asylum claim.\n[19] Regarding their sojourn in the United States and their activities there, the principal claimant testified that they spent time trying to get habituated to the United States as a possible destination for emigration. Therefore, they visited several places such as Times Square, Central Park, and Philadelphia City Hall. He testified that he learned that emigration to the United States is a complex matter and that they did not have a relative or friend in the United States, whereas they had an uncle in Canada.\n[20] The point about the complexity of the immigration process being complex is reasonable, as is a desire for support. However, it is reasonable to assume that claimants, with their professional and academic backgrounds, would have been able to have some understanding of the complexities, and to know which country had an uncle in it and which did not, prior to their exit from Bangladesh.\n[21] The evidence regarding their American experiences suggests that they were vacationing, at least as much as they were attempting to obtain relief from dangers in Bangladesh. For these reasons, some concern about the genuineness of their fear of Bangladesh arises.\n[22] Of much greater concern is the evidence regarding their marriage, which raises concerns of implausibility and inconsistency.\n[23] The country reports documentation establishes that Bangladesh is a conservative country where \"personal laws on marriage, separation, and divorce, some dating to the 19th century, have remained largely frozen in time.\"3 Practically this means that most marriages are arranged by parents, resulting in a situation where \"many women are forced into marriage\"4 and \"few couples...marry under the civil marriage statute.\"5\n[24] Accordingly, it would be a rarity to encounter a religious marriage made without family consent, as alleged.\n[25] The principal claimant was asked about the American visas in evidence. He stated that he was still hoping to get assent for marriage and that the visas could facilitate an elopement.\n[26] When it was pointed out that the American visa applications show that the claimants are already living at the same address, presumably cohabiting, the principal claimant explained that he wanted the mail to come to him and that it was not required to furnish her address.\n[27] It is reasonable, if the allegations are true, to shield the angry relatives from information about their daughter's potential elopement. However, the furnishing of an address is clearly required, since the visa form has a question about it. The principal claimant, asked about the possibility that his wife would have to answer questions from the visa office regarding her place of residence, stated that he had not thought so far ahead.\n[28] Regarding the allegation that his wife faces being married off to a different person, the principal claimant was asked how it would be possible, given that she is already married. He replied that he and his wife had not cohabitated as spouses or consummated their marriage.\n[29] Documentary reports indicate that \"a daughter's chastity\" is relevant in marriageability.6 Therefore, the principal claimant was asked if they had now consummated the marriage. He acknowledged that they had done so. Accordingly, the factors of cohabitation and consummation, stated as being elements in the risk of remarriage, are no longer effectual.\n[30] The principal claimant was asked why he and his wife returned to their family homes after marriage, instead of living together. He replied that her family would not consent to the union, and kept his wife imprisoned in her room for almost a year.\n[31] Asked why he would marry a girl that he could not live with, the principal claimant replied that he was in love and did not know that they could not cohabit.\n[32] Asked if this meant that he was expecting that they would cohabit after the marriage, the principal claimant replied that he did not want his wife to come to his house just like that - he wanted consent and proper procedure to be followed.\n[33] This answer is, again, contradictory to previous testimony. The principal claimant is simultaneously alleging that he was unaware that he did not know they could not cohabit, and that he could not bring his wife home without family consent, which he claims not to have received.\n[34] Asked about marriage procedure and whether the marriage deed presented in his evidence package7 was a proper document, the principal claimant replied that it was valid. Later, to a question posed by his counsel regarding whether he was married in Bangladesh per law, the principal claimant answered yes.\n[35] However, he asserted that a real marriage incorporates additional cultural requirements such as the renting of a hall (presumably for a celebration) and the assent of her relatives.\n[36] When it was pointed out that relatives had given assent, in that the marriage deed names witnesses to both the bride and groom, the principal claimant stated that he provided all of the witnesses and that the relationships were not checked.\n[37] This answer, if true, indicates that the marriage deed is essentially fraudulent, in that it specifies two names of the bride's family as witnesses. If they were not her relatives, then the form was improperly completed, which contradicts his testimony that it is a valid document.\n[38] Overall, the evidence regarding marriage and the answers given in the testimony of the principal claimant create a negative impression of his credibility.\n[39] Another area of concern is that the principal claimant has had no direct encounter with the purported agent of persecution. XXXX XXXX is described as a violent militant with followers. The principal claimant has testified that his home and place of business were being searched, but XXXX was unable to find the principal claimant.\n[40] I find this statement to be highly implausible. The principal claimant was not in hiding. His list of addresses8 shows that he was at the same home in Dhaka from at least 2006 to 2016. He owns a clothing business, Signature, which has a retail outlet whose address is listed publically9 and has a business card indicating his contact information.10 He should not have been difficult to reach.\n[41] XXXX also had a considerable period of time to try to catch and punish the principal claimant, if that was really his intent. In testimony, the principal claimant agreed that he was married in August 2013, that his brother in law came to know of this situation three months later, and that he left Bangladesh in XXXX 2016. This is a period of approximately two years and three months.\n[42] Asked how XXXX could have failed to find the principal claimant over a period of more than two years, the principal claimant replied that at that point in time, XXXX was also busy because the situation in Bangladesh was not very peaceful, he had full control over his sister, and only tried to locate the principal claimant once.\n[43] This answer, that XXXX only tried to locate the principal claimant once, contradicts his statement given to an immigration officer, in which the principal claimant stated that XXXX and his goons came to his house, came to his business, tortured his cousin, threatened his mother, talked to family members in order to get them to spy, visited his store again and assaulted two employees and broke things in the store, and were threatening family members after the claimants escaped to the United States.11 It contradicts his written narrative, in which XXXX led an attack on the home, put their names on a killing list, put their names and pictures all over the country in their political network, attacked the business, attacked the home a second time, and attacked his mother.12\n[44] I find that the principal claimant's explanation for his brother in law's failure to locate him is contradictory to his previous statements regarding the intensity and duration of this alleged search. His evidence on this topic raises considerable concern about his truthfulness.\n[45] These concerns must to some degree have an impact on the associated claimant as well. She shares his narrative and stated that she has no corrections to make to his testimony.\n[46] There is an additional concern specific to her situation, which was raised by the submissions of the Minister, which included the name of the associated claimant appearing on a convocation list from XXXX XXXX published on Facebook in October 2014.13 The Minister submitted that this means that the associated claimant was in fact going to school after her wedding, and not remaining at home as a prisoner of her family.\n[47] The associated claimant replied to this concern in her testimony. She stated that she graduated with her business administration degree in 2011, and had entered the MBA program in 2012 before being confined to her room. The convocation in 2014 was for her business administration work.\n[48] Asked if students at the institution were irate at having to wait two or three years after the completion of their coursework before they could receive their degree, the associated claimant replied that the Facebook list refers to \"2nd Convocation\" and that it is very common not to get one's degree for such periods of time.\n[49] This answer is not backed up with any information stating that the school will make students wait two or three years to get their degrees after completing the requirements. Such a practice does not make sense, as it is an obvious disincentive to attend that school.\n[50] It also conflicts with her own written statement that she attended XXXX XXXX from 2007 to 2011 and from 2012 to 2015.14\n[51] Asked about this contradictory information, the associate claimant replied that she was just asked for the start and end date of her education. This answer does not account for the end date of approximately February 2013, when her family allegedly imprisoned her in her room. I also note that her narrative15 states that her family \"stopped my MBA classes,\" without indicating any relief from that imprisonment.\n[52] I find that these credibility concerns have collectively overcome the presumption of credibility. The claimants do not present as reliable witnesses and I find that I am unable to place weight on their testimony.\n[53] Therefore, I have considered the documents that have been provided, which include a medical certificate of treatment, a report made to a Women's Organization, and newspapers.16\n[54] I find that these documents do not have inherent weight or reliability. They were not provided by uninterested sources but from relatives in Bangladesh who may reasonably have some emotional reason to support the claimants independent of any motivation to provide wholly truthful statements. The suppliers of these documents were not made available to testify.\n[55] Also, regarding the possibility of forgery, an official at the High Commission of Canada to Bangladesh stated in 2010 that Bangladesh is a producer of fraudulent documents, such as passports, birth certificates, bank statements, and documents related to tax, business, school and marriage, so that \"if we ask for it, it can be produced.\"17\n[56] Also, the newspapers raise additional concerns in that they have some curious anomalies.\n[57] Counsel originally submitted materials which appeared to be newspaper clippings from the Daily Jalalabad, the Daily Shyamal Sylhet, and The Daily Sylhet Bani.18 These materials are highly relevant to the claim in that they describe XXXX as a radical Jamat activist attacking Hindus, the police, and the principal claimant's business.\n[58] After the hearing, counsel submitted documents that purport to be originals of the previously submitted Daily Jalalabad and The Daily Sylhet Bani newspapers.\n[59] I note that they are one-page broadsheets folded in half to make four pages. Unless the Daily Jalalabad and The Daily Sylhet Bani are four-page newspapers, these are not complete publications.\n[60] The main issue is whether they are authentic.\n[61] They certainly look like newspapers, but newspapers do not have security features that would make them particularly difficult to forge. There is no forensic assessment of these materials, and no independently authenticated original with which to compare them. Nor is there any evidence that these publications have an online archive, searchable from Canada, to definitely establish authenticity.\n[62] What I have are the papers themselves, reportedly from March 2013 and January 2016. They show no signs of yellowing or aging, which defies common sense in that the Daily Jalalabad newspaper purports to be more than three years old.\n[63] The Daily Jalalabad also has a nameplate of curious appearance. The name is bordered by irregular lines that do not seem to be part of the design, is of darker tone than the surrounded white space, and is deeply shadowed on the left side. Similar shadows are found on the obverse side of the paper, due to the bleeding of print ink through the porous newsprint. Accordingly, it seems more likely than not that the nameplate on this version of Daily Jalalabad was cut out of the newsprint version of a previous edition of the paper.\n[64] Even assuming that the newspaper is composited by hand and not on a computer, it makes no sense that the assemblers would be so short of unblemished copies of the correct nameplate that they would have to cut out and paste the name from a copy of the paper.\n[65] Similarly, the name Daily Jalalabad on the apparent last page of the paper is also of a noticeably darker tone, with edges suggesting of cutting and pasting.\n[66] The nameplate of the Daily Sylhet Bani has shadowing also, on the right edge, extending into the grey border with parallel black line that runs horizontally over the main body of the front page. Where the edge meets this border, a noticeable triangular shadow appears, as does a slight break in the black line. The impression of cut-and-paste result here also.\n[67] The third page of this document, in the upper right corner, has a small block of text that is of slightly darker tone and that has cut lines around it. There is another similarly darker text block with irregular lines around it at the bottom of the fourth page.\n[68] At the top of the fourth page, the illustrated articles appear to have been edited in that they end with small strips of bright white, suggestive of tape being placed over certain words.\n[69] Overall, these anomalies in the newspapers lead me to find, on a balance of probabilities, that they are assembled from various elements and then printed on newsprint in order to simulate genuine newspapers.\n[70] There is no evidence or reason to indicate that the claimants participated knowingly in the creation of these forged newspapers. However, the papers reduce the already low probative value of the documents provided to supplement testimony that I have found to lack credibility.\n[71] In sum, there is no reliable evidence upon which I could make a positive protection finding for either of the claimants under the Act.\nCONCLUSION\n[72] For the reasons given, and on the evidence, I find that XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX are neither Convention Refugees nor persons in need of protection, and I reject their claims.\n(signed)\n\"Ron Yamauchi\"\nRon Yamauchi\nAugust 18, 2016\nDate\n1 Added as Exhibit 7 on list of documents.\n2 Maldonado v.

Therefore, the panel finds the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimant's detailed allegations are noted within his Basis of Claim (BOC) form2 and his testimony. The claimant alleges as a Tamil citizen of Sri Lanka, he faces persecution due to his ethnicity. The claimant states that he grew up in the Negombo area of Colombo. His father, whom operates an XXXX XXXX XXXX business, has been detained twice by Sri Lankan authorities, once in 2010 and again in 2014. The claimant testified that neither he nor his father have ever been members of the Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). During his father's first detention in 2010, he was held for a period of XXXX months. His second detention, which occurred after his phone number was found in the cell phone of a notorious member of the LTTE, was for a period of XXXX months.3 After his release, the claimant's father was required to report once a month to the authorities and was still allowed to travel for business, with permission from the government and under certain requirements.\n[4]\nThe claimant alleges that in XXXX 2014, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) requested he testify against the police that refused to help him when his father was detained. He alleges that after he agreed to come to their office, he received a threatening phone call from police stating that if he spoke to the ICRC he would be killed. The claimant alleges that his father became worried for his safety and arranged for the claimant to leave the country. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, the claimant left Sri Lanka on his own passport and travelled through Abu Dabi, Brazil, Guatemala and Mexico to the United States where the claimant was detained and made a claim for asylum. After his release from US immigration detention, the claimant travelled to the Canadian border where he met with family and made a claim for protection.\nANALYSIS\n[5] The determinative issues in this case are credibility, well-foundedness of the claimant's fear and generalized risk.\nIdentity\n[6] The claimant's identity as a citizen of Sri Lanka is established by way of his testimony and the documentary evidence, namely his birth certificate, driver's license, national identity card and a photocopy of the biometric page of his Sri Lankan passport.4 The panel is satisfied that the claimant is Sri Lankan and of Tamil ethnicity.\nCredibility\n[7] In assessing the credibility of the evidence presented by the claimant in support of the claim for Convention refugee status and for the claimant to be a person in need of protection, the panel is guided by the principles established in the Federal Court of Appeal's decision of Maldonado,5 wherein the Court states, in part, \"When an applicant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there be reason to doubt their truthfulness.\"6\n[8] In assessing credibility, the panel was mindful of the claimant's age, education and background. The claimant testified that he has ten years of education. Counsel requested that the panel simplify any questions for the claimant, which the panel and counsel attempted to do. In addition, the panel is cognizant of the difficulties faced by a claimant in establishing a claim, including cultural factors, the environment of the hearing room and the stress inherent in responding to oral questions through an interpreter. The panel has taken these considerations into account in arriving at the negative credibility finding.\n[9] The panel finds that there were credibility issues central to aspects of the claim. As a result, the panel does not accept, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant's allegation about being targeted by the Sri Lankan authorities is what led the claimant to flee Sri Lanka.\n[10] The claimant testified that after his father's initial detention in Colombo in XXXX 2010, he and his father's friend approached the ICRC to seek assistance. The ICRC visited the claimant's father twice during his XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX detention. When his father was detained in 2014, for XXXX months, the claimant again contacted the ICRC for assistance. The claimant alleges his father was mistreated in detention and that the ICRC monitored the situation. Afterwards, the claimant testified that the ICRC contacted him in XXXX 2015, asking if he would come in and speak with the organization about how the police would not assist him during his father's detention. The claimant agreed. A few days later, the claimant was contacted by the police and told if he spoke to the ICRC, his life would be in danger. The claimant believes his phone lines were tapped, and that resulted in the police becoming aware of his communication with the ICRC.\n[11] When asked if the ICRC wanted to speak to his father regarding his treatment in detention, the claimant stated they did not, they wanted to speak to the claimant himself, because the police had refused to assist him when his father was arrested. The panel asked if the ICRC ever spoke to his father about his treatment while in detention, the claimant testified they did not. The panel asked the claimant if he has any documentary evidence establishing that the ICRC had actually asked him to come and speak to them about the police in Sri Lanka. The claimant testified he did not. The panel brought to the claimant's attention that he received a letter from the ICRC in XXXX 2015 which confirmed his father's detentions, and asked the claimant how he got this letter. The claimant testified that his father's friend obtained the letter for him. When asked if his father's friend had attempted to obtain a letter confirming that he was asked to assist with an investigation in XXXX 2015, the claimant testified that he had not.\n[12] The claimant alleges that he approached the ICRC officials and made oral complaints on two separate occasions when his father was held in detention. He has presented documents that substantiate that the ICRC was monitoring his father's detention. The claimant testified that he was asked to provide information about the police in XXXX 2015 however, the claimant has failed to provide any documentary evidence that links him to an investigation by the ICRC, or the ICRC in any way, despite the fact that his father's friend obtained documents for the purpose of his claim from the same organization in XXXX 2015.\n[13] The claimant was unable to identify the individual at ICRC whom he spoke with about the investigation and was unsure he could get a letter post hearing about what he was asked to do. The panel does not find it reasonable that the claimant would not have obtained a letter from the ICRC officials regarding the investigation he was allegedly assisting them with. The panel finds that it would not have been difficult to obtain this document, considering the claimant already had a family friend assisting him in obtaining information regarding his father's detention from the same organization. The panel draws a negative credibility inference from the lack of documentary evidence establishing a connection between the claimant and the ICRC. The panel finds it reasonable that a document could have been easily obtained. Considering that the ICRC investigation is what led to the alleged threats from police that forced the claimant to leave the country, the panel finds that documentary evidence of this connection is of critical importance in establishing the central element of his claim.\nDeparture from Sri Lanka\n[14] The claimant testified that after he was threatened by police, his father wanted him to leave the country. The claimant testified he departed his home country on his own Sir Lankan passport on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015, a few weeks after receiving death threats. The claimant testified that he received an exit stamp and had no difficulty leaving the country.\n[15]\nThe claimant testified that he exited Sri Lanka via Colombo airport on his own passport with the aid of an agent. The panel notes that security screening at the ports of entry, particularly the airport is stringent. The panel grants that there may be the ability to bribe security staff at the airport however the panel finds it highly implausible, on a balance of probabilities, that those who were of interest by Sri Lankan authorities would easily be able to traverse and exit the country, particularly as the claimant alleges his life had been threatened by the police and that he was a potential target of the authorities because of his father's suspected involvement with the LTTE.7\n[16] The Sri Lankan National Police Criminal Investigations Unit (CID) is responsible for investigating cases and laying potential charges under the Sri Lankan Criminal Code and Immigration Act at the airport. The CID may investigate cases of document malfeasance, human smuggling and trafficking, and conduct criminal background checks of returned Sri Lankan nationals in order to check for any outstanding domestic criminal...warrants.8\n[17] Tamil passengers on all incoming and outgoing flights are the focus of the TID. These sources report that the TID officials take individuals into custody, either interrogating them for hours or taking them away \"in unmarked white vans to unknown destinations.\"9\n[18] The panel makes a negative credibility inference that the claimant would be living in a home with a suspected LTTE member or sympathizer, allegedly have his phone line tapped and be under surveillance, have his life threatened by the police and yet have no trouble leaving the country through the airport in Colombo. The panel finds the ease in which the claimant was able to travel out of the country on his own passport, not credible. Due to this fact, the panel is not persuaded, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant was threatened by the police as the claimant has alleged.\nWell-Founded Fear\n[19] The panel notes that the claimant alleges he departed Sri Lanka in XXXX of 2015. He travelled through various countries including through the UAE, Brazil, Guatemala and Mexico, most signatories to the United Nations Refugee Convention, yet the claimant failed to seek protection in any of these countries. The claimant reached the United States in XXXX 2015, where he was detained by U.S. immigration officials. At this time he filed a claim for asylum.10 He was detained for three months and released on a bond.\n[20] The claimant proceeded to Canada, effectively abandoning his U.S. asylum claim. As the U.S. is a well-known refugee-granting country, the panel finds it troubling that in his case, he abandoned the opportunity for asylum in the U.S. Although counsel for the claimant suggests that there is merit in the claimant proceeding to Canada and abandoning his claim, as the claimant has relatives residing in Canada, namely his Uncles. Counsel has also submitted that a delay is not relevant to a subjective fear and should not impact the determination of the panel. The panel finds that the claimant had no guarantees that his claim would be approved in Canada. The panel considers that it is appropriate to inquire into the circumstances of any delay, protracted postponement of or inaction on, as in this case, or abandonment of a claim for refugee protection \"as a means of evaluating the sincerity of the claimant's need for protection.\"11\n[21] The panel notes that the Federal Court has held that a delay in claiming could be indicative of lack of subjective fear.12 While the panel agrees that the claimant has no obligation to advance a claim in the first country he arrives, it should be noted that the claimant was detained in the US and did advance a claim there. Thus, his abandoning of the claim and failure to advance claims in any of the countries he traverse does speak to a lack of subjective fear.\nBasis of Claim\n[22] The panel is now left with the task of determining if the claimant falls within one of the risk profiles if he were to return to Sri Lanka. The panel finds that the determinative issue in this case is whether the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution were he to return to Sri Lanka. The documentary evidence regarding Sri Lanka paints a contradictory picture of the situation in the country as to who is at risk and why. The panel prefers the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) documents13 because it is internationally recognized and supported by the United Nations, a body that is charged with the protection of international human rights.\n[23] The UNHCR released its most recent Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Asylum Seekers from Sri Lanka (UNHCR Guidelines) in December 2012. It concluded that:\nGiven the cessation of hostilities, Sri Lankans originating from the north of the country are no longer in need of international protection under broader refugee criteria or complementary forms of protection solely on the basis of risk of indiscriminate harm. In light of the improved human rights and security situation in Sri Lanka, there is no longer a need for group-based protection mechanisms or for the presumption of eligibility for Sri Lankans of Tamil ethnicity originating from the north of the country.14\n[24] The UNHCR Guidelines recognized, however, that individuals with certain profiles are still at risk and identified five Potential Risk Profiles:\n\u2022 Persons Suspected of Having Links with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE);\n\u2022 Journalists and Other Media Professionals;\n\u2022 Civil Society and Human Rights Activists;\n\u2022 Women and Children with Certain Profiles;\n\u2022 Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) Individuals;\n\u2022 Certain opposition politicians and political activists; and\n\u2022 Certain witnesses of human rights violations and victims of human rights violations seeking justice.\n[25]\nThe panel notes that the specific profiles listed in the UNHCR Guidelines are as follows:\nA.1 Persons Suspected of Certain Links with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)\n1) Persons who held senior positions with considerable authority in the LTTE civilian administration, when the LTTE was in control of large parts of what are now the northern and eastern provinces of Sri Lanka;\n2) Former LTTE combatants or \"cadres\";\n3) Former LTTE combatants or \"cadres\" who, due to injury or other reason, were employed by the LTTE in functions within the administration, intelligence, \"computer branch\" or media (newspaper and radio);\n4) Former LTTE supporters who may never have undergone military training, but were involved in sheltering or transporting LTTE personnel, or the supply and transport of goods for the LTTE;\n5) LTTE fundraisers and propaganda activists and those with, or perceived as having had, links to the Sri Lankan diaspora that provided funding and other support to the LTTE;\n6) Persons with family links or who are dependent on or otherwise closely related to persons with the above profiles.\n[26] In reviewing the \"risk profiles\" as identified above, the panel finds that none of the listed criteria apply to the claimant. Although his father is suspected to have links to the LTTE, as noted in b), the panel notes that the claimant's father himself was let out of detention, and although he continues to be monitored, he has been allowed to travel out of the country. The panel has considered if these various elements apply to the claimant's profile and finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant does not meet the criteria for \"Persons Suspected of Certain Links with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)\" and determines there is no serious possibility that he would be persecuted on this basis should he return to Sri Lanka.\n[27] Furthermore, given the credibility findings and the fact that the claimant himself in his oral testimony denied any previous association with the LTTE, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant had no association with the LTTE. The claimant testified that he has asked his father if he was linked to Gopi or the LTTE, and his father denies any involvement. The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant's father is somehow linked to the LTTE however, the claimant himself has not provided any persuasive evidence that he himself would be perceived to be a supporter of the LTTE or any other political group. The panel also finds it reasonable to expect that, if Sri Lankan authorities believed that the claimant was one of the persons identified in the aforementioned \"risk profiles,\" he would not have been able to pass through security checkpoints when he boarded the plane out of Sri Lanka.\nFailed Asylum Seekers\n[28] The claimant alleges a fear of returning to Sri Lanka due to being a Tamil male, whose father is a suspected LTTE sympathizer. The claimant testified he would be targeted upon his return, arrested and sent to an army camp. Furthermore, he would have to register and possibly be questioned, suffering what his father has experienced. The panel has considered counsel's submissions in regards to being targeted, as the claimant's father has had very serious allegations made against him regarding his association with the LTTE, specifically one of the group's renowned members, the late Gopi. The documentary evidence15 is clear that despite the fact the war has been over for more over four years, the situation in Sri Lanka is continuing to evolve. The panel considered whether the claimant's profile as a failed asylum seeker, should he be returned to Sri Lanka, would attract negative attention from Sri Lankan authorities and whether that attention would be the basis of a well-founded fear of persecution.\n[29] The panel has considered counsel's submissions in regards to the situation of Tamils, particularly young males, and those whose family members are more likely than not are associates of the LTTE. Counsel notes that most of those in those two categories face discrimination and persecution by the Sri Lankan authorities. The claimant has testified that he is at risk for detention because of his contact with the ICRC as well as his father's perceived connection to the LTTE however, the panel notes that the claimant has not provided any documents to support his involvement with the ICRC. The claimant is not alleging any involvement with any anti-government activities himself while in Sri Lanka, and therefore the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that he would not be targeted by the government authorities. Furthermore, his father, despite being held twice for lengthy detentions for having alleged connections to a significant member of the LTTE, has himself been released. Although he is required to report to Sri Lankan authorities, he has been granted permission to travel outside the country for business.\n[30] Based on the above, the panel finds that there is no evidence to suggest that the Government of Sri Lanka considers the claimant a security threat or that he was a member of the LTTE. There is no indication that the claimant while traversing the multiple countries was involved in any anti-Sri Lanka government activities, nothing to suggest he was involved in any anti-Sri Lanka government activities during his short stay in Canada. The panel finds that in this claimant's particular circumstances, his personal profile is not one that would subject him to be viewed or targeted with suspicion by the Sri Lankan authorities. For these reasons, the panel does not find the claimant's particular profile in regards to being a failed asylum seeker returning to Sri Lanka would subject him to a risk of persecution upon his return to Sri Lanka.\n[31] The panel has considered reports which suggest that returnees are at a heightened risk of being detained at the airport and at risk of torture should the returnees have connections to the LTTE.16 It is clear that regardless of the ongoing post-war challenges in Sri Lanka, groups of Tamils continue to return to Sri Lanka both on a voluntary basis and as failed refugee claimants. Documentary sources state that returning Tamils are subjected to the same screening process for all persons returning to Sri Lanka, regardless of whether they are returning on a voluntary basis or as the result of a failed refugee claim.17 Once a returnee's right to enter the country has been established, they are then interviewed at the airport by the Criminal Investigations Division (CID), followed by an interview by the State Intelligence Service (SIS). The CID conducts criminal background checks of returnees by contacting the police stations in all the districts in which the returnee lived. Generally, these police record checks may be completed in a few hours, but can last 24 to 48 hours. However, in circumstances where it is difficult to obtain security clearance, these detainments may at times last for periods up to some months.\n[32] The Canadian High Commission has noted that there have only been four cases of persons having been detained upon arrival of which the Canadian High Commission is aware of, and these cases involved outstanding criminal charges in-country and were not related to their overseas asylum claims or their ethnicity. 18\n[33] The panel agrees that the preponderance of documentary evidence corroborates counsel's argument that returnees who are suspected of having ties to the LTTE face increased surveillance by the Sri Lankan government upon their return to Sri Lanka. Counsel's documentary evidence indicates that young Tamil men from the northern and eastern Sri Lanka, in areas where the LTTE held strongholds during the war, are disproportionately subject to arrest and detention on the suspicion of having ties to the LTTE.19 The documents suggest that in cases where returnees are Tamils with connection to Tamil causes, it is very likely that they will be screened at the airport and taken into police custody. However, in the circumstances of this claimant, he has testified that he has no connection whatsoever to the LTTE and furthermore, the panel notes that he is not a Tamil male from the North, but he was born and raised in Colombo.\n[34] There is also documentary evidence showing many examples of persons returning to Sri Lanka who have been out of the country for lengthy periods (some of whom left prior to the ceasefire period, some who left during the ceasefire period and some who left after the ceasefire period). These persons are returning on both a voluntary basis and as failed refugee claimants.\n[35] The United Kingdom Border Agency (UKBA) found similar results and they noted on June 17, 2011, 26 failed asylum seekers, 15 of whom were Tamil, seven of whom were Muslim, and four of whom were Sinhalese. When the returnees arrived at Colombo, the CID questioned them all. After questioning, no arrests or criminal charges were laid, they were released and all returned to their homes.20 As such, the panel determines that the claimant's past history in Sri Lanka does not establish a well-founded fear of persecution. Given the various issues of credibility, the panel concludes that the claimant was not personally targeted nor did he have a significant LTTE profile with authorities.\n[36] In summary, the panel does not find the claimant's allegations that are central to his claim, namely that he was targeted by the police for his involvement with the ICRC. The panel does not find the claimant to fit a particular profile that would be at risk if he were to return to Sri Lanka. The panel therefore finds that there is no credible or trustworthy evidence supporting the allegation that the claimant has come to the attention of the Sri Lankan authorities.\nCONCLUSION\n[37] After careful consideration of all of the evidence, including the claimant's testimony, as well as submissions by counsel for the claimant, the panel, on the basis of the totality of all the evidence made available to the panel, finds that there is not a serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted in Sri Lanka, nor that he would be subjected personally to a risk to his life, a risk to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or to a danger of torture. For these reasons, the claim is rejected.\n(signed)\n\"K. Foreman\"\nK.

They are claiming refugee protection in Canada pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)1.\n[2] In accordance with section 167(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the Refugee Protection Division appointed the principal claimant to be the designated representative of the minor claimant for the purpose of this refugee claim.\n[3] These claims were heard jointly pursuant to Rule 55 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules.\n[4] The panel has considered and been guided by Guideline 3: Child Refugee Claimants: Procedural and Evidentiary Issues2 during the hearing and in coming to a decision in these claims.\nALLEGATIONS\n[5] The details of the claimant's allegations were documented in the principal claimant's and associate claimant's Basis of Claim forms (BOC)3 as well as in their oral testimony. The claimants fear the Ethiopian state authorities and security forces because of the principal claimant's political opinion.\n[6] The principal claimant became a member of the XXXXParty in XXXX 2013 and actively participated in assisting the XXXX Party XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The principal claimant was detained by security forces on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015 when he returned to Ethiopia and was interrogated about his XXXX Party activities. The claimant was abused and assaulted while in detention. The claimant was released on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015 and fled Ethiopia on XXXX XXXX, 2015. The claimants resided in the United Arab Emirates until they came to Canada in August 2015.\nDETERMINATION\n[7] The panel determines that the claimants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of IRPA.\n[8] The determinative issue in this claim is credibility.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[9] The panel finds that the claimants have established, on a balance of probabilities, their personal identities and their national identities as citizens of Ethiopia through the disclosure of their identity documents, namely their passports.4\nCredibility\nThe principal claimant's political activities in Ethiopia\n[10] The principal claimant's alleged political activities with the XXXX Party took place in Dubai. The principal claimant was asked if he was ever active politically in Ethiopia. The principal claimant stated, \"Not in Ethiopia.\" The principal claimant then further stated that his political activities were \"outside Ethiopia in Dubai\". When asked why he was not politically active in Ethiopia, the principal claimant stated that he was working in Dubai and that he went to Dubai in 2007. The principal claimant continued to testify in a confusing and rambling manner that the country was moving ahead and that programs were clear for everybody. The principal claimant then suddenly stated that he was a supporter of the political party XXXX and that he participated in XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. The principal claimant stated that he was involved in such political activities in Ethiopia. When asked why he testified previously that he was not politically active in Ethiopia and only in Dubai, the principal claimant stated he said that because he was only a supporter of XXXX and not a member. The panel rejects the principal claimant's explanation. The principal claimant is fluent in English and had the assistance of the interpreter directly beside him at the hearing. The question was a simple question: \"Were you ever active politically in Ethiopia?\" The panel made no reference in its question to whether the claimant was a political supporter or a political member. The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that it is reasonable to expect that had the principal claimant been politically active by attending XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX, that he would have stated so at the outset when the question was posed to him as such activities are clearly and irrefutably political activities. The panel finds the principal claimant's internally inconsistent testimony is an indication of the principal claimant's lack of credibility.\n[11] The principal claimant was asked to give details of the demonstrations and meetings he attended in Ethiopia. The principal claimant stated he attended two demonstrations. When asked when these demonstrations occurred, the principal claimant was very hesitant and paused for a while before stating that he could not remember the date and that he was not sure. The principal claimant then eventually stated it was in 2005. The principal claimant did not provide any detailed evidence of the demonstrations he attended and what he did there. Similarly the principal claimant's testimony of where and how he XXXX XXXX and was equally vague and lacking in any meaningful detail. When asked about the political meetings he attended in Ethiopia, the principal claimant then stated that it was a \"gathering\" as opposed to a formal meeting and that it was in a hall. His testimony about the meetings was vague and evasive. Given the almost complete absence of any meaningful or fulsome testimony of his political activities in Ethiopia, and given the principal claimant's evasiveness and inability to recall when the demonstrations he participated in took place, dates that the panel finds would be reasonable to recall given that they would have been memorable occasions, the panel draws a negative inference and finds the principal claimant is not a credible witness with respect to his allegations he was active politically in Ethiopia.\n[12] The principal claimant makes no reference in his BOC that he was active politically in Ethiopia. The panel asked why the principal claimant makes no mention in his BOC that he was active politically in Ethiopia, by XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX. The principal claimant explained that the interpreter who assisted him with his BOC instructed the principal claimant to only explain the principal claimant's current situation. The principal claimant stated that it was a rush application and that it was not organized and that he did not give it deep thought. The panel rejects the principal claimant's explanation. The principal claimant confirmed at the outset of the hearing that his BOC is complete, true, and correct. The principal claimant's BOC was submitted on October 9, 2015 and his refugee hearing on December 2, 2015. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities that even if the application process was as rushed and disorganized as the principal claimant claims, that the principal claimant had ample opportunity between October 9, 2015 and December 2, 2015 to submit amendments to his BOC with respect to his political activities in Ethiopia. The only BOC amendments that were submitted were with respect to the biographic information of the principal claimant's siblings and the addition of the details of the principal claimant's brother's asylum in the United States.5 The panel finds it is reasonable to expect that the principal claimant would have taken that same opportunity when he submitted amendments to his BOC to also include the information about his political activities in Ethiopia. The principal claimant was represented and had the guidance and benefit of experienced counsel to prepare and to amend his BOC and include details about his alleged political activities in Ethiopia. The panel finds the principal claimant has not provided a reasonable explanation for the omission of relevant and crucial information. The panel finds the omission is significant given that it directly relates to the details of his political activities and thereby his political opinion. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant is not a credible witness in this regard and finds that the principal claimant embellished the details of his political activities for the purpose of his refugee claim. The panel finds there is insufficient persuasive and credible evidence before the panel to find that the principal claimant was ever active politically in Ethiopia. The panel finds the principal claimant is not a credible witness.\nThe principal claimant's political activities in Dubai with the XXXX Party\n[13] When asked what he did for the XXXX Party, the principal claimant stated that he was a member of the XXXX Party in the Dubai chapter and prepared XXXX Party XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to Ethiopia. When asked if he did anything else, the principal claimant stated that he also XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX to the party. The principal claimant stated that he met with the XXXX Party members on the first Friday of every month. The panel noted that there is no mention in the principal claimant's BOC that he XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX with the XXXX Party. The only reference in the principal claimant's BOC to the principal claimant's political activities with the XXXX party states that he helped the XXXX Party XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The principal claimant explained that such details were supposed to be included and that his BOC was a \"rush work\" and not complete. The panel rejects the principal claimant's explanation. The principal claimant confirmed at the outset of the hearing that his BOC is complete, true, and correct. The principal claimant's BOC was submitted on October 9, 2015 and his refugee hearing on December 2, 2015. No BOC amendments were submitted with respect to the principal claimant's XXXX Party activities. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that even if the BOC was an incomplete \"rush work\" as the principal claimant claims, that the principal claimant had ample opportunity between October 9, 2015 and December 2, 2015 to submit amendments to his BOC. The principal claimant was represented and had the guidance and benefit of experienced counsel to prepare and to amend his BOC. The panel finds the principal claimant has not provided a reasonable explanation for the omission of relevant and crucial information. The panel finds the omission is significant given that it directly relates to the details of his political activities and thereby his political opinion. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities that the principal claimant is not a credible witness in this regard and finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant embellished the details of his political activities for the purpose of his refugee claim. The panel finds the principal claimant is not a credible witness.\nThe principal claimant's passport and the principal claimant's detention by Ethiopian security forces\n[14] The principal claimant was allegedly detained in Ethiopia from XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014 to XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014 because of his political activities. The principal claimant alleges he was physically assaulted and interrogated by Ethiopian state officials. The principal claimant stated he did not have any contact with his family or friends while he was detained. The principal claimant explained that his passport was seized by the officials while he was detained and once he was released on XXXX XXXX, 2014 his friend XXXX applied for another passport on behalf of the principal claimant and the principal claimant was then issued a new passport on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014. The principal claimant explained that XXXX took care of all the arrangements and also paid bribes in order to get the principal claimant's new passport.\n[15] A copy of the principal claimant's passport which the principal claimant alleges was issued on XXXX XXXX, 2014 is included in Exhibit 1. The panel notes that the passport was issued on XXXX XXXX, 2014. When asked how the principal claimant could have possibly been issued a new passport during the time he was detained and moreover, even before he had even applied for a new passport, the principal claimant stated that his friend XXXX told the immigration officials that the principal claimant's previous passport was lost on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014 and that therefore the passport officials agreed to issue the new passport with a date of issue of XXXX XXXX, 2014, despite the passport being issued on XXXX XXXX, 2014 to match the date of when the principal claimant's previous passport was lost. The panel rejects the principal claimant's explanation. There is no reliable or trustworthy objective documentary evidence before the panel to show that immigration officials in Ethiopia would willingly and purposely alter the date of issue of its passports based on the date of lost passports nor is there any objective documentary evidence before the panel to show that such passport issuance practices for replacement of lost passports are customary in Ethiopia. The panel finds the principal claimant is not a credible witness.\n[16] The principal claimant repeatedly stated that it was his friend XXXX who obtained the passport on his behalf. The panel has reviewed the letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX and the panel notes there is not a single reference in his letter to his having helped the principal claimant obtain a passport.6 XXXX XXXX XXXX only states in his letter that he assisted the principal claimant with security clearance at the airport when the principal claimant fled Ethiopia. The panel finds that it is reasonable to expect that since XXXX XXXX XXXX mentioned in his letter that he assisted the principal claimant with security clearance at the airport that he would have also mentioned that he had also helped the principal claimant obtain a new passport. While the principal claimant testified that his passport was obtained by way of bribes given by his friend, XXXX, the panel notes there is no reliable evidence that the principal claimant's passport was obtained through his friend XXXX or that there was any intermediary involved at all in the procurement of the principal claimant's passport. The panel finds the lack of consistency between the principal claimant's testimony and his friend's letter undermines the credibility of both the principal claimant's testimony and of the letter from MXXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[17] The panel notes that the principal claimant's passport contains visas for Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, as well as a Schengen visa. The panel finds this is clear evidence that the passport has passed through the hands of multiple government officials from Europe, Canada, and the United States and has been accepted as a genuine, properly issued document. There is no indication that the authenticity or trustworthiness of the principal claimant's passport has ever been questioned. In considering the evidence the panel gives the passport more evidentiary weight than the principal claimant's testimony as there is no persuasive evidence before the panel that undermines the trustworthiness and reliability of the passport. With no persuasive evidence to the contrary the panel finds the passport is a genuine document that was properly issued on XXXX XXXX, 2014. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities that the principal claimant's passport was issued on XXXX XXXX, 2014 as the passport indicates and not on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014 as the principal claimant alleges.\n[18] The principal claimant alleges he arrived in Ethiopia from Dubai on XXXX XXXX, 2014 and was apprehended at the airport and detained by Ethiopian authorities from XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014 to XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant was not in detention from XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014 to XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014. The issuance of the principal claimant's passport on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014 clearly and irrefutably indicates otherwise. The principal claimant's passport is persuasive evidence that the principal claimant was able to visit a passport office to apply for and obtain a passport from the time he landed in Ethiopia on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014 and the issuance of his passport the next day on XXXX XXXX, 2014. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant fabricated his allegations of detention and abuse to embellish his profile as a XXXX Party member. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no persuasive evidence that the principal claimant was ever detained or ever came to the attention of the Ethiopian authorities because of his political profile and his political activities. The panel finds the principal claimant is not a credible witness and his word cannot be trusted.\nThe principal claimant's XXXX Party membership card and letter\n[19] The principal claimant submitted a letter from the XXXX Party.7 With the principal claimant's consent, the panel took the step of sending the letter to the IRB Research Directorate for verification as to its authenticity. The result of that verification exercise was that \"all emails and phone calls were unsuccessful\" in the research unit's attempts to reach the XXXX Party in Ethiopia through official XXXX Party channels via the contact information provided on the website of the XXXX Party.8The researcher was able to contact the United States XXXX Party branch; however, the contact there indicated to the researcher that he could not assist in providing a contact for the XXXX Party in Ethiopia. Counsel for the claimant provided post-hearing exhibits attached with his post-hearing submissions.9 These exhibits include seven untranslated letters from the XXXX Party. Counsel points to the fact that all seven letters from the XXXX Party have the same footer, letterhead and logo as the letter submitted by the principal claimant. Counsel also refers to the phone numbers given at the bottom of the seven letters and submits that had the researchers phoned the numbers indicated at the bottom of the letters that they would have reached the chairman or the vice-chairman of the party.\n[20] The panel finds that simply having an identical footer, letterhead, and logo is not persuasive evidence of the authenticity of the letter submitted by the principal claimant as there is no evidence before the panel that such details cannot be copied and replicated. The panel also finds that the fact that the XXXX Party can only be contacted through the contact information given in the claimant's XXXX Party letter and not through the contact information provided via official XXXX Party channels, namely their website or their XXXX Party branch in the United States, is not persuasive evidence of the reliability and trustworthiness of the letter. The entire purpose of the verification of the letter was to verify the letter by contacting the XXXX Party through official channels, independent of any contact information contained in the letter. The panel finds that using the information contained in the very document that is in question to verify the document is not persuasive evidence of its authenticity or trustworthiness.\n[21] The panel further notes that the letter from the XXXX Party states that the principal claimant attended meetings, paid his membership dues, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX with the XXXX Party XXXX in Dubai, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. There is no mention in the letter that the principal claimant also XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX as the principal claimant alleges. The letter from the XXXX Party also states that the principal claimant was arrested by the Ethiopian police at XXXX XXXX Airport on XXXX XXXX, 2014 and detained and tortured for XXXX days before being released on XXXX XXXX, 2014. The panel has found, on a balance of probabilities, that the principal claimant was not arrested nor detained in XXXX 2014 and that the principal claimant is not a credible witness in this regard. Given the serious credibility concerns that arise with the contents of the letter and the lack of evidence to establish the veracity of the letter, the panel gives the letter from the XXXX Party no evidentiary weight.\n[22] The claimant submitted a XXXX Party membership card.10 There is no security features embedded in the card. Given the serious credibility concerns that have arisen with respect to the claimant's political profile and his political activities the panel finds that a membership card that holds no security features is not persuasive evidence to overcome or address all those credibility concerns. There is no objective documentary evidence before the panel to establish what the necessary criteria, requirements and procedure are to obtain a XXXX Party membership card. The panel has found the claimant to be lacking in credibility with respect to his political profile and the panel finds there is no persuasive evidence independent of the claimant's testimony to establish that the membership card is a reliable and trustworthy document. The panel gives the membership card no evidentiary weight with respect to establishing the claimant's political membership with the XXXX Party and his political profile.\nThe principal claimant's XXXX Party documents\n[23] The principal claimant submitted supporting documentation related to his XXXX Party activities, including XXXX Party receipts, invoices, and letters from the principal claimant's friends, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX.11 The letters from XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX are personal letters, not sworn affidavits, and have no security features. The panel notes that both letters make reference to the principal claimant's arrest and detention by Ethiopian state authorities in XXXX 2014; however, the panel has found the principal claimant was not arrested nor detained in XXXX 2014 and that he is not a credible witness in that regard. The panel notes that XXXX XXXX states that the principal claimant attended meetings, contributed his membership fee and was \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\", yet there is no mention in XXXX XXXX letter that the principal claimant also XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. The panel finds that these are significant credibility concerns with respect to the trustworthiness of the letters. The panel finds the personal letters do not address or overcome the serious credibility concerns that arose. The panel gives the letters no evidentiary weight.\n[24] The XXXX Party receipts and invoices are handwritten receipts with no security features and with no evidence independent of the principal claimant's testimony of where and from whom these receipts originated from. There is no persuasive objective documentary evidence before the panel to indicate whether an individual must be politically active, be a political party member, or have any particular political profile at all in order to obtain receipts and invoices. The panel gives the receipts and invoices no evidentiary weight in establishing the political profile of the principal claimant.\nPolice documents\n[25] The principal claimant submitted a police summons issued from the XXXX XXXX City Police Commission demanding that the principal claimant present himself to the XXXX XXXX Police Commission for questioning.12 The summons is dated XXXX XXXX, 2014 and addressed to the principal claimant. The panel notes that there is no indication from the summons that the principal claimant is wanted for any reasons related to the principal claimant's alleged political activities. The summons simply states the following: \"Police wants you for questioning. Therefore, we strictly notify you to appear at the XXXX XXXX Police Commission, office number XXXX, on XXXX XXXX XXXX\/2014 at 9AM\". As the panel has found the principal claimant is not a credible witness with respect to his political activities in either Dubai or in Ethiopia, and has furthermore found that the principal claimant was not detained by Ethiopian state forces, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the police summons was not issued with respect to any matters relating to the principal claimant's political activities or political profile. The panel gives the police summons no evidentiary weight in establishing the political profile of the principal claimant.\nThe principal claimant's medical and psychiatric reports\n[26] The principal claimant submitted letters from: Dr. XXXX XXXX of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Dr. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who provided a psychiatric assessment report, and XXXX XXXX of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.13 The panel finds the reports from Dr. XXXX XXXX, Dr. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX were based on the principal claimant's history as recounted by the principal claimant himself, whom the panel has found to be lacking in credibility. While such reports can be helpful in assessing a claimant's refugee claim, in this particular case the panel cannot find that the reports address or overcome the credibility concerns noted. The panel finds that these reports are simply based on information recounted by the principal claimant himself. The higher courts have noted that the Board may reject a psychological report when the doctor has merely recounted what the claimant has told him\/her, and then formed a medical opinion without independent clinical studies.14The panel finds the reports cannot stand in lieu of all the deficiencies of the principal claimant's credibility or as a cure-all for why the principal claimant was so lacking in credibility. The Federal Court has held that a psychiatric report cannot possibly serve as a cure-all for any and all deficiencies in a claimant's testimony\".15 Furthermore, as stated in Danailov, with respect to the assessment of a physician's evidence and the question of the assessment of credibility, \"that opinion evidence is only as valid as the truth of the facts on which it is based.\" 16 While the principal claimant may be suffering from mental health issues, there is no persuasive evidence before the panel that the claimant's medical concerns are as a result of his political profile and political activities. Given that the panel has found the claimant not to credible in key areas of his claim and there is no evidence before the panel that the medical professionals did not base their conclusions on anything more than what the claimant recounted without conducting any further independent clinical studies, the panel assigns no evidentiary weight to the reports with respect to establishing the political profile of the principal claimant.\nXXXX XXXX XXXX Hospital Medical Certificate\n[27] The principal claimant submitted a medical certificate from the XXXX XXXX XXXX Hospital in Ethiopia dated XXXX XXXX, 2014.17 The medical certificate states that the principal claimant presented himself with various physical complaints and injuries. There is no reference in the medical certificate to the principal claimant's political profile, his alleged detention by Ethiopian state forces, or how the principal claimant received such injuries. The medical certificate simply reports the principal claimant's medical complaints, diagnosis, and treatment. There is no indication from the medical certificate of how the principal claimant obtained such injuries. As the panel has found the principal claimant is not a credible witness with respect to his allegations of detention and torture, the panel finds that while the principal claimant may have been injured in some fashion on XXXX XXXX, 2014, there is no persuasive evidence to find that the principal claimant's injuries are in any way connected to his political profile or his political activities or as a result of any interaction with the Ethiopian state forces. The panel gives the medical certificate no evidentiary weight in establishing the principal claimant's political identity as a member of the XXXX Party.\nThe associate claimant's and minor claimant's re-availment to Ethiopia\n[28] The associate claimant testified that she and the minor claimant traveled back to Ethiopia on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and remained in Ethiopia until they left on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015. The associate claimant explained that she and the principal claimant were having marital problems and that that is why she returned to Ethiopia. The associate claimant testified that she did not believe at the time that the Ethiopian state authorities would focus on her as she was not a member of the XXXX Party. Once the associate claimant \"got feedback\" from her family members in Ethiopia of the risk she faced, the associate claimant then realized the risk of harm to herself and the minor claimant.\n[29] The panel rejects the associate claimant's explanation. The principal claimant was allegedly detained and tortured for XXXX days. The principal claimant alleges a police summons was issued on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014 as a result of his political activities. The panel does not find it reasonable that the associate claimant willingly traveled back to Ethiopia with the minor claimant within three months of her husband's torture and in light of a police summons allegedly being issued against her husband simply because she believed she was not at risk. The panel does not find it reasonable that the associate claimant was unaware of the risk of harm she faced in travelling back to Ethiopia until she arrived in Ethiopia. The panel notes that not only did she willingly subject herself to a risk of harm in travelling back to Ethiopia when her husband was allegedly tortured and detained only three months prior, but she and the principal claimant also willingly subjected their son, the minor claimant to such risks when they allowed him to travel back to Ethiopia and moreover remained in Ethiopia for well over a month, from XXXX XXXX, 2015 to XXXX XXXX, 2015. There is no evidence that the associate claimant or the minor claimant encountered any problems with the Ethiopian state authorities during their stay in Ethiopia, despite entering Ethiopia under their own identities with their own passports and despite the documentary evidence which states that security forces detain family members of persons sought for questioning by the government.18 The panel finds that the associate claimant's travel to Ethiopia with the minor claimant and their lengthy stay in Ethiopia is not behaviour indicative of persons who fears a risk of harm in Ethiopia. Given the principal claimant's lack of credibility with respect to his political profile, the panel finds the associate claimant's and minor claimant's re-availment to Ethiopia is further evidence that the claimants are not credible witnesses and that they do not fear any risk of harm in Ethiopia. The panel finds the claimants are not credible witnesses.\nClaimants' political profile\n[30] The panel acknowledges that the principal claimant gave testimony of some aspects of the XXXX Party and its views. The panel finds that the principal claimant's limited knowledge is not persuasive evidence to establish the principal claimant's political profile. Given the serious credibility concerns that arose with the principal claimant's alleged political profile and political activities, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the principal claimant's knowledge of the XXXX Party was purposely gained and studied for the purpose of advancing his Canadian refugee claim and not from any genuine political practice. The panel finds that the credibility concerns that arose are serious and that there is insufficient persuasive, reliable and credible evidence before the panel to find that the principal claimant is a genuine member of the XXXX Party. The panel therefore finds that the principal claimant has not established on a balance of probabilities that he is a member of the XXXX Party or that he has any political profile, perceived or otherwise.\n[31] As the claims of the associate claimant and the minor claimant are based on the claim of the principal claimant and as the panel has determined the principal claimant lacks credibility with respect to his allegations of a risk of harm in Ethiopia, the panel finds that since the principal claimant's claim fails, so must too, the claims of the associate claimant and the minor claimant. The associate and minor claimants did not advance any other evidence that they would face a risk of harm in Ethiopia. The panel therefore finds that the claimants would not face a risk of harm should they return to Ethiopia.\nCONCLUSION\n[32] The panel has considered all the grounds of protection under section 96 and subsection 97(1) of IRPA and based on the totality of the evidence determines that there is not a serious possibility that the claimants would be persecuted in Ethiopia, or that, on a balance of probabilities, they would be personally subjected to a danger of torture, or face a risk to their life, or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Ethiopia.\n[33] The panel concludes that the claimants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection and therefore rejects their claim.\n[34] In rejecting these claims, the panel determines there was no credible or trustworthy evidence on which the panel could have made a favourable decision, given the claimants' lack of credibility and the lack of independent, credible evidence linking the claimants to potential persecution or a risk of harm under section 96 and 97 of IRPA. In accordance with section 107(2) of IRPA the panel determines that there is no credible basis for these claims.\n(signed)\n\"A. Jung\"\nA.

All relevant factors, such as the social and cultural context in which the claimant found herself, along with the issues, were examined and guided with consideration of the Chairperson's Gender Guidelines.\nPost hearing issues\n[3] Following the claimant's testimony after questions from the panel and counsel, the counsel was asked for his submissions. Counsel requested that his submissions be made in writing and the panel accepted his request. On March 15, 2016 counsel submitted a request for an audit of the interpretation of the hearing as he stated that soon after the hearing the claimant notified him that on two separate occasions the interpreter had made a mistake in interpreting what the claimant had said. He also attached his written submissions in the event that his request for an audit was denied.\n[4] The panel denied counsel's request for an audit of the interpretation for the following reasons. He had not identified any specific areas of concern regarding interpretation and he had not made submissions about what part of the claimant's testimony was affected. Furthermore, because the claimant has proficiency in English and she completed her BOC in English, the panel would expect to have heard of any concerns regarding interpretation issues to have been made at the earliest opportunity.\n[5] After being notified that the request had been denied, counsel made further submissions on March 18, 2016 pertaining to his request for an audit. He indicated that a specific example of a mistake made by the interpreter is that the interpreter added the phrase \"peace be upon him,\" which she did not say. Counsel also indicated that although the claimant knows English she is relatively young and was nervous at the hearing; therefore she was not able to advise either the panel or counsel of the errors in the interpretation.\n[6] The panel does not find that counsel's request for an audit of the interpretation is warranted for the same reasons as previously stated. In addition, the claimant was advised at the start of the hearing to let the panel know if there were any issues with the interpretation.\nALLEGATIONS\n[7] The claimant's allegations are documented in her Basis of Claim form (BOC)3 narrative. In summary, she fears harm in Pakistan because of her profile as a Christian woman. She fears a Muslim student at her college named XXXX XXXX who wanted to forcibly convert her to Islam and marry her. The claimant also fears being forcibly converted and married to other Muslim men in general.\nDETERMINATION\n[8] The panel determines that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\n[9] The determinative issues are credibility and an internal flight alternative (IFA).\nIdentity\n[10] The claimant's identity as a national of Pakistan is established through testimony and the supporting documentation filed. 4\n[11] The claimant's religious identity as a Christian is also established through testimony and the supporting documentation filed. 5\nCredibility\n[12] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are indeed true unless there is valid reason to doubt their veracity.6 The determination as to whether a claimant's evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities.7\n[13] The panel finds the claimant not credible with respect to her material allegations, namely that she faces a risk of harm or persecution from XXXX XXXX who wants to forcibly convert her to Islam and marry her.\n[14] The claimant stated that she is afraid of Muslim extremists in Pakistan, XXXX XXXX, a fellow student at her college and the police.\n[15] The claimant stated that as far as she knows XXXX XXXX is not part of an extremist group but that he is affiliated with the studentXXXX XXXX XXXX at her university. She explained that the XXXX XXXX is a XXXX XXXX but that it is not comprised of fundamentalists. She fears XXXX XXXX as he told her that if she refused to get married to him he would charge her with blasphemy.\n[16] The claimant explained that she is not afraid of any specific men, but she is afraid of Muslim extremists as they serve in the form of groups that are comprised of fundamentalist young men.\n[17] The claimant stated she is also afraid of the police who might charge her with blasphemy if she made a complaint against XXXX XXXX as they will take the side of the Muslim population.\n[18] The panel noted to the claimant that her BOC omitted the information that she is afraid of Muslim extremists; she only mentions her fear of harm from XXXX XXXX. The claimant explained that she thought that he was an extremist because he wore a long beard and the traditional attire that Muslims wear.\n[19] The panel asked the claimant if she thought that he was part of a terrorist group or if he was fundamentalist in terms of his ideologies. The claimant stated that she thinks that he is a combination of both being part of a terrorist group and being fundamentalist regarding his ideologies because his ideas are fundamentalist but that he would not dare take extremist action.\n[20] The panel rejects the claimant's explanation. Her BOC does not indicate that she is afraid of extremist groups. The omission is material as it concerns one of the agents of persecution. The claimant completed her BOC in English, she was represented by competent counsel and she confirmed at the start of the hearing that BOC was complete, true and correct.\n[21] The panel further noted to the claimant that her BOC does not mention that XXXX XXXX is an extremist, only that he is part of the XXXX XXXX at her university. The claimant explained that it is because his way of dressing symbolizes his extremist views as other normal Muslims do not dress that way and he presented himself as a symbol of extremism.\n[22] The panel rejects the claimant's explanation and finds that her answers were inconsistent and they evolved as the omissions concerning the identity of the agents of persecution were put to her. The panel also notes that closer to the start of the hearing when asked who she was afraid of in Pakistan, the claimant initially said that as far as she knew XXXX XXXX was not an extremist. The panel finds that the claimant has exaggerated her allegations about XXXX XXXX from being a Muslim student at her college to being a Muslim student who might be part of a terrorist group and who has extremist views.\n[23] Due to the above noted significant inconsistencies and omissions concerning the agents of persecution, the panel draws a negative inference to the claimant's credibility and finds that her allegations concerning her fear of harm from extremist groups and XXXX XXXX are not credible. As such, the panel finds the claimant not credible with respect to her fear of the police, and finds that as she is not credible regarding her allegations concerning XXXX XXXX. As a result, it is not credible that she would be charged with blasphemy for refusing to convert to Islam and marrying him or for reporting XXXX XXXX to the police.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[24] The panel has also considered the issue of IFA.\n[25] The cases from Rasaratnam and Thirunavukkarasu clearly state the two-pronged test to be applied in determining whether there is an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA).8 First, the Board must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country in which it finds an IFA exists. Second, the conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimant, for him to seek refuge there.\n[26] The panel asked the claimant if she returned to Pakistan if she could reside somewhere else, such as Karachi. The claimant stated that although XXXX XXXX would not be in Karachi, there would be several other Muslim men who would treat her in the same manner. As the majority of the population is Muslim, they have the same extreme mindset. She stated that she cannot live her life in hiding or confinement as she would have to expose herself to study or to work, or to generally live her life. The claimant stated that the majority of the population of Christians in Pakistan are poor and cannot get visas; therefore she was lucky to have gotten a visa. She acknowledged that her family is not poor in Pakistan. She stated that there is discrimination in Pakistan for Christians when they try to get a job.\n[27] The claimant stated that she could not seek state protection in Karachi if she was being persecuted by Muslim men because the police are extremely impartial and they always protect the Muslim populations' interests and there have been recent incidents whereby the police murdered a young Christian man during the process of their investigation.\n[28] Considering the second prong of the IFA test, the claimant stated that even in Karachi, people living there are in an extreme state of fear because of persistent terrorist attacks and activities and that they are also thinking of moving or migrating from Karachi as they feel more vulnerable there.\n[29] The panel finds that there is not a reasonable possibility that the claimant would face persecution, or that she would be subjected on a balance of probabilities to a risk to her life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger of torture in the part of the country where the IFA exists. The panel also finds that it is not objectively unreasonable considering all of the circumstances including those particular to the claimant for her to seek refuge in the proposed internal flight alternative location. The panel finds that has a viable and reasonable internal flight alternative in Karachi. This is based on a number of factors arising in her evidence and the objective country documentation.\n[30] The panel notes that the claimant is well educated and independent; she completed her Bachelor of XXXX in XXXX at the XXXX XXXX College in XXXX, Pakistan. The claimant travelled alone from Pakistan to the United States. She resided in the United States for one month prior to coming to Canada to join her uncle. The claimant has shown that she is independent and resourceful by moving to another country such as Canada which is culturally diverse.\n[31] While the claimant stated that it she faced discrimination and harassment in Pakistan and that it was difficult for her to go out of the house alone without a male family member, she did go out on her own. She managed to complete her studies at the XXXX college. The claimant did not present any evidence that she had difficulty practicing her religion in Pakistan.\n[32] There is no evidence before the panel that the agent of persecution who wishes to forcibly convert the claimant to Islam and marry her would seek her out in any other location.\n[33] The panel finds that the claimant has a reasonable relocation alternative in Karachi. Karachi is a large urban city where she would have job opportunities given her completion of her Bachelor of XXXXdegree in XXXX. The panel does not find that it would be objectively unreasonable or unduly harsh for her to move to Karachi where she speaks the language as well as English and has an education that is marketable in an urban area.\n[34] Although the claimant states that she fears Muslims throughout Pakistan, the panel does not find that she has a reasonable possibility of persecution in terms of her fears of being forcibly converted to Islam and forced to marry a Muslim man.\n[35] The panel has considered the situation for Christian women living in Pakistan. According to the Board's National Documentation Package, there are many Christians in Pakistan,the U.S. government estimates the total population at 196.2 million (July 2014 estimate).9\n[36] Islam is the official religion of Pakistan and sources indicate that 97 percent of the population is Muslim. Sources report various estimates of the number of Christians in Pakistan, including: 1.27 million (Plus News Pakistan 5 Sept. 2012), two million (Dawn 15 Apr. 2010), and three million (30 Aug. 2012). Sources indicate that the majority of Christian Pakistanis live in the province of Punjab. 10\n[37] The Constitution of Pakistan accords citizens the right to \"profess, practice and propagate\" their religion, \"subject to law, public order and morality. However, other laws, as well as government practices, restrict freedom of religion, particularly for religious minorities and religious freedom is subject to numerous legal restrictions. 11\n[38] A London-based NGO focussing on human rights abuses in Pakistan against Christians and other religious minorities indicated that Christians generally have good relations with other religious minorities and some \"more liberal\" Muslims. However, it is also noted that because of the strong influence of Islamism over Pakistani society, overall attitudes are overwhelmingly negative. Sources note that Christians are considered to be \"inferior\" and are largely politically powerless and impoverished and that discrimination against Christians is motivated not only by religion but also by caste prejudice. 12\n[39] Sources report that Christians are subject to employment discrimination and work primarily in menial occupations, partly due to the high rates of illiteracy and poverty among Christians, and also because of societal attitudes that consider Christians to be \"unclean.\"\n[40] Other sources state that it is a stereotype that many Christians do menial work, and they are \"robustly represented in a variety of positions ... in teaching, social work, the arts and institution building\". Although based on information collected in interviews with Christians in professional and menial occupations in urban areas, well-educated young Christians are unable to find employment. Government sources indicate that five percent of government jobs are reserved for religious minorities; however, other sources report that this policy has not been effectively implemented. 13\n[41] Intolerance and growing religious extremism is noted in Pakistan.14 In its human rights report of 2012, Freedom House states that \"recent waves of attacks on Christians have been attributed to the spread of Sunni extremist ideology\" in Pakistan (2012). The USCIRF states that Christians were targeted in 2011 by attacks by \"armed extremists,\" some of whom have ties to the Pakistani Taliban. The BPCA indicated that the Taliban \"and other Pashtun Islamists\" attack Christians in Karachi on a regular basis and that the militant group Lashkar e-Taiba, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the governments of Canada and the United States.\n[42] Sources indicate that government officials do not adequately protect religious minorities from violence. The Evangelical Asian Church representative stated that it is difficult for the authorities to protect members of religious minorities, even if they want to, because of pressure from \"extremists\".15\n[43] The February 2015 United Kingdom Home Office on the situation of Christians in Pakistan states: There are incidents of some Christians being subject to harassment, discrimination, violence and murder at the hands of non-state actors in Pakistan, as well as allegations of blasphemy and forced conversion to Islam. However, there are a large number of Christians in the country and the evidence does not indicate that Christians are, in general, subject to a real risk of persecution or inhuman or degrading treatment. 16\n[44] Unlike the position of Ahmadis, Christians in general are permitted to practise their faith, can attend church, participate in religious activities and have their own schools and hospitals.17\n[45] Along with Christians, Sunnis, Shi'as, Ahmadis and Hindus may all be potentially charged with blasphemy. Citizens who are more marginalised and occupy low standing social positions may be less able to deal with the consequences of such proceedings. The risk of becoming a victim of a blasphemy allegation will depend upon a number of factors and must be assessed on a case by case basis. Relevant factors will include the place of residence, whether it is an urban or rural area, and the individual's level of education, financial and employment status and level of public religious activity such as preaching.18\n[46] Like other women in Pakistan, Christian women, in general, face discrimination and may be at a heightened risk but this falls short of a generalised real risk. Factors such as their age, place of residence and socio-economic milieu are all relevant factors when assessing the risk of abduction, conversions and forced marriages.'19\n[47] The NGO Movement for Solidarity and Peace (MSP) reported estimates of 100 to 700 forced conversions to Islam of Christian girls and women each year. The USCIRF reported that 'Marginalization and poverty make the Christian community in Pakistan vulnerable and sexual assaults against underage Christian girls by Muslim men continue to be reported. Catholic NGOs estimate at least 700 Christian girls are kidnapped and forced to convert to Islam every year. The Asian Human Rights Commission also estimated that 700 Christian girls are forcibly converted to Islam each year in Pakistan, notably in Punjab, Khyber Pakhtun Kha and Sindh provinces and reports that 'Typically, girls are abducted, raped, and kept in Madrassas, where they are forced to sign marriage certificates and state that they have converted to Islam.' The UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines consider that 'Law enforcement authorities are reportedly unable or unwilling to protect victims of forced marriage and other forms of sexual and gender based violence.'\n[48] The constitution establishes Islam as the state religion, and it requires that laws be consistent with Islam. The constitution states, \"subject to law, public order, and morality, every citizen shall have the right to profess, practice, and propagate his religion.\" The government's general failure to investigate, arrest, or prosecute those responsible for religious freedom abuses promoted an environment of impunity that fostered intolerance and acts of violence, according to domestic and international human rights organizations. Government policies did not afford equal protection to members of minority religious groups, and due to discriminatory legislation such as blasphemy laws and laws designed to marginalize the Ahmadiyya Muslim community, minorities often were afraid to profess freely their religious beliefs. According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), police registered 20\n[49] Societal intolerance persisted, including mob attacks, blasphemy accusations, and violent extremist activities. Violent extremists in some parts of the country threatened citizens who did not follow their authoritarian interpretation of Islam.21\n[50] The constitution declares that adequate provisions shall be made for all citizens to profess and practice their religious beliefs freely. It states \"Every citizen shall have the right to profess, practice and propagate his religion.\" Other constitutional provisions and laws, however, impose limits on this right, which is \"subject to law, public order and morality.\"22\n[51] Government policies do not afford equal protection to members of majority and minority religious groups, and due to discriminatory legislation, minorities are often afraid to profess freely their religious beliefs. Media and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) report killings of religious minorities by police. Minorities also state that the judiciary is biased against religious minorities, especially in cases involving blasphemy.\n[52] The government's general failure to investigate, arrest, or prosecute those responsible for societal abuses promoted an environment of impunity that fostered intolerance and acts of violence, according to domestic and international human rights organizations. In numerous cases during the year, authorities failed to protect victims of religiously motivated mob violence.23\n[53] The Government of Pakistan allocates four seats in the Senate and ten seats in the National Assembly to minorities. There are also reportedly seats reserved for minorities in the provincial assemblies. The federal Ministry of National Harmony was created in July 2011 to provide \"oversight and coordination on issues relating to religious minorities\" and also to liaise with district interfaith harmony committees. The USCIRF reports, however, that the ministry is not represented in the federal cabinet. In August 2012, the State Minister for Interfaith Harmony indicated that interfaith harmony committees were currently being established at the district level throughout the country. The State Minister also announced that the ministry had launched a national campaign to promote national unity and interfaith harmony and that ten religious holidays of minority religions were to be celebrated officially by Pakistan 24\n[54] In summary the panel notes that the Pakistan constitution guarantees the rights of religious minorities .The panel also notes that there are problems in Pakistan concerning religious violence and extremism and gender based violence for women. The panel also notes efforts made by the government to address issues relating to religious minorities. Factors such as their age, place of residence and socio-economic milieu are all relevant factors when assessing the risk of abduction, conversions and forced marriages.\n[55] The panel has considered the claimant's particular circumstances and has considered such factors as her age, education and socio-economic milieu and finds that given her fears of kidnapping and forced conversion to Islam by Muslim men, there is not a serious possibility of persecution in Karachi or that on a balance of probabilities, she would not face a risk to her life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Karachi. The panel finds that it would not be unreasonable in all of the circumstances including those particular to the claimant for her to seek refuge in Karachi.\nCONCLUSION\n[56] The panel finds that the claimant has not satisfied her burden of establishing that there is a reasonable possibility of persecution on a Convention ground or that, on a balance of probabilities, she would be personally subjected to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture in Pakistan.\n[57] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel determines that the claimant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\n[58] The Refugee Protection Division therefore rejects her claim for refugee protection.\n(signed)\n\"J.

Consequently, they are claiming for refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The Principal Claimant joined a Falun Gong group in XXXX 2015 after having trouble with shoulder and neck pain as a result of her XXXXwork, which also led to severe insomnia. The Principal Claimant alleges that her Falun Gong group was raided by the Public Security Bureau (PSB) on XXXX XXXX, 2015. The Principal Claimant managed to escape capture and went into hiding. The Principal Claimant learned from her husband that the PSB came to seek her at her home on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015. The Principal Claimant then decided to flee to Canada.\n[3] The Principal Claimant alleges that she hired a smuggler who helped her obtain a U.S. visa. The Principal Claimant alleges that she and the Minor Claimant left China with the smuggler on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2016 and arrived in Los Angeles on the same day. She alleges that they then flew to Seattle and entered Canada from the U.S. on April 13, 2016.\n[4] The Principal Claimant alleges that the PSB has been back to her home on numerous occasions since this time, and had gone to the home of her relatives as well.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] The Panel finds that the Claimants have not demonstrated that there is a serious possibility of persecution if they return to China, nor that they are persons in need of protection pursuant to IRPA.2\nISSUES\n[6] The issues in this instance include identification, credibility, and whether the Principal Claimant is a Falun Gong practitioner.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[7] Upon examination of the documentation provided by the Claimants, including the certified true copy of their Claimant Resident Identity Cards which were seized by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada when making their claim,3 as well as the Minor Claimant's birth certificate,4 the Panel is satisfied that, on a balance of probabilities, the Claimants have established their identity as per section 106 of IRPA.5\n[8] However, the Panel does not find that the Principal Claimant has established, on a balance of probabilities, that she was a genuine Falun Gong practitioner in China, nor that she is a genuine practitioner in Canada. The reasons for this finding will be canvassed later in the decision.\nExit from China when wanted by authorities\n[9] The Principal Claimant states that she was wanted by the PSB when she left China, but that she was able to depart from the country using her own passport. The Panel finds this scenario unlikely in light of much of the objective country documentation contained in the National Documentation Package (NDP) for China.\n[10] The objective evidence before the Tribunal shows that the freedom to exit China is not absolute.6 Pursuant to Article 12 of the Exit and Entry Administration Law of China, exit from the country is denied under certain circumstances, including situations where a citizen does not hold valid exit documents or is a suspect (or defendant) in a criminal case.7\n[11] As a part of their exit control measures, Chinese authorities have access to a PSB computer system known as \"Policenet\" or \"Golden Shield.\"8 The Golden Shield contains a database of fugitives and those convicted of offences, which is automatically searched when border authorities scan a passport.9\n[12] The Golden Shield allows authorities to search out any Chinese national's photograph, family background, political leanings, Internet history and other pertinent information.10 The documentary evidence contained in the NDP states that airports are connected to the Golden Shield.11 Indeed, the documentary evidence found in the NDP establishes that airport officials coordinate with police departments in China to track and detain individuals who are wanted by the authorities.12\n[13] Moreover, Chinese authorities are provided with Advance Passenger Information (API) on arriving and departing passengers.13 This information contains a number of details related to the passenger, including the passenger's name; date of birth; gender; nationality; country of residence; travel document type; and passport information.14 The provision of this information means that the authorities have detailed information on the passengers on outbound flights, thereby creating another obstacle in attempting to bypass China's exit control. As noted by the Refugee Appeal Division in X (Re), 2015 CanLII 72857 (CA IRB):\nAPI requirements which have been in effect for years, in conjunction with the highly effective Golden Shield program, makes it, on a balance of probabilities, unlikely a wanted person could depart China from an international airport using a passport with his own name, date of birth, and photograph in it. The likelihood of bribing so many people as would be involved in a person's departure is miniscule. From the person selling the ticket, to the check in counter, to the security checkpoint, the customs and immigration people onto the person who checks the Boarding pass, all of these people may be randomly in place and make it nearly impossible for anyone to know who to bribe at what point. It is simply implausible that a wanted man will escape China on his own legitimate documents [emphasis added].15\n[14] In this case, the Principal Claimant left China on her own genuine passport and, similar to X (Re), testified that a smuggler was able to successfully smuggle her out of the country. She could provide no details about how the smuggler facilitated her exit from China. While the Panel accepts that it is possible to bypass the security measures set in place by China to control exits from the country, the Panel has also considered the extensive evidence in the NDP regarding the difficulty a person faces in leaving China if she is wanted by the PSB, including being checked through the Golden Shield database and having their API information provided to the Chinese authorities prior to their departure.\n[15] Indeed, when considering the documentary evidence with regard to the thoroughness of the security measures controlling departures from China, The Panel finds find that, on a balance of probabilities, the Principal Claimant's ability to leave China using her own passport was not due to the interventions of a smuggler, but rather because she was not wanted by the PSB as she alleged. The Panel draws a negative finding of credibility against the Principal Claimant because of the story she has put forward to explain her ease of departure from China, despite allegedly being sought by the PSB.\nNo Passport or other Proof of Travel\n[16] As noted above, the Principal Claimant testified that she travelled using her genuine passport. However, the Principal Claimant testified that she was unable to provide her passport to the Panel because she had given it to the smuggler. When asked why the smuggler took her passport, the Principal Claimant stated that the smuggler made her agree to relinquish her passport as a term of their agreement.\n[17] Mr. Justice Nadon (as he then was), in Elazi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2000 CanLII 14891 (FC), stated the following about the importance of the passport and air ticket in a refugee claim:\nI take this opportunity to add that it is entirely reasonable for the Refugee Division to attach great importance to a claimant's passport and his air ticket. In my opinion, these documents are essential to establish the claimant's identity and his journey to come to Canada. Unless it can be assumed that a refugee status claimant is actually a refugee, it seems unreasonable to me to ignore the loss of these documents without a valid explanation. In my view, it is too easy for a claimant to simply state that he has lost these documents or the facilitator has taken them...16\n[18] Mr. Justice Nadon further noted that :\nMinimizing the importance of the passport and air ticket as documents to be produced or ignoring their non-submission for all sorts of reasons in my opinion only serves to encourage all those whose only purpose is to take advantage of a system which is intended solely to enable genuine refugees to come to Canada.17\n[19] In this case, the Principal Claimant failed to provide her passport to the Panel. She also failed to provide any other proof of travel to the Panel, such as a boarding pass, itinerary, or baggage tags. The Principal Claimant alleged she was unable to provide the boarding pass and itinerary because this information was inserted into the passport when she handed it to the smuggler.\n[20] The Panel does not accept the Principal Claimant's explanation for failing to provide any documentation of her journey to Canada as being that all of her documentation was taken by the smuggler. This is especially so where the Panel has already found that it is more likely than not that the Principal Claimant did not use a smuggler to leave China as alleged, given the ease with which she departed. Consequently, the Panel draws a negative inference against the Principal Claimant's credibility on the basis of her failure to provide her passport or any other travel documentation to the Board.\nLack of Documentation from Chinese Authorities\n[21] The PSB allegedly sought the Principal Claimant at her home on many occasions, including four instances prior to her departure from China and two incidents after her departure from China. The Principal Claimant alleged that at the first visit, the PSB told her husband that three members of her Falun Gong group had been arrested. She alleged that the PSB showed her husband a search warrant and then searched her home; she also alleged that the PSB told her husband that they would catch her sooner or later. When asked, the Principal Claimant stated that the PSB visited her home on three more occasions prior to her departure from China. She also alleged that the PSB visited family members, including her parents' and husband's siblings' homes prior to her departure. The Principal Claimant also alleged that the PSB sought her out on two occasions since her arrival in Canada.\n[22] However, according to the Principal Claimant's testimony, on none of these occasions did the PSB leave a summons or other documentation for her.\n[23] The current NDP states that Falun Gong practitioners in China are detained under Article 300 of China's Criminal Procedure Code, which deals with criminal involvement in evil cults.18 The NDP also indicates that the PSB issue summons in criminal investigations, and that summons may be left with an adult family member if the subject of interest is absent.19 The Country Condition documents suggest that this practice is becoming quite consistent in its application.20\n[24] The quantity of visits in this case, the nature of these visits (such as, in the first visit, demanding to learn of the Principal Claimant's whereabouts and activities, a search of her home, pronouncements of the PSB's determination to find her), as well the alleged visits to her family members, all point to the conclusion that the PSB have more than a casual or passing interest in the Principal Claimant. Furthermore, the Principal Claimant alleges that several other members of her Falun Gong group was arrested during the raid, which also points to a higher level of PSB interest than simply a passing or casual interest.\n[25] When considering the circumstances alleged by the Principal Claimant (that being, for instance, the PSB's six visits to the Principal Claimant's home and its visits to the homes of two other relatives, the arrest of several fellow Falun Gong practitioners members, and the PSB's assertions that the Principal Claimant would be caught) within the context of the country condition documents, the Panel finds that if the PSB were indeed seeking the Principal Claimant as intently as alleged, that, on a balance of probabilities, a summons or other document indicating the PSB's interest and demands would have been left at her residence. In making this finding, the Panel considers that in Zhang v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2011 FC 654, Kelen J. upheld a similar finding, noting that the Board may weigh the documentary evidence against the applicant's testimony and find that the documentary evidence supports a finding that is contrary to the testimony of the applicant.21\n[26] In this case, there were no official documents submitted into evidence to indicate any PSB interest in the Principal Claimant, despite it being reasonably expected in the circumstances based on the information contained in the NDP. As such, the Panel draws a negative inference regarding the Principal Claimant's credibility, as well as the credibility of her allegations of being sought by the PSB, because of a lack of such documentation.\nFindings on PSB Interest\n[27] When considering the Principal Claimant's ability to leave China when allegedly wanted by the PSB, and the lack of any documentation regarding the PSB's interest when a summons or a similar document could be reasonably expected, the Panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the Principal Claimant is not wanted by the PSB as alleged. The Panel makes a strong finding against the credibility of the Principal Claimant and her allegations on this basis.\nCredibility as a Falun Gong practitioner\n[28] The Panel finds that the Principal Claimant displayed reasonable knowledge of the principles of Falun Gong based on the length of time she alleges having been a Falun Gong practitioner. To this end, the Principal Claimant was able to explain to the Panel several Falun Gong concepts, including white matter, dark matter, and the workings of the Law Wheel. The Principal Claimant also provided some information to the Panel regarding the 7th talk of Zhuan Falun when asked.\n[29] However, the Panel notes that simply having knowledge as to the basic principles of Falun Gong is not enough - in and of itself - to prove the genuineness of one's Falun Gong practice, as such knowledge can be gained by most anyone who would choose to read the works of Master Li relevant to Falun Gong.\n[30] In order to corroborate her allegations of being a Falun Gong practitioner, the Principal Claimant submitted a handwritten letter into evidence from her husband (the father of the Minor Claimant), as well as a letter from the husband of one of the practitioners that was arrested at the time of the alleged raid.22 These letters essentially confirm the details and events contained in the Claimants' BOC narrative and the Principal Claimant's testimony with regard to the PSB raid.\n[31] However, the Panel notes that these letters was not a sworn or notarized statements. Moreover, these letters are handwritten, there is no proof that these letters were written by the people alleged, as there is no identification provided with these letters to connect the authors with these letters. Furthermore, these writers were not called as witnesses at the hearing, thus rendering the Panel unable to test and assess the credibility of their statements. As such, the Panel finds that these letters are not a reliable source of evidence in this case, and it assigns no weight to these letters to corroborate the veracity of the Principal Claimant's alleged Falun Gong practice.\n[32] There is also a letter before the Panel concerning the Minor Claimant's expulsion from school.23 However, the Panel has found that the Principal Claimant's testimony regarding the PSB raid and their subsequent interest in her to lack credibility. As such, the Panel does not accept the dismissal letter as a result of the credibility concerns noted above, and furthermore, the Panel notes that this is a simplistic document that contains no security features and could be replicated quite easily. As the Panel has determined that the PSB was not interested in the Principal Claimant as alleged, the Panel assigns little weight to the document regarding the Minor Claimant's expulsion from school on the basis of the Principal Claimant's practice of Falun Gong.\n[33] According to Dan-Ash v. Minister of Employment and Immigration (1988), 93 N.R. 33 (F.C.A.), contradictions or discrepancies in the evidence of a refugee claimant is a well-accepted basis for a finding of lack of credibility. As noted by Mr. Justice Hugessen at page 35:\n\"unless one is prepared to postulate (and accept) unlimited credulity on the part of the Board, there must come a point at which a witness's contradictions will move even the most generous trier of fact to reject his evidence [Emphasis added].\"24\n[34] The Federal Court of Appeal held in Sheikh v. Canada that a general finding of a lack of credibility on the part of the Claimant may conceivably extend to all the relevant information emanating from his testimony.25 In this case, the Panel has found credibility concerns in relation to the Principal Claimant's evidence of her travel to Canada and the PSB's alleged interest in her that have not been reasonably explained. Because of these concerns, the Panel finds that the Principal Claimant was not wanted by the PSB as alleged, thereby making an additional negative finding against the credibility of the Claimants and their allegations.\n[35] The Panel must weigh its credibility concerns regarding the Principal Claimant's allegations of being sought by the PSB, against the evidence before the Panel that supports the Principal Claimant's allegations of being a Falun Gong practitioner in China.\n[36] In so doing, the Panel finds that the credibility concerns related to the Principal Claimant being wanted by the PSB are paramount. As the Principal Claimant's Falun Gong practice is tied directly to the alleged PSB interest in her, the Panel finds that these credibility concerns also cast serious doubt on the veracity of her alleged Falun Gong practice, leading the Panel to find that the Principal Claimant has not proven that she was, on a balance of probabilities, a Falun Gong practitioner in China.\nThe Claimant's Falun Gong Practice in Canada\n[37] Although the Panel has determined that the Principal Claimant was not a Falun Gong practitioner in China, it must still consider whether she has become a practitioner in Canada, or whether there is any reason to believe that the Principal Claimant may now be within the purview of section 96 since her arrival to Canada.\n[38] The Principal Claimant alleged that she practices Falun Gong on Saturdays in XXXX Park and has participated in other Falun Gong activities, including a parade with the XXXX XXXX association and handing out flyers for Falun Gong. She also spoke of practicing at the XXXX Mall.\n[39] The Principal Claimant provided two practitioner letters and photographs to corroborate her Falun Gong practice in Canada.26 However, the Panel notes that the information provided by the practitioners' letters differ significantly from the information given by the Principal Claimant during her testimony. For instance, the practitioners' letters spoke of practicing with the Principal Claimant each Saturday and Sunday at XXXX Park since mid-April. The Principal Claimant, however, first stated that she had been practicing at XXXX Park on Saturdays since mid-June. She then amended her testimony to say that she had been practicing since mid-May. When the Panel put to her that her BOC said that she had been practicing since mid-April, the Principal Claimant stated that April was the correct month and she was nervous when providing her previous answers.\n[40] When asked to provide more detail on her Saturday practices, the Principal Claimant stated that the practices took place from 8-9 am and that the group does exercises 1-5 in this time. The Principal Claimant then amended her testimony to state that the practices run from 8-10, but explained that at the start she did shorter practices of an hour until she could keep the pace of the other practitioners.\n[41] The Panel also asked the Principal Claimant why the letters corroborating her claim both stated that she practiced on both Saturdays and Sundays, when she only stated she practiced on Saturdays when asked about her Falun Gong practices and activities in Canada. The Principal Claimant explained that she did not practice every Sunday as she had the Minor Claimant with her, therefore at times she would observe and not practice. The Principal Claimant explained further that she sometimes does practice on Sundays, but other times will go to observe or take a walk with the Minor Claimant in the park. She then stated that she does practice at times on Sundays in the park, but only if the Minor Claimant is willing to sit and watch her practice.\n[42] Both letter writers corroborating the Principal Claimant's practice noted that they and the Principal Claimant study Zhuan Falun for an hour after the two hour-morning practice on Saturday and Sunday.27 However, the Principal Claimant did not mention the hour of study following the practice when asked about her Falun Gong activities and practice in Canada. When asked about this omission, the Principal Claimant simply explained that she was nervous when answering the question.\n[43] The Panel draws a serious negative credibility finding regarding the major discrepancies between the information the Principal Claimant provided about her Falun Gong practice in Canada, and the information provided in the letters from the practitioners. The Panel notes that the information provided in the practitioner letters was internally consistent between the letters: both letter writers allege they started practicing Falun Gong with the Principal Claimant in mid-April and have been practicing and studying with her on Saturdays and Sundays since then. The Principal Claimant's evidence on this, however, was inconsistent on important points, including when she started practicing, the content of these gatherings, and, significantly, how often she practices.\n[44] The Panel does not accept the Principal Claimant's explanations for these discrepancies, which, in two instances relied on her nervousness in answering the questions. The Panel notes that these questions were the final questions of the hearing and that the Principal Claimant had not previously mentioned being inhibited by nervousness at any time during the hearing; nor does the Panel accept the Principal Claimant's explanation for failing to mention the Sunday practices in her testimony because she only practices on some Sundays and other times may simply observe. Regardless of whether she participated in or observed Sunday practices, if the Principal Claimant attended XXXX Park every Sunday as alleged by the practitioners - as well as in her later testimony - the Panel can reasonably expect that the Principal Claimant would have mentioned these practices as a part of her practice regimen when asked.\n[45] The Panel finds that the discrepancies between the Principal Claimant's testimony and that of the practitioners letters regarding when she began practice results from the fact that the Principal Claimant did not begin regularly attending Falun Gong practices in mid-April as alleged. Even more important, however, is the Principal Claimant's omission of the weekly practice on Sunday - the Panel finds this omission very important in this instance, and finds that the Principal Claimant does not attend the Sunday Falun Gong session in XXXX Park as alleged, or else she would have mentioned this session voluntarily when asked about her practices and activities in Canada. Importantly, this omission also serves to discredit the letters provided by the Principal Claimant's alleged co-practitioners, who both stated that they practiced with the Principal Claimant twice weekly when the Principal Claimant's initial testimony did not corroborate this fact.\n[46] The Panel draws a negative inference regarding the Principal Claimant's testimony, her allegations, and the veracity of the corroborative letters on this basis. As such, the Panel cannot assign any weight to the letters regarding the Principal Claimant's alleged Falun Gong practice in Canada.\n[47] Furthermore, the Panel draws the same negative inferences with regard to the Principal Claimant's testimony regarding the post-practice study sessions that allegedly occur twice weekly, finding that the Principal Claimant's omission on these points is a result of her not attending these sessions on a regular basis as alleged by the co-practitioners.\n[48] The Principal Claimant also put photographs of her practicing Falun Gong and participating in Falun Gong activities before the Panel.28 However, the Panel finds that these photographs are not proof that the Principal Claimant has become a genuine Falun Gong practitioner while in Canada. Indeed, these photographs are unverifiable, and do not demonstrate an extended or committed involvement to Falun Gong practice.\n[49] Mr. Justice LeBlanc of the Federal Court stated in Li that:\nUltimately, the RPD is tasked with determining if adherence to Falun Gong is motivated solely by a desire to support a refugee claim, in which case it is open to the RPD to find that the claimant's religious beliefs are not genuine, or if the claimant has developed faith to a point where he or she has become a true adherent to that religion, even if, initially, the adherence to that religion might have been motivated to support a refugee claim.\n[...] Findings that the claimant lacks credibility, that he or she has fabricated stories about practising the claimed religion in the country of origin and that his or her knowledge of the details of the claimed religion is lacking, have been held by this Court to reasonably support a conclusion that the sincerity of the claimant's religious beliefs is not genuine.29\n[50] Based on the serious discrepancies and omissions with regard to the Principal Claimant's alleged Falun Gong practice in Canada, the Panel finds that she has not become a genuine practitioner in Canada as alleged.\n[51] Indeed, when considering all of the evidence before it, including the Principal Claimant's testimony and documentary evidence within the larger context of its credibility findings, the Panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the Principal Claimant participated in Falun Gong activities in Canada for the purpose of bolstering her fraudulent refugee claim. On the basis of the totality of evidence before it, the Panel finds that the Principal Claimant is not a genuine Falun Gong practitioner; nor is there any credible evidence before the Panel suggesting that she would be perceived as such upon return to China.\nMinor Claimant\n[52] The Minor Claimant's claim in this instance is founded on the persecution she fears in China as a result of the Principal Claimant's identity as a Falun Gong practitioner. As the Panel has determined that the Principal Claimant did not practice Falun Gong in China, was not wanted by the PSB, and has not begun a genuine practice in Canada, the Panel also finds that the Minor Claimant is not at risk as alleged. Therefore, her refugee claim must also fail.\nCONCLUSION\n[53] The Panel finds that the Principal Claimant was not a credible or trustworthy witness. When considering the facts and evidence of this case in totality, the Panel finds that there is not a serious possibility of persecution for either Claimant, nor would they be subjected personally, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture, should they return to China. Accordingly, the Panel finds that the Claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection pursuant to IRPA. Consequently, these claims are rejected.\n[54] As the Panel has made serious negative findings regarding the Principal Claimant's credibility, allegations, and alleged Falun Gong practice, and there are no trustworthy documents before the Panel to corroborate the events she alleges having occurred, the Panel finds that there is no credible or trustworthy evidence upon which the Panel could have come to a favourable decision. Consequently, the Panel finds that these claims have no credible basis pursuant to ss. 107(2) of IRPA.\n(signed)\n\"Alison J. Kennedy\"\nAlison J.

The claimant states that he has a well-founded fear of persecution pursuant to section 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the \"Act\").1\n[2] The duty of the Panel is to determine if there is sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to determine that there is a \"serious possibility\"2 that the claimant would be persecuted, or that there are substantial grounds to believe that he would be tortured, or at risk of losing his life or being subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he returned to his home country. This also means that it must not be possible to get protection from this persecution or risk in his own country and, further, that there is no other place in his country where he could live safely.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The Claimants stated that he is a citizen of Somalia. He is a member of the XXXX tribe and XXXX sub-tribe. His tribe were in a dispute with the XXXX Tribe. The claimant states that the XXXX tribe is more powerful than his tribe. He states that in 2009, members of the XXXX Tribe killed his father and took his camels. The members of the XXXX tribe then returned to the claimant's home and threatened to kill his family. The claimant states that he and his mother were tortured. The claimant further stated that his home town is now in control of Al-Shabab.\n[4] The claimant decided to leave Somalia. His family sold some livestock in order to pay for his travel to South Africa. The claimant remained in South Africa for approximately three years. He then decided to leave South Africa as refugees were being targeted by locals. He paid an agent to bring him to South America. He traveled to numerous countries and eventually entered the United States where he made an asylum claim. The United States government rejected his refugee claim. The claimant was eventually released from custody. After his release from custody, he made his way to Canada where he filed a refugee claim. The claimant believes that he will be harmed or killed by members of the XXXX clan or Al Shabab if he returns to Somalia.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] The Panel has reviewed all the documentary evidence including the claimant's disclosure,3 the National Documentation Package on Somalia, 4the claimant's BOC5 as well as the claimant's testimony, the testimony of his cousin XXXX XXXX as well as the testimony of his mother. The Panel also received written submissions from his Counsel on March 21, 2016.\n[6] The Panel finds that the claimant has not satisfied the burden of establishing that there is a \"serious possibility\" that he would be persecuted, or that there are substantial grounds to believe that he would be tortured, or at risk of losing his life or being subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he returned to Somalia.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[7] The panel finds that the determinative issue in this claim is identity. The claimant testified at the hearing that he has never had any government issued identity documents from\nSomalia. This is consistent with the objective documents on Somalia which outline the fact that there has been no real central authority in Somalia for the last 25 years and as such, it is impossible for Somalis to obtain documents.\n[8] The Panel must therefore assess the claimant's credibility as part of the assessment of his identity. It is trite law that sworn testimony is presumed to be true unless there is evidence to rebut the presumption of truthfulness.6 The Panel finds that the presumption of the claimant's truthful testimony has been rebutted in this case.\n[9] The claimant was asked at the hearing if he had ever presented any Somali documents to anyone. The claimant stated that he had not. The Panel then showed the claimant a birth certificate7 issued by the Municipality of XXXX. The claimant was asked to explain the discrepancy between his testimony and the existence of this document. The claimant stated that he apologized for the mistake.\n[10] The claimant was asked how he came into possession of the fraudulent birth certificate. The claimant stated that the woman he stayed with in Venezuela produced the false document. She told the claimant he may need it to travel the United States. The claimant further stated that he lost the document on his way to the United States. The claimant testified that he entered the United States without any identity documents.\n[11] The claimant was asked how he got a copy of the birth certificate in the United States. He stated that the woman in Venezuela gave him two copies of the birth certificate and the claimant sent one copy back to South Africa to his friend XXXX for safe-keeping. The claimant was asked how he received the document in the United States. The claimant testified that his cousin XXXX got the document for him. He was then asked if he instructed his cousin to obtain the document and he stated that he did not. The claimant stated that his cousin XXXX told him that she would find a document for him. The claimant further stated that his cousin did not\ngive him the details on how she obtained the document only that she was going to get it as she heard in the community that such a document could be helpful.\n[12] The claimant was asked how it was possible that his cousin XXXX was able to obtain the birth certificate from his friend in South Africa without the claimant instructing her. The claimant stated that he did not have the details. XXXX testified at the hearing and was questioned about the birth certificate. She testified that she was asked by the claimant to obtain the document from the claimant's friend in South Africa. She further stated that she acted as the middle person. The Panel prefers the explanation of XXXX over the explanation of the claimant. In order for the Panel to believe the claimant's version, the Panel would have to accept that XXXX obtained the birth certificate at her own behest. Once she decided to this, she just happened to contact the one person in South Africa who had the birth certificate. The Panel simply finds this to be impossible. The Panel finds that the claimant improvised his testimony to conceal that he was in possession of an identity when he initially stated that he was not and that he wanted to conceal the fact that he asked his cousin to reach to his friend in South Africa to obtain a document that he knew to be fraudulent.\n[13] The claimant was asked if he used the document in the United States and he stated that he did not. The Panel does not find the claimant to be credible on this point. The Claimant's cousin XXXX told the Panel that she obtained the document from the claimant's friend in South Africa and that she sent it to the claimant when he was still being held by U.S. officials. The Panel finds that the claimant likely asked his cousin to retrieve the document in order to assist him to secure his release from custody. The claimant was released shortly thereafter. The U.S. documents at Exhibit 1 suggest that the claimant presented some documentation that led to his release from custody. The Panel infers that the claimant uttered the birth certificate in order to secure his release from custody. Even if he did not submit the fraudulent birth certificate to U.S. officials, the claimant fabricated the story on how he obtained the document. This negatively impacts the claimant's overall credibility.\n[14] The claimant was questioned regarding the declaration by from his cousin's husband XXXX XXXX XXXX (\"XXXX\").8 In his affidavit, XXXX declared that the\nclaimant was a family friend and that he has known him since his birthday. Lower in the same declaration, he states that he and the claimant are close family friends and that he was present at the claimant's birthday in XXXX Somalia.\n[15] The claimant's cousin XXXX was asked whether her husband ever met the claimant. She stated that he had not. They had only spoken on the phone after the claimant's arrival in the United States. XXXX further testified that she met and married her husband in South Africa in 2007. The Panel finds that XXXX and the claimant never met in Somalia and that he never attended the claimant's home in Somalia for his birthday. Counsel for the claimant suggested that perhaps XXXX had been to home as a child but this is highly unlikely as he was from another part of Somalia. Moreover, the claimant's mother made no mention of XXXX being to her home. The Panel finds that the claimant obtained this declaration to assist him while he was in custody. It is logical for the Panel to conclude that XXXX provided a false declaration at the behest of the claimant. This declaration was submitted by the claimant for this hearing. The Panel finds that the production of a declaration\/affidavit from XXXX by the claimant knowing that it contained false information negatively impacts the claimant's overall credibility. The Panel therefore finds that the claimant was not a credible witness at the hearing.\n[16] Having found that the claimant was not a credible witness, the Panel must assess the other evidence presented by the claimant to establish his identity. As stated previously, the Panel finds that the claimant obtained the XXXX affidavit to assist while he was in custody. The Panel finds that the affidavit contained false information. The Panel gives this affidavit little weight for the reasons mentioned previously. The XXXX affidavit is insufficient to establish the claimant's identity on a balance of probabilities.\n[17] The Panel finds that the letter 9and testimony of XXXX are insufficient to establish the identity of the claimant on a balance of probabilities. The Panel as noted previously finds that the claimant improvised his testimony to explain on how XXXX obtained his birth certificate from\nSouth Africa. Moreover, XXXX could not corroborate the claimant's events in Somalia nor did she testify that she had seen the claimant in Somalia. XXXX letter and testimony are given little weight.\n[18] The letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX Minnesota is insufficient to establish the identity of the claimant on a balance of probabilities.10 The letter provided by the association is vague and provide no details as to how they were able to establish the identity of the claimant. This document is given little weight.\n[19] The declaration from the Manitoba XXXX XXXX is insufficient to establish the identity of the claimant on a balance of probabilities.11 The document is vague and provides no explanation on how they were able to establish the identity of the claimant. This document is given little weight.\n[20] The letter from the XXXX XXXXof South Africa (XXXX) is insufficient to establish the identity of the claimant on a balance of probabilities.12 The document does not explain how the association went about to ascertain the identity of the claimant. The Panel gives this document little weight.\n[21] The declaration of XXXX XXXX XXXX, Vice-President of the Manitoba XXXX XXXX is insufficient to establish the identity of the claimant on a balance of probabilities.13 The declaration is vague as it only states that a group of elders concluded that the claimant is Somali.\nThey did not provide any other details with respect to his identity or the type of inquiry that was conducted by them to establish the claimant's identity. The Panel gives this declaration little weight.\n[22] The declaration of XXXX XXXX is insufficient to establish the identity of the claimant on a balance of probabilities.14 The declarant states that he knew the mom of the claimant but he has no knowledge of the claimant. Moreover there were gaps in his declaration and he stated that he had no contact with the claimant prior to his coming to Canada. Moreover, in a note on the declaration it states that only after asking the claimant a series of questions did the declarant remember that he knew his mother. Finally, the declarant was in Canada but was not presented to testify at the hearing. The Panel gives this declaration little weight.\n[23] The declaration of XXXX XXXX XXXX15 is insufficient to establish the claimant's identity on a balance of probabilities. His affidavit was included with the affidavit of XXXX. He declares the same thing that XXXX has declared, specifically that he and the claimant were friends and that he was present for his birthday in XXXX. This information was shown to be false with respect to XXXX. The Panel finds that given the problems with XXXX affidavit, the declaration of XXXX is given very little weight.\n[24] The Panel finds that the claimant's mother's testimony is insufficient to establish the identity of the claimant on a balance of probabilities. The mother's testimony must be analyzed in the context of the claimant's credibility. The claimant's mother generally corroborated the claimant's story about his departure from Somalia. Given the other difficulty with the credibility of the claimant and the fabricated evidence presented by the claimant, the mother's recitation of what happened to the claimant independent of any other corroboration as the claimant's identity is not sufficient to establish the claimant's identity.\n[25]\nThe Panel finds that independently, the evidence presented by the claimant is insufficient to establish his identity on a balance of probabilities. The Panel has looked at the evidence presented by the claimant collectively and its totality and finds that cumulatively, the claimant has not presented sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to establish his identity on a balance of probabilities. The Panel finds that the claimant's failure to establish his identity on a balance of probabilities is determinative of the claim. The Panel therefore finds that the claim must be rejected under both Section 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n[26] The Panel further finds that there is no credible basis to the claim pursuant to Section 107(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. As identity is the cornerstone of refugee determination, the claimant's failure to establish his identity results in the Panel concluding that there is no credible or trustworthy evidence on which it could have made a favorable decision.\nCONCLUSION\n[27] The Panel therefore rejects the claim under Section 96 and Section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and concludes that XXXX XXXX XXXX is not a Convention refugee and therefore rejects his claim and the Panel further concludes that there is no credible basis to his claim.\n(signed)\n\"Daniel Tucci\"\nDaniel Tucci\nApril 28, 2016\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Adjei v.

The panel began questioning. In fact, Counsel found the questioning by the panel, exhaustive. However, the panel will point out there was considerable information to garner and the claimant was often offered breaks. Furthermore mid-way through the hearing, Counsel noted he did not have all of Exhibit 1. The panel went over the exhibit and obtained copies for Counsel. Time was given to Counsel and the claimant to review the missing information.\nDETERMINATION\n[3] The panel finds the claimant has not satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution for a Convention ground or that he would be personally subjected, on a balance of probabilities, to a danger of torture, or a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment upon return to Sri Lanka. Therefore, the panel finds the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] Details of the claimant's allegations can be found in his Basis of Claim2 (BOC) form. The claimant refers to a written narrative, the claimant states as a Tamil, young man from the north, he faces persecution. The claimant's cousin XXXX joined the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in 2000. People knew he was related to the claimant, and as such the claimant had problems with the army and the Eelam People's Democratic Party (EPDP), often checked and questioned, this continued after the war ended.\n[5] In XXXX 2011, the claimant worked selling XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He did this for three months. Several times on his way home he was stopped by the army and was accused of canvassing sympathy for the LTTE. The claimant stopped going XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX 2011, after two men approached him and accused him of canvassing for the LTTE for XXXX XXXX. The men told the claimant if they heard the claimant was continuing canvassing, his life would be in danger.\n[6] After this the claimant got a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX licence and began to drive in XXXX 2012. He took people between XXXX to XXXXUniversity. He was stopped by the army and questioned multiple times. He was asked about his connection to the University.\n[7] On XXXX XXXX, 2012, there was pandemonium in the University. The claimant was stopped by the army when he was leaving the University. He was taken to a local camp with many other drivers. He was questioned as to what students he had transported. He was beaten and his vehicle damaged. After three to four hours he was released and warned that he would be watched.\n[8] During this time, the claimant was being pressured to join the EPDP and told that the EPDP would help him get jobs within the government. When he refused he was accused of being a LTTE supporter.\n[9] On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2013, the claimant was arrested by the military police while in XXXX buying XXXX XXXX and XXXX. The claimant was picked up in their truck and taken to the XXXX army camp - he was tortured, refused food and water, and given water with alcohol in it. He was burned on his back, cheek and hand; he was not allowed to sit down. The claimant was told the authorities knew his cousin was a member of the LTTE. The claimant was asked why he refused to join the EPDP. The claimant was accused of being a LTTE sympathizer. The claimant was released on XXXX XXXX, 2013 after his father paid a bribe to some officers.\n[10] The claimant's father went to the police to complain but he was laughed at and the complaint dismissed.\n[11] After the claimant's release the military would visit neighbours and friends asking questions about the claimant. The claimant went to stay in XXXX and then to Colombo in a distant relative's home. The claimant left Sri Lanka on XXXX XXXX, 2013.\nANALYSIS\n[12] The determinative issue in this claim is credibility.\nIdentity\n[13] The claimant's identity as a national of Sri Lanka is established through testimony and the supporting documentation filed. 3\nCredibility\n[14] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are indeed true unless there is valid reason to doubt their veracity.4 The determination as to whether a claimant's evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities.5 The panel agrees the claimant was consistent however the panel does not find the claimant credible in certain areas of his testimony.\nTravel on Passport\n[15] The panel finds that the claimant purposefully downplayed his knowledge on how, who with and where he travelled when he left Sri Lanka. The panel finds the claimant not credible in how he was able to leave Sri Lanka and travel to the U.S.A.\n[16] The claimant testified to having a passport in his own name. The claimant testified that he obtained a passport from an agent - he provided a picture for his passport and his father provided all other necessary documents. The panel finds this not credible as the information clearly indicates that the passport has to be issued in person.6 The panel is aware that there are corrupt officials who are willing to aid smugglers, yet, the number of smugglers involved in the claimant's travel and the risk is not credible. Particularly, as the claimant confirmed that he utilized his passport, with his bio-data information and photograph, at the interviews with U.S.A. and Canadian authorities to travel out of Sri Lanka. When questioned by the panel, the claimant confirmed that it was his name in this passport and that he used this passport to travel out of Sri Lanka to a second unknown country and obtained entry using this passport. However, the panel finds it not credible that the claimant would obtain a passport in his own name to leave the country. The panel finds this not credible or plausible in light of the number of times the claimant alleges the authorities (the army) sought him from his release. Not just attending his family home but through friends and relatives. The panel notes that security screening at the ports of entry, particularly the airport is stringent. The panel grants that there may be the ability to bribe security staff at the airport, however the panel finds it highly implausible, on a balance of probabilities, that those being sought by the security forces would easily be able to traverse and exit the country, particularly as the claimant alleges he was assaulted for having suspected sympathies for the LTTE.\nAirport Controls: Traveller entry and exit controls for [BIA] are the responsibility of the Sri Lankan Department of Immigration and Emigration. All persons seeking to enter or depart the country are legislatively directed to present themselves at a designated port of entry. These controls take the form of passport examination, short oral interviews and the use of caches [secure entry\/exit stamps on passports (Canada 19 Jan. 2010)].7\nIn addition, travellers may be subject to an examination by Sri Lanka Customs. Sri Lanka Customs' main functions center on revenue collection and enforcing customs law and other related rules and regulations. In broad terms it is tasked with the collection of taxes, duties and other levies as imposed by the government; to ensure proper enforcement of tariff, trade and social protection policies of the state; and to ensure flow of passenger, goods and related means of transport.8\nThe Sri Lankan National Police Criminal Investigations Unit (CID) is responsible for investigating cases and laying potential charges under the Sri Lankan Criminal Code and Immigration Act at the airport. The CID may investigate cases of document malfeasance, human smuggling and trafficking, and conduct criminal background checks of returned Sri Lankan nationals in order to check for any outstanding domestic criminal...warrants.9\n[17] There is no doubt there is corruption but if one is to improperly obtain a passport as the claimant has alleged, why utilize his own identity documents, his own bio-data, possibly endangering not only the claimant but the agent and the issuing officer if caught. Why risk this when the smuggler appeared to have the means to get a passport issued to someone being sought by the military. The panel makes a negative inference on the claimant's ability to obtain and travel on passport issued in his own name.\nAgents\n[18] Even if the panel were to accept that the claimant could escape under his own identity, the fact that the claimant was given no instructions by the agents on what would happen at the airport upon departure or possible questions that could be posed is not credible. The claimant testified that he never travelled prior to this trip. This was the first time he had left Sri Lanka. The claimant testified to there being two agents - one that got him the passport and another who travelled with him to the U.S.A. The claimant was asked the instructions he was given in leaving Colombo airport and travelling with the agent to the U.S.A. He testified that he was told to follow the agent. There was no further instruction. The panel finds it not credible that the claimant was not being given any instructions other than follow the agent, in light of the documentary evidence that indicates all departing persons via the Colombo airport are interviewed by security officials at time of departure.10 Counsel's documents support that Criminal Investigative Department (CID) has a 24 hour operation in Colombo airport11. This has existed from 201212, thus the lack of information the claimant attests to having been given is not credible.\n[19] The panel finds that as a first time traveller who had no knowledge of travel would not provide some basic instructions even with the expectation of a bribe being offered to a corrupt official. Furthermore, the claimant travelled to a second country and not to be given any information on what may happen at customs or entry is not credible. The panel does not find it credible that the agent would not have provided any instruction or guidance to the claimant considering the number of possible control points that he would have had to traverse. The panel makes a negative inference.\n[20] The claimant testified that he held his passport and used this passport to enter the second country. This passport contained is bio-data information and photograph. The panel acknowledges that smugglers may have connections with specific customs officials at the point of exit to evade security at airports. Yet, in Sri Lanka there is no perfect plan - the lack of instruction or information given, the fact the claimant was able to exit Sri Lanka and travel on his own passport given the alleged interest by the authorities had in the claimant, their efforts to seek him not only at home but at friends', and the ability to identify him when he departed Sri Lanka in light that he travelled on his own information is not credible. The panel makes a negative inference.\nTravel to the U.S.A.\n[21] The claimant no longer has this passport, having given it to the agent sometime prior to travelling to the U.S.A. He may have given it to the agent when he was flying into the second country. He testified to this but when it was pointed out that he had told the official he had used the passport to enter the unknown second country, he testified he was unsure if the agent took the passport in the flight or after he was in Senegal13, before he came to the U.S.A. He changed his testimony to state he was on the plane when the agent gave him the false passport but he did not open it or look at it. The panel does not find this credible in light of the security concerns the Americans have about people boarding planes to their country. It would be unlikely the claimant had obtained a visa in his own name to the U.S.A. as this would have been reflected in the biometrics report, since the U.S.A. takes fingerprints of some persons seeking to enter, particularly those who require visa, as do Sri Lankans. There are also interviews conducted to obtain said visa, thus, it is highly unlikely that the claimant had obtained a visa in his own name. Therefore, the panel finds the mid-flight exchange of passport is neither probable nor credible. The passport must have been exchanged prior to his boarding the flight to the U.S.A. The panel makes a negative inference.\n[22] Furthermore, the claimant was asked about bio-data information in the false passport. The claimant testified that he did not look in the passport; he just held it in his hand as he did not want to draw attention to himself. The panel does not find it credible that the claimant would not look to see what the passport looked like; the claimant travelled a long way and had ample time to look at the passport. As noted-above, he would have had the passport to board the plane to the U.S.A. He was expecting to enter the U.S.A. without looking what name was in the passport to confirm his personal information. The panel finds claimant's allegation not credible.\nClaim in the U.S.A.\n[23] The claimant testified it was his intention to make a claim in the U.S.A. and he did. The claimant had a credible fear interview and was asked a series of questions.14 The panel notes that there was a Tamil interpreter utilized for the questioning. The claimant told the officer that he took exams in 2011 but failed to qualify for higher studies, his father purchased a XXXX XXXX XXXX which he used to take people from one place to another and that he applied for vacancies but he never got the job.15\n[24] The panel notes that the claimant omitted any mention of his cousin being a member of the LTTE. In his Basis of Claim (BOC) form16 he indicated that this was one of the reasons he believed he was detained in XXXX 2013, in that the authorities knew his cousin was a member, that the claimant was involved in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, he was driving with university students and he refused to join the EPDP. When the panel pointed out to him that the information about his cousin was omitted the claimant testified that he was not asked any questions and just gave his information. The panel doesn't find this credible as the follow up question to the claimant had been \"Do you think they knew who you were? Why do you think they stopped you?\" The response from the claimant was \"I really don't know....but I know they arrested me because I am Tamil.\"\n[25] When this was pointed out to the claimant, he testified he was tense and that reason never struck him. The panel accepts that the claimant was nervous, and noted that the interview was not the same date as when he arrived in the U.S.A., it was held in XXXX and the claimant arrived XXXX XXXX 2013. Yet, this is important as this is one of the alleged reasons the authorities detained and tortured him for information about his cousin; this is why he was targeted all along, particularly when he was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which the panel notes he also omitted from his claim in the U.S.A. The panel does not find it credible that he would omit this important detail of his cousin, particularly when his sole intention was to remain in the U.S.A. and seek asylum, to which he testified that it was always his intention. The panel makes a negative inference.\n[26] The panel has considered the claimant's documents that indicate his cousin XXXX who was a member of the LTTE.17 This why the army always harassed the claimant particularly after he worked for XXXX, however he omitted this mention and it was only in Canada that he identified this was a problem as the army and EPDP were always checking on him. The panel does not find it credible he would not mention the cousin in Canada and not in the U.S.A. where it was always his intention to remain. The panel does not find the claimant had a cousin that was a member of the LTTE, in light of his omissions to the U.S.A. authorities. The panel finds this was embellished to make his claim more credible in Canada.\n[27] The claimant had proceeded to Canada, effectively abandoning his U.S. asylum claim. As the U.S. is a well-known refugee-granting country, the panel finds it troubling that in his case, he abandoned the opportunity for asylum in the U.S. The claimant testified that he came to Canada as he had an aunt here, and did not understand the language in the U.S.A., including having language difficulties with the man he identified as his uncle but was a friend of the family. The panel pointed out to the claimant he had an aunt he identified as living in the U.S.A. also.18 The claimant had testified to travelling specifically to the U.S.A. to make a claim. The panel finds that the claimant had no guarantees that his claim would be approved in Canada. The panel finds the abandoning of the claim does speak to a lack of subjective fear.\nXXXX XXXX XXXX\n[28] The claimant testified that he had problems when he started to work for XXXX XXXX; he started with XXXX in XXXX 2011. He took an exam but had to wait for results the manager took him into her his group, to canvass XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He began canvassing XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX to XXXX 2011 in known areas, to friends and family in various villages. He was harassed by the army during this time due to his canvassing, stopped and questioned. He was warned not to canvass as it was believed he was working for the LTTE.\n[29] In XXXX 2011, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, he was stopped by two men on a motorcycle wearing helmets who warned him against continuing canvassing. If he continued it would endanger his life. The claimant stopped. The claimant first testified it was one individual and when the panel pointed out to him that it was two agreed that it was two. The claimant testified his father made him quit the job. This canvassing is what caused him future problems, as the army kept referring to it when they detained in both in XXXX 2012 and XXXX 2013.\n[30] In support of his statement that he worked for XXXX XXXX, the claimant provided an identity card.19 The claimant was asked why if he began to work in XXXX 2011 the card was issued in XXXX. He testified that he had to take a test and was waiting for the results. The panel pointed out to the claimant that the card read \"XXXX XXXX XXXX-3011\" and when asked about this discrepancy, the claimant testified he had noticed this but couldn't start as the problems had started. This is not credible. The claimant had already been canvassing from XXXX 2011 and quit in XXXX, to have a card issued the last day of the month, with the year error when the card was supposed to be an identity card to prove that he worked for the company is not credible.\n[31] This job and his cousin was the reason why the claimant came to the attention of the authorities. It led to him quitting and getting a vehicle that operated as XXXX XXXX, which caused him to transport students to the university and caused him to be detained during XXXX XXXX celebrations by the military in XXXX 2012 and again in XXXX 2013. These were the core reasons he was sought, though he also testified to his being approached to join the EPDP and his refusal caused further problems. However, this also arose from his leaving the XXXX XXXX and his cousin. The panel does not find that the claimant was working for XXXX XXXX, the claimant does not find the claimant has a cousin that was a member of the LTTE thus all else falls due to these findings.\nBurns\n[32] Counsel pointed out there was considerable time spent questioning the claimant by the panel in light of his testimony that he suffered cigarette burns on his cheeks, hands, and shoulders while in custody in XXXX 2013. The claimant testified that a lit cigarette was held against his skin. After his release, he got an ointment that he put on the wounds and they healed. The claimant was asked if he had any scars, he testified there were no scars, particularly on his cheeks where he testified he suffered cigarette burns. The panel asked the claimant if he smoked and he testified he did not. The panel noted to the claimant that lit cigarettes burn hot, extremely hot even a just lit cigarette and if pressed against one's skin it would cause a burn. The claimant testified that he was given ointment and the burns went away. Counsel asked him questions if the cigarette was pressed against his skin or held by his skin. The claimant testified the cigarette touched his skin and he pulled away. When Counsel repeated the question on what was done with the cigarette, the claimant testified that the wounds blistered and became a wound. Counsel asked was the cigarette put out against his skin, the claimant testified the cigarette touched his skin and he pulled away. Counsel asked if he was allowed to pull away and the claimant testified yes and after they burned his hands.\n[33] The claimant asked if he had any medical certificate in support that he had these burns. The claimant said he may have but not at the hearing, when asked why he testified that he did not think he would need them. This claim is an older claim, the original referral was in 2013, and the claimant had ample time to get the information. The panel notes that up and till the day of the hearing documents were received from the claimant, the last being a statement from his father20 accepted by the panel the day of the hearing. The claimant has always identified he was tortured by the army in light that he had this evidence or could be reasonably expected to obtain it and did not, is not credible.\n[34] The panel notes the claimant provided a driver's licence to prove he could drive. He provided a statement from a local justice of peace and a letter from a sports club but not to seek any information about his burns or injuries is not credible. The panel has considered Counsel's submissions that the burns may be superficial, \"all young boys\" know of the game and the claimant was consistent with this information about his torture being not being able to sit, physical abuse, water with alcohol but consistency is not alone sufficient to find this occurred. The claimant said he was burnt with a cigarette and tortured from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX, 2013. The claimant testified that the burns occurred over a four to five day period, two to three times. These do not appear to be superficial incidents but torture as he alleged. The panel finds that the claimant may or may not have scars but even when he was released he was not kept in hospital, just taken to a local clinic and given ointment.\n[35] The panel is not a doctor nor does she have sufficient knowledge of the torture techniques to state unequivocally that someone would have visible scars if one is burnt by a lit cigarette, particularly on his cheek(s). However, in light of his testimony that he was tortured, he testified he had no other injuries as a result of his torture, only burns for which he obtained ointment. Not to produce any documents to support these statements is not credible. Furthermore, the claimant's documents indicate that there is visible scarring from cigarette burns of individuals who experienced burns similar the claimant's.21 Though, this is not a discrepancy or credibility concerns, the panel speaks about it as Counsel had indicated we spent a significant period discussing this issue and the panel wishes to express her concern with the lack of documentary evidence of the torture as the claimant alleged.\nLetters\n[36] The panel has considered the statement from the claimant's father, the father's own evidence conflicts with what occurred in Sri Lanka. The father filed a police report that stated his son XXXX was taken by four men dressed in civil clothes when they came looking for his other son XXXX in XXXX XXXX 2014. The report was filed on XXXX XXXX, 2014, stating that his son XXXX had been missing for 24 hours. 22 The claimant testified that his brother was taken and released the next evening. However, his father wrote that his son was released after four to five hours. The panel did not put this to the claimant as he would have no idea why the father's information conflicts with the police report and the claimant's understanding of what occurred. The panel grants little weight to this letter as it was just issued in XXXX 2016 and contained errors.\n[37] The letter from the Justice of the Peace, XXXX XXXX XXXX, on the plain reading of the letter, it is apparent that the letter was sought by the claimant's father. The panel finds it offers little details on how the signatory came to know the information he recounts and is vague, as he speaks about the claimant collecting money for some organization which was the information recounted by the claimant and is used to support the claimant obtaining protection in Canada. The panel will accept letter as proof of identity but not for any other purpose in light of these issues.\n[38] The panel accepts the letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX as evidence of the claimant's identity but for no other purpose as it just recounts his involvement in the club.23\nResidual Profile\n[39] The panel finds the claimant not credible in what led to his having to flee Sri Lanka. The panel does not find the claimant left the country illegally as he left on his passport, the panel does not find the claimant had ties to the LTTE however, the panel turns her mind to whether the claimant's profile of being a young, male, Tamil from the North. The question is would this profile subject him to persecution or put him at risk of harm, risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or risk of torture if he were to return to Sri Lanka. The panel finds the claimant does not have a well-founded fear of the Sri Lankan government simply for having the profile of a Tamil from the North of Sri Lanka who would be returning to Sri Lanka as a failed refugee claimant.\n[40] The panel has considered the multiple articles24 and notes that most are not on point as it relates to this particular claimant.25 The panel has considered the documents that state some of the Diaspora who returned to Sri Lanka post-war had problems upon return. Some were questioned and held, some were questioned and released, and other returnees were questioned, released and observed by security forces.26 Counsel refers to the ARC articles he provided.27 Counsel submits that this is reputable source of information, which the panel does not disagree with, but this information is somewhat confusing as the document clearly indicates \"This document is intended to be used as a tool to help identify relevant COI and the COI referred to in this report can be considered by decision makers in assessing asylum applications and appeals. However, this document should not be submitted in full or in isolation as evidence to refugee decision making authorities.\"28 These documents indicate that there are returnees that have been detained, torture, disappeared upon return to Sri Lanka. These documents also indicate that the returnees have links, some strong links, to the LTTE. Some individuals have not left legally leaving by boat and not the airport. This is not the situation of the claimant. The claimant had indicated during his testimony that his passport had been stamped upon departure. Further in the document it identifies that the Sri Lankan government have agents working in foreign countries, including Canada, that monitor those who support the LTTE, again this is not the case of the claimant.\n[41] The panel finds the documentary evidence regarding Sri Lanka paints a contradictory picture of the situation in the country as to who is at risk and why. The panel prefers the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) documents29 because it is internationally recognized and supported by the United Nations, a body that is charged with the protection of international human rights. This document states,\nUNHCR considers that individuals with these profiles - though this list is not exhaustive - may be, and in some cases are likely to be in need of international refugee protection, depending on the individual circumstances of their case.\n(i) persons suspected of certain links with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE);\n(ii) certain opposition politicians and political activists;\n(iii) certain journalists and other media professionals;\n(iv) certain human rights activists;\n(v) certain witnesses of human rights violations and victims of human rights violations seeking justice;\n(vi) women in certain circumstances;\n(vii) children in certain circumstances; and\n(viii) Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) individuals in certain circumstances.\n[42] The panel notes that the document also identifies a specific category of LTTE involvement or those who have certain links to the LTTE, a profile the claimant alleges he has been accused of having. This risk profile has been described by the UNCHR subcategory,\nThe nature of these more elaborate links to the LTTE can vary, but may include people with the following profiles:\nPersons who held senior positions with considerable authority in the LTTE civilian\nAdministration, when the LTTE was in control of large parts of what are now the northern and eastern provinces of Sri Lanka;\n2) Former LTTE combattants or \"cadres\";\n3) Former LTTE combatants or \"cadres\" who, due to injury or other reason, were employed by the LTTE in functions within the administration, intelligence, \"computer branch\" or media (newspaper and radio);\n4) Former LTTE supporters who may never have undergone military training, but were involved in sheltering or transporting LTTE personnel, or the supply and transport of goods for the LTTE;\n5) LTTE fundraisers and propaganda activists and those with, or perceived as having had, links to the Sri Lankan diaspora that provided funding and other support to the LTTE;\n6) Persons with family links or who are dependent on or otherwise closely related to persons with the above profiles.30\n[43] The claimant however has not demonstrated a reasonable chance of his persecution in respect of sub-profile #6 or on the basis of some other profile unique to himself on the evidence that he has presented. As the panel mentioned above, the claimant made no mention of a relative that was a LTTE member and that is why he is being sought to the Americans. The totality of the UNHCR eligibility guidelines suggests a profile of being a young Sri Lankan Tamil male from areas formerly controlled by the LTTE is insufficient. The Guidelines suggest what is needed are\n\"[...] previous (real or perceived) links that go beyond prior residency within an area controlled by the LTTE [which] continue to expose individuals to treatment which may give rise to a need for international refugee protection, depending on the specifics of the individual case.\"31\n[44] Furthermore, given the credibility findings noted-above, the fact that the claimant himself in his oral testimony denied any previous association with the LTTE, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant had no association with the LTTE. The panel finds that the claimant has not provided any persuasive evidence that he would be perceived to be a supporter of the LTTE or any other political group. The panel also finds it reasonable to expect that, if Sri Lankan authorities believed that the claimant was one of the persons identified in the aforementioned \"risk profiles,\" he would not have been able to pass through security checkpoints when he boarded the plane out of Sri Lanka.\n[45] The panel has considered the country conditions disclosure made by the claimant on the matter of returning asylum seekers.32 The panel gives preference to the UNHCR guidelines again for the comprehensive, methodology, and the mandate of the UNHCR. The Guidelines discuss ongoing repatriation and the matter of returnees to Sri Lanka whose asylum claims have been rejected.\n[46] For these reasons, the panel does not find the claimant's profile in regards to being a failed asylum seeker returning to Sri Lanka would subject him to a risk of persecution upon his return to Sri Lanka. The panel finds that the claimant has not satisfied his burden of establishing a serious possibility that he would be persecuted or that he would be personally subjected to risk of life or a risk of cruel and unusual punishment or danger of torture by any authority in the Sri Lanka.\nCONCLUSION\n[47] Based on the foregoing analysis, the panel finds that the claimant is not a Convention refugee pursuant to section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, nor a person in need of protection pursuant to section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Accordingly, the panel rejects his claim.\n(signed)\n\"B. Lloyd\"\nB.

They are nationals of Croatia. They are siblings and they are both minors. XXXX XXXX was appointed as a designated representative for the Claimants.\nBACKGROUND\n[2] The Claimants' father is XXXX XXXX (Mr. XXXX) and their mother is XXXX XXXX (Mrs. XXXX). Mr. XXXX arrived in Canada in July 2010.1 The Claimants and Mrs. XXXX followed in September 2010. Mr. XXXX extended his status by six months and he therefore ran out of status in XXXX 2011. No application was made to extend the Claimants' status so they ran out of status in XXXX 2011.\n[3] In XXXX 2015 Mr. XXXX came to the attention of the Canada Border Services Agency and he was arrested. He made a refugee claim but was ultimately found ineligible after being issued a deportation order for serious criminality. Mrs. XXXX attempted to make a claim, but did not do so until after she had been issued an exclusion order for overstaying her status, which barred her from making a claim. The Claimants were deemed eligible and their claims were referred to this Division on November 12, 2015.\nALLEGATIONS\n[4] Each of the Claimants provided a Basis of Claim Form (BOC) containing a narrative written by, and from the point of view of, Mr. XXXX. It would appear that he wrote it before being found ineligible, as it is written to explain the reasons he himself needs protection. The allegations are summarized as follows, along with some clarifying information that came up during the hearing.\n[5] In XXXX 2009, Mr. XXXX was in a car with some new business acquaintances. They were stopped by the police who discovered three kilograms of marijuana in the car. Mr. XXXX did not know about the marijuana, and the owner of the car admitted that it was his. However, Mr. XXXX was nonetheless arrested and charged. Through what he feels was an unfair trial by a biased judge, Mr. XXXX was convicted and sentenced to six years imprisonment. He was released in XXXX 2009 pending an appeal and he came to Canada in July 2010. While in prison he acted as an informant and gave the police information about a cellmate named XXXX XXXX who is a high-ranking organized criminal. XXXX was released from prison in 2011 or 2012, and in late 2012 some people came looking for Mr. XXXX at his parents' home. They told his parents that they would kill Mr. XXXX. These men came and made similar threats to Mr. XXXX parents in the summer of 2015.\n[6] The appeal was decided in 2014, and though the conviction was upheld, the sentence was reduced to two years. A warrant was issued for Mr. XXXX arrest so that he may serve his sentence, and this warrant has been outstanding ever since.\n[7] Mr. XXXX sold his business for 570,000 Euros. He alleges that he entered Canada intending to stay one month, and to then go to California and perhaps start a business there. However, he alleges that circumstances forced him to stay longer. He alleges that he made a business loan of 150,000 Euros to XXXX XXXX and did not get his money back. He made one application to extend his status, and though he did not produce the document as evidence, he testified that his status was extended by six months. He testified that he made a subsequent application to extend his stay, which was rejected.\n[8] In 2012, Mr. XXXX loaned 250,000 Euros to XXXX business partner XXXX XXXX. Some monthly payments were made on the loan but they ceased in the summer of 2015.\n[9] In XXXX 2013, Mr. XXXX introduced XXXX XXXX to two Croatian investors, namely XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. These men loaned 100,000 Euros to XXXX XXXX. XXXX never paid the money back. In late 2013 two people visited Mr. XXXX parents' home in Croatia and told them that Mr. XXXX owes them money. Mr. XXXX believes that XXXX and XXXX hold him responsible for the 100,000 Euros because he brokered the loan. He believes that the visit to his parents' home was an attempt to collect this money from him.\n[10] As noted above, Mr. XXXX made a refugee claim after he was arrested by the CBSA in XXXX 2015. Claims were made on the Claimants' behalf shortly thereafter.\nANALYSIS\nChairperson's Guideline 3\n[11] During these proceedings, the Panel has applied Chairperson Guideline 3: Child Refugee Claimants: Procedural and Evidentiary Issues (Guideline 3.) In written submissions, counsel argued that, being children, the best interests of the Claimants must be considered by the Panel. One must be careful to observe what Guideline 3 says, and what it does not say. Guideline 3 governs procedural issues exclusively. It governs the prompt identification, scheduling, and processing of claims made by minors. It governs the sensitive issue of questioning minors, and the weighing of oral evidence given by a minor. Guideline 3 does not say that this Division should accept or reject claims based on the best interests of children. As Guideline 3 notes, \"[w]ith respect to the merits of the child's claim, all of the elements of the Convention refugee definition must be satisfied.\" Mr. Justice Shore ruled as follows in Kim:2\nAt the stage of a section 96 application, it is sufficient that the best interests of the child are taken into account procedurally, as directed by the Guidelines. The Court must reiterate that the best interests of the child cannot shoehorn a refugee claimant into the section 96 definition if the child's claim would otherwise be rejected, but it can influence the process which leads to that decision. [Emphasis in original.]\n[12] In the present case, the Claimants were represented by counsel and by an independent designated representative. At counsel's request, to avoid exposing them to trauma, they were not present in the hearing room. The exception was when XXXX briefly gave evidence about his father's English language abilities, which will be detailed below.\n[13] In respect of process, procedure, and hearing room conduct, this Division and the Panel conducted the hearing of these claims in a manner consistent with the best interests of the Claimants.\nThe Evidence of Mr. XXXX\n[14] In advance of the hearing, counsel notified this Division that she intends to call Mr. XXXX as a witness.3 This makes perfect sense, since Mr. XXXX wrote the Claimants' BOCs and all of the allegations come from him, and not from the Claimants per se. Counsel wrote in her letter that the Claimants \"do not know the risks they face in Croatia and cannot testify fully to such.\" At the outset of the hearing, counsel stated that she may question the older of the Claimants, namely XXXX who is 15. However, she stated that neither Claimant knows anything about the allegations other than what they have heard from Mr. XXXX.\nDelay in Claiming - Failure to Apply for Extensions\n[15] For the reasons the follow, the Panel finds that there is a significant delay in claiming and that it detracts from the credibility of Mr. XXXX allegations. As noted above, Mr. XXXX did not make a refugee claim on behalf of the Claimants until he was arrested by the CBSA. At that time, he had been out of status for about 52 months and the Claimants had been out of status for 56 months.\n[16] Mr. XXXX second extension application was refused in approximately July 2011 and after this point he was without status. The Panel asked Mr. XXXX if, at the time his status lapsed, he knew that he could be sent back to Croatia if he were caught by immigration authorities. He testified that he was aware of this. The Panel asked him if he considered returning to Croatia and then re-entering Canada to obtain more status. He testified that he was scared to return to Croatia at the time. He testified that he was afraid of the police, given that he had been wrongfully convicted of a crime, and he was also afraid of XXXX XXXX men. However, when asked to testify about his mindset at the time his status lapsed, he testified that he was afraid of only the police at that time.\n[17] The Panel asked Mr. XXXX if, after his status lapsed, he tried to find out about other ways to stay in Canada. He testified that he went to hundreds of lawyers and told them about his fear, but that, figuratively speaking, the door was always closed. The Panel asked him how many lawyers he visited and he revised his evidence to \"maybe\" 15 lawyers. He testified that they all told him that, because of his conviction, he might not have a chance in a refugee claim. Counsel asked Mr. XXXX if he recalls the names of any of the lawyers, and he gave the names XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. He testified that they each asked for $300,000 to represent him and they each asked for half of the money up front.\n[18] The Panel asked Mr. XXXX if he ever applied to extend the Claimants' status and he testified that he never did. The Panel asked him why, and he testified that he does not know why. At the second sitting of the hearing, the Panel asked Mr. XXXX at what point he became afraid for his children's safety in Croatia. He testified that \"from day one\" he knew that his children could never return to Croatia. The Panel asked him why he did not apply to extend their status, given this risk. He testified that he did not know what to do at the time, and he did not know one word of English.\n[19] Counsel asked Mr. XXXX why he did not make refugee claims for the children earlier. He testified that he knew nothing about refugees or about immigration. He testified that he went to many lawyers to see what could be done to protect his children.\n[20] In the Panel's view there is simply no way to reconcile Mr. XXXX actions with the danger that he says the Claimants have faced \"from day one\" in Croatia. He alleges that the Claimants have faced a danger from the very beginning, yet he did not even take the simple step of applying to extend their status, even though he had successfully applied to extend his own status. His explanation at the first sitting was that he does not know why he did not apply for them. At the second sitting his explanation was that he did not know what to do, and spoke no English. These latter explanations are clearly misleading, given that Mr. XXXX had the wherewithal to submit a successful application to extend his own status.\n[21] The Panel also rejects Mr. XXXX evidence regarding approaching lawyers. His testimony bears hallmarks of exaggeration, where he testified that he visited hundreds of lawyers before reducing this to \"maybe\" fifteen. He could then give only two names. The amount they all requested to represent him, namely $300,000 with $150,000 upfront, strains credulity. A lawyer may indeed advise a man such as Mr. XXXX that he could be found ineligible because of his conviction, but this would not affect the children. As is now obvious, his children can make claims independent of him, and there are other avenues a lawyer would know about, such as a humanitarian and compassionate application. Yet, Mr. XXXX took no action to regularize the Claimants' status at a time when he says they were at risk, and at a time when he knew they could be returned to Croatia if caught without status.\n[22] Counsel made extensive written submissions regarding the relevance of Mr. XXXX testimony and whether his credibility may negatively impact the Claimants. Counsel cited Nour4 and acknowledged that the Panel may draw inferences from the credibility of witnesses who testify on behalf of minor applicants. However, she argued that it would be unreasonable to draw an adverse credibility inference based on Mr. XXXX testimony. She argued that the Claimants' claims should \"be assessed completely separately from their father who is not a claimant in the current case.\" She argued that the Claimants had no knowledge of about their status and should therefore not be \"punished\" for the delay in claiming. Counsel acknowledged that \"some case law suggests that delay of a principal claimant that is of age can be assessed with respect to the minor applicants who have claimed with them.\" However, she argued, this is not such a case because Mr. XXXX is not a claimant in these proceedings.\n[23] In Richards,5 Mr. Justice Near dealt with a situation similar to the present case. Richards concerned three minor claimants whose mother had been found ineligible and was therefore not a claimant in the proceedings. The mother gave evidence and the RPD drew a negative inference from, inter alia, her delay in making the claims on behalf of the three minors. The Court concluded that this was entirely reasonable. Counsel referred to no jurisprudence to show that the present case is distinguishable or that a different conclusion should be reached.\n[24] In the Panel's view, these claims hinge entirely on the credibility of Mr. XXXX, and the fact that he is a witness and not a claimant per se changes nothing. The Claimants rely entirely on Mr. XXXX allegations. Mr. XXXX is the only person with direct knowledge of the events that the Claimants rely on. Mr. XXXX is the person who decided that the Claimants would make refugee claims when they did. Further, the Panel respectfully disagrees with counsel's framing of the delay issue. Negative inferences, such as from delay in claiming, are never about \"punishing\" a claimant. The Panel must do what is necessary to find out whether the Claimants and their designated representative have established their allegations on a balance of probabilities with credible or trustworthy evidence. The mere fact that Mr. XXXX is not a claimant in these proceedings does not mean that his credibility, and therefore the credibility of the Claimants' allegations as he wrote them, are immune from proper examination.\n[25] For the foregoing reasons, the Panel rejects Mr. XXXX explanations for failing to make any attempt to extend or regularize the Claimants' status. The Panel finds that his actions contradict the risk he alleges for the Claimants, and the Panel therefore draws a negative inference.\nDelay in Claiming - Explanation not Credible\n[26] Mr. XXXX gave evidence of business activities that, according to him, account for his remaining in Canada after his status lapsed. For the reasons that follow, the Panel does not believe this evidence.\n[27] Counsel filed an affidavit that Mr. XXXX wrote for the purposes of the Claimants' hearing.6 At commencement of the first sitting, Mr. XXXX stated that he is fluent in English and that he does not need an interpreter.\n[28] Mr. XXXX testified that when he arrived in Canada, his plan was to stay one or two months, but he ended up staying longer because of some loans he made. Mr. XXXX first came into contact with XXXX XXXX, who had business operations but was having financial difficulty because of a divorce. Mr. XXXX agreed to loan him 150,000 Euros (the \"First Loan\"). He testified that he thought he was going to get the money back. The Panel asked him if he did anything to ensure that XXXX had the capability to repay the loan. He testified that he did not. Mr. XXXX also testified that the money was not paid back to him as agreed. Then, XXXX and his partner XXXX XXXX showed him paperwork for a future project and Mr. XXXX agreed to loan them 250,000 Euros (the \"Second Loan\"). At the first sitting the Panel asked Mr. XXXX if he has provided the loan agreements as evidence and he testified that he gave it to his counsel. However, they were not provided to the Panel at that time.\n[29] The Panel asked Mr. XXXX about the repayment terms for the Second Loan and he testified that there were to be monthly payments starting right away, but they did not actually start until about 8 months after the loan was made. He testified that each payment was supposed to be $10,000 and the interest rate was to be 8%. The Panel asked him how long it was supposed to take in order for the whole loan to be paid off through this system, and he testified that they did not have an exact date when it was to be paid off. The Panel asked him if there was an amortization schedule to indicate when the interest and principal would be paid off. He testified that the First Loan was to be paid off after five or six months. The Panel later asked Mr. XXXX if there was an agreement as to when the Second Loan would be paid back, and he testified that there was no specific date. The Panel asked him why he loaned such a large amount of his money without a firm schedule as to when it will be paid back. He testified that he had enough money and it was not hard for him, and people need help when they fall on hard times.\n[30] In paragraph 16 of the BOC narrative Mr. XXXX wrote:\nIn 2012, XXXX business partner approached me again with a business proposal and he asked me for money. I lent him 250,000 Euros. As part of our agreement, the interest charges on the loan will be assessed at 8% annually amortized over 5 years paid monthly installments on the 10th of every month. According to this agreement, he would pay me the interest and a small amount of the loan every month until summer 2015 [sic].\n[31] The same passage appears verbatim in Mr. XXXX affidavit.7 The Panel referred Mr. XXXX to paragraph 16 of the BOC narrative. The Panel asked Mr. XXXX if he could explain why he testified that there was no schedule as to when all of the money would be paid back, when he wrote about a fixed five-year amortization in the BOC. He testified that it was not specified when all of the money has to be paid back, just how much each month. The Panel read the pertinent part of the BOC to Mr. XXXX and he asked the Panel where it says this. The Panel responded that it is in the BOC he authored. He asked the Panel to tell him what it says. The Panel asked him to open the BOC and turn to paragraph 16 of the narrative. The Panel again drew his attention to the reference to a five-year amortization. He responded that he has not received any payments. Counsel then read the sentence to Mr. XXXX and asked him if he knows what \"amortized\" means. He responded \"not so much.\" He added that this loan never had a date by which it had to be paid back. Counsel and the Panel then explained what it means to amortize a loan over 5 years. Mr. XXXX responded again that they did not pay it back. The Panel and counsel attempted to have Mr. XXXX explain the loan and he firmly maintained that there was no time where the loan had to be completely repaid. Counsel asked him why he wrote about a 5 year amortization schedule in the BOC. He testified that he does not know, and there was no such agreement.\n[32] Counsel then raised a concern that Mr. XXXX may need an interpreter. The Panel asked Mr. XXXX if he understands the questions and express himself in English. He testified that there may be one word he does not understand, but in general he understands. The Panel asked him if he would like to continue as he had previously elected, namely without an interpreter. He responded that he does not know, and if his lawyer thinks he does not understand, he does not want to say anything stupid that may affect his children.\n[33] Counsel then made the following oral application:\nIf I may say something, I'd like to say something. It has become clear to me that XXXX did not sign his BOC document using an interpreter and it has become clear now that we're here, and when he claimed refugee and did his BOC it was not envisioned that his children would be my only clients and I'd be here representing them. It has become clear to me now, that XXXX you do not understand all of this, and I would like to have it interpreted to him for the interests of his children, and have an interpreter read it over to him, and have an adjournment so we can proceed, because this is important to his children and as their lawyer I have obligations to them that are quite separate and apart from my obligations to XXXX when I was his lawyer. And the children are vulnerable, I think the guideline on children refugees require me to do this and I would be delinquent if I don't do this right now. I am not satisfied that the evidence for the children is properly before this board. And I think that I really need, before I can proceed further, on credible evidence, I need to have an interpreter interpret the BOC to XXXX and correct mistakes that there may be that are there, and I would not like to proceed until that is done, because I am having serious concerns.\n[34] The Panel asked Mr. XXXX if, like with the BOC, he also completed his affidavit without an interpreter, and he testified that there was no interpreter for the affidavit. The Panel asked him if he read it before he signed it. He responded \"I'm not so well in reading. Yes, but I - so much.\" Finding this unclear, the Panel asked Mr. XXXX if he was confident that he knew what was written in the affidavit before he signed it, or if he was in any way unsure about what it said. He responded \"I thought it's - think it's true. That why I signed it.\"\n[35] The Panel denied counsel's application for an adjournment. The Panel noted that Mr. XXXX signed a solemn declaration on the BOC that he can read English and that he fully understands the answers he gave on the form. The Panel acknowledged that a Croatian interpreter was requested on the BOC, but that no interpreter was requested for Mr. XXXX in the counsel's witness notification.8 Mr. XXXX also clearly stated that he does not need an interpreter at his children's hearing, where he knows that he is giving evidence for their claims. The Panel noted that Mr. XXXX also signed an affidavit, sworn before Ms. XXXX, without an interpreter, and that he testified that he knew what was written before signing it. The Panel noted that it was speculative to suggest that a lack of interpretation was the reason for the inconsistency between Mr. XXXX testimony and his two written statements about the loan. The Panel would note that Mr. XXXX never indicated a lack of capability with English until counsel suggested that he does not understand the word \"amortize.\" When asked to state whether he can participate in English, Mr. XXXX testified that other than the one word (amortize) he understands English. Even if it were true that for some reason he used the word \"amortized\" in both the BOC and his affidavit without knowing what it means, he also added \"over five years\" in both documents. It is very difficult to believe that, with Mr. XXXX command of English, and even if he did not understand the word \"amortize,\" he would have signed both documents referring to a five year period if there was no such period.\n[36] When the Panel had given reasons for denying the adjournment application, counsel stated that she wished to \"respond\" to the decision. The Panel stated that no response would be entertained as the decision had been stated and reasons had been given. Counsel then made an application that the Panel recuse itself based on bias. After hearing the reasons for the application, the Panel informed counsel that the application was denied, and that written reasons would be included in the final reasons for the claims. Counsel's full application and the Panel's reasons may be found at the conclusion of these reasons.\n[37] As soon as the Panel informed Counsel of the dismissal of her application, she then requested a recess to speak to the Claimants, as \"they have a right to know what is going on.\" The Panel allowed the recess and the hearing stood down for 15 minutes. After the recess, upon returning to the hearing room, the Panel observed that Mr. XXXX was no longer present. Instead, XXXX was present, and counsel stated that she had apprised XXXX of her concerns and asked XXXX if he believes that his father is fluent in English or if he needs an interpreter. She stated that XXXX had told her that his father is a proud man and that he does indicate when he cannot express himself to XXXX. XXXX then informed the Panel that he thinks the hearing should be postponed so his father can go over his evidence as he is not fluent in English. Counsel asked for four weeks in order to complete this exercise with an interpreter. With some reluctance, the Panel decided to allow the application based on the new evidence provided by XXXX. The hearing was adjourned.\n[38] The second sitting took place on September 26, 2016 and, given what transpired at the first sitting, the Panel arranged to have a Croatian language interpreter present. Disclosure9 was received in advance of the second sitting, namely:\n* An affidavit signed September 13, 2016 by Mr. XXXX for the purpose of his application for leave and judicial review of the decision finding him inadmissible for serious criminality.\n* Loan agreements for the First Loan and the Second Loan.\n* Several emails regarding collections of the 100,000 Euro loan that Mr. XXXX allegedly brokered (the \"Third Loan\").\n* A Statement of Claim filed in respect of the Third Loan.\n* Two pages of untranslated Croatian documents, apparently of a financial nature.\n* A letter from a lawyer regarding the third loan.\n* A Labour Market Opinion regarding Mr. XXXX and two educational certificates.\n* Residential tile and business registration documents.\n[39] At the commencement of the second sitting, to the Panel's surprise, Mr. XXXX stated unequivocally that he does not need an interpreter, and that he wishes to continue giving evidence in English. The Panel asked Mr. XXXX if he had carried out the actions that formed the justification for the adjournment, namely reviewing his BOC and affidavit with an interpreter. He testified that he did not do this. The Panel asked him why, and he testified that he saw one mistake in the documents, namely there was no agreement that the Second Loan will be paid off in five years. He added that five years after 2012 is 2017, not 2015 (the BOC and affidavit both indicate 2015), and that it was never agreed that the loan would have to be paid off by a particular date, but rather that it would have to be paid off within five years. This turn of events raised obvious questions about the adjournment request, but the Panel decided to simply continue with the questioning.\n[40] Further questions were asked of Mr. XXXX, and, as best the Panel understood his evidence, each month an interest payment had to be made equal to an annualized rate of 8% of the outstanding principal balance. The principal, however, was to be paid off at any time within five years.\n[41] Mr. XXXX provided a written agreement for the First Loan.10 As for repayment, the agreement provides as follows: \"Money will be paid back in full at current rate of exchange within three (3) months or sooner as projects are completed and paid out.\" The Panel asked Mr. XXXX when the loan was to be repaid according to the agreement. He testified that it was to be repaid in the short term, perhaps three or four months. The Panel asked him if there was a specific time period in the agreement and he testified that there was no specific time period. The Panel asked him if he can explain why the loan agreement he provided indicates a fixed term of three months to repay the entire loan. He responded that he had said short term and three months. He added that the important thing is that he lost everything.\n[42] The Panel does not find Mr. XXXX evidence about the loans, which form the justification for remaining in Canada for several years without status, to be not credible. As a starting point, it is reasonable to believe that an experienced business person would not loan out hundreds of thousands of Euros without clear agreements and without having a clear understanding of how and when the loans will be repaid. Yet, Mr. XXXX evidence in this area was confusing and contradictory. When first asked about the written agreement for the Second Loan, he testified that there were to be monthly payments of $10,000. This is not in the written agreement he later provided. He also testified that there was no exact time when the entire loan was to be paid off. This is inconsistent with the agreement, which gives a deadline of five years. It is also inconsistent with his later testimony, which is that even though it was not truly \"amortized\" over five years, the principal was indeed to be paid off within five years. Also, if this last version were true, then the first explanation of $10,000 monthly payments would not make sense, as the monthly payments would not be fixed and would vary depending on the outstanding balance. Further, if the monthly payment were to be monthly interest at an annualized 8% rate, this would not come close to $10,000 per month.\n[43] Further, at the first sitting when Mr. XXXX was referred to his own written statement in the BOC regarding the Second Loan, he maintained that there was no set time as to when the loan must be paid back. He then appeared completely unfamiliar with what he had written, and it had to be shown to him. When again asked for an explanation, he appeared to avoid the issue, saying that he has not received any payments. Even after the concept of an amortized loan was explained to him, he continued to testify that there was no fixed time for the loan to be paid off. In response to counsel he testified that he does not know why he wrote about a five-year term in the BOC and affidavit.\n[44] Mr. XXXX also testified at first that the First Loan was to be paid off over five or six months, which is inconsistent with the agreement which sets the deadline at precisely three months. Even at the second sitting after he had supplied the loan agreements, he still could not offer testimony consistent with the agreement.\n[45] Even after the hearing was adjourned at counsel's request, and with Mr. XXXX knowing that his children's claims rest on his evidence, he did not take the opportunity to review his BOC and his affidavit with an interpreter. At the second sitting, he attempted to tweak his evidence into consistency, by implying that there is a difference between the loan being paid off in five years, and the loan being paid off at a date five years in the future. This is a meaningless distinction, and in the Panel's view Mr. XXXX was simply attempting to erase the unexplained inconsistency that had arisen in his evidence. In any event, his final version was that only interest was payable on a set monthly schedule, and the principal could be paid back at any time within five years. This is still inconsistent with his repeated testimony that there was no deadline to pay off the loan.\n[46] Given the amount of money at skate, the Panel finds that if Mr. XXXX had engaged in the Second Loan, he would be able to explain the terms in a fairly straightforward and consistent manner in English, which is the language he expressly chose for the hearing and the language in which he wrote his BOC and affidavit. He was not able to do so. The evidence regarding the First Loan is even more starkly inconsistent and not credible. The written agreement clearly provides that the money must be paid back within three months. It is beyond belief that Mr. XXXX would not be able to corroborate this simple fact in testimony. Asked for an explanation of why he said there was no fixed time period, he simply tried to erase the inconsistency by pointing out that \"three months\" was part of the answer of \"three or four months\" that he had given. This explanation is nullified by his additional testimony that there was no fixed time period to pay off the loan.\n[47] The fact that his evidence is so confusing and inconsistent, and that he gave evasive answers at some points, leads the Panel to find that neither the First Loan nor Second Loan is credible or believable.\n[48] After carefully considering all of the evidence and counsel's submissions, the Panel finds that Mr. XXXX delay in claiming, for which no credible explanation has been offered, is inconsistent with the danger he alleges is faced by the Claimants in Croatia. The Panel draws a negative inference in respect of his credibility and in respect of the Claimants' allegations. The Panel notes that even if its conclusions regarding the loans is wrong, Mr. XXXX still remained in Canada for years without status and without making attempts to regularize it for himself or his children. Even if he made loans, this would not stop him making reasonable efforts to find a way to get safety for himself and the Claimants in Canada, which he did not do. A negative inference would result whether the Panel rejected the loans or not.\nBOC Omission - Police Assault\n[49] In the BOC, which he signed in November 2015, Mr. XXXX wrote about his interaction with the criminal justice system in Croatia and his conviction. He also wrote about this in his affidavit, which was filed nine months later in August 2016. In the affidavit he writes that when he was in police custody, they beat him for two or three days in order to extract a confession. He wrote that it was extremely painful and left him with bruises but that he never signed the confession. He wrote that at trial, his lawyer tried to argue in court that he was beaten, but that the court took no heed of this. When asked about this, Mr. XXXX testified that for three days straight, four or five police officers would come into his cell and beat him until he was vomiting blood. He testified that this is part of the reason he does not trust the police in Croatia and he is not willing to avail himself of their protection.\n[50] Mr. XXXX made no mention of any assault by the police in the BOC and the Panel asked him why. He testified that he does not know why it is not written in his BOC. He added that he spoke many times with the Claimants' counsel, and that she said this detail is not as important for his refugee claim hearing.\n[51] Under questioning from counsel, Mr. XXXX testified that he wrote the BOC sometime after being released from detention.\n[52] The Panel rejects Mr. XXXX explanations for the omission. The prolonged and vicious police beating is an extremely important detail in Mr. XXXX allegations. It forms an important part of his alleged need for protection. It simply defies common sense that he would choose to omit it, given the level of detail that he gave in the BOC regarding the conviction and his interaction with the police and the courts. The Panel also rejects the notion that counsel would advise him not to include this important detail. The fact that he had been in detention recently before preparing his BOC does not explain the omission of this vital detail.\n[53] The Panel draws a negative inference in respect of Mr. XXXX credibility.\nInconsistency - Threats to Mr. XXXX Family in Croatia\n[54] In his BOC and affidavit, Mr. XXXX wrote about a total of three visits to his parents in Croatia. XXXX XXXX men visited in late 2012 and the summer of 2015, and other men came regarding the Third Loan in late 2013. However, Mr. XXXX testified about more than three visits. The Panel asked him how many times his parents have been visited, and he testified that there may have been \"four or five.\" He then added \"six.\" The Panel asked him why he wrote about only three visits in the BOC, to which he responded that maybe there were ten visits, and who knows. He added that maybe his parents don't want to tell him everything. Asked again why he wrote about three if he knew about more, he testified that there is no reason, and that this is what he remembers from his parents, but he knows for sure there were more.\n[55] The Panel rejects Mr. XXXX explanation. His explanation did not squarely address the inconsistency. He seems to leave room for visits that he knew about but chose not to write about. It does not make sense that he would not write about events he knows about. Regardless of how he found out about the visits, it is reasonable to expect that Mr. XXXX would provide a consistent account of how many times his parents have been visited by agents of harm in Croatia. The Panel draws a negative inference.\nOther Documents and Evidence\n[56] The Panel will assess the other documents that were submitted in support of these claims, as they related to Mr. XXXX allegations.\n[57] Counsel provided emails, and one lawyer's letter, purportedly arising from efforts to collect the Third Loan.11 The letter, in which the lawyer for XXXX and XXXX demands payment, is addressed to four parties including Mr. XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and two companies. The lawyer does not offer any explanation of Mr. XXXX part in this loan or the collection, simply addressing his demand to \"you.\" Counsel also provided a Statement of Claim filed in Ontario by XXXX and XXXX against XXXX XXXX and his company.12 There is passing reference to these men being introduced by \"a mutual friend\" though this friend is not named.13\n[58] The Federal Court has ruled consistently that, when there are significant reasons to doubt a claimant's credibility, their documents may be rejected or given little weight.14 In particular, the Panel cannot overlook the fact that the First and Second Loans have been revealed as fabrications. However, even if the emails, letter, and statement of claim regarding the Third Loan were given the full weight of their contents, in the absence of credible evidence about the surrounding circumstances they would not advance Mr. XXXX allegations of persecution. They only reflect a small fragment of the alleged Third Loan, namely correspondence regarding collection efforts. These documents could arise from any number of plausible circumstances where money changed hands. The documents do not corroborate Mr. XXXX involvement and they certainly do not corroborate persecution. His testimony is the only evidence tying these proceedings to persecution.\n[59] Counsel provided several documents from Mr. XXXX trial and appeal.15 They also provided a \"legal opinion\" from Croatia, wherein at the request of Mr. XXXX, a lawyer gives an opinion that Mr. XXXX \"was a victim of his own lack of judgment, as well as being 'in the wrong place at the wrong time'.\"16 The lawyer essentially engages in a re-weighing exercise and concludes that if another trial were held, \"a lighter sentence would be justifiably expected, and even a trial outcome other than a conviction.\" The lawyer appears to be of the opinion that the case against Mr. XXXX was too circumstantial to convict him. He also offers the opinion that under new soft drug decriminalization policies enacted in 2012 and 2013, Mr. XXXX would now get a lighter sentence.\n[60] The documents related to the trial do not assist Mr. XXXX; they simply confirm that after a trial he was convicted and that his appeal of the conviction was dismissed. The Panel can place no weight on the \"legal opinion.\" The existence of another possible outcome of the trial based on the same evidence does not vitiate the court's original conclusion that Mr. XXXX is guilty. It is also irrelevant that decriminalization provisions enacted since the conviction may have led to a different result. The Panel also cannot overlook the fact that Mr. XXXX embellished his evidence about these charges by adding an allegation of assault by the police and attempt to force a confession.\n[61] The Panel acknowledges that counsel provided numerous documents about the general situation of corruption in Croatia. These would add support Mr. XXXX allegations if there were a credible basis to his allegations. In the absence of such evidence, however, they merely show that his allegations are not inherently implausible.\n[62] Counsel applied for the admission of post-hearing evidence. The Panel has decided to allow the application. The disclosure consists of a statement from Mr. XXXX mother and some purported news articles.17 The statement is neither dated, nor signed, nor sworn. It states that there were threatening visits from people, vaguely stating that they occurred \"in the last couple of years.\" It does not indicate how many visits there were, even approximately. This evidence is also being provided at a late juncture, so it cannot be tested. The Federal Court has cautioned against adopting untested or unsworn statements, especially from interested parties such as family members.18 Further, since the statement not dated, the Panel does not know if it was drafted before the hearing, or if it was drafted after the hearing to repair credibility issues that arose during the hearing. For these reasons, this statement is given no weight. As for the news articles, their source is unclear; there is no information as to the authors or what organization, if any, published them. Nothing has been provided to establish even a minimal level of reliability for these articles. However, even assuming that they are reliable, they only provide evidence of the existence of organized crime and gang members in Croatia. The articles contain nothing that bolsters the specific allegations of Mr. XXXX.\n[63] Mrs. XXXX was not declared in advance as a witness. However, she was present at some points and Counsel briefly asked her some questions, which the Panel allowed. She testified that she is afraid that XXXX XXXX will harm her children. She testified that she has heard that XXXX is connected with the police. She testified about how she would try to protect her children if they had to return to Croatia. Mrs. XXXX is not mentioned in the BOCs as being personally present for any of the persecutory events. The only such events counsel asked her about were the threatening visits to Mr. XXXX parents. She confirmed that she heard about these visits from Mr. XXXX parents.\n[64] Counsel argued that Mr. XXXX was found credible by the Immigration Division (ID) at his admissibility hearing. The admissibility decision is in evidence and counsel appears to argue that since the ID member did not mention credibility in his decision, he found Mr. XXXX credible. There is no merit to this submission. The fact that the ID member did not undertake a credibility analysis does not mean that he accepts that Mr. XXXX was wrongly convicted. The ID member only had to determine whether Mr. XXXX was convicted of an offence, and Mr. XXXX admitted the conviction. It was not necessary to determine whether he is credible about the facts underlying the conviction. The ID member did not find him credible, he simply declined to re-try the offence as it was unnecessary to do so.\nConclusion - Credibility\n[65] In assessing Mr. XXXX evidence, the Panel has applied the presumption that his sworn allegations are true unless there is a valid reason to doubt their truth. In short, the Panel treated his evidence as though he were a refugee claimant. There is no reason to do otherwise as he is the author of the Claimants' BOCs and the source of all of their evidence. Were it not for the finding that he is ineligible, he would have been a party to these proceedings as the principal claimant and his evidence would have been tested in the same way.\n[66] Despite the presumption of truth, the Panel arrives at a conclusion that Mr. XXXX is not credible. His failure to apply for extensions of the Claimants' status, after he had successfully extended his own status, is absolutely contrary to the dangers he alleges on behalf of the Claimants. The fact that Mr. XXXX remained in Canada for over four years without status, and without making any attempt to regularize his status, even further diminishes his credibility. The Federal Court has maintained that delay in claiming can be fatal to a claimant's credibility even when there are no other reasons to doubt their credibility. The decision of Mr. Justice Boswell in Pournaminivas stands for this principle.19 Mr. Justice Fothergill ruled similarly in Juma, also noting the longstanding presumption \"that a person having a well-founded fear of persecution will claim refugee protection at the earliest opportunity.\"20\n[67] The Panel has heard, considered, and rejected Mr. XXXX explanations for the delay in claiming. Because of his stark inability to provide consistent evidence of the loans that he alleges caused the delay, the Panel finds neither loan credible. The existence of two purported loan agreements does not make up for Mr. XXXX extremely problematic testimony. It appears to the Panel that if Mr. XXXX had not been arrested, he would still be living without status in Canada and avoiding the outstanding arrest warrant in Croatia.\n[68] The Panel finds that Mr. XXXX claims about approaching lawyers were heavily embellished and exaggerated. In addition, Mr. XXXX omitted a very serious and central allegation in his BOC, namely several days or torturous assaults by the police.\n[69] Mr. XXXX was also unable to give consistent evidence on the simple but important issue of how many times his parents have been visited in Croatia. Material omissions and inconsistencies are well-established indicators of a lack of credibility.\n[70] Mr. XXXX documents do little to rehabilitate his credibility and they provide little probative value in establishing his allegations. At best, the documents relating to the third loan establish that a loan was made between parties other than Mr. XXXX, and that there are efforts to collect on this loan. The documents from his trial establish that he was convicted of the offence and was unsuccessful on appeal. For the reasons given above, the \"legal opinion\" carries no weight in establishing that his conviction was wrongful. All told, the post-hearing documents carry no weight in establishing Mr. XXXX allegations of harm.\n[71] Mrs. XXXX was presented as a witness but, as far as events that form part of the allegations of persecution, she testified only about one. Her evidence in this area was hearsay. This does little to rehabilitate the serious deficiencies in Mr. XXXX credibility. The Federal Court has ruled that third party corroboration does not repair a lack of credibility.21\n[72] For these reasons the Panel finds that Mr. XXXX is not credible. This is a global finding that extends to all of his evidence of persecution; the Panel finds that he is simply not a credible witness.\nConclusion - Allegations not Established\n[73] Mr. XXXX has been found not credible. The Panel has reviewed his documents and determined that they are only evidence of peripheral matters such as the existence of legal disputes. The Federal Court has ruled consistently that, when assessing a claimant's allegations of persecution, documents may be given no weight when they corroborate peripheral events and not persecution itself.22 Mr. XXXX documents are not credible evidence of his allegations of persecution, as this would require credible evidence of a link to those allegations. Given that Mr. XXXX is not credible, this link does not exist and the documents are given no weight.\n[74] For these reasons the Panel finds that Mr. XXXX has failed to establish his allegations on a balance of probabilities with credible or trustworthy evidence.\nNo Credible Basis\n[75] For the reasons that follow, the Panel finds, pursuant to subsection 107(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act), that these claims have no credible basis. This provision reads as follows:\n107(2) If the Refugee Protection Division is of the opinion, in rejecting a claim, that there was no credible or trustworthy evidence on which it could have made a favourable decision, it shall state in its reasons for the decision that there is no credible basis for the claim.\n[76] The seminal case governing this issue is the 2002 Federal Court of Appeal decision in Rahman:23\n[28] Moreover, the wording of subsection 69.1(9.1) provides that a \"no credible basis\" finding may only be made if there was no credible or trustworthy evidence on which the Board member could have upheld the claim. In other words, the Board member may not make a \"no credible basis\" finding if there is credible or trustworthy evidence before it that is capable of enabling the Board to uphold the claim, even if, taking the evidence as a whole, the Board decides that the claim is not established.\n[29] However, as MacGuigan J.A. acknowledged in Sheikh, supra, in fact the claimant's oral testimony will often be the only evidence linking the claimant to the alleged persecution and, in such cases, if the claimant is not found to be credible, there will be no credible or trustworthy evidence to support the claim. Because they are not claimant-specific, country reports alone are normally not a sufficient basis on which the Board can uphold a claim.\n[30] On the other hand, the existence of some credible or trustworthy evidence will not preclude a \"no credible basis\" finding if that evidence is insufficient in law to sustain a positive determination of the claim. Indeed, in the case at bar, Teitelbaum J. upheld the \"no credible basis\" finding, even though he concluded that, contrary to the Board's finding, the claimant's testimony concerning the intermittent availability of police protection was credible in light of the documentary evidence. However, the claimant's evidence on this issue was not central to the Board's rejection of his claim.\n[77] In Iyombe,24 decided in 2016, Mr. Justice Martineau summarized the law thus:\n[15] Yet, the fact that the RPD finds that an applicant's testimony is not credible does not, de facto, lead to a finding that there is no credible basis for a claim (Foyet v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2000 CanLII 16312 (FC) at para 23 [Foyet]). There is a high threshold for finding that there is no credible basis for a claim (Ram\u00f3n Levario v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 314 at para 18). The RPD may not make a \"no credible basis\" finding in cases where there is independent and credible documentary evidence (Foyet at para 19). However, as the Federal Court of Appeal specified in Rahaman v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 FCA 89 at para 19, \"in order to preclude a \"no credible basis\" finding, the \"independent and credible documentary evidence\" to which Denault J. [in Foyet] refers must have been capable of supporting a positive determination of the refugee claim.\"\n[78] In Ebika,25 Mr. Justice Phelan recently ruled as follows:\n[11] A finding of \"no credible basis\" is a severe finding with significant consequences (loss of right to appeal to the Refugee Appeal Division). It is more than a credibility finding (Pournaminivas v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 1099). Therefore, to make such a finding, the RPD must examine and reject a piece of relevant evidence so that there is no credible evidence which could support a claim. [Emphasis in original]\n[79] In view of recent jurisprudence, which the Panel will review in the following paragraphs, the Panel finds that there is no credible or trustworthy evidence that could support these claims.\n[80] The recent jurisprudence deals with situations where a claimant is found not credible, but the decision is attacked for conflating that credibility finding with a finding of \"no credible basis.\" In these cases, the Court has assessed whether the remaining evidence meets the thresholds of reliability and probative value to vitiate the \"no credible basis\" finding. In the present claims, Mr. XXXX has been found not credible but there is other evidence, so the Panel must engage in a similar exercise.\n[81] In Ebika,26 the RPD had found a woman not credible in her claim of being a lesbian, and therefore placed no weight on her testimony. However, she also presented photographs and a letter establishing her involvement with an LGBT organization. The Court did not disturb the \"no credible basis\" finding because the evidence was not sufficient to establish sexual orientation. That is, the fact proven by this evidence, that is simple attendance at LGBT events, was not sufficient to ground a claim.\n[82] In Moshood,27 a claimant was found not credible and the remaining evidence consisted of affidavits, a death certificate, and news articles. However, the death certificate did not speak to a cause of death, and the news articles dealt with events unrelated to the claimant.28 The affidavits (from the claimant's mother and uncle) simply reiterated the claims that had been found not credible, without providing additional detail.29 The Court noted that \"no credible basis\" is an appropriate finding \"when the only evidence linking an applicant to the harm that he alleges is found in their own testimony and the claimant has been found to be not credible.\" In assessing whether there is \"independent and credible documentary evidence that is capable of supporting a positive determination,\" the Court noted that only the affidavits contained evidence with the necessary links between the claimant and the alleged persecution. Even though the affidavits were not found to be fake or fraudulent, given the other credibility concerns in the case and the lack of specificity in the affidavits, they carried little weight and were insufficient to support a positive determination.30 The Court upheld the \"no credible basis\" finding.\n[83] In Seenivasan,31 the Court found the RPD's decision on credibility to be reasonable. In assessing whether the claim had \"no credible basis,\" the Court reasoned as follows:\n[39] The only evidence that could possibly be considered of a corroborative nature related to his claim was the power of attorney deeds and the news articles. The powers of attorney simply demonstrate that he was involved in real estate transactions, had authority over some land and delegated authority over other land to others. They do not show that he engaged in a land grab scheme, that these were illegal in any way, that he was kidnapped or threatened by politicians, or that he faced charges by the police.\n[40] The news articles refer to the land grab issue in Tamil Nadu, describe the scheme differently than how the applicant described his dealings and convey that the new governing party does not condone these practices. The news articles do not make any link to the applicant's evidence or corroborate his claims. Moreover, that information would not establish that anyone was at risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, danger of torture, or risk to life, only that those involved in illegal schemes may be investigated and prosecuted.\n[84] The Court found that the only evidence linking the applicant to these documents was his own discredited testimony. The Court therefore upheld the finding that the claim had \"no credible basis.\"\n[85] The Panel has applied this jurisprudence to Mr. XXXX other evidence. His documents are not unlike the documents assessed by the Court in the three decisions mentioned above. The First and Second Loans have been rejected, and the loan agreements are therefore given no weight. However, in any event, only the Third Loan relates to the alleged persecution. The documents related to the Third Loan are the letter and email correspondence with the lawyer, and the Statement of Claim. Mr. XXXX testimony is the only evidence that would link the existence of this loan and its collection with the persecution he alleges was committed by XXXX and XXXX. Without his testimony, the documents are only evidence of a loan and collection proceedings. They do not even contain clear evidence of how Mr. XXXX was involved.\n[86] The statement from Mr. XXXX mother suffers from several deficiencies as discussed above. It is also diminished by Mr. XXXX general lack of credibility. Even if it were not so diminished, it is too vague and lacking in specifics to be considered evidence that could ground a positive decision. It is akin to the affidavits assessed by the Court in Moshood. The news articles do not mention anything specific to Mr. XXXX allegations. An evidentiary link between himself and the gangsters would be required, and Mr. XXXX discredited testimony is the only such link. The documents regarding his conviction establish only that he was convicted of a drug crime and his conviction was upheld on appeal. Mr. XXXX legal opinion, for the reasons given above, carries no weight in establishing that he was wrongly convicted. The articles in counsel's disclosure32 regarding corruption in Croatia have no link to Mr. XXXX personal circumstances and therefore could not lead to a positive determination in these claims.\n[87] Mrs. XXXX was questioned only briefly by counsel. Her knowledge of persecution is only from what she heard from others. It is impossible to attach weight to her testimony when the person who purports to have firsthand knowledge of the persecution, namely Mr. XXXX, demonstrates himself to be lacking in credibility. Her testimony could not lead to a positive decision in these claims.\n[88] In coming to all of its findings in this matter, the Panel has been alert, alive, and sensitive to the Claimants' status as minors. The Panel has applied Guideline 3. However, this is not a case where the minors are giving evidence on their own behalf, or where they are constrained by their age. There is no indication that the Claimants' status as minors limited their ability to gather evidence for their claims or to present them to the Panel. They had a lawyer and an independent designated representative, as well as both of their parents in Canada assisting them. This is also not a case where there are unique considerations for what would constitute persecution to the Claimants as minors. Their claims turn completely on the credibility of Mr. XXXX and on his allegations. In addition Guideline 3 is clear that evidentiary and legal burdens are not relaxed for minors.33 The Federal Court affirmed this principle in Kim, supra. Finally, the Act provides minors no exemption from subsection 107(2) of the Act, which provides that the Panel \"shall\" state, when certain criteria are met, that a claim has no credible basis.\n[89] The Panel finds that these claims have no credible basis.\nApplication for Recusal\n[90] These are the reasons for the rejection of counsel's application for recusal based on bias. Counsel's oral application was as follows:\nI will formally make, I think, at this point, I'm going to officially and formally make a motion for you to recuse yourself on a basis of bias. I think you are very biased towards my two minor claimants. I feel that I have to put it on the record that you are biased against them. I can't expect them to have a fair hearing with you sir, with all due respect, because we have here their father, whose testimony today has clearly shown he is not as proficient in understanding all of the nuances of the English language and he says he doesn't need an interpreter but now I have serious concerns that he doesn't really understand everything properly and he doesn't know his limitations, because his evidence is going to be used for my two minor Claimants. With all due respect, as their lawyer, I want an interpreter provided so I can review the BOC document with their father, and make any changes that are necessary to protect the two minor claimants. I don't believe that is an unreasonable request, and when we are dealing with minors we have to be particularly careful. And given your total refusal to entertain that these minors are prejudiced by their father and his lack of insight into his own limitations, with all due respect I think that that constitutes bias on your part. It seems to me that you have made up your mind about certain things, and nothing I can say to you is going to make you look at things fairly towards them. And I think that is deeply regrettable, and I don't feel comfortable proceeding with you at this time.\n[91] A review of the case law governing such applications is appropriate. Mr. Justice Shore made the following comments in Zhu34:\n[1] The test for reasonable apprehension of bias, as articulated by Justice Louis-Philippe de Grandpr\u00e9 in the often cited case of Committee for Justice and Liberty v Canada (National Energy Board), [1978] 1 SCR 369:\n...the apprehension of bias must be a reasonable one held by reasonable and right-minded persons, applying themselves to the question and obtaining thereon the required information... [T]hat test is \"what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically -- and having thought the matter through -- conclude. Would he think that it is more likely than not that [the decision-maker], whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly.\n[2] An applicant alleging bias must meet a very high threshold. He or she must provide \"cogent evidence\" demonstrating that something a Refugee Protection Division [RPD] member has done gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias (R v RDS, [1997] 3 SCR 484 at para 116-117). As stated in Arthur v Canada (Attorney General), 2001 FCA 223, allegations of bias cannot be done lightly:\n[8] ... An allegation of bias, especially actual and not simply apprehended bias, against a tribunal is a serious allegation. It challenges the integrity of the tribunal and of its members who participated in the impugned decision. It cannot be done lightly. It cannot rest on mere suspicion, pure conjecture, insinuations or mere impressions of an applicant or his counsel. It must be supported by material evidence demonstrating conduct that derogates from the standard ...\n[All emphasis by Mr. Justice Shore].\n[92] The Federal Court echoed these comments in Brahim,35 Dang,36 and Maklakov,37 affirming that allegations of bias are serious and should be made with caution.\n[93] Counsel's allegation is one of actual bias, not perceived bias. However, her allegation is based solely on the fact that the Panel's had rejected her application to adjourn the proceedings. Nothing else about the Panel's conduct of the proceedings was impugned. In Brahim and Dang, the Federal Court dealt with similar allegations of bias, namely those based on a tribunal's decisions rather than their conduct. In Dang, the Court ruled that the tribunal's negative finding regarding wedding attire did not raise an apprehension of bias, even though the Court then went on to reject that finding as unreasonable.38 In Brahim, the Court stated it even more succinctly:\n[16] In this case, the applicants crafted their allegations of \"bias\" primarily on the basis of the RPD's findings. They allege, inter alia, that the RPD failed to mention medical evidence regarding the minor female applicant as well as problems she and her mother purportedly experienced at school. The Court is of the view that this is not a matter of \"bias,\" but rather one that is related to the reasonableness of the decision. The same holds true for comments made by the RPD with respect to secularism in Quebec. [Emphasis added]\n[94] Even if, for the sake of argument, we were to assume that the Panel was wrong to deny the adjournment, this does not in and of itself show that the Panel is biased.\n[95] The Panel will make one final comment on this subject, and it is acknowledged that, in making this comment, the Panel has the benefit of hindsight that it did not have when it orally denied the application for recusal. The Panel did eventually allow the application after XXXX give evidence. Despite this, and despite the vehement arguments that it was crucial for the Claimants that Mr. XXXX review his BOC and affidavit with an interpreter, he never did this.\n[96] In conclusion, in applying the test in Committee for Justice and Liberty and the subsequent jurisprudence, the Panel's conduct did not show a bias.\nCONCLUSION\n[97] The claims are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"K.

This relationship was discovered by her family in 2008 and as a result the claimant was severely mistreated by her father and then forced to marry a man, XXXX XXXX, in XXXX 2008. While she continued her lesbian relationship in secret, she was continually sexually and physically abused by her husband. In 2013, when her husband discovered the claimant and her partner kissing in the driveway he called the police who arrested and detained the claimant for 3 days The claimant alleges she was raped and tortured during her arrest.\n[4] The claimant returned to her home with her husband where she again experienced physical and sexual violence at the hands of her husband.\n[5] The claimant, having obtained a business visa to the United States (USA) in 2016 for work purposes, travelled to the USA in XXXX 2016. She made a port-of-entry refugee claim in Canada on April 13, 2016. Her claim was an exception to the Safe Third Country Agreement as she has a brother in Canada.\n[6] The claimant fears her husband, her family, the police, and community on account of her sexual identity and fears domestic violence.\nDETERMINATION\n[7] The Panel finds that the claimant is not a Convention refugee, nor is she a person in need of protection in accordance with sections 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b) of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[8] The claimant presented her Ugandan passport when she made her claim for refugee protection.2 The Panel accepts the claimant's identity on a balance of probabilities.\nCredibility\n[9] The Panel finds that the determinative issue on this claim pertains to credibility. Documents submitted by the claimant to support her claim contained inconsistencies and contradictions that are unreasonably explained. The claimant's testimony regarding contact with her past partner was inconsistent. The claimant's brother, here in Canada, and present at the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) on the day of the hearing, was not willing to act as a witness in the claimant's case, according to the testimony of the claimant. The Panel draws a negative inference from his unwillingness to testify.\nIncident of police detention\n[10] The claimant testified that she met her partner \"XXXX\" when she was in school. She testified that they began a relationship in 1999 when the claimant was approximately 13 years of age. She testified that the relationship ended when they were caught kissing, by the claimant's husband, on XXXX XXXX, 2013 (approx.14 years). On that day the claimant said that her husband called the police and the claimant was arrested and detained for three days. The claimant testified during her hearing that she was raped and tortured by the police as well as other female inmates during her time in jail. She testified that she was beaten with \"bamboo sticks\" by the police.\n[11] The claimant testified that on the day she was released, XXXX XXXX, 2015, she was let out of police custody and walked to a nearby hospital for treatment. She said her arms were bleeding from the beatings and she was cold.\n[12] To corroborate this incident the claimant presented a hospital medical form.3 The claimant was asked a number of questions regarding her treatment such as what she was treated for, how she managed to walk to the hospital on her own, and how she obtained the hospital record. The claimant's account was unreasonable. The claimant testified that she was \"bleeding\" and when asked what treatment she received she provided a cursory answer, she said she was cold, she said the hospital gave her an injection \"to sleep\", and she could not recall any other treatment. According to the medical form the claimant was treated for hypothermia, and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) among other treatments that are difficult to read on the form. When the claimant was asked specifically about the CPR, she was unable to explain. When asked how she managed to walk to the hospital and yet was in such a state that required CPR the claimant could not explain. When the claimant was informed that CPR would indicate an emergency medical procedure used to resuscitate someone from cardiac arrest, the claimant could not explain when\/how this was done. She testified that she was asleep and when she woke up she did not get any feedback from the doctors about her treatment due to the busyness of the hospital. The Panel finds the claimant's account that she was severely beaten, raped, and tortured in police custody and was able to walk herself to hospital, yet required CPR, highly unlikely.\nStatements from the claimant's cousin\n[13] The claimant was asked how the medical form was obtained as an original was presented in the hearing room. The claimant stated that it was sent to her from Uganda while she was at XXXX XXXX in Detroit, waiting to enter Canada. She testified that her cousin got the medical note from the hospital. When asked why the note is dated August 1, 2013, if it was obtained by her cousin at the hospital in March\/April 2016 the claimant said it was with the hospital records.\n[14] The Panel, in considering the credibility of this testimony, considered the affidavit statement submitted by the claimant from her cousin \"XXXX\", the same cousin who collected her documents.4 According to XXXX statements the claimant's husband found out about her same-sex relationship \"in and around 2014\" and reported it to the police. However, according to the claimant's testimony her husband found out in 2013 and reported her to the police. The claimant was asked about this and numerous other inconsistencies in the affidavit. She testified that her cousin got some information \"wrong\" and that the information was based upon what the claimant told her cousin, and yet her cousin did not have all the information. The affidavit also refers to the claimant being raped in police custody in 2014; however, the claimant testified that she was not in police custody in 2014.\n[15] The Panel finds the explanation that the cousin made mistakes is wholly unreasonable. The affidavit is the claimant's evidence. She submitted it to corroborate her claim. That she distances herself from her own evidence that she put forward is in the Panels' view unreasonable. Other inconsistencies in the affidavit include the cousin corroborating the claimant's testimony that she fled to her home before leaving for the USA. According to the claimant she went to her cousin's to stay before departing for the USA. At that time the claimant stated she had no knowledge of the police looking for her.5 However according to her cousin, the claimant \"fled her husband's home due to the police mounting a search for her in relation to her sexuality at the said residence.\"6 When asked about this statement, the claimant said that she \"didn't know.\"\n[16] The Panel finds the affidavit submitted to support the claimant's claim inconsistent with the claimant's testimony and lacking in credibility. The claimant's testimony that her cousin obtained the hospital form is also lacking in credibility due to the numerous credibility problems with the cousin's statements. There is no reference from the cousin regarding how the medical form was obtained and why it is dated from 2013 when it was obtained in 2016. The Panel places no weight on the documents submitted to corroborate her relationship or the abuse she endured in 2013 while in police custody.\nInconsistent testimony about contact with her girlfriend\n[17] The claimant testified that she had an approximate 14-year relationship with XXXX. The claimant was asked if she has anything to corroborate this relationship such as correspondence, photographs etc. The claimant testified that she did not, that she had to be discreet due to the situation for lesbians in Uganda. The Panel accepts this explanation as reasonable, as the documentary evidence refers to the political and social situation in Uganda as highly intolerant of sexual minorities7 and therefore lesbians would reasonably have to be discreet in such a context. However, the Panel finds the claimant's testimony was inconsistent when she testified about her contact with her partner and the types of contact she had.\n[18] The claimant testified that the last time she saw her partner was in XXXX 2013 when she and her partner were caught. After that date the claimant said she did not see or hear from her. However, according to the letter from XXXX to the claimant dated May 10, 2014, XXXX states that \"It has been 5 months since I last saw you.\" When confronted with her evidence the claimant provided a confusing and contradictory account. She initially said \"I didn't see her... I don't know why she said that.\" Then when asked by the Panel to clarify who is correct, XXXX or the claimant, the claimant said that she was \"scared\" and that she had tried to Skype with XXXX in her office after the claimant's arrest. The claimant when confronted with her inconsistency repeatedly said she was \"scared\". However, this explanation does not explain why she testified that she had no contact and then said she did have contact. The claimant, when questioned by her counsel, indicated that they tried to \"Skype\" a few times, but then only Skyped once. Not only does the Panel find the claimant's account of contact with her girlfriend inconsistent and unreasonably explained but when asked why she earlier said she kept no record of the relationship and yet then testified to texting her girlfriend and Skypeing her girlfriend, the claimant said she \"deleted everything.\" When asked if she could demonstrate that she or her girlfriend had a Skype account, the claimant said she did not keep any account. The Panel finds that the claimant's testimony continually changed with respect to contact with her girlfriend. The only document to corroborate the relationship contained inconsistencies that the claimant could not reasonably explain. The Panel places no weight on the letter to corroborate the claimant's same-sex relationship.\nBrother refusing to act as a witness\n[19] The claimant submitted a letter from her brother, who resides in Canada, to corroborate that she is a lesbian and that she was forced into a marriage against her will.8 The letter explains the claimant's travel and her brother's willingness to assist her. The Panel asked the claimant if her brother was present on the day of the hearing. The claimant indicated that he was. The Panel asked the claimant why he was not called to act as a witness. The claimant stated that her bother is unwilling to do so as he is a \"born-again Christian\" and \"he chooses not to\". The Panel draws a negative inference from the claimant indicating her brother is unwilling to act as a witness. The brother was present at the Board on the day of the hearing and provided a letter. That he was not willing to answer questions pertaining to his letter of support is in the Panel's view unreasonable. The Panel places no weight on the letter and draws a negative inference from the brother's unwillingness to speak to the letter he wrote.\nEvidence of marriage and abuse\n[20] The claimant alleges that she was forcibly married to a man since 2008, approximately 7 years before she fled. She described during oral testimony that she was repeatedly raped and abused by her husband, that she experienced instances of gang rape instigated by her husband; when asked if she received any medical attention, she said no. She did present one medical document from XXXX 2012 which she states indicates a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test due to the numerous assaults on her.9 The claimant provided startling details of physical and sexual violence instigated by her husband, during her oral testimony. She was asked why she makes little reference to the types of abuse she endured at the hands of her husband in her Basis of Claim Form (BOC). The claimant said \"I just forgot\". The Panel finds the claimant's account of the years of sexual and physical abuse lacking in credibility. The claimant only submitted one medical form that is generally illegible. She had numerous omissions in her BOC regarding the types of abuse she suffered both by her husband and also while in police custody.10\n[21] When asked if she has any other evidence of the marriage such as a marriage certificate, the claimant stated that she \"did have one but did not bring it.\" The family member present on the day of the hearing could have corroborated her testimony but refused to do so.\n[22] Given the numerous credibility concerns related to the claimant's testimony and the documents submitted to corroborate her claim, the Panel finds the claimant lacking in credibility with respect to her testimony of forced marriage and abuse.\nOther documents\n[23] The claimant did submit a number of other documents to corroborate her claim.\n[24] Specifically, a warrant for her arrest11 and mail from her lawyer about the arrest12 both to corroborate that she is wanted by the police. The Panel places no weight on either document as evidence of the claimant being wanted in Uganda. The warrant contains few security features and no letterhead. The warrant, according to the email from the claimant's lawyer in Uganda, was obtained through his \"contact\".13 The Panel has no way to verify the individual who states he is the claimant's lawyer.\n[25] In considering the totality of the evidence the Panel finds these two documents do not outweigh the numerous credibility problems with this case. The Panel finds that the warrant for the claimant's arrest is lacking in credibility as the circumstances leading to her arrest have been lacking in credibility.\n[26] The claimant also provided a letter from \"XXXX XXXX XXXX\" in Waterloo.14 This letter indicates the claimant's involvement in a Lesbian Gay Bisexual Trans Queer (LGBTQ) volunteer organization in Waterloo, Ontario. The claimant attended a newcomer's event. The Panel finds that mere membership in a community organization does not confer sexual identity. The Panel finds that the claimant's involvement in this organization does not outweigh the credibility concerns on this claim.\nGender Guidelines\n[27] The Panel did consider the Gender guidelines in this claim.15 The claimant is a university educated woman from Uganda who worked as the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for a XXXX XXXX.16 The concerns she is alleging are based upon the nexus of membership in a particular social group, as a lesbian and as a victim of domestic violence. While her allegations are based on Convention grounds, and are documented problems relative to the country conditions,17 the Panel finds that her claim fails due to a lack of credibility.\nCONCLUSION\n[28] The Panel determines that, for reasons of credibility, the claimant has not satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, or that, on a balance of probabilities, she would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life, or face a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, if she were to return to Uganda. The Panel rejects her claim.\n(signed)\n\"Nadra Qadeer\"\nNadra Qadeer\nJune 10, 2016\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended.\n2 Exhibit 1.\n3 Exhibit 4, page 2.\n4 Exhibit 4, pages 7-8.\n5 Exhibit 4, item 4.\n6 Exhibit 4, page 7.\n7 Exhibit 4, item 9.\n8 Exhibit 6.\n9 Exhibit 4, page 2.\n10 When testifying on the police custody the claimant also testified to startling sexual violence perpetrated by other female inmates and encouraged by the police.

After graduating, she was hired by the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in Kinshasa on XXXX XXXX, 2015, as a XXXX XXXXin-training under the supervision of XXXX XXXX. On the night of March 19 to 20, 2015, 421 corpses were discovered buried in a mass grave at a cemetery in Maluku, approximately 100 km from Kinshasa. She went there with her supervisor on March 20, 2015, to XXXX XXXX XXXX. Like all XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, they XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX despite the police ban. XXXX XXXX did not show up for work on XXXX XXXX, 2015, and he has not been seen since then. She received a summons from the police on XXXX XXXX, 2015, to appear the next day. She did not go. The police went to her house on XXXX XXXX, 2015, arrested her and searched the house. She was mistreated while incarcerated. A police officer who was a member of her mother's ethnic group helped her escape. She went to the home of her friend, XXXX XXXX, who spoke with the claimant's parents. According to them, she could not return home because the police were still looking for her. As they were leaving, the officers left a summons. Her parents gave her her passport and an airplane ticket from a travel agency so she could go and study in the United States. The course at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX began on XXXX XXXX, 2016. She left by airplane on XXXX XXXX. An exit stamp from the general directorate of migration was affixed at the airport. She arrived in the United States on XXXX XXXX, 2015. She did not claim asylum in the United States. She went to the Canadian authorities in Windsor, Ontario, to make her claim for refugee protection. According to Schedule A, she had worked for XXXX XXXX in Kinshasa from XXXX 2015 to XXXX 2015. In response to question 6(J), whether she had \"ever been detained, incarcerated or put in jail,\" she checked \"no.\" She gave the same answer to question 6(b), whether she is \"currently charged with, on trial for, or party to a crime or offence, or subject of any criminal proceedings in any country.\" She was living at XXXX XXXX, Kinshasa.\nDocuments\n[4] The claimant submitted a driver's licence; a certificate of achievement from the Congo XXXX XXXX dated XXXX 2014 (issued on XXXX XXXX, 2016); a diploma from the Congo XXXX XXXX dated XXXX 2013 (XXXX XXXX XXXX); a state diploma dated XXXX XXXX, 2008; and a transcript from XXXX XXXX, 2012, from the Congo XXXX XXXX.\n[5] The claimant submitted a summons dated XXXX XXXX, 2015, for her appearance on XXXX XXXX, 2015 (XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX). The reason was to be communicated on site. A second summons, dated XXXX XXXX, 2015 (XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX), from the same public prosecutor for her to appear on XXXX XXXX, 2015.\n[6] According to a letter from the claimant's mother, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, dated January 5, 2016, two men went to her home on XXXX XXXX to serve her with a summons in the claimant's name. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, men in uniform carried out a search and questioned her. The claimant was arrested. On XXXX XXXX, a second summons was left at the house. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, XXXX XXXX told her that the claimant was at her home. She scheduled an appointment with a travel agency to purchase an airplane ticket. A copy of her voter's card was included.\n[7] The claimant submitted a letter from XXXX XXXX dated January 10, 2016, with an identity card from her job. In the night of XXXX XXXX to XXXX, 2015, the claimant went to her house. She went to speak with the claimant's mother on XXXX XXXX, 2015. She asked her to go to a travel agency to purchase an airplane ticket. Someone she had contacted was waiting for them at the airport to facilitate the trip. The claimant is being sought.\n[8] A letter dated February 18, 2016, from her half-brother in Canada, XXXX XXXX XXXX, was submitted. In XXXX 2015, his parents informed him that the claimant was having problems in the Congo and that she had to leave the country for her safety. They told him that the problems were related to the discovery of a mass grave in Maluku, where she had gone for a XXXX XXXX.\n[9] A letter from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX indicates that she was admitted as a student on XXXX XXXX, 2015, for XXXX XXXX 2016 session. She had to pay her school fees before XXXX XXXX, 2016.\n[10] The claimant submitted a copy of her travel itinerary dated XXXX XXXX, 2015. She left from Kinshasa on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015, and arrived in the United States on XXXX XXXX via Paris.\n[11] The claimant submitted a copy of her identity card from XXXX XXXX dated XXXX XXXX, 2015, and a letter from XXXX XXXX dated February 22, 2016. The claimant was arrested by the police in XXXX 2015 and detained for three days. An identity card was not attached.\n[12] A letter from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX [XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX] dated February 25, 2016, indicates that the claimant was arrested on XXXX XXXX, 2015, as a result of her appearance at the site of the mass grave in Maluku on March 20, 2015. An identity document was not submitted. The source of this information was not identified.\n[13] A copy of an article from L'Objectif from December 24 to 28, 2015, that the claimant mentions was submitted.\nCountry conditions\n[14] Response to Information Request COD105429.F of February 16 was filed as Exhibit 4. According to that document:\n[translation]\nSources indicate that 421 bodies were buried in the night of March 29, 2015 [to March 20, 2015 (RTBF May 5, 2015)] in Maluku, about 100 km from Kinshasa. The Report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) submitted in June 2015 to the United Nations Security Council states:\nOn 12 April, [2015,] the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior, Evariste Boshab, and the Minister of Justice, Alexis Tambwe Mwamba, confirmed that 421 bodies, including those of destitute or abandoned persons and unborn babies, had been buried in a mass grave. The Government opened a judicial investigation into the mass grave. Judicial and administrative investigations into the case are being conducted by the Congolese authorities with the support of MONUSCO. Concerns persist, however, that the bodies buried in Maluku may be of individuals killed during \"Operation Likofi\" from November 2013 to February 2014 or of individuals killed during the demonstrations of January 2015, whose bodies were taken away from the morgues of hospitals in Kinshasa with the intention of dissimulating the killings. (United Nations 26 June 2015, para. 5)\n[15] The Association congolaise pour l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la justice (ACAJ) [Congolese association for access to justice]:\n[translation]\n... reports a \"violent repression\" by the police during a march held on April 24, 2015, in Kinshasa and Mbuji-Mayi on the initiative of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (Union pour la d\u00e9mocratie et le progr\u00e8s social, UDPS) political party, so that an \"independent and credible\" investigation could be carried out in the case of the Maluku mass grave (ibid. Apr. 27, 2015). The ACAJ states that in addition to members of the UDPS and Christian Democracy (D\u00e9mocratie chr\u00e9tienne) political parties, \"[t]he police ... brutally assaulted journalist Eliezer [Tambwe] and his cameraman, who were covering the march, and that they damaged...and seized [the latter's] camera before...releasing them around 5:00 p.m.\"\n[16] According to that Response:\n[translation]\nFurther information on the arrests of people XXXX XXXX XXXX in relation to the discovery of the 421 corpses in Maluku could not be found among the sources consulted by the Research Directorate within the time constraints of this Response.\n[17] Document 3.12 in the national documentation packages is Response to Information Request COD104763.F of April 10, 2014. According to that document, fraudulent documents are easily obtained in the DRC.\n[18] According to the United Kingdom report of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, there are XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in the DRC.1 Private criticisms of the government are tolerated. However, public criticism of government officials and government conduct or decisions regarding issues such as conflict and insurgencies, management of natural resources, or corruption sometimes resulted in harsh responses, often from the ANR, the intelligence service under the president's control.2\n[19] The report from the U.S. Department of State stated the following.3 The government registered XXXX XXXX XXXX. Unlike in the previous year, government authorities neither killed XXXX nor caused any to disappear. According to one source (XXXX XXXX XXXX), authorities assaulted XXXX XXXX and threatened or harassed 21 during the year. The group reported a decrease in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX violations from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Other incidents included detentions or questioning XXXX XXXX and efforts to subject them to administrative, judicial or economic pressure or to interpose obstacles to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[20] The claimant submitted a user manual for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\nANALYSIS\n[21] The claimant's testimony is not credible or trustworthy. According to the claimant, she worked as a XXXX for nine months, from XXXX to XXXX 2015, and she used XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The panel asked her questions about the XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and the number XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and she could not give even a simple answer. She did not know the basic functions of XXXX XXXX, despite having worked for nine months as XXXX XXXX with a supervisor.\n[22] According to the XXXX XXXX manual, the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. She had no knowledge of the concept of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. When the panel asked her what she recorded XXXX XXXX XXXX, she replied on a cassette. There were two rolls of 5 cm with a ribbon on the inside. According to the user manual, the XXXX XXXX is a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that records XXXX on a \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\" memory card. Given that the claimant did not even know that XXXX XXXX does not use cassettes, it is unlikely that she ever used such XXXX XXXX, even if her supervisor set the controls before giving it to her. Her testimony that she worked as a XXXX is implausible.\n[23] The letters from the claimant's mother, her half-brother and XXXX indicate that they support the claimant's written account. The source of the information reported by L'Objectif and the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX [XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX] is not identified. In particular, the panel is unable to establish whether the family or another source is responsible. The probative value of those documents is insufficient to establish the truth of the facts alleged in them.\n[24] The fact that the claimant plausibly did not tell the truth with regard to her work as a XXXX casts doubt on the authenticity of the letter and identity card from XXXX XXXX. The panel gives them little probative value. According to the claimant, she did not report to the prosecutor's office on XXXX XXXX, 2015, as required by a summons-notice to appear. She was therefore arrested by the police on XXXX XXXX, 2015. She fled during the night of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Another summons-notice to appear was issued on XXXX XXXX, 2015, asking her to report to the prosecutor's office on XXXX XXXX, 2015. According to those documents, [translation] \"Failure to comply with this notice may result in an arrest warrant being issued for the person(s) concerned.\" When she failed to appear on XXXX XXXX, 2015, a warrant for her arrest had to be issued according to that document, in order to make her appear before the prosecutor's office. However, after she fled, a second summons-notice to appear was issued with a different file number, stating that the reason would be communicated on site, even after she had been questioned for two days. Without further information, these submissions alone are insufficient to conclude that those documents are false. However, when these factors are considered in the context of testimony that is not credible, the documentation from XXXX XXXX that is probably not authentic, and RIR COD104763.F stating that fraudulent documents are prevalent in the DRC, the panel finds that these summonses do not have enough probative value to establish that they are authentic or that the claimant is being sought by the authorities.\n[25] A positive factor in the claim is the fact that her mother, her half-brother and XXXX supported her refugee protection claim. They have an interest in seeing the claim allowed. However, the claimant's testimony about her work as a XXXX is central to the claim, but not credible. The support of her family and a friend without knowing their motivation does not have enough probative value to establish the basic points of the claimant's story, given the degree of her lack of credibility.\n[26] Having considered all the documentation with the claimant's explanations, the panel finds that the presumption of truthfulness of the claimant's testimony has been rebutted in this case. There is not enough credible and trustworthy evidence to establish that the claimant was arrested in the past, or that she is a person of interest to the government authorities for the reasons she described. The claimant's return to the Democratic Republic of the Congo would not subject her to a good chance of persecution or to a danger of torture, risk to her life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment, as defined in sections 96 and 97 of the Act.\n[27] The RPD determines that the claimant is not a Convention refugee or person in need of protection. For all these reasons, this claim is rejected.\n(signed)\n\"H. Shepherd\"\nH. Shepherd\nApril 29, 2016\nDate\nIRB translation\nOriginal language: French\n1 Exhibit 3, XXXXXX XXXXX\n2 Ibid., para.

The claimants are common law spouses. The female claimant was pregnant with the male claimant's child at the time of the hearing.\n[4] The female claimant alleges that she was raped and impregnated by a XXXX XXXX, and forced to undergo an abortion in China. She alleges that the PSB accused her of slandering the government of China because she posted comments on the internet in which she criticized the XXXX. She alleges that her criticism of the XXXX caused her to lose her job and to be beaten. She alleges that if she returns to China she will be arrested and beaten.\n[5] The male claimant alleges that the XXXX where he worked in China was selling fake drugs. He alleges that he was beaten, lost his job and was accused of slandering the government as a result of criticizing XXXX management about this issue.\n[6] The claimants travelled to the US using their own passports and US visas, and arrived in Hawaii on XXXX XXXX. They then travelled to Canada on February lst where they made their claims. The male claimant's mother lives in Canada and was found to be a refugee by the Immigration and Refugee Board in 2011.\n[7] The claimants initially submitted their claims to the Board without mentioning each other or their common law relationship in their respective Basis of Claim (BOC) forms. The claims were subsequently joined by the Board on the basis of their common law relationship. The claims were heard jointly and both claimants testified. Each claimant stated that the evidence of the other was correct, and adopted the evidence of the other as their own. The Minister intervened on the issue of credibility.\nDETERMINATION\n[8] The panel finds that the claimants have not established that there is a reasonable possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, or that, on a balance of probabilities, they would personally be subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if they were to return to China.\nCREDIBILITY\n[9] The panel was mindful of the challenges faced by the claimants when establishing their claim including cultural factors, nervousness, and the unfamiliar milieu of the hearing room. The panel also considered the age, education and background of each claimant when assessing their credibility. It also considered the Gender Guidelines.1 At the time of the hearing, the female claimant was 26 years old. She said that she had 15 years of education which included college, and said she worked in XXXX in China. The male claimant was 32 years old at the time of the hearing. He said he had 12 years of education, and worked as a XXXX in a XXXX XXXX in China XXXX XXXX.\n[10] The panel finds that the presumption of truthfulness was rebutted for the following reasons.\nClaimants initially fail to disclose their relationship\n[11] The claimants initially submitted two separate, unrelated claims. Neither claimant mentioned the other in their respective BOC or disclosed at Q.5 that they were common-law spouses as they were required to do. Although each claimant amended their BOC to include information about how their spouse was affected by the persecution the other alleged, they did so only after the Board joined their claims.\n[12] The female claimant confirmed that she and her spouse had lived together for two years in China, and that both were aware of each other's problems while still in China. She said that they submitted their claims separately because: \"at the time, they thought they were doing it independently\". She said they didn't want to affect each other, so that's why information about the other wasn't included in their respective first BOC versions. She was asked if they didn't want to affect each other, why she mentioned her spouse in her BOC amendment. She said because later on they found out that they were applying jointly.\n[13] She was asked why they would submit independent claims to the Board given that it would result in an inaccurate picture of their circumstances. She said because when they came, the snakehead told them that they would have a better chance to stay in Canada if they applied independently. The panel therefore finds, on the basis of the female claimant's testimony, that the claimants intended to submit unrelated claims in order to improve their chances of being found to be refugees\nAffidavit of XXXX XXXX\n[14] The claimants submitted an affidavit from XXXX XXXX who indicates that she works as an interpreter for a company that assisted the claimants with their BOCs. Ms. XXXX states that the claimants' first BOCs were submitted in error to the Board. When asked about this, the female claimant said she didn't know about it.\n[15] Ms. XXXX also stated in her affidavit that the error involved an employee who \"accidentally printed out the wrong version of their personal narrative which was submitted to the IRB.\" This explanation is contradicted by the testimony of the female claimant who testified that both claimants intended to submit separate claims in order to maximize their chances of acceptance on the advice of their snakehead. The failure of the claimant's to initially disclose their relationship is not only limited to their personal narratives, as mentioned by Ms. XXXX in her affidavit, but is also found in the BOC form itself. Neither claimant disclosed that they had a common-law partner as they were required to do by Q.5 of their BOC. This finding further undermines the explanation provided by Ms. XXXX. The panel assigns little weight to the affidavit of XXXX XXXX for these reasons.\nInvolvement of Smuggler\n[16] The panel acknowledges that a smuggler is sometimes used by a claimant to flee persecution in their own country. However, the female claimant testified that she and her spouse took advice from a smuggler who counselled them to apply for refugee status independently in order to improve their chances of acceptance. The panel finds that this involvement of the smuggler with respect to advice given, and then taken by the claimants on how to maximize their odds of acceptance, is troubling because it resulted in the claimants with-holding and misrepresenting information about their common law status in their initial BOCs. The panel finds this strategy to with-hold and misrepresent material evidence was calculated and intended to deceive, and would have misled the panel and prevented it from making an informed and proper adjudication of the family planning issue. These findings undermine the credibility of both claimants.\n[17] The panel notes that the claimants are both well educated, have travelled fairly extensively and held reasonably responsible positions in China. It finds that neither were disadvantaged in their decision to mislead the panel by a lack of education or basic sophistication. It finds that both claimants willingly accepted the snakehead's advice to apply independently of each other with full knowledge that this strategy was intended to improve their odds of being found to be refugees.\n[18] The panel finds that this misrepresentation was also carried forward by the claimants to their BOC declarations. Both claimants declared that the information they provided in their BOC was complete, true and correct, although both knew they had chosen to apply independently of the other thereby making the information which they provided in their BOCs about their family incorrect and their declarations necessarily false. The panel finds that the willingness of both claimants to sign a false declaration further undermines their credibility, as well as the reliability and trustworthiness of their other BOC allegations and testimony.\nFailure to disclose Siblings\n[19] The female claimant testified that that she had two siblings: a brother and a sister. However, she failed to disclose this information at Q.5 of her first BOC as she was required to do. Rather, she amended her BOC to include two siblings at Q.5. The issue of the non-disclosure of the siblings in her first BOC, and her amendment to include them, is relevant to the weight to be given to her hukou which lists the composition of her family and which indicates that she is from Hebei province. Her hukou refers to the female claimant as the \"second daughter\" which presupposes the existence of an older sister.\n[20] The female claimant was asked why she didn't mention that she had two siblings in her first BOC. She said that she was afraid for her siblings, and didn't want to affect them. She said, at the time, she didn't really understand how this goes, and she didn't want to affect them. She was asked to clarify. She said she just didn't want to have what was happening to her to affect them. The panel asked her why she included information about her parents in Q.5 given her concerns. She was asked to clarify what she meant. She said because her siblings are in her hukou registration, and both are married. She was asked if she wanted to add anything more to her explanation, and only said that she was really sorry.\n[21] She was asked if she deliberately chose not to disclose information about her siblings in her first BOC. She said yes, but then her counsel told her it would not affect them. The panel noted for the female claimant that she signed a BOC declaration indicating that the content of her BOC was complete, true and correct although she knew it wasn't correct. She said correct.\nAnalysis\n[22] The panel rejects the claimant's explanations for not disclosing the existence of her alleged siblings in her first BOC. It finds that her explanation that she didn't want to involve them in her own matters is undermined by her subsequent decision shortly thereafter to amend her BOC to include information about them. Her failure to identify the alleged siblings in her first BOC is further undermined by her willingness to disclose other family members at Q.5. The panel rejects her explanation that she amended her BOC to include the siblings because her counsel advised that it wouldn't affect them given that it finds that the claimant failed to provide a credible explanation why this information was not included in her BOC in the first place.\n[23] The claimant testified that she amended Q.5 of her BOC to include the siblings because they are mentioned in her hukou. It finds that this explanation raises credibility concerns with respect to the genuineness of the hukou. It finds that the claimant effectively amended Q.5 of her BOC to include siblings so that her BOC would be consistent with information about the \"second daughter\" found in her hukou.\n[24] It finds that her BOC amendment to modify the core structure of her family undermines her credibility, in the absence of a reasonable explanation, and the genuineness of her hukou. These findings undermine her allegation that she lived in Hebei province before coming to Canada. When considering the weight to assign to the female claimant's hukou, the panel also considered that documentary evidence indicates that fraudulent documents, including IDs, are a serious problem in China.2 The panel assigned little weight to the claimant's hukou for all of these reasons. These findings undermine her allegations that she lived in Hebei province before coming to Canada.\n[25] The panel acknowledges that the claimants submitted resident identity cards, and that the male claimant also submitted a hukou which indicates he is from Hebei province. The panel approached these documents with caution as a result of its concerns with respect to the female claimant's hukou, and the involvement of a snakehead in their Canadian refugee claims.\n[26] The panel also draws a negative inference with respect to the claimant's testimony that she knowingly with-held information at Q.5 of her BOC, and thereafter knowingly signed a false BOC declaration with respect to her family composition. These findings undermine her credibility and confirm her disregard for telling the truth particularly in the context of a formal declaration.\nHow the Claimant found out she was pregnant\n[27] The claimant alleges that she became pregnant as a result of the rape. She said that she went to the hospital for a check-up, and the doctor told her she was pregnant. She was asked for her medical book. She said she didn't have one. She was asked if she had a hospital report indicating that she was pregnant. She said there was none. She was asked if she meant it didn't exist. She said correct. She was asked how she knew this. She said the doctor said so.\n[28] She was asked if she had an explanation why there was no hospital record that she was pregnant. She said that she just found out that she was pregnant, and that she had no further check up's on the baby or anything. She was asked if she had any explanation why the doctor would tell her than there was no medical record despite the hospital finding that she was pregnant. She said she didn't know.\n[29] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that if the claimant was found to be pregnant by a doctor in a Chinese hospital, in a country that carefully monitors pregnancy and births,3 that some record would exist for this finding. It finds her allegation that the doctor told her there was no hospital record, in the context of a country that is known to diligently monitor pregnancies and births, lacks credibility. The panel finds that the absence of a hospital report indicating that the claimant was pregnant, and her improbable evidence that the hospital doctor told her that there was no hospital report for her pregnancy, undermines her allegation that the hospital visit occurred, or that the claimant received a pregnancy finding from a doctor in a hospital. These findings undermine her related allegations that the XXXX XXXX impregnated her, and that she was subsequently forced to have an abortion.\nAbortion Certificate\n[30] The claimant was asked if the family planning office was involved in her forced abortion. She said that she didn't know. She was asked if she saw or spoke to anyone from the Family Planning office during or after the forced abortion. She said no.\n[31] The claimant submitted an abortion certificate to the panel which indicates that she underwent an abortion. The certificate indicates: \"Location of operation: XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX center of XXXX XXXX Hospital (Family planning office, Bureau)\".\n[32] The claimant was asked why she said that she didn't have contact with the Family Planning office, and didn't know whether they were involved with the abortion, given the information on her certificate. She said, first of all, she really doesn't know that much about hospitals. She said that she just realized when her older sister was pregnant, everyone that is pregnant has to go to a women's and health hospital for certain procedures, and that's when she realized that they were together, when the panel first asked the question, she didn't really think of it that way.\n[33] The panel rejects this explanation. It finds that the claimant's testimony that she didn't see or speak to anyone from Family Planning is undermined by her abortion certificate which indicates that the abortion allegedly took place at a family planning bureau within the hospital. As well, the panel notes that the claimant testified that she asked for the abortion certificate which was allegedly supplied by the hospital. It finds it reasonable to expect in these circumstances that the claimant would be aware that the family planning office was involved in the forced abortion.\n[34] It rejects her explanation that she didn't understand the connection of the hospital to the family planning department when the panel first asked the question, and that her memory was only jogged when she remembered details of her sister's pregnancy. It rejects this explanation given that the panel's question was straightforward, and the claimant's certificate indicates that the location of the operation was the family planning bureau at the hospital. It finds that the claimant`s lack of familiarity with where she allegedly was forcibly aborted, and by whom, despite allegedly obtaining a certificate with this information, undermines the genuineness of the certificate and the credibility of her allegation that she was forcibly aborted. The panel acknowledges that the abortion certificate contains a seal, the name of a surgeon, the address of the hospital, and bears a date. However, the panel finds that its noted concerns with the certificate undermines the reliability otherwise imparted by these features.\n[35] When assessing the reliability and trustworthiness of the abortion certificate, the panel also considered the documentary evidence which indicate that fraudulent documents are a serious problem in China and are easily obtained.4 The panel assigns little weight to the certificate for all of these reasons.\nInternet Posting\n[36] The claimant alleges that she posted criticism about the XXXX on the internet which resulted in a summons being issued against her for slandering the government. The claimant submitted a document identified in her personal documents as \"Internet post by XXXX XXXX.\"\n[37] The panel noted for the claimant that there was nothing about this document which indicated it had been posted on the internet: there was no visible reference to a search engine, nor did she take a photo of her on-line comment or print them from the internet. The claimant said that her posts were mysteriously deleted, so she couldn't print her comments. She said all that she could do was to write down what she wrote. She confirmed that the document she submitted was not the original internet posting.\n[38] She was asked if that was the case, why her document stated: \"A few days ago, I received a letter from XXXX XXXX.\" She said that this was the content of what she published on-line at the time.\n[39] The panel finds that it did not have sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to find that her comments were ever posted on the internet. This finding undermines her allegation that the PSB issued a summons accusing her of slandering the government because of her internet comments. The panel assigns little weight to the internet post for these reasons.\nDiagnostic Certificate - p. 16\n[40] The female claimant submitted a Diagnostic Certificate in support of her allegation that she was beaten by 10 men as a result of her internet posts. The words `The People`s Hospital of XXXX XXXX\" appear at the top of the certificate. The certificate indicates that the claimant was seen for \"swelling of soft tissue\" that was \"caused by external force\", and that she received \"Treatment advice\" from the hospital to \"ice down the swelling area.\"\n[41] The certificate does not provide an address or contact information for its issuer. The female claimant was asked if she wished to comment. She said the letter had a seal with a signature. The hearing room interpreter confirmed that the words XXXX XXXX Hospital, and \"Diagnostic Certificate seal\" appeared in the seal.\n[42] The panel finds that the absence of an address or contact information for the issuer undermines the genuineness of the certificate. It acknowledges that the certificate contains a seal, and the name and signature of a doctor. However, it finds that these features which would ordinarily impart reliability to a document are undermined by the absence of contact information for the issuer.\n[43] As well, the panel notes that the abbreviation \"No:\" appears in the Certificate, but that there is no file number beside it or elsewhere in the document. The claimant was asked for her comment. She said that she didn't know how they standardize their certificate or how the hospital does that.\n[44] The panel noted for the claimant that other than mentioning her name and age, that there was no other information in the Certificate to identify her: no date of birth, no address, no hospital file number or resident identity card number. She said that was their format, and they only have a name, a diagnosis and description in their format. She was asked how she knew what their format was given that she had said moments earlier that she was not aware of their standardized practices. She said that's what she saw when they gave it to her\n[45] The panel finds that the absence of identifiers, both for the claimant personally, and her hospital file generally undermine the genuineness of the certificate given that almost no information is provided in the document which could identify the claimant personally or identify her as a patient in a hospital. It finds her testimony about what the format of a hospital certificate should look like to be unreliable and contradictory given that she testified earlier that she was not aware of the hospital's standard practices. It finds that her contradictory evidence undermines her credibility given that she attempted to mislead the panel when she clearly had no credible evidence on this issue. The panel assigns little weight to the diagnostic certificate for these reasons. The panel finds it had insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to find that the claimant was beaten as she alleged.\nBOC omission - XXXX would not let her leave job\n[46] The claimant said that she worked for the XXXX XXXX and was raped by the XXXX XXXX. She alleges in her BOC that she became his mistress afterward, and \"went along with it\" because she \"believed the consequences of breaking up [with him] would be too severe including job loss and social stigma.\"\n[47] She was asked wouldn't it have been better to quit her job than to work with someone who raped her and continued to abuse her sexually. She said that he wouldn't let her leave, and that he wanted her to be his mistress. She said if she refused, he would cause all kinds of trouble. The panel noted for the claimant that she didn't mention in her BOC that the XXXX wouldn't let her leave her job. She was asked why she omitted this information. She said she did write it in her BOC, and he wanted her to be his mistress in secret. She added: \"I needed that job\".\n[48] She was asked to clarify. She said it wasn't easy to find a stable job with a stable income. She then added that she was afraid at the time. She said if she reported it, when people heard that she was raped, they would talk behind her back and family members would be in shame.\nAnalysis - BOC Omission\n[49] The panel finds that the claimant's allegation that her rapist would not allow her to leave her job is a material allegation. Although the claimant said that she included this information in her BOC, she was unable to offer an explanation for the omission. This panel notes that this allegation is not found in her BOC. The panel assigns little weight to the claimant's testimony that she thought she had included this information in her BOC. It finds that the claimant had an opportunity to hear the contents of her BOC at the point of translation. As well, the interpreter's BOC declaration, which the claimant confirmed was correct at the beginning of the hearing, indicates that the claimant assured the BOC interpreter that she understood all of her answers as interpreted. The panel finds, on this basis, and on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant was aware of the content of her BOC.\n[50] The panel also considered the Gender Guidelines when assessing the noted BOC omission. It finds that the claimant was able to provide BOC evidence and testimony with respect to why she didn't leave her employment, some of which referred to her relationship with the rapist, without any apparent difficulty or inhibition. It finds, applying the Guidelines, and on a balance of probabilities, and on the basis of the claimant's ability to provide information about this issue in both her BOC and testimony, that the noted BOC omission was not caused by feelings of shame or an inability to provide evidence with respect to her allegation that her rapist would not let her leave the workplace.\n[51] It finds, on a balance of probabilities, that her alleged fear of the XXXX or fear of social stigma do not adequately explain the BOC omission given the claimant was able to provide other evidence with respect to the alleged workplace issues without any apparent difficulty of inhibition. As well, the panel finds these explanations strayed from the question with respect to her explanation for the BOC omission, and were evasive.\n[52] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, having considered the Gender Guidelines, and the materiality of the omitted allegation, as well as the ability of the claimant to otherwise provide evidence on the noted issue, and the absence of a reasonable explanation for the noted BOC omission, that the claimant fabricated her evidence that the XXXX would not allow her to leave her employment. This finding undermines her credibility. It also undermines her related allegations involving other misconduct of the XXXX including his sexual abuse, her pregnancy as a result of rape, and the forced abortion.\nRelationship with XXXX\n[53] The claimant states in her BOC that she became the XXXX \"mistress\" and refers to the time they spent together as \"our affair\". The panel notes that this terminology is found in the first BOC which was submitted to the Board before the claimant disclosed that she was in a two year common-law relationship with the male claimant.\n[54] The claimant was asked why she would continue to have a sexual relationship with a man who raped her. She said that if she talked about it, she would lose her boyfriend and job. She said after this happened, she was afraid, didn't know what to do, and was naively trying to keep things the way they were. The panel noted for her that she had 15 years of education and that it l wouldn't have been that hard for her to get some kind of job. She said that if she quit her job, her boyfriend would ask her for the reason, and that if she told him the truth, he would not be with her any more.\n[55] The panel finds this explanation lacks credibility. It notes that the claimant could afford to take a European vacation with her common law spouse in roughly the same period of time which suggests some measure of affluence beyond the need for a job which she alleges. Nor does it find her allegations that she naively tried to keep things the same, and that she didn't know what to do, to be credible given that the status quo involved on-going sexual involvement with her rapist.\nClaimant pursues rapist\n[56] The panel acknowledges that the position of XXXX implies a position of power. However, it finds the claimant's BOC evidence in which she allegedly repeatedly challenged the XXXX undermines her allegation that she feared him or the notion that he exerted authority or control over her. She states in her BOC, after allegedly being fired by him, that she \"called him several times to see him\" and when he told her \"he wanted no entanglement with me,\" she went to his office and \"tried to find him,\" however the staff \"prevented me from seeing him and kicked her out\" telling her that if she came back they would ask the PSB to arrest her.\n[57] This description of the claimant's alleged response to the XXXX does not suggest that she was passive or intimidated by him. These findings, as well as the panel's finding that the claimant fabricated evidence about not being allowed to leave her employment, undermine her allegation that she was victimized by the XXXX.\n[58] The panel acknowledges that a rape victim might be reluctant to mention rape or sexual abuse to a spouse because of shame or cultural norms. However, it finds the claimant's allegation that she continued to have sex with her rapist because she feared that if she quit her job, her boyfriend would find out about the XXXX, and implicitly about his sexual abuse, strains credulity, given that the panel finds that that the claimant was not compelled to remain in the workplace. These findings undermine the claimant's allegation that she was involved in a sexually abusive relationship with the XXXX. It also undermines her allegation that family members were threatened and beaten.\nFail to Claim Elsewhere and Reavailment\n[59] The claimants travelled to Europe in XXXX 2015 on vacation, and then returned to China. The female claimant said that she and the male claimant travelled to Germany, France, Italy, Czech Republic, and Switzerland before returning to China. She confirmed that they didn`t make refugee claims in any of these countries. She was asked why. She said that when they went to Europe, they just wanted a change of scenery.\n[60] She was asked why they didn't make a refugee claim in these countries given that she alleged that she had experienced significant problems in China before this trip. The panel notes that the claimant alleges that she was forcibly aborted in XXXX 2015 and beaten in XXXX 2015 when 10 men came to her house to confront her about her internet posting. These alleged events occurred before their European vacation.\n[61] The claimant said that they didn't know until after they went back to China that the police would come to them with a summons. She was asked if she meant that what had happened before wasn't sufficient to make a refugee claim, but that they only realized they needed help when the issue with the summons arose. She said that was right.\n[62] She was asked why she returned to China after her vacation. She said that she wanted to go back to China, and to continue to protect their rights. The male claimant was asked if he wanted to add anything to the female claimant's testimony with respect to the issues of failure to claim in the aforementioned countries or their reavailment. He said no. The claimant also indicated at the end of the hearing that the female claimant's evidence was correct, and he accepted it as his own.\n[63] The panel rejects the explanations given for their failure to claim in the above-noted European countries, their reavailment. Each claimant alleges that they suffered significant persecution before their trip to Europe: the female claimant alleges that she was raped, became pregnant as a result of the rape, forced to have an abortion and was beaten during the visit with the 10 men. The male claimant alleges that he was beaten, threatened, and arrested and detained by the PSB for 7 days before he went to Europe. The panel finds that the female claimant's explanation that the alleged rape, forced abortion, and beating were insufficient to make her realize that she needed help in the numerous countries she visited strains credulity. It finds this explanation lacks subjective fear and is opportunistic given that the claimants rely on the very same incidents, which were insufficient to make a refugee claim at an earlier time, to establish their Canadian refugee claim.\n[64] It finds that their explanation that they returned to China to allegedly protect their rights lacks credibility, and demonstrates a lack of subjective fear given the extent of their alleged victimization before their European vacation. The panel finds that their failure to claim in the European countries which they visited and their reavailment to China undermines their subjective fear under s.96 and their credibility under s.97, as well as the likelihood, on a balance of probabilities, that the persecutory incidents they allege before their vacation actually occurred.\nDismissal letter. Ex 7, p.12\n[65] The female claimant submitted a dismissal letter in support of her allegation that the XXXX was responsible for her being fired. The writer of this letter does not identify himself by name, position or department. Instead, at the bottom of the letter, the words `The People`s government of XXXX XXXX appear. The female claimant said that the letter was from XXXX XXXX, the people's government, and it had a seal, and that it represents that it came from their work unit.\n[66] Although the panel acknowledges that the letter contains a seal, bears a date, and has contact information for the office, it nonetheless finds that the absence of a name, position or department of the writer undermines the genuineness of the dismissal letter. It finds that the reliability otherwise imparted by the seal and contact information is undermined by the failure of the letter to identify whoever wrote the letter. The panel assigns little weight to this letter for these reasons.\nSummons\n[67] The female claimant submitted a summons in support of her claim. At the top of the document, the words Public Security Bureau of XXXX XXXX, XXXX Police Station appear. The summons does not include an address or contact information for the issuer. She was asked if she wished to comment about this. She said there was only one police station in XXXX, which is a sub-county of XXXX XXXX. She said that anything that has to be done in the county has to be done there.\n[68] It noted for the claimant that her summons directs her to \"surrender yourself\" but doesn't provide her with a reporting address. She was asked how she would be able to respond to the summons without a reporting address or contact information. She said that people who live in the sub-county all knew about that PSB sub-station. She said you go there to have the resident identity card issued.\nClaimant knows where the police station is located\n[69] The panel noted for the claimant that the country reports suggest that the PSB is a sophisticated police organization that is well-organized throughout the country and which uses cutting edge technology.5 It noted for her that her that her summons, which fails to include even a reporting address, is inconsistent with what is known about the PSB. She was asked if she wished to comment.\n[70] She said that they came from a small village and the police equipment is not as sophisticated. She was asked how she knew this. She said that she had been to the police station when her resident identity card was issued, and it was a primitive place. She was asked if she was given a tour of everything they did at the police station and how they did it. She said no.\n[71] The panel rejects the claimant's explanation that a reporting address in her summons is effectively unnecessary because she knew where the police station was located, and had gone there to obtain identity documents, It finds this explanation to be highly speculative, and finds that it attempts to substitute her subjective view for objective PSB practices. Following the claimant's logic, the ability of the PSB to compel the appearance of an accused person would depend on whether or not the accused knew where the PSB office was located. The panel finds that the discrepancy between the documentary evidence which describes the PSB as a nationally networked police force that uses \"cutting edge\" technology and the claimant's marginal summons undermines the genuineness of the summons.\nFunctionality\n[72] The panel finds that the purpose of the summons to compel the attendance of an accused person. It finds that this purpose would be significantly undermined, if not thwarted, by the absence of a reporting address or contact information for the issuer. It finds the claimant's alleged belief that she was obligated to surrender herself to the police station in XXXX sub-county is speculative given no information about the reporting address is found in the summons.\n[73] The panel finds that the lack of functionality of the summons, when considered with the serious charge of slandering the government which it contains, further undermines the genuineness of the summons.\n[74] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that a well-organized police force such as the PSB6 would not rely on the subjective knowledge of an accused person to obtain their attendance when issuing a summons. The panel finds that the lack of contact information for the issuer and the absence of a reporting address in the summons, undermines its reliability and trustworthiness.\nDocumentary evidence\n[75] The panel acknowledges that the documentary evidence indicates that policing methods in China vary throughout the country. However, it also finds that the preponderance of the documentary reports also indicate that the PSB uses advanced technology throughout the country7 which suggests that a high level of organization and sophisticated police practices are found through-out the country.\n[76] Documentary evidence indicates that China uses a \"sophisticated surveillance system\" called the Golden Shield which has been described by an economist in an article in Open Magazine as part database, part monitoring network.8 In a March 2013 article, the Laogai Research Foundation describes Policenet as a component of the Golden Shield which in turn is described as \"a system of cutting-edge databases\" that allow public security officials to monitor information about Chinese citizens including their family relationships and internet browsing histories.9\n[77] An undated article on the website of the Ministry of Public Security indicates that all police units nationwide have access to eight public security databases, including the National Basic Population Database.10 The rate of network coverage for local police stations stands at 99%.11\n[78] The panel finds that the documentary evidence about the sophisticated policing methods employed by the PSB is in sharp contrast to the marginality of the claimant's summons. It assigns little weight to her testimony that the XXXX police station was a primitive place given that she also testified that she didn't how that police stationed functioned, making her evidence speculative. It finds that the disparity between the documentary evidence which depicts the PSB as being an interconnected and sophisticated police force and the claimant's marginal PSB summons undermines the genuineness of her summons.\nOther considerations\n[79] The panel acknowledges that the claimant's summons is similar to a sample summons found in the documentary evidence, but finds that this similarity is insufficient to ground a conclusion that the summons is genuine. It finds that the samples are merely blank precedents upon which particulars would be thereafter added. It also notes that these blank precedents are widely available to the general public on-line and finds for this reason that the summons format can be easily reproduced without being genuine.\n[80] The panel also considered that the summons contained seals, and a date. It finds that the reliability otherwise imparted by these features is undermined by the concerns noted by the panel. It also considered CHN104579.E when assessing the weight to be given to her summons, which indicates that there are \"consistent reports\" of document fraud in China, and that fraudulent identity documents, are easily obtained there.\n[81] The same report quotes a professor of criminal justice at Xavier University who specializes in Chinese policing as stating that \"[t]here is little question that fraud of all kind[s], including ID fraud, is a major problem in China.\" The panel assigns little weight to her summons for all of these reasons.\nSummons of male claimant\n[82] The male claimant submitted a summons that is very similar to the summons submitted by the female claimant. His summons also indicates that he was accused of slandering the government, and also directs him to surrender himself to the police, but doesn't provide a reporting address or contact information for the issuer. His summons was also allegedly issued by a sub-county police office. The panel notes that the male claimant testified that the female claimant's evidence was correct, and that he accepted it as his own. The panel therefore finds that her explanations applies to similar features found in his summons.\n[83] The panel assigns little weight to the male claimant's summons for the same reasons given with respect to the female claimant's summons with respect to the sophistication of the PSB, and the lack of functionality of his summons. The panel assigns little weight to the male claimant's related allegations that the PSB framed him, as a result of issuing the summons with the slandering charge, given the panel's noted concerns with his summons.\nMarital Status\n[84] The panel finds that it had insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to find that the XXXX had raped, impregnated or harassed the claimant. Nor did it have sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to find that she posted criticism of the XXXX on the internet or that she had been beaten by his henchmen as a result. It finds that her allegation that she lived in Hebei province is undermined by the discrepancy between the information she initially provided at Q.5 of the BOC and her hukou which in turn undermined the genuineness of the hukou, and her allegation that she lived in Hebei.\n[85] The panel found the female claimant to be generally not credible, and to lack subjective fear. It finds that her sworn BOC declaration had little meaning for her as evidenced by her with-holding material information about what she describes as a common law relationship. This with-holding of material information raised concerns for the panel with respect to whether she with-held other information about her marital status as well. The panel finds that the claimant's general lack of credibility extends to the issue of her true marital status.\n[86] Although the decision to marry belongs solely to the claimants, the panel finds that it is nonetheless a decision fully within their control which would prevent the persecution the female claimant alleges she would face as an unmarried, pregnant woman. The female claimant was asked why she and the male claimant didn't get married given their stable, long-term relationship, and the persecution she alleged she would face as an unmarried, pregnant woman. She said the male claimant's mother was in Canada. She said that she and the male claimant are rather traditional and they wanted the parents to be there when they got married to give them their blessing. She said they didn't marry in China because she wasn't pregnant at the time.\n[87] The panel finds that her preference to marry in the presence of the parents in order to obtain their blessing is not a basis for granting refugee protection. It finds that she and the male claimant intend to marry each other, and that she would avoid the persecution she alleges she would face as an unmarried, pregnant woman by becoming married.\nClaimant alleges she is unable to marry in China\n[88] The female claimant said she couldn't marry in China because the Chinese government would not recognize a foreign marriage, and she would need to get a medical exam before marriage, and such an exam would reveal that she was pregnant, and they would force her to abort her child.\n[89] The Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China does not prohibit unwed parents from marrying. Although this law specifically identifies those who are excluded from marriage in Article 7 and Article 10, it does not prohibit pregnant women or parents with children born out of wedlock from marrying. The panel rejects the claimant's allegation that she would not be permitted to marry if she returned to China for these reasons.\n[90] Article 41 of the Population and Family Planning Law of the People's Republic of China 12specifically envisions situations where children are born out of wedlock, and indicates that the penalty for this occurrence is a social maintenance fee. Article 41 states: \"Citizens who give birth to babies not in compliance with the provisions of Article 18 of this Law shall pay a social maintenance fee prescribed by law.\"13 The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, and on the basis if China's legislation, that the penalty that the female claimant would face if she married while pregnant is a fine. It finds that there is no bar to her becoming married while pregnant, and finds that her allegation that she would not be permitted to marry when pregnant is not supported by the documentary evidence.\nFine is standard penalty\n[91] According to the US Department of State (DOS) report, having children out of wedlock is illegal in almost all provinces in China and attracts a social compensation fee.14 The DOS report states: \"It continued to be illegal in almost all provinces for a single woman to have a child, with fines levied for violations. However, \"some local governments continued to mandate abortion for single women who became pregnant.\"15 According to the Australian Report: \"The phrasing of the [DOS] report suggests that having a child out of wedlock may be legal in some provinces of China but it does not say which.\"16\n[92] Although the documentary evidence does not specify the provinces in which it is legal for a single woman to have a child, the preponderance of the country reports indicate that the official sanction for family planning violations, that is for having unapproved children, is a social compensation fee.17 In June 2012, the Economist reported that an independent scholar and critic of the one-child policy had conservatively estimated that over 314 billion dollars had been collected in social maintenance fees since 1980.18 The panel also acknowledges that the documentary evidence indicates that 13 million annually terminated unplanned pregnancies.19 However, statistics on the percentage of all abortions that were non-elective was not available. 20 The panel finds that the high fine amount of fines collected demonstrates the significant extent to which a monetary fine is used as a penalty for family planning violations in China.\n[93] These fees apply to violations such as having a child out of wedlock or having more than the approved number of children.21 Specific guidelines for the collection of social compensation fees are set out in the Measures for Administration of Collection of Social Maintenance Fees. Fees vary according to a number of factors including the province, type of violation, personal income, and average income of the area. 22\nFamily Planning in China\n[94] The 2002 national family planning legislation establishes national principles and standards for family planning.23 It devolves power over the implementation of family planning policy to provincial and county level governments. Other sub-provincial governments: prefectures, counties, and townships, may also have their own local family planning regulations.24 Family planning regulations vary between provinces and enforcement can also vary by locality. 25\nForced abortion and sterilization are illegal in China\n[95] Sources report that a spokesperson for the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) held a press conference in January 2014 and advised media that forced late-term abortions are \"banned\" in China as is the \"enforcement of family planning policy carried out in a brutal way\".26\n[96] In correspondence with the IRB Research Directorate in January 2015, an associate professor at Oxford University who specializes in population and policy in Asia stated that a 2006 National Health and Family Planning Policy regulation states that \"forced operations\" such as abortion and sterilization are banned.27 In the summer of 2012, the National Population and Planning Commission of China issued a directive to all family planning committees prohibiting forced abortion and forced sterilizations. 28 The panel acknowledges that other sources indicate that there is no \"specific\" 2012 directive banning forced abortion and sterilization, but rather a \"restatement of the illegality of forced abortion.\" 29 The panel considered these conflicting reports and finds that there is credible documentary evidence which indicates that forced abortions and sterilizations are illegal as a matter of national policy in China.\n[97] The panel acknowledges that the documentary evidence indicate that, in some instances, local officials coerce women to have abortions or undergo sterilization to enforce family planning policies.30 The panel finds that these family planning officials act illegally and outside of the ambit of the national law. As noted, the implementation of national policy is delegated to provincial and subordinate level governments, and enforcement can vary by locality. As noted by Freedom House, compulsory abortion and sterilization still occur, but \"less frequently than in the past.\"31\nRemedial Measures\n[98] At least 22 of China's 31 provincial-level family planning regulations, including Hebei, \"explicitly instruct officials to implement abortions, often referred to as 'remedial measures' for out-of-plan pregnancies, with no apparent requirement\" for consent.32 Some local governments continued to mandate abortion for single women who became pregnant,\" 33 while other provinces and localities imposed fines of various amounts on unwed mothers. 34 Regulations requiring single women who violate family-planning policy to terminate their pregnancies still existed and were enforced in eight provinces including Hebei. 35 The panel acknowledges that the above-noted legislation is still on record in China. However, it finds that all provinces and subordinate governments in China are required to follow the national family planning policies and directives, and that coercive measures, including forced abortions and sterilizations, are illegal.\nFamily Planning policy applied to claimants\n[99] Although the panel acknowledges that some local governments continued to mandate abortion for single women who became pregnant in Hebei, the panel did not have credible evidence to find that all local and provincial governments in Hebei mandate abortion for single women or that this is the standard approach to unwed mothers in Hebei province. Information on the treatment of unmarried women who bear children is difficult to find except in provincial family planning regulations.36\n[100] The finds, on a balance of probabilities, and on the basis of the documentary evidence that the standard penalty for single mothers who have out of plan children in China is a fine although some local governments in Hebei mandate abortion for single women. The panel finds that it lacked sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to find that the female claimant would be forcibly aborted on the basis of being unmarried and pregnant should she return to China.\n[101] In the alternative, the panel finds that if the claimants are not married, they have the legal ability to marry in China even though the claimant is pregnant. As noted, the female claimant testified that she and the male claimant intend to marry. The panel finds given this intention, and their legal ability to marry in China, that their marriage would resolve the female claimant's alleged fear of persecution on the basis of being unmarried and pregnant given that she would no longer be unmarried.\nFine is standard penalty\n[102] When asked to comment on the documentary evidence which indicates that a fine is the standard penalty for having children out of wedlock, the claimant denied this was the penalty she would face. However, the preponderance of the documentary evidence indicates that the penalty the claimants would face for having a child born out of wedlock is a fine. Whether or not social compensation fees are waived if couples marry after the birth of a child varies by province.37\n[103] The panel finds that a fine, either for being pregnant and unmarried or for being parents of a child born out of wedlock, is not persecutory. It finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants could afford to pay a fine given their ability to pay for their European vacation, their travel to Hawaii and the United States for XXXX weeks before arriving in Canada, as well as their young age and relatively high level of education within the work force. Specific guidelines for the collection of social compensation fees are set out in the Measures for Administration of Collection of Social Maintenance Fees. Fees vary according to a number of factors including the province, type of violation, personal income, and average income of the area.38\n[104] The documentary evidence also indicates that there is evidence to suggest that officials may exercise their discretion when calculating the fine.39 In the alternative, the panel notes that the claimant initially misrepresented her marital status in her BOC, and finds that it did not have credible and trustworthy evidence to find that the claimant is unmarried and therefore allegedly at risk of persecution.\nConsequences for inability to pay a fine\n[105] Counsel raised the issue of what penalty the claimants would face if they could not pay a fine. The documentary evidence indicates:\n[106] \"Under national law, offenders have 30 days to pay via lump sum after being served notice by local authorities. Those unable to pay in a lump sum have 30 days to apply for approval to pay in instalments to the family planning administrative department of the people's government at the county level. The county level family planning unit should then decide the outcome within 30 days of receiving the application and notify the person in writing. 40\n[107] The national law also states that individuals who fail to pay on time are penalised with a surcharge fine on a monthly basis at the rate of 0.2 percent of the unpaid social maintenance fee, and those who persist in not paying face the possibility that the family planning administrative department could file an application with the people's court for compulsory enforcement according to law.\"41 The number of instalments permitted for payment of social compensation fees varies between provinces.42 The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the official penalty, and the provisions therein, is the one the claimants would face should they not be able to pay a fine.\n[108] The panel acknowledges that the documentary evidence indicates that officials use various methods of punishment of enforce citizen's compliance with population planning policies including detention.43 However, these detentions were found to be illegal and the offending officials were investigated and punished.44 There are reports of authorities using other punitive measures as punishment for breaching family planning regulations. According to the US Department of State's 2012 report on China, family planning officials can detain family members or confiscate and destroy property of families who refuse to pay social compensation fees. However, the panel finds on the basis of the preponderance of the documentary evidenfce, that the penalty the claimants would face if they breached China's family planning policies, and were unable to pay a fine, is an instalment plan for payment and interest on the unpaid fine.\nDiscrimination\n[109] The panel acknowledges that higher fines are imposed on single mothers for out-of-plan births in comparison to married couples.45 It finds that higher fines for unmarried mothers is discriminatory, but finds that this discrimination does not rise to the level of persecution.\n[110] The panel notes that married couples are now permitted as a matter of national policy46 to have two children without penalty in China. This change in China's law does not apply to single women or unmarried couples who are required to pay a fine for having an unauthorized child outside of family planning policies. Although the panel finds that this distinction between unmarried and married parents in China, in the context of recent family planning reform, is discriminatory, it finds that this discrimination does not rise to the level of persecution\n[111] Although remedial measures continue to exist as regulations in various provinces in China, the panel finds that forced abortion and sterilization is illegal, and that the standard and official approach in China is a fine.\nSocial Stigmatization\n[112] Sources indicate that unmarried parents, particularly young single mothers, may experience social stigmatization in China.47 The panel finds that these discriminatory attitudes to single mothers in China does not rise to the level of persecution. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, and for all of these reasons given that the claimants would not face persecution on the basis of family planning issues should she return to China.\nSize of Family\n[113] The claimant testified that she wanted to have several children if she returned to China. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, and on the basis of the documentary evidence that if the claimant is married, she is entitled to have two children as of right. The panel notes that China's 2-child policy is a fairly recent reform48 and not much is yet known about how it will be implemented.\n[114] Existing documentary evidence indicates that the standard penalty for exceeding the 1-child policy was a fine. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the previous standard penalty for exceeding the 1-child policy will likely continue with respect to the 2-child policy until China indicates otherwise. This finding is supported by national laws and provincial regulations, as noted in this decision, which address the issue of unauthorized births.\n[115] The panel finds that the quantum of the fine for additional births would depend on a number of factors described in the documentary evidence49, including whether or not the claimant is married. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities and on the basis of the documentary evidence, that the penalty the claimant would face if she chose to have more children, either as a married or unmarried woman, is a fine.\nMonitoring of Reproductive Rights\n[116] The claimant testified that she believed mandatory family planning monitoring would place higher restrictions on her. She said women of a certain age, although she didn't know what age, would be forced to insert an IUD.\n[117] Mandatory gynaecological checks of women of child bearing age by family planning officials have been part of China's family planning policy since at least the 1990s.50 During these checks held annually, semi-annually, or even quarterly, medical personnel check for reproductive health problems, monitor contraceptive use, and detect unauthorised pregnancies. The U.S. Department of State reported in May 2012 that in 2011, some provinces fined women who did not undergo periodic pregnancy tests, but did not provide information on the size of the fines that had been imposed.\"51\n[118] According to a 2010 report published by Chinese Human Rights Defenders52, the frequency of gynaecological tests, including pregnancy checks, varies locally and depends on the woman, for example, whether she has been sterilized or is approaching the end of her childbearing years. This report also indicates that women who fail to appear for tests within the specified period could be punished by the local government. Although this report does not list the range of punishments, it does provide the example of an individual's land being confiscated for failing to return in 2001, when summoned by the local government in Anhui province, to have his wife tested for pregnancy.\n[119] According to the UN Population Fund, 53 87 percent of married couples used contraception but contraception use was significantly lower in unmarried relationships. Among married couples, 72 percent used a reversible method of contraception. Only 1.2 percent of women took oral contraceptives.\n[120] The panel finds, on the basis of the documentary evidence, that not all citizens in China use birth control, and that those who do use a variety of methods. It finds that although gynaecological checking is invasive and a violation of privacy, it finds that this practise does not rise to the level of persecution. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, and on the basis of the preponderance of the country reports, that if the claimant faced a penalty for not attending mandatory check-ups, that the penalty she would face is a fine.\n[121] The panel finds that it has insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to find that the claimant, as an unmarried mother, would face more restrictive family planning monitoring. However, it finds that the claimant, should this occur, would experience discrimination which does not rise to the level of persecution\nClaim of Male Claimant\n[122] The male claimant said he worked as a XXXX in a XXXX in China XXXX XXXX. He alleged that he discovered that the XXXX was selling `fake medicine`, which could potentially poison others, and that he was fired and targeted for this reason.\nBOC Omission - XXXX and claimant`s director involved in drug scam\n[123] The claimant was asked why he attracted the significant attention he alleged in his BOC, with respect to his concerns about the drugs, given that he was merely a XXXX in a XXXX. He said it was because he discovered that the XXXX had been selling fake medication, and it had occurred before. He said that the medication did not have the name of the manufacturer or the date of manufacture, and the print on the package was blurry, and because of that, he went to his director in the XXXX. The claimant said it was because he was the one who discovered that the XXXX and his director did it together, and because of that, he was dismissed.\n[124] He was asked when he said that the XXXX and his director did it together, whether he meant the pharmacy scam. He said yes. He was asked why he didn't mention this information which led to his dismissal, in his BOC. He said because when he was writing his BOC, the consultant said that he should summarize and so he didn't go into such detail.\n[125] The panel rejects this explanation. It finds that his allegation that both his director and the XXXX collaborated to sell fake drugs as part of a drug scam, and that the selling of fake drugs had occurred before are material allegations, given that this information is relevant to the reasons for his persecution.\n[126] The panel rejects his explanation that he was told to summarize information, and so he didn't go into detail given that the materiality of the omitted information. It finds, on a balance of probabilities, and on the basis of the materiality of the omitted allegations, and in the absence of a reasonable explanation for these omissions, that the claimant fabricated his evidence that the XXXX and his director collaborated to sell fake drugs and that the XXXX had sold fake drugs before.\n[127] These findings undermine the claimant`s credibility. They also undermine his related allegations that the director engaged in corrupt practices involving the sale of fake drugs, and that the claimant was beaten and threatened not to reveal information about the \"problematic medicine\" at the XXXX.\nMale Claimant`s Dismissal letter\n[128] The claimant submitted a dismissal letter from the XXXX indicating that he had violated XXXX regulations during his employment and that it had severely impacted the regular operations of the XXXX. The claimant said that this was the reason they found to dismiss him.\n[129] The panel acknowledges the claimant said that his superiors wouldn`t state in his dismissal letter he was fired because he found out that the XXXX was selling fake medicine. However, it finds that the letter itself, as written, does not support his allegations that he was fired for comments he made about the sale of fake drugs in the XXXX.\n[130] Nor does the dismissal letter identify the name of who wrote the letter or their position. The claimant was asked if he wished to comment. He said that the letter contained the name of the work unit and a seal. He said that in China, to have a seal is the most important part. The hearing room interpreter indicated that the seal on this letter states: XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\n[131] The panel acknowledges that the words \"XXXX XXXX XXXX\" appear at the bottom of the letter. However, it finds that this information does not indicate who wrote the letter or what position the writer held, if any. The panel acknowledges that an address and phone number appear at the bottom of this letter.. However, it finds that the reliability otherwise imparted by a seal and contact information is undermined by the absence of information about the identity of writer and their position. The panel assigns little weight to the dismissal letter for these reasons.\nDetention Certificate\n[132] The claimant alleged in his BOC that he was detained in XXXX 2015 for 7 days after going to the XXXX after he was fired. He said at that time that he had hung up a scroll and shouted that the XXXX sold fake medicine to patients. He submitted a detention certificate in support of this allegation. The certificate indicates that the claimant was detained for disrupting the social order and slandering government. The bottom of the certificate states: \"Stamped and issued by the Public Security Bureau of XXXX XXXX XXXX District Sub Division\".\n[133] The original of the certificate has a fill in the blank format. The panel acknowledges that the Certificate has a file number, and contains the name and date of birth of the claimant. However, the certificate does not provide contact information for the issuer, nor does it indicate who filled out the information found in the certificate or who processed the detention. The claimant said that this was what was given to him.\n[134] The panel acknowledges that the certificate contains a seal. However, it finds that the reliability otherwise imparted by the seal is undermined by the absence of contact information for the issuer and the absence of any information with respect to who filled in the information found in the document or who processed the claimant during his alleged detention. The panel assigns little weight to the certificate for these reasons. The panel finds that it had insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to find that the claimant was detained by the PSB.\nChristianity\n[135] The claimant's mother was accepted as a refugee in Canada in 2011 according to Q.6 of the male claimant's BOC. He alleges in his BOC that \"my family had difficulties with the authorities because of my mother's problems. She is a Christian who practiced at an underground church that was raided in XXXX 2010 and she had to flee the country.\" He states in his BOC that subsequently, the \"PSB searched for her and harassed my family.\"\n[136] The claimant was asked if either he or his wife were Christians. He said no. The panel noted for him that he stated at Q.1(f) of his BOC that he was a Christian. He said that the consultant who helped his mother also assumed that he was a Christian. He said he corrected it when he found out about it.\n[137] The male claimant was asked whether he or his wife were harassed by the Chinese authorities because of his mother's religion. He said yes. He was asked when this happened. He said it had been a long time, and he couldn`t recall. He said he last saw his mother in 2010, and he was harassed after that time. He said that they would frequently come to his home, looking for his mother, and threatened them, and did not let them conceal any information about her.\n[138] He was asked why he didn`t mention in his BOC that the authorities had threatened them on the basis of his mother`s religion. He said the story was a simplified one, so that's why it wasn't written in it. He confirmed that he feared that the PSB would threaten him because of his mother`s religion should he return to China.\n[139] The panel acknowledged that the claimant states in his BOC that the authorities `harassed his family\" and that he had \"difficulties with the authorities because of my mother's problems\". However, he does not mention in his BOC that he was threatened by the PSB in relation to his mother's problems. The panel finds a threat to the claimant is more than harassment or the alleged search by authorities for his mother.\n[140] Although the panel acknowledges that the claimant's mother received a positive determination from the Board on the basis of her Christianity, it notes that she did not submit evidence or attend the hearing to provide testimony in support of either claim.\n[141] The panel finds it reasonable to expect that if the PSB threatened the claimant, in relation to his mother's faith, that he would include this material information in his BOC. It rejects his explanation that his story was simplified, and that he didn't include it for this reason given the materiality of the omission. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, and on the basis of the materiality of the omission, and in the absence of a reasonable explanation, that the claimant fabricated his evidence that the authorities had threatened him in relation to his mother's faith. This finding undermines his credibility, and his related allegations that he and his family were harassed by the PSB in relation to his mother's faith.\n[142] The panel finds that it had insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to find that the director and XXXX conspired to commit a drug scam or that the claimant was beaten, arrested, detained and otherwise mistreated him as a result of allegedly being a whistle-blower. Nor does it find that it had sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to find that the authorities searched or threatened him with respect to his mother's religion, or sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to support his other allegations.\nCONCLUSION\n[143] The panel considered all three protection grounds under sections 96 and 97(1) of IRPA and, considered the totality of the evidence cumulatively. It finds that both claimants were generally not credible. It finds that their credibility was undermined by misrepresentation, material BOC omissions and discrepancies for which they were unable to provide reasonable explanations. It finds that the claimants lacked subjective fear as evidenced in their failure to claim refugee status in the numerous countries they visited while on vacation in 2015, and their reavailment to China.\n[144] While none of the credibility concerns raised may be sufficient, each on their own to negate the claim, the cumulative effect of all of them is that the panel did not have sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence upon which to base a determination that the claimants are Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. For these reasons, the claims are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"N. Cassano\"\nN.

He states that he has been targeted by extremists who extorted money from him, labelled him an atheist and made offensive pronouncements about his involvement in demonstrations supporting harsh punishment for extremists being tried by Bangladesh's War Crimes' Tribunal. He further states that he has not been able to secure domestic State protection and the police refused to assist him. He alleges that he endured a campaign of extortion and threats for years until XXXX 2016 when he was kidnapped. He fears that were he to return to Bangladesh, he would continue to be targeted by the extremists who would seriously harm or kill him because of his opposition to them and failure to accede to their demands for his support.\nDETERMINATION\n[2] I determine the claimant not to be a Convention refugee or a person in need of Canada's protection. The evidence in areas crucial to the claim lacks credibility. It has not been established on sufficient reliable evidence and on the balance of probabilities that the claimant has the persecutory experience and campaign of threats and intimidation alleged in the claim. It has not been established that, were he to return to Bangladesh, there is a serious possibility that he would be persecuted for any Convention reason. It has not been established that there is in Bangladesh a risk to his life, a risk of cruel and unusual punishment or treatment, or danger of torture.\n[3] Additionally, there is no credible basis to the claim.\nANALYSIS\n[4] The claimant is a 38-year old high school graduate with what he described as approximately one and a half years of post-high school studies. He states that he is married and has two children. His wife and daughter live together and his son from a previous marriage lives in Australia with his mother.\n[5] In confusing inconsistent testimony, the claimant stated that his wife, daughter and he continued to live in their rented family home in XXXX until XXXX 2016 when he took them to XXXX to his wife's parents' house. He testified that he and his current wife had moved on some three occasions before this time to get into better areas. He stated that his wife and daughter live in much fear at his wife's parents' house because they are concerned that the JMB could go there to look for him and the JMB could harm them. He stated that his wife and daughter did not go to her parents' house to hide before XXXX 2016 because \"I did not have problems before\". He was asked if his previous business and personal extortion problems were separate from the JMB problems, to which he replied in the negative, confirming \"JMB\". The question was repeated for his benefit and he responded again in the negative. To ensure that the claimant understood the important question, he was asked whether he experienced the same problem and he replied in the affirmative. He further confirmed that the people who were extorting him in the past and to whom he paid some money were the JMB. The claimant confirmed that he fears no one else in Bangladesh, except the JMB who would be described as Islamic fundamentalist terrorists.\n[6] The claimant testified that he started fearing that this group could do harm to him personally in XXXX 2013. His description of the JMB depicted the group as a menacing, torturing set of extremists who had a sophisticated and influential network. He further alleges that the JMB would find him and harm him anywhere in Bangladesh. By contrast, however, he explained that his on site business manager at a XXXX store in XXXX he called XXXX XXXX, who began working at the store in 2012 at the time of its establishment, has not experienced any problems with the JMB because of the claimant. When asked why this was so, and whether he was surprised that the manager had not been harmed by the group, he responded that he did not know. He added that it was because the group does not know that he has a business there. When the claimant was asked if he was stating that the group did not know that he had established and run his business since 2012 in XXXX, he confirmed that this was so.\n[7] The claimant stated that he made an initial payment of 20,000 Taka and altogether paid 70,000 Taka. He testified that his manager has never been demanded any money by the group. When the claimant was asked why he believed that JMB had not been able to determine that he had been running a business in XXXX since 2012, he responded that it is because he still lived in XXXX and did not live in XXXX; he added that his manager used to look after the business in XXXX. He confirmed that the JMB do not research business records, licences, tax information and the like in order to find out what their intended extortion targets have and where they are located. He did confirm though that the JMB operate throughout Bangladesh.\n[8] The claimant testified that he was beaten and intimidated and then ultimately kidnapped on XXXX XXXX, 2016. He testified that before this day, he did not begin to think that his life could be in danger and explained that he did not think that things would get that far. He further elaborated that he had such a presumption because he was doing business and the group members would come to extort him and he would have to pay in order to continue to do business. The claimant testified that he continued to run a XXXX XXXX business in XXXX until 2016 and then stopped running the business in XXXX 2016 when he was kidnapped. He testified that at that time that business shut down.\n[9] The claimant testified that the JMB had become more and more powerful over recent years since his first contact with them in 2013. Since that time he has known that the group is a violent force that he confirms that the group did not ever stop being interested in him. He was therefore asked why he did not fear for his life at their hands until XXXX 2016 when he alleges he was kidnapped by them. He responded that he had thought at that time that they would come for extortion money so if he paid them they would calm down and leave him alone. He did not think that they would gradually become so cruel toward him. He was asked if in 2013 there was any threat to his personal security; he responded affirmatively. He was further asked if he took what the JMB said to him in 2013 as a death threat, namely, that if he did not pay the funds demanded he would be killed. He explained that he did not think so far at that time. He was asked what he did think the group would do if he did not accede to their financial demands. He responded that he thought that perhaps they would harm him in some way, but he did not think they would kill him. I reject the claimant's testimony, assertion and explanations in these important areas of the claim and find that the claimant has not established on sufficient reliable evidence that this menacing fundamentalist group has had the persecutory interest and campaign against him that he alleges.\n[10] If such a group had ever targeted the claimant for the extortion and other demands that he refers to, then more likely than not, he would have had a serious fear for his personal security and for his life long before XXXX 2016 when he alleges he was kidnapped by the group's members. In my view, based on the evidence viewed in its totality, I find that the claimant has attempted to, but not succeeded in, explaining away his several trips out of Bangladesh between XXXX 2013 and XXXX 2016 following which trips he returned each time to Bangladesh.\n[11] After a trip to Canada in or around XXXX 2013, the claimant returned to Canada four times including this current trip when he made his refugee claim. He also travelled to India for some 11 days on a visitor visa and stated that he did so when his sister's husband was ill and went with him for his treatment. The claimant testified that he had applied for visas to the U.K. twice and been denied both times. He stated that the U.K. Government cited insufficient funds as reasons for the denials. He testified that he applied for a Canadian visa only once and had received a multiple entry visa. He testified that he applied for the Canadian visa in XXXX 2013, some seven months before what appears to be the commencement of the campaign of mistreatment by the JMB against him.\n[12] The claimant stated that he applied for the Canadian visa in 2013 because he was associated with a group created to demand the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXfor war crimes. He corrected himself and stated that he applied for the Canadian visa in XXXX 2013 because on the XXXX XXXX XXXX, 2013, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who was a blogger, had been attacked by Islamic extremists in front of his home and hacked to death.\n[13] The claimant added that because of this, many in the movement were afraid, as was he, and he then contacted an agent regarding leaving the country. The claimant was asked at his hearing if he requested a Canadian visa from the agent; he responded affirmatively adding that this was because Canada is a humanitarian country and values human beings.\n[14] The claimant asserted that the purpose of his first trip to Canada was to ensure his own safety from the JMB and to be free of its extortion; it was also to assess the condition of Bangladesh from afar in Canada and to determine if the situation would improve. If it did improve, he thought, he would return to Bangladesh. His first response to the question as to his purpose in coming to Canada the first time was that \"After I came here I was not worried\". This was confusing testimony and the claimant was conferred opportunities to explain and elaborate on his thought process at times material to the allegations in the claim.\n[15] The claimant was asked what sort of change he wanted to watch for from Canada. He responded that following the murder of XXXX in XXXX 2013, he was observing the situation from Canada to see whether there were any other murders that would take place. He was reminded that he had already testified that his fears in Bangladesh were limited to the JMB and he again confirmed that this was so.\n[16] He clarified that he was afraid of Islamic extremist violence against the XXXX XXXX XXXX and in this connection the group he was afraid of were the JMB terrorists, the ones who kidnapped and beat him.\n[17] In my view, the claimant has not established that he began to fear for his personal security in 2013 as alleged. If he had developed such a fear of a group he described as highly violent, then more likely than not particularly with his opportunities for international travel, he would have made attempts to seek international or at least domestic hiding temporarily or permanently. The claimant has not established that the reasons he came to Canada on multiple occasions related in any way to any campaign against him or those he alleges he was associated with by the JMB or other extremist group. What supports this conclusion, in my view, is that the claimant was not able to adequately explain, in my view, why his wife and daughter had not also applied for visas to any country during periods of allegedly intense fear and risk. His responses in this regard included statements that they have not tried, just because and I don't know. His responses also clearly suggested that he did not start fearing for his wife and daughter's personal security until after he was allegedly kidnapped in XXXX 2016; he stated, for example, that that was when he started worrying about his family.\n[18] He testified that he came to Canada the first time in 2013, for around five and a half months. He stated that apart from assessing the country conditions of Bangladesh from afar, he also looked into what kind of businesses could be conducted in Canada. He stated that he contacted people over the phone with respect to business in connection with his first trip to Canada. He gave examples of what types of businesses he looked into. These included XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX. He also testified that one of the purposes of his staying in Canada during the first trip was that \"I was stress free\".\n[19] The claimant's second trip to Canada was also for about five and a half months, in XXXX 2014. He stated that the purpose of that trip to Canada was the same. The claimant distinguished the purpose of this trip in that he stated that since he had been threatened with a pistol in his office in intervening between the trips to Canada, he was even more scared so he came for security. He was asked if a pistol had ever been pointed or shown to him before this time and he responded in the negative. When asked why then he was not fearful for his life at this time, he responded that he was fearful for his life. He was reminded that he had kept testifying that he did not start fearing for his life until after he was kidnapped in XXXX 2016. He explained that even that time he thought since he had given the group 50,000 Taka and they left the scene, it would not be a problem again. In my view, this was not a reasonable or adequate explanation for the important credibility concern that was put to him for contempt in his comment.\n[20] He added that the second trip to Canada was also meant to keep him safe from the hands of the JMB and its extortion. This and other allegations made by the claimant, in my view, remained sharply inconsistent with his testimony that he feared neither for his wife or daughter at any time until XXXX 2016, nor did his on-site manager at his alleged business sustain any form of harm at the hands of the JMB in the claimant's absence or presence. In my view, the claimant's allegations and assertions are contextually unembedded. The claimant's assertions, explanations and allegations are tantamount to the position that only he was at risk of serious harm at the hands of JMB, not others closely associated with him and located at the very site of alleged persecution and extortion and that only he had to seek temporary international hiding but not for any fear for his life until an alleged kidnapping in XXXX 2016. The claimant's risk profile is of course also to be assessed in keeping with his travel and visa applications before commencement of the alleged JMB campaign and his clearly non-refugee motivations in undertaking travel for multiple months at a time, then exploring business opportunities at times highly material to the alleged campaign experience, risk and fear.\n[21] In my view, based on a close examination of all the evidence and submissions, it has not been established on the balance of probabilities that the claimant's travel to Canada and his current claim have had anything more than a private purpose; it has not been established that the claimant is a forced migrant to Canada.\n[22] The claimant's allegations that during his second trip to Canada he did not look into business opportunities because he had become quite weak and was worried because the JMB had been coming to him a lot are not reliable on the balance of probabilities. The claimant was asked if he had received any kind of medical assistance whether in Bangladesh or Canada right to the time of the hearing in connection with the allegedly protracted violent campaign against him. He responded in the negative explaining that at that time he did not have much time. He then added that it was because he did not need it, and might need to go for medical assistance now because he was feeling very nervous and ill and he was very worried now for his wife and child. His explanation in this regard culminated in the statement that he was feeling \"gradually sick\". Although this type of gradual illness can indeed follow the forms and degrees of mistreatment the claimant has alleged occurred in his life, he has not established on sufficient reliable evidence and on the balance of probabilities that he himself has been subject to these forms or degrees of mistreatment.\n[23] The claimant came to Canada again in XXXX 2015 and remained in Canada for almost six months. He states that he had no relatives in Canada during times material to these trips. He explained that the purpose of this third trip to Canada was to come and stay and get some relief from the JMB and its extortion. Very confusingly and contradictorily, he added that he came \"because of business\" but appeared to be suggesting that the main reason for his trip to Canada was to save himself. He testified that he decided to leave Bangladesh not permanently because he had a wife, daughter and businesses, and his parents in Bangladesh were old. He added that he never thought that he would live in Canada permanently. The claimant testified that \"they beat me a lot\"; in these circumstances, it has not been explained and established why the claimant did not receive any form of medical assistance at any time even up to the date of his hearing.\n[24] Although the claimant testified that over the course of these three trips to Canada, he attended mosque often, several times a day, for three of the five daily prayers and would chat with fellow mosque goers, he told no one in Canada about his fears in Bangladesh. He explained that this was because of what people would think. He added that he did not know how people would respond to his hiding in Canada and feared that people might gossip that it was a weakness that he was afraid of the JMB. Then the claimant was asked again whether over three trips to Canada he did not tell even one person about his problems and fears in Bangladesh, he changed his testimony and responded affirmatively. He testified that he told one or two people, and that he also asked them not to tell anyone else. He testified that he did not ask anyone about Canada's refugee process as he never even thought about this; he had a good business, a wife and a child. He denied even having ever heard or learned about Canada's refugee process over all his time in Canada and stated that he never asked about this.\n[25] The claimant made his fourth trip to Canada in XXXX 2016. He testified that his purpose in coming to Canada at this time was that he had been kidnapped by the JMB. He added that he was supposed to come to Canada before the kidnapping anyway and that the plan was that he would come to Canada like he had done before and leave again. He added that because he was kidnapped, he thought he would come to Canada and claim refugee status and if his claim were accepted, he would bring his wife and daughter to Canada.\n[26] He was asked if he knew, before arriving in Canada this time, that he was coming to Canada to claim its refugee protection. He answered affirmatively. When he was asked how he would know this before his flight to Canada, he explained that he thought he could find out about the refugee process from the Bengali Consulate in Canada and how to claim refugee status. When his response was confusing given that he had not yet made his trip to Canada and he was alleging that he was intending to come to Canada the fourth time in order to claim Canada's refugee protection, he responded that when he spoke to his wife she told him that she had heard that Canada was a humanitarian country and he could claim refugee status in Canada.\n[27] The claimant was asked when he first stated to a Canadian official his intention to seek Canada's refugee protection. He responded that this was after he came to Canada the fourth time and talked to the Bengali Consulate and found out how he could claim refugee status. He alleged that it was staff at the Consulate that told him about various lawyers. The claimant stated that he forgets many things nowadays because he feels very hopeless. The question needed to be repeated one more time, and then he was prompted with the month when he may have first stated his intention to make a refugee claim in Canada. He stated that on May 25th, he stated his intention to a Canadian official that he wished to make a refugee claim in Canada, and spoke to his lawyer.\n[28] The claimant's Basis of Claim form, one of several important documents that initiate a refugee claim, was signed on July 8th, 2016. Although the claimant was not out of legal status in Canada at the time he filed his refugee claim in July 2016, it has not been adequately explained why there was a delay of up to two months, between early May and early July, in advancing his refugee claim. More significantly, however, it has not been satisfactorily explained why the claimant failed to assert his intention to seek Canada's refugee protection when he arrived at the Canadian port of entry in XXXX 2016. His conduct in misrepresenting his purpose in coming to Canada at this time at the port of entry has not been demonstrated to have been in keeping with his own alleged fear and experience, including extensive travel experience and degree of acculturation and knowledge in Canada.\n[29] It is not plausible, in my view, that this claimant with his particular experience and particular circumstances did not know that he could make a refugee claim in Canada and do so by openly declaring his need for Canada's protection immediately upon arrival at the Canadian port of entry in XXXX 2016. The visa he had in his possession enabled him to come to Canada on multiple occasions and most importantly the most recent occasion; the claimant's use of this visa to enter Canada holding himself out as a visitor to the country, whether for business or other personal reasons, has not been shown to have been reasonable in all the circumstances or consistent with his alleged claim. In my view, the claimant's failure to make his refugee claim at the port of entry on his most recent trip to Canada, and his short but material delay of several weeks thereafter in going into an inland immigration office and asserting his plea for Canada's refugee protection in his allegedly dire and serious circumstances, has been conduct inconsistent with that of a person having the fear, risk and experience set out in his own claim.\n[30] I am not satisfied that the claimant has been a forced temporary or permanent migrant to Canada in that his own declarations, testimony and actions at times and in areas highly material to his claim have been inconsistent with the claim.\n[31] I find the claimant to be an untrustworthy witness in the proceeding. His responses and testimony vacillated, expanded and waived in significant areas of the claim; he was unresponsive and indirect in important areas of the examination. And on a close and comprehensive examination of his circumstances, it is my view that the quality of his declarations, testimony and explanations are not adequately and sufficiently explained by any health circumstances, limited education, intermediation of interpretation at the hearing, or by virtue of nervousness or stress from the hearing process, or any combination of these factors. Although each or all of these factors can and are realities for claimants, in the particular circumstances and case of this claimant, I find that it has not been established that these factors even cumulatively explain the significant evidentiary discrepancies arising in the claim and the conduct of the claimant at times material to the claim.\n[32] The claimant testified that each time he came to Canada he cited business purposes for his trips. He explained that otherwise officers would not let him into the country. When asked whether his declarations at the port of entry in this regard were truthful, he responded in the negative, explaining that he was coming to Canada to save himself from extortionists. When asked why he did not say that this was the reason he was coming to Canada in that he had heard of Canada's humanitarian nature and had made three previous trips and lived in Canada each time for several months, he asserted that he did not know that one could claim refugee status at the airport. He was asked if he made inquiries in this regard with the immigration officer at the airport. He responded in the negative stating that he did not know; he added that it was because he was afraid that the officer would send him back. He stated that he did not know that one could make inquiries at the airport and was \"just afraid\"; \"I didn't know\". Further on in the examination, he testified that on his fourth trip to Canada, he asked a lot of Bengalis in Canada how to claim refugee status. When asked why he did not make such inquiries with Bengalis in Canada on his second or third trip out of precaution, he responded that back then his problem was not so big.\n[33] When describing the penultimate kidnapping event of XXXX 2016, the claimant provided a description. The claimant testified that he was kept at a place overnight. When it was clear that his oral testimony in this important area of the claim departed significantly from his Basis of Claim form written declarations, he was asked if this was stated in his Basis of Claim form. He responded \"I said it in brief\". The question was repeated to him and he responded that he was sure he did put in such a declaration. To assist the panel, his counsel submitted that he did not see such a declaration in the claimant's Basis of Claim form narrative. It was explained to the claimant that the way his Basis of Claim form read, he was alleging that the kidnappers placed him in the vehicle and then pushed him off; there is no indication in the written narrative of an overnight detention. He repeated that the kidnappers took him to their den and added that they beat him and kept him there. He continued his description and alleged that they started beating him \"again\". In my view, the evidentiary discrepancy by way of the omission in the Basis of Claim form of an overnight kidnapping and detention has not been adequately overcome; in my view, if the claimant had been detained overnight, more likely than not, he, a represented claimant, would have added such an allegation even briefly in his written narrative. The claimant's expanding allegation in this important area of the claim undermines his reliability as a witness and contributes to the conclusion that there has been established no credible basis to the claim.\n[34] With respect to the delay in filing his Basis of Claim form and making his refugee claim in Canada, the claimant explained that there were steps needed to complete the Basis of Claim form and other immigration forms. He explained that he also had to bring a lot of documents from Bangladesh and for that reason a lot of time passed. He added that there was a delay and that he and counsel met at least eight to 10 times between their first visit in May and the filing of the forms. The claimant was asked if he could explain why those appointments took place over six weeks and not more quickly. He responded that during that time it was Ramadan and sometimes he would feel sick; sometimes he could not do full statements and this kind of work takes him a lot of time. He then continued to expand his explanation that at that time he used to feel sick often and felt like his heart rate was faster. He added that often he had headaches and he would think of the situation back home concerning his wife and child. The claimant stated that all personal documents relating to his refugee claim were sent to him from Bangladesh and he did not bring any documents with him to Canada. He explained that this was because he left in such a way that his papers were all in the rental home in XXXX and he only went to XXXX to go to the airport.\n[35] He testified that an assistant from his company brought the documents to his wife and she was afraid to go anywhere. Among the personal corroboration is digital photographic evidence the claimant said was taken by his friend; he alleges that it shows him within the context of the activities of the XXXX XXXX XXXX Movement. In my view, this document does not establish, either by itself or in conjunction with the balance of the evidence properly before me, that the claimant is at risk of serious harm in Bangladesh at the hands of any agent. Similarly, a letter from his friend, in my view, demonstrates, more likely than not, that the friend wrote information requested by the claimant; the claimant has an interest in the outcome of his proceeding as would his friend, a person obviously closely associated to him. Furthermore, the document is neither an affidavit nor a sworn declaration, it is a letter. It has not been established on sufficient reliable evidence and on the balance of probabilities that the letter emanates from the person the claimant alleges it came from. The claimant has been an untrustworthy witness in the proceeding.\n[36] Although counsel submitted and attempted to explain for the claimant that the claimant supplied a letter from his friend, and not an affidavit, because this is what his counsel requested him to obtain, this information is in the nature of submissions only and it was not provided as evidence. Accordingly, I am unable to find that there has been put before the division any reliable, acceptable evidence to help establish that the claimant's inability or choice to put before the Board an affidavit has been adequately or reasonably explained; at best, in my view, the contents of the letter are to be accorded only as much weight as the evidence supplied by the claimant himself orally and in his BOC.\n[37] The claimant's complaints to the police, including any in writing, were his own. No documentation has been placed before the division emanating directly from the police confirming any independent or other witnesses, or statements provided by persons other than the claimant himself. Again, it is my view that such personal corroboration is to be assessed bearing in mind the unreliability of the claimant himself as the source of the information. I am not satisfied, accordingly, that the claimant has put before the division any reliable documentary support for his allegations that he has specifically been targeted and would be at risk of serious harm at the hands of any agent of persecution in Bangladesh.\n[38] I accept that the claimant has the personal and national identity alleged. To this extent, his oral testimony and written claim, and the copies of pages of his Bangladesh passport1 (1) are reliable. The claimant testified in Bengali through an interpreter at the hearing. He provided details and evidence in respect to names of groups and cities was conferred a multiple entry visa by Canadian immigration authorities.\nCONCLUSION\n[39] Based on the foregoing analysis and having reviewed the evidence properly before me and the submissions, I conclude that the claimant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution in Bangladesh for any Convention reason. It has not been established that there is in Bangladesh a risk to the claimant's life, a risk of cruel and unusual punishment or treatment, or a danger of torture. There is not a serious possibility that he would be persecuted were he to return to Bangladesh.\n[40] Additionally, the panel finds that pursuant to subsection 107(2) of the IRPA, there was no credible or trustworthy evidence on which a favourable decision could be made and therefore there is no credible basis for the claim.\n[41] Accordingly, I determine the claimant not to be a Convention refugee or a person in need of Canada's protection.\n(signed)\n\"B.

The panel also finds that the claimant is not a person in need of protection pursuant to section 97(1) of the Act. The panel finds that the claim has no credible basis as per section 107(2) of the Act. Its reasons are as follows.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The claimant's complete allegations are set out in the Basis of Claim (BOC) form2 and amended BOC3 and need not be repeated here in detail. To summarize briefly, the claimant alleges the following.\n[4] She is an Iraqi citizen. She is Kurdish. She is a XXXX fearing Fundamentalist Muslim relatives. They found out that she was living with a man outside of marriage. The male common law partner, XXXX, is in hiding. The agents of persecution threatened to kill the claimant. She says the tribal elders believe she has dishonoured the family by cohabitating with a man and having a sexual relationship before marriage. She has received threats from several tribal elders. She fears gender-based violence and fears honour killing throughout Iraq. The agents of persecution include her mother's cousin, who is a police officer, and an elder uncle, who is an imam or Muslim religious leader. The tribal elders of her family are fundamentalist Muslims. She was born in Iran , where her parents had taken refuge. The family, including the claimant, returned to Iraq in 2006.\n[5] The claimant also alleges fear of risk to his life, risk of torture or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment at the hands of the same agent of harm.\n[6] The claimant alleges that neither state protection nor safe and reasonable internal flight alternatives are available in her country of nationality.\nMinister Intervention\n[7] The Minister's Representative from Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) was intervening in person pursuant to subparagraphs 170(e) of the Act and pursuant to Rule 29 of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) Rules.4\nANALYSIS\n[8] The main issues are Identity (citizenship and personal identity) and Credibility.\nIdentity\n[9] The claimant's identity and citizenship have not been established by the testimony and supporting documentation filed and entered in the proceedings.\n[10] A document issued by a foreign authority is presumed to be valid unless there is evidence to the contrary.5\nCLAIMANT'S PASSPORT ISSUED IN 2016\n[11] The claimant's current passport, issued in 2016, which she used to travel to the USA on her way to Canada was in disclosure. It was issued in XXXX, Iraq.6\n[12] When asked about the various format inconsistencies between the biodata page of her 2016 passport and the sample found in Exhibit 6, the claimant said she did not know and that she thought the style of passport had changed. The panel notes in this regard the information at Exhibit 6 in which the RPD Research Directorate notes no changes to passports issued in XXXX in 2016 and no new A-series passports issued in XXXX in 2016. The inconsistencies included the placement of the various entries or fields, the order of the languages describing the entries, the placement of the emblematic bird, the contrast of the reproduced photo, etc......The panel gives more weight to the research produced by the Research Directorate than to the claimant's testimony in this regard. That is because the Research Directorate follows strict methodology, consults well-established sources and has no vested interest in the outcome of the claim. The claimant's passport bio data page is lacking the triangular parentheses on the barcode number list which is in the sample at exhibit 6. As well, the claimant's passport number has one more digit than the sample found in Exhibit 6, which is from the Documentchecker website. The panel notes that the Documentchecker website published by Keesing Reference Systems is a highly detailed and precise source of information with no vested interest in the outcome of the claim. For this reason, the panel gives more weight to the documentary evidence found on the Documentchecker website than to the claimant's testimony.\n[13] The claimant's 2016 passport lists her place of birth as Iraq. Her own evidence, as provided in testimony and in her BOC is that she was born in Iran, not Iraq. When asked why her passport says otherwise, she said that when she went to Iraq in 2006, she was told that it was better in order to get Iraqi citizenship, to say that she was born in Iraq. Other than the claimant's assertion, the panel is unaware of credible objective evidence which supports the claimant's explanation for why her passport says she was born in Iraq when that is not the fact. The panel draws a negative inference from this.\n[14] Counsel for the claimant argued that the document analysis report of the 2016 passport at Exhibit 9 took no issue with the passport, and that it should be given more weight. The panel chooses to give little weight to the document analysis report in question, and to draw no conclusion from it. The reason for this is that it makes no reference to the various inconsistencies between the claimant's passport and the sample information found in Exhibit 6. The other reason is that the report itself notes that the \"physical examination of the document will not reveal whether it has been improperly issued, obtained by means of fraud or genuinely issued to a different person\". The panel notes in this regard the information at National Documentation Package (NDP), item 3.8 on the fact that Iraqi passports are relatively easy to manipulate, and that there is a lack of checks in passports against population registries. 7A third reason for the panel not giving the document analysis report at Exhibit 9 any weight is that it fails to answer any of the credibility concerns arising from the passport in disclosure, concerns which include questions pertaining to the source documents for the passport.\n[15] Exhibit 25 contains the copy of the bio-data page of an Iraqi passport issued to a man in Baghdad in 2016. When interviewed by CBSA, The man said that he is Iranian and that the Iraqi passport was fraudulently obtained. The panel notes that the passport in exhibit 25 has exactly the same features, fields and field locations as the claimant's 2016 Iraqi passport. That includes the lack of a triangular parentheses on the bottom line of the barcode number list. The panel draws a negative inference from this man's passport. This impact the claimant's own evidence about her 2016 Iraqi passport. The reason for that is that the man's passport at Exhibit 25 is, on its face, indistinguishable from the claimant's 2016 passport, and it is acknowledged to be fraudulent. As is the case with the claimant's passport, it was used to obtain a US visa on which the passport bearer traveled to the USA (at the same time as the claimant). The man who used this fraudulently obtained Iraqi passport stated (Ex 25, interview of XXXX XXXX, 2016) that he is not\nan Iraqi citizen and that he has no permanent status in Iraq. He also stated that the name that appears on the Iraqi passport is not his name. He also stated that he was born in Iran, not Iraq - yet the Iraqi passport says he was born in Iraq.8 The panel finds that the Iraqi passport issued to a man in XXXX in 2016 in exhibit 25 strengthens the panel's doubts as to the genuineness of the claimant's own 2016 Iraqi passport. Other than the specific entries, the fact that the man could fraudulently obtain such a passport and travel to the USA on it seriously undermines the claimant's evidence that she obtained her passport through regular channels. That is because this man obtained an identical-looking passport as far as fields and format, and it was all a fraud - his country of birth, his name, and his citizenship. The panel draws a negative inference from this, which impacts its assessment of the claimant's identity as supported by her 2016 Iraqi passport.\n[16] The counsel for the claimant argued that Baghdad-issued passports are different-looking than XXXX-issued passports.9 He was unable to provide objective evidence to support this statement. The panel finds there is no credible evidence for it to conclude that XXXX-issued passports are different in appearance to those issued in Baghdad. Were that the case, given the amount of information on passports in disclosure and in the NDP, one would expect that to be mentioned. As per exhibit 6, the Research Directorate found no such information. The panel draws a negative inference from the silence of country conditions documents on this point. The evidence to support the statement that Baghdad-issued passports are different-looking than XXXX-issued passports is supported only by the claimant's evidence and that of her friends and relatives. In light of the lack of objective evidence supporting the evidence of the claimant's friends and family, the panel gives their evidence little weight.\n[17] The panel gives no weight to the claimant's 2016 Iraqi passport. It finds it was fraudulently produced and obtained.\nCLAIMANT'S PASSPORT ISSUED IN XXXX 2013 (Exhibit 16).\n[18] This document, valid to 2021, could presumably have been used to travel to the USA in 2016. When asked why she had not used it, she said that it had been damaged when her mother washed the jacket in which she had left it. She said she was told by Iraqi authorities that the resulting damage to the passport rendered it unusable. When asked where the rest of the passport was, she said she had to surrender it when applying for her 2016 passport. The panel notes that the surrendered passport was issued in 2013 in XXXX. When compared with other passports not removed from circulation10 , the panel notes that the features on the bio data page of the claimant's own do not match any of the three samples. The entries are placed in different places, for example, and the reproduction of the photograph is much more contrasted in the claimant's copy than in the samples provided. Her explanation for these differences was that it was a genuine passport, obtained legitimately, and that the samples were all issued in Baghdad, whereas hers was issued in XXXX. She said the differences were explained by the different issuing office. The panel is unaware of objective evidence on Iraqi passports issued in 2013 from within Iraq having a different appearance depending on the place of issue. If this were the case, the panel would reasonably expect there to be some mention of this, in the various documents in the NDP package, or in the very Keesing's document checker database at Exhibits 6 and 18. There is none. The panel draws a negative credibility inference from the silence of the documents in this respect. The panel notes that NDP item 3.2. makes several references to the central source of passport-printing machines.11 From this the panel finds that one can reasonably infer, absent any objective evidence to the contrary that there are centrally-produced templates being printed. This inference is supported by NDP item 3.7.12 It refers to the passport offices being organised under the Passport Directorate, within the General Directorate for Nationality. It also says that all passport applications must be submitted to that General Directorate in Baghdad for approval. It says the passports are personalised locally in the governorates. It refers to the main passport office in Baghdad, where all passports in Iraq are produced. There are photographs of the\npassport producing machines. These machines perforate the serial number and print the photo and the rest of the data, before the passport is laminated.\n[19] Counsel for the claimant pointed out that the format of the mother and sister's passport biodata page spread13 is identical to that of the claimant's passport issued in 2013 at exhibit 16. The panel finds differently. The A-series passports of the sister and mother are no more documented objectively as far as their entries and appearance than the claimant's.\n[20] The panel gives no weight to the claimant's 2013 Iraqi passport bio data page.14 It finds it does not establish the claimant's citizenship or identity.\nCLAIMANT'S IRAQI NATIONALITY CERTIFICATE\n[21] The information in item 3.7 of the NDP15 on nationality certificates lists information contained in the certificate and states that it is listed with the same numbering as in the list provided. This information is dated in the NDP item as being from 2009. That is the same year that the claimant's nationality certificate was issued. The list on the claimant's nationality certificate16 does not match the list in the NDP item 3.7. Notably, her full name is not listed per se, and the information on the granting of citizenship is not listed per se, and is placed at the beginning and not at the end of the information. The NDP item 3.7 information on the folder number and certificate number is also not listed in a numbered list on the claimant's document. That information is not at the same place in the NDP item 3.7 as on the claimant's document. The claimant's document has seven items listed, whereas the information from 3.7 is that there are 16 listed items. The panel draws a negative inference from this. That is because the panel finds that there is no reasonable explanation for the fact that the nationality certificate\nformat does not match what one would reasonably expect, given the country conditions information.\n[22] Another reason for drawing a negative inference from the Iraqi nationality certificate of the claimant is her explanation for how and when she obtained it. It is dated 2009. The claimant moved to Iraq from Iran in 2006. She was 17. She was asked how soon after moving to Iraq she obtained her Iraqi citizenship certificate. She said she did not recall exactly, but that it was in less than one month. She confirmed in testimony that the citizenship certificate in question was obtained in 2006. Yet the one in disclosure is dated 2009.17 When asked why she got a new citizenship certificate in 2009 - the one in disclosure -, she said that she had the same citizenship until 2015 and that in 2015 she renewed her citizenship. Neither the need to have a new nationality certificate nor the need to renew it or one's citizenship are supported by country conditions evidence. Given the significance of this document and of citizenship itself, one would reasonably expect these two administrative requirements to be mentioned somewhere in the NDP. That is not the case. The information in the NDP on identity documents is not sparse. Given the amount of available information from varied sources bearing on identity documents found in the NDP, the panel draws a negative inference from this silence of the documents on the need to renew a nationality certificate or one's citizenship, which the claimant mentioned. The panel notes that there is no validity period on the citizenship certificate in disclosure. The panel therefore finds that the claimant's explanations are unreasonable. Without a date when validity ends and without objective evidence on the need to have such a certificate issued three years later, or renewed, the panel gives more weight to the country conditions information than to the claimant's unreasonable explanation. The documentary silence on this alleged need to renew one's citizenship or citizenship documentation leads the panel to draw a negative inference regarding this document. The panel gives the claimant's nationality certificate no weight. That is because its format and content are inconsistent with objective country conditions evidence. As well that is because the claimant's evidence on how and when she obtained the certificate are not credible. The credibility concerns with the claimant's nationality certificate compound credibility doubts regarding the passport of 2016, and of 2013, for which it was a required document.\nCLAIMANT'S IRAQI IDENTITY CARD (Exhibit 16)\n[23] The claimant's identity card at Exhibit 16 shows it as issued in 2016. The claimant indicated this was a translation mistake, and that it was issued in 2013. This was confirmed by the hearing interpreter. NDP item 3.3 describes this identity card as perhaps the most important official document in Iraq\" and notes that it is \"treated like a birth certificate\".18 Two sources two years apart are described as stating that the civil status identity card contains the ethnicity of the bearer.19 The claimant's does not. She did not have an explanation for this, and said she did not know why her identity card does not mention her ethnicity. The panel draws a negative credibility inference from this, not so much because of her lack of an explanation for it, but because there is objective evidence stating that such a document would mention ethnicity. The panel gives more weight to what is stated in the objective country conditions evidence because the country conditions information is objectively produced and independently sourced, and has no vested interest in the outcome of the claim.\n[24] The claimant was asked what she had as identity prior to this identity card. Her explanation was that the Iraqi government in 2013 asked people to obtain new identity cards. The NDP item 3.3. is dated November 25, 2013 and makes no mention of the alleged requirement by the government to have new identity cards issued.20 This is contrary to the claimant's explanation for why her identity card was issued in 2013. NDP item 3.7 states the following in regard to identity cards:\nAll Iraqi nationals are issued such a card on the basis of the information in the family register. New-borns are issued their first ID card on the basis of their birth certificate and their parents' ID cards (GDN, meeting in Baghdad, April 2012). The card can be renewed several times and should be renewed in connection with changes in marital status and relocation. A new date of issue and a new serial number are entered on the new card.21\n[25] The claimant has failed to provide a reasonable explanation for the year of issuance of the document. The panel draws a negative credibility inference from this. The panel gives more weight to the country conditions information on Iraqi identity cards than to the claimant's testimony in this regard. That is because the country conditions information is objectively produced and independently sourced, and has no vested interest in the outcome of the claim. The panel gives the identity card little weight. This is because of a lack of reasonable explanation for the year of issuance, and for the fact that what should appear in it, such as her ethnicity, does not.\nCLAIMANT'S FATHER'S DOCUMENTS:\n[26] The father's 2011 passport biodata page is in disclosure.22 Its format is the same as the claimant's with the exception that the issuing authority of XXXX is spelled differently as XXXX. Nowhere else on official identity documents on file is XXXX spelled like that, except in the samples provided by the claimant and drawn from relatives and a friend. The panel draws a negative credibility inference from this. Like her 2016 passport and her 2013 passport, the entries or fields do not match the available objective evidence on the appearance of these passports. Notably, where the sample in Exhibit 6 consistently lists in the same order the three languages of the entry names , the father's passport biodata page and the claimant's and her mother's and sister's present inconsistent order of entry names. In some cases, English appears as the first language, in other cases, such as \"country\" or \"passport\", it appears last. The panel draws a negative inference from this and gives little weight to any of the passports in disclosure. That is because, as an official travel document with a variety of security features, it is reasonably expected to be consistent and methodical in its format, in accordance with its official significance. The panel notes in this regard the country conditions information on the availability of doctored and fraudulently obtained passports in Iraq. The panel finds that the bio data page of the father was fraudulently obtained. The source documents for it, as seen in the analysis below of those, are unreliable. The bio data page of the passport itself raises several credibility and concerns over authenticity and genuineness.\n[27] The father is listed in his Iranian refugee identity document of 199523 as having been born in XXXX. This is in contrast to the claimant's Iraqi citizenship certificate, where he is listed as having been born in Baghdad. When asked about this, the claimant said her father was born in XXXX but that when her family returned to Iraq, her grandfather's place of birth was listed on all of the new documents. Other than the claimant and her friends and relatives, the panel is unaware of evidence including objective evidence according to which this practice relating to birth place existed in Iraq.\n[28] The father's identity information is relevant because the country conditions information refer in more than one place to the father's documents as being among the \"feeder documents\" for establishing status and identity for a female child. The panel finds that the father's information such as it is presented is unreliable. This further weakens the claimant's evidence pertaining to the claimant's Iraqi citizenship.\nOTHER IDENTITY DOCUMENTS\n[29] On the day of the last resumption, the claimant provided identity documents. They are: a Food Supply card issued to her family,24 a registration document for refugees, a document from the Interior Minister of Iraq in her father's name.25 None of these documents make up for the lack of credible identity documents for the claimant. None of them in and of themselves, or seen together, establish the claimant's alleged nationality. That is because they do not present security features or photographs, and are not considered primary identity documents. None of them explain the credibility issues that arise when the claimant's identity documents mentioned above are examined. The panel gives the documents at exhibit 26 little weight.\nCOUNTRY CONDITIONS INFORMATION PERTAINING TO IDENTITY DOCUMENTS\n[30] The claimant explained inconsistencies in her identity documents by stating that that is how such documents are produced and obtained in Iraq.\n[31] The panel notes that the country conditions documents on file bearing on identity documents are numerous and varied in their sources. The panel's conclusion is that the country conditions documents in question do not support the claimant's point that identity documents in Iraq and specifically in Kurdish Iraq are issued in a relaxed fashion or in a void of specific bureaucratic requirements and checks.26 The claimant did not provide objective country conditions evidence which supported this point of view.\n[32] The panel finds that the credibility problems linked to the claimant's identity documents are compounded by the significance of identity documents in Iraq. This significance of identity documents in Iraq is supported by, among other things: NDP item 2.3., quoting a 2009 report, and which explains that five key documents are necessary to access public services and that the documents are interlinked.27\n[33] The objective evidence, found in section 3 of the National Documentation Package (NDP), is that fraudulently obtained id documents are widely available in Iraq (mention references). This includes a wide variety of documents, such as nationality certificates, passports, and identity certificates.28\nIdentity\n[34] The panel finds that the claimant has not established her personal or national identity. The panel finds that the claimant has disclosed a number of fraudulently obtained or irregularly obtained identity documents to support her claim. The evidence pertaining to her identity is damaging not only to her alleged identity but also damaging to her credibility as a witness. That is because of the number of fraudulently obtained documents she alleges are authentic and genuine, and because of her numerous misrepresentations on the subject.\nCredibility\n[35] When credibility is assessed there are two principles that are followed. Firstly, when a claimant swears to the truthfulness of certain facts there is a presumption that what he is saying is true unless there is reason to doubt it.29 Secondly, when assessing credibility the panel is entitled to rely on rationality and common sense.30 The determination as to whether a claimant's evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities.\n[36] However, the panel found significant inconsistencies (contradictions, omissions) in the testimony which caused it to find that the claimant is not a reliable witness.\nCBSA EXHIBITS 19 AND 21\n[37] The evidence from CBSA at exhibits 19 and 21 bears on XXXX, a man in Canada with whom the claimant has been linked. The point of the matter with XXXX is not so much the nature of the claimant's relationship with him as the impact of the evidence on her credibility as a witness. On the following points, the claimant damaged her credibility by insisting on a version of events that is not reasonable - whether XXXX clothes were on the floor, whether his toothbrush and razor were in the bathroom and whether he was living in the apartment in question, whether she was living there, and whether she was living there alone or not, whether she had violated her CBSA reporting conditions, why she introduced him to her landlord as her boyfriend... On all of these points the claimant defended a version of events that is different to CBSA's. The panel agrees with the Minister that, first of all, some of the allegations made by CBSA should be given weight because they are documented, such as the copy of the lease agreement.31 These documents are from sources other than the claimant, and thus present to the panel an element of objectivity and distance from the claim that the claimant's and the claimant's friend's evidence lacks. Second of all, the panel agrees that it is unreasonable to say that no less than three CBSA officers misrepresented in their Solemn Declarations what happened during the encounters with the claimant and XXXX. The panel gives more weight to the evidence provided by the CBSA officers, because there are several CBSA staff attesting to the claimant's actions and statements, and because the CBSA staff are sworn Peace Officers entrusted with serious responsibilities by their employers. In addition, they have no vested interest in the outcome of the claim.\nIMPACT ON THE CLAIMANT'S CREDIBILITY\n[38] The impact of this information on the credibility of the claimant as witness is significant. The panel draws a negative credibility inference from the fact that the claimant repeatedly lied to CBSA officers when encountered by them as per exhibit 19 and 21. The panel finds these numerous lies greatly undermine the claimant's credibility as a witness. Regardless of the nature of her relationship with XXXX, her willingness to repeatedly lie about it clearly indicates that it matters to her a great deal.\nXXXX AND XXXX\n[39] The claimant's testimony on matters relating to the male in Canada, XXXX, was consistently emotional and intense. This was reflected in her vocal tone, facial expression and demeanour. None of that emotion or intensity were present when she was testifying on her relationship with XXXX. When testifying about XXXX, the claimant faced the panel, interjected and interrupted the speaker several times, moved her hands, provided testimony which was not in response to a question, she cried. Whereas when testifying to her relationship with her common-law partner in Iraq, XXXX, she was physically still, did not interject, interrupt, or provide unsolicited information. What information she provided on why she was attracted to XXXX, or what they had in common, for example, was succinct and reasoned, which was not the case when speaking about XXXX. The panel draws a negative inference from the marked contrast between the testimony on XXXX and the testimony on XXXX. The claimant's explanations for her involvement in XXXX affairs did not sway the panel. That is because the evidence on how and when they met is inconsistent (XXXX version at Exhibit 25 is different than hers, for example, the fact that she was friends with XXXX wife is also inconsistently told).\nCOUSIN XXXX AND XXXX\n[40] As for the allegations involving XXXX and the claimant in Iraq, the panel notes the following. The claimant alleges that her problems stem from having been found living out of marriage with XXXX, by her fundamentalist cousin, XXXX. The panel notes that, when describing the incident when her cousin, XXXX, went to the home she shared with XXXX, which resulted in a violent physical altercation, the claimant consistently faced away from the panel, turning towards the counsel's computer without facing him or the Minister's counsel. About three quarters of the way through this testimony on the incident with her fundamentalist cousin XXXX, the claimant glanced at the clock, which was located behind the Minister's counsel. The panel draws a negative inference from the demeanour of the claimant while testifying to the attack by her cousin on her and XXXX. That is because of the demeanour which was entirely different from the fervent one exhibited while talking about XXXX. The testimony on the incident with the cousin and XXXX had the stilted feel of practised testimony. The glancing at the clock as if she could not wait for it to be over further undermined the credibility of the testimony. The testimony in question was on a seminal event, which is at the origin of the flight from Iraq and the refugee claim in Canada. One cannot forget, when assessing the contrast between her evidence on XXXX and her evidence when discussing XXXX, that XXXX life is allegedly at risk, and that he is in hiding and that, unlike the claimant, he was unable to get out of Iraq. This is the context of the testimony on XXXX, and the context is so greatly at odds with the flavour of the testimony that it is damaging to the claimant's credibility, when seen in contrast to her heart-felt testimony on XXXX.\nWHEN ENCOUNTERED BY XXXX\n[41] When testifying to events relating to her relationship with XXXX in Iraq, the claimant referred to her having been seen in Iraq driving XXXX car, XXXX being the male in Canada. She corrected herself and said she meant XXXX car. When asked about this slip, she said she had said the name of XXXX because her friends (in Canada) are always asking her about what is happening with him. When it was put to her that she had earlier stated that she had only two friends in Canada, she said that the friends in question were her landlord's guests. This is not what she said, and those guests were described elsewhere as part of the reason why she decided to move, given that they made her uncomfortable and expected her to keep house. The panel draws a negative inference from the slip concerning whose car she was in when found out by her fundamentalist cousin in Iraq. This impacts the credibility of the allegation of the incident with the cousin, a seminal event in the allegations of persecution.\nFAILURE TO CLAIM ELSEWHERE\n[42] The claimant spent three to four days in Turkey on her way to Canada. This was not the first time she had traveled to Turkey. Among other things, the claimant testified that she did not file a refugee claim in Turkey as she had never heard of someone making a refugee claim in Turkey, and that she was not sure if Turkey accepted refugees or not. She also said that access to Turkey from Iraq is very easy. She said she thought that if she went somewhere legally with a visa, she could be sent back to her country. She said that she had no idea that it was possible to get a visa and then make a refugee claim. She also testified that she had been following the news. She mentioned the case of a young Syrian boy whose relatives were accepted by Canada after he drowned. This was an explanation for why she chose to make a refugee claim in Canada. Mention was made by the panel of the name Alan Kurdi, for the young Syrian boy in question. The panel takes Judicial Notice of the fact that Alan Kurdi's corpse washed up on the Turkish shore. The claimant was asked how come, if she follows news, she did not know that Turkey has many thousand refugees, and that it was while trying to reach Turkey that Alan Kurdi drowned. She did not have an explanation. The panel does not believe the claimant's explanation for not making a refugee claim in Turkey. Her explanation that she did not know it was possible to do so does not stand up to scrutiny. She would reasonably be expected to be aware of that if she followed the news at the time of Alan Kurdi's death. The panel draws a negative inference from the claimant's failure to make a claim in Turkey as it was not reasonably explained. It was explained as an afterthought through misleading testimony that is not reasonable. This further damages the credibility of the claimant.\nRemaining claimant-specific evidence\n[43] The remaining claimant-specific documentary evidence on file cannot remedy the above noted credibility concerns, given what the panel finds to be the claimant's lack of credibility as a witness.\n[44] The panel gives no weight to the testimony of the claimant's three telephone witnesses. They supported a story the panel found not credible, and a claimant whose identity was not established.\nResidual claim\n[45] The panel has turned its mind to the residual claim. A gender-based residual claim cannot be assessed in a vacuum. Absent credible evidence, the panel still does not know who the claimant is or what nationality she holds. In the same way, for a Kurdish-based claim, nationality and identity not having been established, it is unclear against what country the claim should be made.\n[46] As for a risk upon return, a personal risk has not been established, given the lack of credible evidence.\nCONCLUSION\n[47] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel determines that there is not a serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted in her country of nationality for any of the five grounds enumerated in the Refugee Convention, or that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or would face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in her country of nationality.\n[48] Given the serious and extensive credibility concerns with the claimant as a witness, and the fact that her identity has not been established, the panel finds that the claim had no credible basis as there was no credible or trustworthy evidence on which it could have made a favourable decision. The panel therefore finds that there is no credible basis for the claim as outlined in subsection 107(2) of the Act.\n[49] The panel concludes that the claimant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection and the panel therefore rejects the claim.\n(signed)\n\"Miryam Molgat\"\nMiryam Molgat\nDecember 13, 2016\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibit 2.\n3 Exhibit 2.1.\n4 Refugee Protection Division Rules, SOR\/2012-256.\n5 Ramalingam, Govindasamy Sellathurai v.

Oral submissions were heard at the end of the hearing. Additional submissions were received from counsel on April 28, 2016 and entered as an exhibit for purposes of identification.\nHISTORY OF THIS CLAIM\n[2] The claimant arrived at the Douglas\/Pacific Highway Port of Entry on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2016. On XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014, His only identity documents were a Minnesota Driver's License issued in XXXX 2014, a United States of America Employment Authorization Card that is valid from XXXX XXXX XXXX\/15 to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX16, and a United States of America Social Security Card issued XXXX XXXX XXXX\/2015. He had $105.00 US dollars in his possession.\n[3] He noted his address as Ottawa, Ontario. He alleged he was in the USA from 1997 until XXXX 20162. His BOC was signed on January 21, 2016. He alleged that he has a mother and sister living in Ottawa, Ontario.\n[4] On February 9, 2016, a US HVDS match was found for the fingerprints that were submitted by Canada without biographic data. This match comes from the US's biometric immigration data base.\n[5] On February 17, 2016, the claimant signed an Acquisition of Information Form (AIF) consenting to a status check in the United States as a result of the fingerprint match in the US biometric immigration database. As the results of this AIF were not received by the hearing date of March 4, 2016, the hearing was adjourned to April 26, 2016 in order to be in receipt of the response to the AIF. The response was received on March 17, 2016 and a copy was forwarded to counsel on March 18, 2016.\n[6] The Response to the AIF3 states:\nSubject claimed to have entered the United States without inspection on XXXX XXXX XXXX 1997. He filed an asylum application on XXXX XXXX XXXX 1997, but the application was not approved and his case was referred to the Immigration court. Subject was ordered removed by an Immigration judge of the Executive Office for Immigration Review on XXXX XXXX, 2010. Subject appealed the judge's decision however his appeal was dismissed by the Board of immigration appeals on XXXX XXXX, 2012.\nDOCUMENTS PRESENTED AT POE IN CANADA\n[7] The claimant presented three Notices of Hearing in Removal proceedings Immigration Court of Los Angeles dated 20084. These documents do not note the results of any hearing nor do they establish the claimant's identity.\nALLEGATIONS\n[8] The claimant's Basis of Claim (BOC) narrative states that the claimant, three sisters, three brothers and his mother left Somalia on XXXX XXXX, 1991 and entered Kenya. He alleged they were members of a minority clan called the XXXX who resided in the Waberi district of XXXX.\n[9] He alleged he lived in different refugee camps in XXXX and then went to Nairobi in 1995 where he married in 1996. He left Kenya in 1996 and went to the USA. He made an asylum claim in 1997 which was refused5.\n[10] He married for a second time in the USA in 2002 and had three US born children with this wife. He married a third wife in 2008 with whom he has five US children plus three US step children. According to the claimant, his third wife was in the process of sponsoring him and it necessitated his departure from the USA. He was advised to go to Canada.\nDETERMINATION\n[11] The panel determines that the claimant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection pursuant to s 96 and 97 (1) of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity and Nationality\n[12] Based on a review of the totality of the evidence, the panel finds that the claimant has failed to provide sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence in support of his personal identity and nationality and finds him to be an unreliable witness for reasons discussed below.\n[13] Section 106 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act states:\nThe Refugee Protection Division must take into account, with respect to the credibility of a claimant, whether the claimant possesses acceptable documentation establishing identity, and if not, whether they have provided a reasonable explanation for the lack of documentation or have taken reasonable steps to obtain the documentation.\n[14] Rule 11 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules states:\nThe claimant must provide acceptable documents establishing identity and other elements of the claim. A claimant who does not provide acceptable documents must explain why they were not provided and what steps were taken to obtain them.\n[15] The claimant provided no documentation with respect to his personal identity or his nationality as a Somali.\n[16] The claimant was represented by counsel and had the assistance of an interpreter for the preparation of his BOC form.\nIdentity witness\n[17] On March 7, 2016, three days after the March 4, 2016 sitting, counsel forwarded the name of the identity witness which is XXXX XXXX, born XXXX XXXX, 1962. Counsel stated, in his letter, that her full address would be forwarded in April 2016. The latter was never received by the panel.\n[18] At the sitting on April 26, 2016, counsel announced that the identity witness was not present or available as she was out of the country. The panel questioned the claimant about his recent contact with the proposed identity witness. He said that he last spoke to her two weeks ago. When asked if he told her that the hearing was on April 26, 2016, he said no. When asked why not, he said that she knew of the date of the hearing from the previous date as she was present at the premises. The panel notes that the full name of the identity witness and her address was not provided to the panel at the first sitting of March 4, 2016. On March 7, 2016, counsel informed the RPD that the claimant wished to call a witness and gave her name as XXXX XXXX and noted her date of birth as XXXX XXXX, 1962. The CMO noted in the file that counsel would provide the address of the witness in April 2016.\n[19] The claimant was asked the name of the identity witness and he said XXXX XXXX. He said she lived in the same area of XXXX as his family. When asked her age, he did not know. When asked if she was older than the claimant, he did not know. When asked how he met her, he said after he came to Canada, he was told she lives in Toronto. When asked if she had siblings, he said that he did not know. He said she knew about his family but personally she did not know much about the claimant.\n[20] Counsel submitted that the identity witness could be contacted by telephone for questioning. The panel declined this request. Counsel has had a reasonable period of time to request a telephone conference call with a witness on another continent in advance of this hearing date. This procedure requires advance notice.\n[21] When the above information is taken into consideration, the panel finds that the proposed witness who did not appear for the hearing did not have significant evidence to corroborate the claimant's identity as XXXX XXXX XXXX and his alleged membership in a minority clan.\nClaimant and his wife and children who have US citizenship\n[22] The claimant's wife was at the premises for the hearing. However, she met the claimant in the USA and was not called as a witness because, according to counsel, she could not confirm his personal identity as she has no knowledge of his residency in Somalia. He presented five photocopies of his American born children. However, these photocopies, while they note that the father of the children is from Somalia, do not validate the claimant's identity as a citizen of Somalia.\nPrintout from website of the Department of Homeland Security\n[23] The claimant, at the hearing, presented a printout stating that an Immigrant Petition for a relative was approved6. The claimant said that his wife who has a US citizenship was sponsoring him. This printout does not state the names of any of the parties. While this may refer to the claimant and his wife, there is no reliable evidence with respect to the claimant's personal identity, his citizenship and his membership in a minority clan. In addition, counsel said that the claimant's BOC narrative is essentially the same narrative he presented in his US asylum claim. The latter however does not establish the claimant's identity. Documents7 presented by CBSA\/CIC pertaining to the initiation of the claimant's refugee claim refer to an asylum claim in the USA but do not state the reasons why the claim was denied nor do these documents state what identity documents, if any, were presented to the US asylum judge in 1997.\nClaimant and his family members in Canada\n[24] The claimant is his BOC at question 5 states that he has a mother and sister in Canada. At the Port of Entry (POE), he gave an Ottawa address. When asked if he considered his mother or sister to be an identity witness at his hearing, he said his mother is older and she is ill. He said his sister looks after his mother. He implied that his sister could be called.\n[25] After considering the above paragraphs, the panel finds that the claimant has made no serious attempts to present an identity witness or to obtain any documents to substantiate that he was in Somalia or Kenya for the period of time alleged. The claimant did not present any evidence from any Somali organization in the USA or Canada to support that the claimant was born in Somalia. The claimant did not present an affidavit from either his mother or from his sister who live in Ottawa to substantiate his identity.\n[26] The fact that the claimant speaks Somali fluently, possesses knowledge of a specific tribe, or knows the geography and culture of a country does not establish one's personal identity. He may have worked and lived in Somalia. There are significant numbers of Somalis found in several countries outside Somalia, including but not limited to Ethiopia, Kenya, Djibouti and Yemen as well as the two quasi-autonomous regions of Somaliland and Puntland.\nCONCLUSION\n[27] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has failed to produce sufficient credible evidence to establish his personal identity as a national of Somalia as required by section 106 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and Rule 11 of the Refugee Protection Rules. Because identity is the first step for a person claiming refugee protection, there is no further need for the panel to assess whether the claimant faces persecution or is a person in need of protection. The claimant's evidence is that he is being sponsored by his wife who is a US citizen and according to documentary evidence8 the claimant must be outside of the USA for a proscribed period of time. The mandate of the Refugee Protection Division does not include providing residency for claimants in Canada in order to fulfill a prerequisite for alien relatives who wish to immigrate to the United States on the basis of a spousal sponsorship.\n[28] The counsel, pursuant to Rule 43 applied to provide further documents in support of country conditions in Somalia and a document that specifically addresses the XXXX clan which is allegedly the clan of the claimant9. Since the claimant was not able to establish, on a balance of probabilities, his personal identity or nationality as a Somali and as a member of the XXXX minority clan, the panel finds that the documentary evidence and submissions do not establish the claimant's identity.\n[29] The claimant is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. The panel rejects the claim.\n(signed)\n\"Martin Wakim\"\nMartin Wakim\nMay 19, 2016\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96, 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b).\n2\n3 Exhibit 7, SIRU.\n4 Exhibit 1, Referral documents.\n5 Exhibit 2, Basis of Claim form, question6.\n6 Exhibit 10, Department of Homeland Security document.\n7 Exhibit 1, Referral documents.\n8 Exhibit 5, Response to Information Request: USA105453.E.\n9 Exhibit 12, Post hearing supporting document entered for purposes of identification.\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRPD.29.1 (August 31, 2012)\nRPD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SPR : TB6-00266\n",

They allege that the elder minor claimant studied at a XXXX where, unbeknownst to his parents, persons from an unknown extremist group attended and attempted to convince the minor claimant to engage in extremist and potentially violent actions. When they became aware of this, the adult claimant and her husband, who is still in Pakistan, stopped him from attending. Her husband confronted the XXXX. They were subsequently threatened, an incident occurred where the elder minor claimant was the victim of an attempted kidnapping, they moved in with family in Lahore and then eventually left their city to move to Islamabad where they were in hiding. While in Islamabad, the elder minor claimant and his father saw one of the extremists from the XXXX at a XXXX XXXX, which led to a confrontation. The claimants subsequently decided to flee Pakistan and come to Canada.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] I find that the claimants are neither Convention refugee nor persons in need of protection. My reasons are as follows.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] I find that the claimants are nationals of Pakistan as is established by testimony and the supporting documentation filed.3 The panel has copies of their Pakistani passports.\nCredibility\n[6] While the panel has some concerns regarding the credibility of the claimants, those concerns are not significant enough to find that their allegations are false.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[7] The determinative issue in this claim is internal flight alternative. The principal claimant was born in Faisalabad, and as such the panel put this forward as the potential alternative. This was brought forward at the beginning of the hearing, and counsel for the claimants was permitted and did put in evidence and submissions regarding this particular location post-hearing, which have been considered. The panel notes there may be other viable alternatives that were not canvassed.\n[8] In order to be Convention refugees or persons in need of protection, the claimants must face the risk in every part of the country. The panel questioned the claimants on this issue and have carefully considered that testimony and the submissions from counsel and find there is an internal flight alternative for the claimants, as the claimants could reasonably live in another city in Pakistan, Faisalabad, and would not face more than a mere possibility of persecution there.\nIs it reasonable\n[9] The panel considered Faisalabad. It is a very large city of 3.567 million people4. When asked, the principal claimant did not express any significant problems they may encounter if they were to relocate to this city, other than that they would continue to fear the unknown group that had previously threatened them. She stated that she and her husband could re-establish their business, a real estate business, in any city. The evidence does not suggest that there are difficulties related to accessing schooling for the minor claimants.\n[10] While there is evidence of general security problems in the city5, including terrorist attacks, this is the case throughout the country and the evidence does not suggest the claimants would be at any greater risk than the general population. The panel does not find that the existence of crime or terrorism in a potential internal flight alternative location disqualifies it as a reasonable alternative in absence of evidence that such violence will have an effect on the claimants. The panel notes the claimants lived without issue in Lahore until the events outlined, despite similar concerns with terrorism and crime there.\n[11] Finally, counsel for the claimants states that it is unreasonable for the elder minor claimant to relocate within Pakistan because of the trauma he faced in Lahore. The panel has insufficient evidence to find that the minor claimant would be so affected by internal relocation as to render it unreasonable. The medical evidence before the panel is that in the midst of his problems he had negative mental and physical reactions6. It does not, in the panel's view, extend to a finding that internal relocation would cause similar problems at this time. The panel is cognizant of the principal claimant's testimony that the elder minor claimant is doing better in Canada. While the panel understands the claimants' desires to remain in Canada to continue to heal here, this is not, in the panel's view, sufficient to find that internal relocation is not reasonably available to the claimants should they have no more than a mere possibility of persecution in the internal flight location.\n[12] As such, the panel finds it is not objectively unreasonable, in all of the circumstances, for the claimants to relocate to Faisalabad, should they face no more than a mere possibility of there\nIs it safe\n[13] The panel carefully considered the evidence and submissions and finds that there is no more than a mere possibility of persecution in Faisalabad. Counsel suggests in submissions that being 180 kms away from Lahore is not significant enough a distance from the claimants' problems. The panel does not agree that 180kms is not a significant distance. There is no specific distance an internal flight alternative must be for it to be considered, rather, evidence must establish that the risk is present in the proposed alternative. In this case, the panel finds the evidence does not support that the claimants would be at risk there.\n[14] The principal claimant does not know the name of the group that threatened the claimants after the elder claimant was pulled from the XXXX. They identified themselves as part of a dangerous group, but did not state which one. While there are extremist groups that are able to work throughout the country7, without knowledge of the nature of the group in this case, the panel finds there to be insufficient evidence to suggest that the persons or group the claimants fear have this capability, and would be willing or able to find the claimants in another city as large as Faisalabad. The panel notes that in recent articles submitted by the claimant's counsel, terrorist or violent actions taken by well-known or well-connected extremist groups are claimed by said groups8, which mirrors other country documentation about the methods of these groups9.\n[15] Furthermore, the panel does not find there is sufficient credible evidence that whatever group the persons associated with the XXXX may have been from would have an ongoing interest in the claimants. The claimants withdrew the elder minor claimant from the XXXX. While there may have been some concern that the claimants would take action against the people trying to recruit children at the XXXX by telling other parents of the activities or by undertaking other actions initially, it is unclear why this would be an ongoing concern that would lead this group to hunt down the claimants in another city. Similarly, the group may have seen promise in the capabilities of the elder minor claimant such that they took special efforts to\nmaintain their access to him, but it is unclear why this special interest would be so significant as to include efforts to find the claimants after relocation.\n[16] There is evidence to suggest such efforts are not underway or likely. The claimants have family remaining in Pakistan, including a brother-in-law with whom they stayed in Lahore after leaving their home. The claimant was asked if the dangerous group had contacted anyone else in their family including this brother-in-law, and she stated she did not know. The claimant has been in contact with this brother-in-law in order to obtain documents for her refugee claim. The panel would expect that if the group had been in contact with family members trying to find the claimant, she would have been told. Having made no apparent efforts to find the claimants through family members suggests limited interest or ability in the group finding them. Similarly, the claimant stated their servant from Pakistan has been to her family home to gather documents on their behalf. She testified that the servant accessed their home through a shared roof with her neighbor, as the neighbor knew the servant and let him in. The servant did not see evidence that anyone had attempted to enter the home, nor did the neighbors tell the servant of any concerns. While the claimant stated that the area has big houses and so neighbors would not look at other houses, the panel finds that the lack of evidence from the servant or neighbors of anyone looking for the claimants or attempting to enter the home is not insignificant in attempting to determine the efforts the agents of persecution would take to find the claimants should they relocate 180 kms away to a city of over three million people. Finally, the panel notes the principal claimant's husband remains in Pakistan. While he is stated to be in hiding, the claimants have been in contact with him since arriving in Canada. He has not stated that the group has attempted or succeeded in finding him in Pakistan since the incident in Islamabad. The panel would expect, had this happened, he would have told his wife, particularly as this would be relevant for her refugee claim. The principal claimant was also unable to tell the panel details of his efforts to hide from the group such that the panel could determine that it was these efforts rather than a lack of interest or ability that explains the lack of contact.\nCounsel submits that the claimants' experience in Islamabad suggests that the dangerous group is looking for the claimants. The panel disagrees. The evidence suggests that the elder minor claimant and his father were at a medical clinic when one of the extremists from the XXXX in Lahore came in, walked past them, and went to the desk. The claimants left, and the extremist followed them out and attempted to harm them. The principal claimant admitted at the hearing that they did not know if the person was there on purpose to find the claimants or just happened to have entered the same place. Given the lack of other evidence of the group attempting to find the claimants, the panel finds this one incident that is not clearly related to attempts to find the claimants is insufficient to find the unknown group would make and be successful in continued efforts to find the claimants in another city, twice the size of Islamabad. Similarly, if the meeting was by chance, the panel finds such a chance encounter would be less likely in a significantly larger city.\n[17] For these reasons, the panel finds there to be an internal flight alternative for the claimants to Faisalabad as there is insufficient evidence to establish the claimants would face more than a mere possibility of persecution should they relocate there.\n[18] Having found they do not face more than a mere possibility of persecution, the panel finds they are also unlikely to face a risk to their life, risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture in that city.\n[19] Therefore, I find the claimants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection and their claims under section 96 and 97 of the IRPA fail.\nCONCLUSION\n[20] There is not a serious possibility of persecution and the claimants would not be subjected personally, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or\npunishment, or a danger of torture, should they return to Pakistan. Accordingly, the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n[21] The claims are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"K. Pike\"\nK.

They fear returning to Colombia due to their fear of the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) revolutionary group. The principal claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX states that she was kidnapped by the FARC in 2003, and that she and her husband were further threatened with death by the FARC in XXXX and XXXX of 2016.\n[2] The claimants say that there is no state protection for them in Colombia, and that there is no safe place for them anywhere in Colombia.\nIdentity\n[3] The claimants all provided their Colombian passports1.\n[4] On a balance of probabilities, the panel is satisfied that the claimants are citizens of Colombia, and that they are the persons who they claim to be.\nCredibility\nDelay in claiming\n[5] The principal claimant states that she received a visitor visa to Canada in 2013, valid for ten years. The claimant was asked why she and her family had waited until 2016 to leave their country. She answered that she left as soon as she had arranged safety for her son, who now lives with his father in the United States. It was pointed out to the claimant that she had testified that her son left Colombia in XXXX, 2013, and that therefore she did not leave Colombia \"as soon as\" she had arranged for her son to find safety outside Colombia. The claimant had no explanation for having waited from XXXX, 2013 until XXXX, 2016 to leave her country.\n[6] The principal claimant was asked what was different in 2016 that caused her to leave Colombia then instead of after her son had been safely removed from Colombia in XXXX, 2013. The claimant said that in 2016 she had begun to receive threatening telephone calls.\n[7] The principal claimant testified that she received three threatening phone calls in XXXX, 2016. She stated that the phone calls contained threats that she would be killed. She states that she honestly believed at the time that her life was at risk. The claimant was then asked why she had waited some four and a half months to leave at the end of XXXX if she truly believed in XXXX that her life was at risk. She said that the conditions were not favourable, and that she had to renew her passport. She said that she wanted to leave things in order before leaving her country. She did not explain how the conditions were not favourable. The panel accepted her explanation that the principal claimant had to renew her passport before she could leave Colombia.\n[8] The claimant had been sponsored for immigration to the United States by her first husband. An immigrant visa was issued to her in XXXX, 2005, but she did not emigrate to the United States at that time or later. She explained that the relationship with her husband had broken down and that she did not want to resume her relationship with her first husband. She added that an opportunity arose in Bogota where she had obtained a new job with an employer who provided her with security. The claimant said that her fear in 2005 was the same fear that she had felt in 2003, yet she failed to take advantage of the immigrant visa to the U.S. It was pointed out to the claimant that she could have immigrated to the United States for her safety and the safety of her son and then separated from her first husband. The claimant's only stated reason for not leaving Colombia at that time was that she did not have anyone to help her in the United States.\n[9] The principal claimant stated that she was kidnapped by the FARC in 2003. She was a captive of the guerrilla group for some XXXX days, after which she was released. Her captors were captured, prosecuted, convicted and sent to jail. She was unable to say how long the prison sentences of the kidnappers were.\n[10] The principal claimant testified that she considered leaving the country after her kidnapping ordeal in 2003, and she had an opportunity to leave in 2005 when her then husband obtained for her a U.S. immigration visa. She decided against leaving Colombia at that time, due to the deteriorated state of her relationship with her then husband, and also because she had found a new job in Bogota and her employer provided increased security for her.\n[11] In 2010, the principal claimant said that she and her current husband XXXX began community work in the City of XXXX with a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX named XXXX XXXX. They received threatening phone calls from the FARC and were forced to leave XXXX in 2012 after roughly a year and a half in that city. The claimant was asked why, if the community work she was doing was so offensive to the FARC, she would be threatened and not Mr. XXXX. She stated that the FARC has a long memory and that it never forgets those whom it has targeted. This contradicts her assertion that she faced no problem with the FARC between 2003 and 2012. The claimant could provide no other explanation as to why the FARC could single out her and her husband for targeting and not target Mr. XXXX for essentially the same work which would carry the same degree of offensiveness to the FARC. Mr. XXXX did eventually receive threats for the same work beginning around 2015. The principal claimant believed that the FARC was still pursuing her as a follow-up to the FARC persecution of 2003 when she was kidnapped.\n[12] In the absence of a satisfactory explanation, the panel found it implausible that the principal claimant would be targeted in 2003, and that she could then escape being targeted by the FARC from 2003 to 2012, and then she and her husband would be targeted anew by the FARC because of their community work, whereas their co-worker Mr. XXXX was not similarly targeted at the time for doing the same work. The allegation that the FARC was continuing its persecution begun in 2003 was speculative and not grounded in any continuity or pattern of targeting by the FARC. The claimants agreed that Mr. XXXX was a more prominent target because of his profile as a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The evidence that the claimants were targeted in 2012 and yet that the more prominent person who participated in the same community work would not be targeted for that work for another three years is not reasonable. The panel does not accept that the claimants were targeted by the FARC in 2012.\n[13] The principal claimant stated that the reason she, her husband and their daughter left Colombia in 2016 and not in 2005 when she had a visa permitting her to enter the United States of America is that the situation worsened for her beginning around the first week of XXXX, 2016, when she began to receive threatening phone calls from the FARC. She did not report these threats to the authorities in Colombia.\n[14] In paragraph 19 of her narrative, the principal claimant declared that she changed her appearance after being kidnapped by the FARC in 2003. She testified that she changed her hair colour and started to wear glasses. The claimant provided no evidence at the hearing of the changed appearance. Her counsel sent in four photos after the hearing purporting to illustrate the changed appearance of the principal claimant. The photos contain images of numerous people, and the persons who appear in the photos are not identified. There is no affidavit accompanying the photos to assist in identifying the important persons in the photos. The tribunal cannot be sure which are images of the principal claimant and which are images of other people. The dates of the photos are not provided. There is no discernible evidence as to what the claimant's appearance was before the incident in 2003, and what it was after. The panel was unable to attribute any weight to the photos.\n[15] The letter from counsel attempts to identify and explain the photos, but it is not proper for counsel to be both counsel and witness in this proceeding. The evidence as proffered is not helpful to the tribunal, it is late in being provided, and there is no explanation as to why the evidence was not provided at or prior to the hearing on August 2nd, as required by Rule 36(c). The tribunal rejects the post-hearing evidence and it is not entered into evidence.\nFailure to claim elsewhere\n[16] The claimants were in the United States from XXXX XXXX, 2016, to XXXX XXXX, 2016. The claimants had an opportunity to seek asylum in the US, but they did not. The panel finds that the claimants did not offer a reasonable explanation for why they did not apply for asylum in the US. It is reasonable to assume a person with a well-founded fear of persecution will attempt to apply for refugee protection without unreasonable delay. The claimants sojourned in the USA for nearly two weeks. The panel asked the claimants for an explanation. The claimants spent thirteen days in the United States prior to coming to Canada. The claimants were asked why they did not ask for protection in the United States. The principal claimant answered that her family is here in Canada. The panel had to remind the principal claimant that she has two half-sisters in Canada, whereas her 16-year-old son resides in the United States. The principal claimant went on to say that her wish is to have her son with her. This was a contradiction. If the claimant wished to be reunited with her son, she could have and should have made a claim for protection in the United States. Making a claim in Canada is not a sure way of being reunited with one's son in the United States.\n[17] In the Gomez Bedoya decision, the Federal Court held that:\nThe fact remains that the U.S. has ratified the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, and there is no reason to believe it does not abide by its obligations. The fact that the rate of successful applications may be lower there than in Canada does not justify the applicants' failure to seek refugee protection in the U.S. The Board could certainly take that factor into consideration in assessing Mrs. Bedoya's subjective fear: Breucop v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2004 FC 117; Pissareva v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2000] F.C.J. No. 2001 (F.C.T.D.).\n[18] The panel finds that it is unreasonable that the claimants made no attempts to try to file for asylum in the US when there was no guarantee that they would be granted refugee protection in Canada. If they were genuinely fleeing Colombia in fear of being persecuted, they could have and should have sought protection in the United States.\n[19] The fact that the claimants may have relatives in Canada is not an adequate explanation for failing to claim in a country which is a signatory to the Refugee Convention2. The failure of the claimants to claim in the United States is an important factor in assessing the alleged subjective fear of the claimants. The claimants have shown a lack of subjective fear in their delay in leaving Colombia, and in their failure to make a claim in the United States. The panel draws a negative inference as to the credibility of the claimants. On that point, Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer said the following in Kamana v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] F.C.J. No. 1695 (QL), at paragraph 10:\n\"The lack of evidence going to the subjective element of the claim is a fatal flaw which in and of itself warrants dismissal of the claim, since both elements of the refugee definition-subjective and objective-must be met.\"\n[20] The claimants lack subjective fear of being persecuted in Colombia.\nDocumentary Evidence\n[21] The claimants provided a written statement from XXXX XXXX3. Although he was apparently a witness to the troubles experienced by the claimants, his letter speaks to his own current problems in Colombia, but does not provide any insight into what happened to the claimants or himself in 2012, when the claimants moved away from XXXX. As such, the letter has little probative value, and the tribunal accords it little weight.\n[22] There is also a letter from a clinical psychologist Dr. XXXX XXXX4. The letter deals with the after-effects of the principal claimant's kidnapping in 2003, and how she suffered with post-traumatic stress and anxiety. The principal claimant apparently resumed her therapy from XXXX, 2013 to XXXX, 2016, but the psychologist reports \"minimal use of tools\" by the principal claimant. The letter offers no explanation as to what the principal claimant experienced in Colombia in 2016, or why the claimants came to Canada in 2016. The letter can therefore be afforded little weight.\n[23] The claimants stated that they were threatened in XXXX 2016 by two persons on a motorcycle. This incident reflects the high rate of crime prevalent in Colombia, but there is no link between what appears to be an attempted robbery and the claimants' fear of persecution.\nThe panel concludes that the claimants lack subjective fear, an essential element of credibility. The testimony and evidence put forward by the claimants is neither credible nor trustworthy.\nState Protection\n[24] By the principal claimant's own testimony, she received the protection of the state when she was kidnapped in 2003. Her kidnappers were caught. They were prosecuted. Then the kidnappers were convicted and, finally, they were sentenced to prison sentences. The principal claimant does not recall the length of the prison sentences. Thereafter, the principal claimant enjoyed some seven years of relative peace, for according to her the FARC did not contact her again until 2010.\n[25] When the principal claimant was threatened by the FARC again in XXXX, 2016, the claimant did not contact the authorities to seek help.\n\"An applicant for refugee protection is required to demonstrate that he or she took all objectively reasonable efforts, without success, to exhaust all courses of action reasonably available to them, before seeking refugee protection abroad (Hinzman, 2007 FCA 171, above, at para 38; Dean v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2009 FC 772, at para 20; Salamon, above, at para 5). Among other things, this requires claimants for refugee protection \"to approach their home state for protection before the responsibility of other states becomes engaged\" (Ward, [1993] 2 SCR 689, at para 25.\"5\n[26] In this instance, the claimants did not approach their home state for protection, nor did they have an explanation for failing to contact the authorities. Given her previous experience, the principal claimant cannot be heard to say that there was no expectation of state protection. The principal claimant had received better than adequate state protection when the state was approached in 2003, and no reason was articulated as to why the claimants failed to approach the state again in 2016 when threatening phone calls were received and an attempted robbery was committed against them. The panel finds that the claimants had an obligation to seek national protection before asking for international protection. The claimants had no reason to believe that state protection was not forthcoming in 2016, and the failure to seek state protection in 2016 is determinative of these claims.\nCONCLUSION\n[27] The Federal Court has ruled that:\nThe lack of evidence going to the subjective element of the claim is a fatal flaw which in and of itself warrants dismissal of the claim, since both elements of the refugee definition-subjective and objective-must be met6.\n[28] In light of the findings of the panel with respect to the lack of subjective fear of the claimants, the Board finds that the claimants have not satisfied their burden of establishing that there is a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground.\n[29] There are no substantial grounds to believe that the removal of these claimants to Colombia would subject them personally to a danger of torture, or that, on a balance of probabilities, they would be personally subjected to a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture if they were to return to Colombia. The panel therefore rejects their claims under Sections 96 and 97 of the Act.\n[30] The panel concludes that the claimants XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX are not Convention Refugees, nor are they persons in need of protection, and the Division rejects their claims.\n(signed)\n\"R.

This also means that it must not be possible to get protection from this persecution or risk from Albanian authorities and, further, that there is no other place within Albania where he could live safely and that it would be reasonable to do so under the circumstances particular to him.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] The panel finds that the claimant is not a Convention Refugee or a person in need of protection. Reasons for this determination follow.\nALLEGATIONS\n[5] The claimant's allegations were set out in his Personal Information Form (PIF), received May 9, 2012.3\n[6] He alleges that land registry offices burned during the 1997 civil war in Albania, and that a locally powerful family, the XXXX family, was later allocated some of his family's land, using forged deeds.\n[7] In XXXX 2000 the claimant made a refugee claim in the United States on political grounds and resided there for more than a decade.\n[8] The claimant alleges that in 2003 one of his cousins in Albania bought land from one XXXX XXXX (\"XXXX\") and built a house on it. A few years later XXXX two brothers returned from overseas and disputed the sale. In 2008 this cousin was assaulted by the XXXX and hospitalized. The police would not take action, so the claimant's brother, XXXX, attacked one of the XXXX brothers, leaving him paralyzed. The claimant alleges that a blood feud posing a threat to all male members of his family was declared over this incident and that subsequent efforts by his family in Albania to reconcile this dispute with the XXXX family were not successful.\n[9] The claimant lost his asylum claim in the US in 2011 and was deported to Albania, where he went into seclusion at the home of a relative in the town of XXXX to prevent being targeted in the blood feud. Shortly afterward, a nephew was driving him to a nearby church to talk to the priest about making a financial offer to end the feud, when they were ambushed by the XXXX brothers who fired guns at them. The nephew maintained control of the car and drove away, dropping the claimant at the church. The priest then helped the claimant get to another hiding place in XXXX. When the priest's offer to the XXXX was rejected, the claimant resolved to seek refugee protection in Canada. He did so on or about XXXX XXXX, 2012.\nANALYSIS\n[10] The determinative issue in this claim is credibility.\nNexus\n[11] I find no nexus between the risks identified by the claimant and his race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. While the evidence indicates that his alleged risk is linked to his family membership, there is no evidence to indicate that the inter-family dispute has a linkage to a Convention ground. The genesis of the dispute which he alleges places him at risk is clearly one concerning property and related reciprocal criminal attacks.\n[12] Accordingly, this assessment has been conducted only with respect to subsection 97(1) of the Act, which employs a test of balance of probabilities in assessing forward looking and personalized risk to life, risk of torture by or with the consent of the state or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nIdentity\n[13] The claimant's identity as a national of Albania is established by a copy of his passport of Albania found at Exhibit 1.4\nCredibility\n[14] When a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness.5\n[15] Serious credibility issues arose in the claimant's testimony concerning the two central events in his risk narrative and these credibility issues were ultimately determinative of this claim.\nBlood Feud Beginnings\n[16] The first event is the attack by the claimant's brother, XXXX, on one of the XXXX brothers, which resulted in that individual receiving a very serious injury. It is this event, the claimant alleges, which caused the XXXX family to declare the blood feud which poses a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Albania.\n[17] At the outset of the hearing, the claimant testified that the person who was stabbed by XXXX was XXXX XXXX (\"XXXX\"). He testified that XXXX brothers, nephews and cousins are the ones seeking revenge for XXXX resulting paralysis. Asked to identify some of these individuals, he named XXXX and XXXX XXXX, and was able to estimate their ages. He gave other details about the XXXX family, including the village where they are principally based, that they are principally engaged in agriculture but have other economic interests including owning stores in XXXX, selling clothing and household items, and also engaging in importing items from Europe.\n[18] Later in the hearing the claimant was asked again to name the XXXX brother who was injured by his brother XXXX. He responded, \"It was XXXX. I think before I said it is XXXX, but it is XXXX.\" He then confirmed that it is XXXX who was stabbed by his brother XXXX and is now XXXX XXXX XXXX as a result of XXXX.\n[19] The claimant was read a portion of the letter from the National Committee on Reconciliation (\"CNR\") which identifies XXXX XXXX as the individual paralyzed.6 The claimant made no reply. The panel asked if the information in above-referenced evidence was wrong. After another long pause, the claimant testified that he believes the CNR \"got the name wrong.\" He then stated \"at the beginning I said XXXX, but then I said XXXX. I was confused, but it is XXXX.\" The panel asked the claimant if he knew which brother was injured. He testified \"We all heard it was XXXX but there (referring to CNR letter) it says XXXX. The panel asked him again if he knew who was injured. After a long silence, he stated that it was XXXX XXXX, and that he had heard this from his brother and from other family members. Shortly afterward, he was questioned about the letter from the village elder7 which also names XXXX as the victim, and he again changed his testimony to accord with that evidence.\n[20] The claimant testified during the hearing that he has been depressed, and away from family for a long time, and that these factors have impaired his memory. The panel notes that there is no objective or expert evidence before it to support a finding that the claimant's memory is impaired owing to medical or mental health issues or for any other reason, and did not find this to be an adequate explanation for the repeated changes in his testimony.\n[21] Counsel for the claimant, in post hearing submissions received October 2, 2015, submitted that the XXXX family is large, which may account for the claimant's confusion of names concerning who was attacked and paralyzed; that the claimant had not personally encountered the XXXX brothers since 1997 so his familiarity with them was limited, and further that he was away from Albania for many years, inclusive of the period that these events which led to the beginning of the blood feud occurred and therefore had his information second hand. Counsel also submits that the claimant only remained in Albania for a period of nine months before leaving to Montenegro and then Canada and this short sojourn may also be a factor in explaining his lack of clarity as to the facts surrounding the blood feud.\n[22] In regard to the submission that the claimant had no recent personal contact with the XXXX family, the panel notes his testimony that he knew XXXX and XXXX when he was young; in his 20's when he returned from military service and also when he was in Italy in the 1990's and going back and forth to Albania. This testimony indicates that he knew the two brothers intermittently but over a long period of time. In this circumstance, the panel gives little weight to the submission that the claimant's inability to consistently state which of the two was the victim of his brother's attack can be ascribed to his lack of familiarity with the two men.\n[23] The panel also notes that the claimant has submitted supporting evidence at Item 5.18 which consistently identifies the victim as XXXX XXXX. These documents were issued in 2014, and, on a balance of probabilities, passed through the claimant's hands on their way into the evidentiary record, or in the alternative, were available for his review since that time. If the claimant was previously unsure of the identity of the victim for whom the blood feud was initiated, receipt of these documents might reasonably have been expected to clarify his knowledge in the period since they were issued in 2014.\n[24] Further, the panel notes the claimant alleges that he personally undertook to resolve the blood feud with the XXXX family when he was in Albania in 2011. The panel finds that in order to make such an attempt, he would, on a balance of probabilities, have had to be reasonably well-informed of the events underpinning the blood feud, and at a minimum, would be fully cognizant of the identity of the victim for whom blood revenge was being sought. In light of this allegation of direct involvement in seeking to resolve the dispute, the panel finds the claimant's inconsistent testimony regarding the identity of the victim constituting the basis of the blood feud to support a finding that his testimony is neither credible nor reliable.\n[25] Finally, the panel notes that after this contradictory testimony began, the claimant was specifically asked by the panel if he knew which XXXX brother had been injured. He had an opportunity at that point to indicate that he was not certain, but he did not. He paused for a time, then re-stated that the injured individual was XXXX XXXX; that his brother and other family members had told him so. Shortly after, he was questioned in regard to the letter from the village elder, and changed this evidence again.\n[26] For the reasons stated above, the panel finds that neither the size of the XXXX family, nor the claimant's limited recent personal interaction with the XXXX family, nor the fact that the claimant had been away from Albania for many years, including at the time that the attack which caused the alleged blood feud to be declared, nor his relatively short stay in Albania nor his state or mind, nor all of these factors taken together are sufficient to adequately explain the claimant's abrupt reversal of testimony in regard to the identity of the victim of his brother XXXX attack, and subsequent re-reversal when confronted with his own supporting evidence. This is particularly true when it is considered that this event, which triggered the alleged blood feud, lies at the heart of his claim for protection.\n[27] Counsel for the claimant submits that the claimant changed his evidence only after two hours of giving testimony, and that exhaustion may have been a factor in his contradictory evidence. The panel gives this submission little weight, noting that two hours is not an over-long time to answer questions in a hearing, and that witness fatigue was not raised as an issue in the course of the hearing.\n[28] Finally, counsel submits9 that the claimant's lack of education (grade eight) and sophistication, as well as his lack of fluency in English should be taken into account in assessing problems in his testimony. Counsel submits that although the claimant elected to give his testimony in English, counsel was not aware of his degree of fluency in English, because he had always communicated with his client in Albanian. He submits that he did not raise a concern about the claimant's fluency in English in the course of the hearing, because it was only after listening to the audio transcript post-hearing that counsel came to conclude that the claimant was not explaining things very clearly. Counsel points to one or two specific areas in the audio transcript where a question had to be repeated or simplified for the claimant.\n[29] As noted by counsel in submissions, the claimant has lived in the US for 11 years and in Canada for about three years at the time of the hearing of this claim. He declined to use the interpreter provided and he did not at any time in the course of the hearing state that he was experiencing difficulties communicating in English. These facts and the audio transcript all support a finding that he was able to understand and respond to questions posed in English during the hearing.\n[30] The panel accepts that the claimant has only eight years of formal education and has given this some consideration in weighing inconsistencies and contradictions in his evidence. Against this, however, the panel has also weighed evidence that the claimant, at the age of forty seven, is sufficiently experienced to have traveled to both the USA and to Canada to advance refugee claims, voluntarily gave his testimony in English at the hearing, and was employed, over his years in the US in a variety of occupations including as the \"XXXX XXXX XXXX\" of a XXXX in Florida for a period of almost two years.10 This employment description, in particular, implies a degree of business knowledge and general ability, which weighs against counsel's submission that the claimant is so unsophisticated that inconsistencies in his evidence central to his risk narrative can be attributed in a substantial manner to this factor in conjunction with his level of education.\n[31] The panel rejects counsel's submission that the claimant may have failed to understand some of the questions put to him. The panel rephrased or simplified questions when necessary. The panel has reviewed a specific example referenced by counsel, in which the claimant's response to the question of whether there is a difference between revenge killings and blood feuds suggests he may not have clearly understood the question. In follow up, the panel simplified the question by asking him to explain why the dispute between his family and the XXXX family is described as a blood feud when no one was killed. His response here was more to the point, and the panel then moved on. The panel finds little evidence to support a finding that the claimant did not clearly understand questions in areas of his testimony which are now central to this credibility determination.\n[32] Having considered the claimant's testimony inconsistent testimony as to whether XXXX or XXXX was the victim of an attack by the claimant's brother which caused the XXXX family to declare a blood feud against the claimant's family, the panel concludes that his contradictory testimony in regard to a central fact has not been adequately explained by the claimant. The panel draws a negative inference in regard to the reliability of the claimant's testimony, and in regards to the credibility of the alleged blood feud which lies at the heart of this claim.\nAttack on Claimant\n[33] The second major credibility issue is still more serious in the panel's view since it involves testimony concerning events the claimant alleges he personally experienced while in Albania in 2011. In his PIF he alleges that:\n. . . Eager to resolve the blood feud, I got my sister's son to drive me to the church to talk to the priest. We were ambushed by two of the XXXX brothers. We were shot at. My sister's son managed to keep control of the car and drive away. Fearing that we would be followed, my nephew dropped me off at the church . . . Then with the help of the priest, I was driven to a hiding place in the town of XXXX. . . .11\n[34] In his testimony the claimant stated that at the time this shooting happened, his nephew was sitting in the car while he, the claimant, was about ten metres away and walking towards the car. He testified that the shooting happened after he had talked to the priest. The claimant then testified that his nephew told him to get in the car and he did, at which time his nephew drove away very fast. This evidence was reviewed with him and he confirmed that it was correct.\n[35] He then went on to testify that his nephew drove him to XXXX - a town in the mountains with a population of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and returned him to the same house from where he had set out that day. He remained there until he left for Montenegro on XXXX XXXX, 2012. This testimony was reviewed with the claimant, and he confirmed his testimony.\n[36] The panel put it to the claimant that in his PIF he indicates that his nephew dropped him at the church after the shooting, contrary to his testimony that his nephew drove him to XXXX. He testified \"I remember now, he dropped me at the church, then he called police and some others and then in the night time they took me to XXXX.\"\n[37] Asked why he had changed his testimony, he responded that he was confused. The panel did not find this explanation sufficient to account for the discrepancy given the claimant had confirmed his previous testimony several times. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant's testimony here as to his movement in the immediate aftermath of the alleged shooting is not consistent and is not credible.\n[38] The claimant was asked why, in his PIF, he states that with the help of the priest he was driven to a hiding place in XXXX after this incident, not taken to XXXX as he had testified. He initially testified \"they are the same -they are joined together - I stayed at another place\" and when asked again why his PIF narrative says he went to XXXX, he testified \"yes, but then I went back to XXXX - I stayed in the same place, XXXX, the whole time.\n[39] He later testified that the distance between XXXX and XXXX is 45 minutes on foot, or 20 minutes by car, because it is mountain terrain. Still later, he testified that the distance between the two locations is 20-25 minutes on foot. When this latter contradiction was put to him, he testified that there are two roads and one of them is shorter. In all of this testimony the panel found, that the claimant was not consistent or credible in relating events he alleges he has personally experienced. The panel draws a serious negative inference in regard to the claimant's credibility generally, and the credibility of the shooting attack which is central to his risk narrative, as a result of these numerous contradictions and inconsistencies.\n[40] The panel notes that counsel has submitted additional post hearing documents and maps in an attempt to clarify the claimant's testimony in regard to the relative locations referenced in his testimony. The panel has considered counsel's documents and written submissions,12 but finds that, taken together, these are not sufficient to resolve the numerous contradictions in the claimant's testimony concerning this central event in his risk narrative.\n[41] As another example, given he had testified that the shooting took place after he saw the priest, the claimant was asked about his nephew's declaration13 in which it is made quite clear that the shooting occurred before they arrived at the church. After a long pause, the claimant testified that his nephew is correct and the shooting happened before he had arrived at the church. Asked why he had previously testified to the contrary, the claimant submitted that, having been away from his family and having experienced depression, his memory is poor. In his written submissions, counsel also notes that shock arising from the event itself may have played a part in his memory problems. In the absence of objective evidence of memory impairment, the panel rejects this explanation as sufficient to explain the significant inconsistencies noted above - which are examples and not exhaustive - in his evidence concerning this alleged attempt on his life.\n[42] The panel concludes, on a balance of probabilities, that the inconsistencies and contradictions in the claimant's testimony in regard to this central event of his risk narrative are so great as to undermine his credibility. The panel finds that the serious credibility concerns identified in the claimant's testimony in regard to the origin of the blood feud and in regard to his own experiences while in Albania lead the panel to conclude, on a balance of probabilities, that the blood feud narrative put forward by the claimant is a fabrication in all respects.\nSupporting Documents\n[43] The panel is aware that another Immigration and Refugee Board (\"IRB\") decision maker has come to a different conclusion in regard to a similar narrative put forward by one of the claimant's brothers. In that case, the decision maker accepted, on a balance of probabilities, that a blood feud exists between the XXXX and XXXX families, citing supporting documents, which from the description which appears at Exhibit 5.1, tab 1314 appear to be similar or identical to the supporting documents adduced in this claim.\n[44] This panel is not bound by the other panel's conclusions in regard to the reliability of these documents, and has considerable grounds to find to the contrary, given the claimant's lack of consistency and thus credibility in regard to the two central aspects of his claim, as detailed above. In addition, recent objective documentary evidence found in the National Documentation Package15 and considered in this hearing contains documentary evidence in regard to the widespread issuance of falsified documents on blood feuds in Albania.\n[45] In regard to the supporting documents submitted in support of this claim, the panel notes the following evidence at item 7.9 of NDP:16\n* that a 2011 undercover investigation found that some NGOs were routinely selling documents to Albania asylum seekers claiming the holders were involved in a blood feud even where no real conflict existed;\n* that XXXX XXXX, the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and the individual who has signed the claimant's attestation letter17 has been implicated in this practice;\n* that the statistics in regard to number of blood feuds as stated by the CNR are considered by several sources to be inflated, giving further cause to question the CNRs reliability;\n* that a number of reliable sources cited in this research document - including a representative of the Ombudsman in Shkoder - concur that police \"have seen many false documents\" and are actively investigating the activity of some volunteer organizations working in the field of blood feud reconciliation;\n* that, according to the Swedish Migration Integrity Board, the CNR was the organization most frequently mentioned by sources they consulted in Albania as being linked to the issuing of false attestation letters;\n* that an EU representative noted \"there may be corruption links between the volunteer organizations, the police, and municipalities\".18\n[46] Taken together, this evidence supports a finding that false documentation relating to blood feuds is widely available in Albania, has been linked to the CNR, and may involve complicity between a number of organizations including police and local governments. The panel particularly notes evidence here that\nThe official at the Honorary Consulate of Canada in Tirana stated in 26 February 2014 correspondence with the [IRB] Research Directorate that 12 people have been arrested in Shkoder city for issuing falsified documents on blood feuds, including the local secretary of the Reconciliation Committee.19\n[47] The claimant's inability to give consistent testimony in regard to the central aspects of his claim for protection, or consistent with supporting documents he has adduced, such as the declaration of his nephew20 and the priest21 as to the identity of the victim at the heart of the alleged blood feud, and whether the attack he alleges on himself occurred as he approached the church or departed the church and who drove him where afterwards - amongst others - is sufficient to lead the panel to conclude, on a balance of probabilities, that his claim is not credible, but is a fabrication. Since he is found wholly not credible in his risk allegations, his supporting documents are also impugned, and this finding gains additional support from relatively recent and detailed evidence concerning the wide spread availability of falsified documents pertaining to blood feuds in Albania.\nCONCLUSION\n[48] The panel concludes, for all of the reasons stated, that there is insufficient credible evidence on which it could conclude that the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution for any ground enumerated in the refugee Convention in Albania. Similarly, the panel finds insufficient credible evidence on which it can conclude that the claimant would face, on a balance of probabilities, a risk to his life, a risk of torture or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment on return to Albania.\n[49] The claim of XXXX XXXX is rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Lisa R.Devries\"\nLisa R.Devries\nJanuary 7, 2015\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Adjei v.

Fraser (in person)\nConseil du (de la) ministre\nREASONS FOR DECISION\nALLEGATIONS\n[1] The claimant states that he is a citizen of Eritrea. The claimant fears returning to Eritrea because of the persecutory application of universal national service conscription in Eritrea. The claimant also alleges a fear of persecution due to his having departed Eritrea illegally.\n[2] The claimant lived for seven years in Ethiopia without authorization. He fled Ethiopia in 2015 and arrived in Canada in October, 2015, and made an inland refugee claim around December of 2015. He alleges that the government of Eritrea will arrest him if he were to return to Eritrea. The claimant states that he would not be able to receive protection from the state in Eritrea, and that there is no safe place for him anywhere in Eritrea.\nANALYSIS\n[3] At the sitting of this hearing held on October 18th, 2016, the Minister's Representative from CBSA (Canada Border Services Agency) seized the claimant's national identity card, acting under the authority of ss. 140(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nIdentity\n[4] Identity was identified at the outset as a critical issue in the hearing. Identity is often a determinative issue. The claimant provided the original of his national identity card1 and copies of his birth certificate2 and of some school report cards3. He travelled to Canada on an Ethiopian passport4 which he stated was a forged passport.\n[5] The birth certificate was issued in 2010, and not at the time of the birth of the claimant. The claimant was asked why he did not have a birth certificate contemporaneous with his birth, and he answered that he did not know if an earlier birth certificate had ever been issued to his parents.\n[6] During the course of the hearing, the claimant put forward a number of documents seeking to establish his identity: a child health card5, a birth certificate6, and his school records7.\nThe claimant's national identity card\n[7] The claimant was questioned extensively about the validity and authenticity of his Eritrean identity card. The card was apparently issued in 2009 in Asmara, Eritrea. The claimant states that he moved to Ethiopia in 2008, and remained in Addis Ababa for seven years prior to coming to Canada. The claimant stated that the card was obtained by his parents and was forwarded to him in Ethiopia along with his student report cards. The panel pointed out to the claimant that his identity card lacked some of the essential characteristics of an authentic Eritrean identity card, as found in the document checker at exhibit 15.\n[8] The identity card proffered by the claimant is greenish in colour, rather than the blue of an authentic Eritrean identity card. An authentic identity card has the word ERITREA written in white letters as a background. The claimant's card displays no such background. The green seal on the back of the card is not symmetrical, and appears lopsided. The green seal is not round, as would be the case on an authentic card. Most significant, however, is the lack of writing on the plastic laminate. All authentic Eritrean identity cards, of which the panel has specialized knowledge, having seen more than twenty such identity cards, have the initials PGE printed on the laminate8. The letters PGE appear throughout the laminate over the card and even on the laminate borders outside the card. PGE is known to the Member to represent Provisional Government of Eritrea9. The identity card proffered by the claimant lacks this essential detail.\n[9] The card does not bear several of the essential elements of an authentic Eritrean national identity card. The claimant had no knowledge of the provenance of the card, other than to say it was obtained by his parents and sent to him. The claimant was unable to explain the many discrepancies between an authentic card and the card which he had produced.\n[10] The claimant testified that his national identity card was issued to his parents in Eritrea and forwarded to him by his parents. When asked directly if the national identity card had been issued by the proper Eritrean authorities, the claimant admitted that he did not know if that was the case. Even his counsel conceded in her submissions that the claimant did not procure the identity card himself, so he would not be able to account for the many discrepancies between an authentic card and the card which the claimant himself had provided to the Board.\n[11] The panel also notes that the claimant knew at the outset of the hearing, in February, 2016, that there were concerns about the authenticity of the card. Yet in the intervening period between the first and the last sittings of this hearing, namely between February and October, 2016, the claimant did nothing to inform himself about how the card had been procured or why it did not bear the hallmarks of an authentic identity card. The claimant either knew that the card was inauthentic, or he did not want to find out how a card containing so many errors could have been issued to the claimant's parents. In either case, the claimant clearly intended to rely on a deficient national identity card as proof of his identity, in the absence of an Eritrean passport. The panel drew a negative inference as to the claimant's credibility. The panel concludes that the ID card presented to the Board by the claimant is a fraud. The claimant either knows that the card is fraudulent, or he is indifferent to the deficiencies of the card and chooses to rely upon it nevertheless, having been made aware by the panel that it is not an authentic identity card from Eritrea.\nThe claimant's birth certificate\n[12] The claimant provided a birth certificate10 which bore all of the hallmarks of an authentic birth certificate. If the claimant is the same person as the child described in the birth certificate, then he was certainly born in Eritrea and may have had Eritrean citizenship as of the date of his birth. In this case, however, the birth certificate was issued in July, 2010, at a time when the claimant was already XXXX XXXX XXXX years old, and at a time when the claimant says he was residing in Ethiopia. In other words, the claimant did not have to provide proof of his identity to the authorities in Eritrea to have the birth certificate issued to him. The claimant did not know what documents had been presented to the authorities in Eritrea in order to procure the birth certificate. An Eritrean birth certificate does not have a photo attached to it, and there was no independent evidence that the birth certificate in evidence before the panel related to the individual who was actually present in the hearing room.\n[13] So even if the birth certificate is authentic, and even if an individual named XXXX XXXX XXXX was born in Asmara, Eritrea on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, there is no assurance that the person who appeared as claimant in this proceeding is the same person as indicated on the birth certificate. The credibility concerns explored below give the panel no reason to believe and the panel finds that this claimant is not the person named in the birth certificate. The panel attributes no weight to the birth certificate as far as establishing the identity of the claimant.\nThe claimant's other identity documents\n[14] The child health card11, which is essentially a record of vaccinations received by XXXX XXXX, the same name as the claimant says is his, contains a different date of birth XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX] than the date of birth declared by the claimant and found on his birth certificate [XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX]. At first the claimant explained that the difference could be attributable to the differences between the Ethiopian calendar and the Western or Gregorian calendar. The panel obtained a conversion of the birth date on the birth certificate into the correct date on the Ethiopian calendar12, and the claimant's contention that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in the Ethiopian calendar is the same as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in the Western calendar was shown to be incorrect. The date XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in the Western calendar corresponds to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in the Ethiopian calendar13. The claimant's only explanation was that the use of the sixth day and the sixth month on both documents could be a coincidence. In either case, the claimant's assertions and explanations did not correspond with reality.\n[15] The translation of the health card14 indicates that a child whose name is XXXX (no family name on the certificate) was vaccinated on XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. If the claimant was born on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, he could not have been vaccinated on XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX of the same year. In other words, either the claimant's testimony or his birth certificate contradict the vaccination certificate, or the vaccination certificate detracts from the authenticity of the birth certificate and the credibility of the claimant. The Board found that the claimant's incorrect explanations and assumptions undermined his credibility and the reliability of his purported identity documents.\n[16] The claimant provided three years' worth of school records15 for the years 2002-2003, 2003-2004 and 2007-2008, purporting to show that he was Eritrean by virtue of his having attended school in Eritrea in the relevant years. The name on the report cards are variously XXXX XXXX XXXX {2002-2003}, XXXX XXXX XXXX {2007-2008}, or XXXX XXXX XXXX {2003-2004}. The panel did not detect that the documents were not genuine.\n[17] The panel did detect, however, that the names of the students evaluated in the school records did not accord with the names the claimant has given himself. The panel recognizes that a child named XXXX can be called XXXX for short, as may have been the case for this claimant. For one thing, the claimant had never acknowledged using the nickname XXXX in his Generic immigration application form16. This failure to disclose his nickname undermined the credibility of the claimant. Based on the above credibility concerns, the panel finds that none of the claimant's documents are genuine.\n[18] The claimant stated that he thought that the school year in Eritrea began in the winter, but he was not sure. He was then asked in what month winter starts in Eritrea, and he could not be certain. He believed that the school year might begin in January and end in September, but he was not sure. He could not provide the month when winter begins in either the Eritrean (Ethiopian) or the Western calendar. The panel does not find it reasonable that a young man who had actually attended school for ten years in Eritrea could not remember in what month the school year begins, or in what month winter begins. The panel does not accept the claimant's answer which detracts from his credibility as an Eritrean national. The documentary evidence17 indicates that the school year begins in September.\n[19] The claimant's belief that the school year might begin in January and end in September is inconsistent with the notations on the school report cards, which begin in one year and end in another, such as 2002-2003 and 2007-2008. These notations are consistent with a school year that begins in September, and ends around June or July. They are also consistent with the NEUTRAL BODY documentary evidence18.\n[20] The school records are dated from the years 2002 to 2008. The school record for 2007-200819 indicates that the claimant was XXXX years old. If the age of the student was entered at the beginning of the school year, a student born in XXXX XXXX would have been XXXX years old in September, 2007. If the age of the student was entered onto the report card at the end of the school year, the claimant would likely have turned XXXX years old on XXXX XXXX, 2008. The claimant was asked, but he could not explain at what date his age was entered onto the report card, nor could he explain why his age was entered as being XXXX years of age when he was at least XXXX years old. If the report card was completed at the end of the academic year, and if the end of the school year fell after XXXX XXXX XXXX 2008, the claimant would have already turned XXXX years old.\n[21] While it is certainly possible that an error was made in the entry for 2008-2009, the same age discrepancy applied for each of the other report cards20. The report card for the year 2003-2004 states that the claimant was XXXX years old. In September, 2003, the claimant, if he was born in XXXX XXXX XXXX, as he states that he was, would have been XXXX years old. If the report card was completed at the end of the school year, which the panel finds more reasonable and therefore more likely, the claimant would have reached the age of XXXX by XXXX XXXX, 2004. The claimant was asked how the school could not have known the age of its student in consecutive report cards. The claimant could provide no explanation for any of these discrepancies.\n[22] Thus, despite the apparent authenticity of the report cards, the panel could not be certain that the cards applied to the claimant who was before it, as the claimant was adamant that he was born on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. If the claimant's testimony were to be believed, and if his birth certificate is correct that he was born on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, then the report cards proffered must not those of the claimant, but instead apply to someone who is between one and three years younger than the claimant. The panel finds that the report cards are inconsistent with the oral and other identity evidence of the claimant, and accords them no weight in establishing the identity of the claimant.\n[23] The claimant provided a letter of support from his brothers21. The letter was purportedly translated from another language, but there is no translator's certificate attesting to the language of the original, nor is there a copy of the original letter nor are there original signatures. The letter is undated. Pursuant to the Rules of the Refugee Protection Division, the panel is entitled to reject the document in question. Even if the panel were to accept the letter into evidence, there is nothing in the letter to confirm that the person who was the claimant before the panel is indeed the brother of the purported letter writers. Consequently, the panel was unable to accord any weight to the letter from the claimant's brothers in order to assist in identifying the claimant.\n[24] The claimant provided a copy of the Eritrean national identity card of his mother, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX along with a translation thereof22. The panel was of course unable to examine the mother's original identity card to establish its authenticity. Assuming the identity of the mother is established as Eritrean, the national identity card of the mother does not erase the fraudulent nature of the claimant's own national identity card, nor does it compensate for the credibility issues which arose in the testimony of the claimant, nor does it assist the panel in establishing the identity of the claimant who was before it. The mother's national identity card was of no assistance in identifying the claimant, and the panel attributed no weight to the document.\n[25] The claimant provided an affidavit dated February 16th, 2016, from XXXX XXXX XXXX, a Canadian citizen23. Prior to the claimant's arrival in Canada in October 2015, the deponent had not seen the claimant since 1998, or some eighteen years prior to the hearing. Ms. XXXX identified the claimant as a citizen of Eritrea born in 1989, and attached a photograph of the claimant to her affidavit. The affidavit does not address the question of how the deponent knows the year of birth of the claimant, since she does specify only the year of birth and not the exact date. Because the date of birth of the claimant is not established, and a possible birth date of XXXX XXXX is specifically contradicted by the school records and the vaccination certificate, the panel would have needed to hear from Ms. XXXX in order to establish the claimant's date of birth. Ms. XXXX did not testify, and was therefore not available to answer questions as to her knowledge of the claimant's date of birth and her knowledge as to where he has been living since she last saw him in 1998. The affidavit of Ms. XXXX cannot overcome the deficiencies and discrepancies in the testimony of the claimant. The deponent provided a reasonable explanation as to why she could not testify in person in February, but as there was no subsequent affidavit from her nor any reason given why she could not testify in person before the Board in October, and due to the lack of detail in the affidavit, the panel could only give limited weight to the affidavit of XXXX XXXX.\n[26] The claimant also presented in evidence a letter from the Association of Eritrean Jeberti Canada24, dated February 18th, 2016. The letter baldly states that the claimant is a member of the \"minority ethnic group of Jeberti\". The letter does not say how this was ascertained, what identity documents the claimant may have provided to the Association, what questions the Association asked the claimant in order to establish his identity, or any other detail that would assist the panel in identifying the claimant who appeared before it. The letter did not overcome the deficiencies in the claimant's identity documents or in the testimony of the claimant. The panel attributed no weight to the letter from the Association of Eritrean Jeberti Canada. The panel recognizes that the documentary evidence suggests that there is discrimination against Jeberti in Eritrea. There is insufficient evidence in this instance of a threat of persecution against the claimant because he is Jeberti. In any event, the panel made no finding as to whether the claimant is a member of the Jeberti ethnic group.\n[27] The claimant has a duty to provide reliable evidence of his identity. The panel notes that the claimant was assisted by a lawyer throughout his claim. There was every reason to believe that the claimant knew that he should provide reliable documents attesting to his identity, or give a reasonable explanation as to why he could not provide them. This was made clear to the claimant from the very first sitting. The claimant fell short in his obligation.\n[28] The Board has closely examined the claimant's testimony and determines that in light of the numerous contradictions and inconsistencies in said testimony, no probative value can be afforded to the contradictory documentary evidence submitted by the claimant (Ibnmogdad v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2004 F.C. 321. There is no duty on the tribunal to obtain an expert or forensic report to verify identity documents where there is sufficient evidence to cast doubt on the authenticity of the claimant's documents (Culinescu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1997), 136 F.T.R. 241; Kashif v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2003 F.C.T. 179. Here, the Board finds that there is ample evidence to doubt the authenticity of the claimant's identity documents.\n[29] The claimant relies on his original identity card, his birth certificate, three school records and an immunization certificate to prove his identity, as well as testimonial letters and an affidavit. As analyzed above, the Board has found that all these documents are defective or deficient in assisting to identify the claimant. The national identity card is found to be fraudulent. Therefore, the documents proffered by the claimant do not assist in establishing his identity, whether it be his personal identity, his national identity, or his ethnic identity.\n[30] The Minister's representative asked the claimant how old he was on the day of the October 18th sitting. The claimant stated that he was either XXXX XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX XXXX years old. The Minister then asked him which one it was. The claimant stated that he was XXXX XXXX XXXX. The Minister's representative pointed out that a person born on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, would have already reached the age of XXXX XXXX XXXX on October 18th, 2016. The claimant was asked why he did not know how old he was on the date of the hearing. The claimant stated that he made a mistake in calculating his age. The claimant's inability to remember his age weakened his credibility.\n[31] Section 104 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act states as follows:\nThe Refugee Protection Division must take into account, with respect to the credibility of a claimant, whether the claimant possesses acceptable documentation establishing identity, and if not, whether they have provided a reasonable explanation for the lack of documentation or have taken reasonable steps to obtain the documentation.\n[32] Rule 11 of the RPD Rules clearly requires claimants to provide acceptable documents establishing their identity. Documents which establish identity are interpreted as being broader than simple identity documents such as birth certificates, passports and identity cards. Also included would be documents that establish an individual's personal status such as religious, employment or school records.\n[33] Having considered the complete lack of reliable documentation to establish the claimant's identity and the lack of credibility of the principal claimant's testimony, the panel finds that the identity of the claimant has not been established.\n[34] A claim for refugee protection must be rejected as soon as the Board determines that the claimant's identity has not been established. The onus is on a claimant to prove his identity. This claimant has failed to establish his identity. The claimant has provided a fraudulent identity card. He has travelled on an Ethiopian passport which bears his name but which he says is not his. On a balance of probabilities, the claimant is not a citizen of Eritrea, and the panel considers that his identity and his nationality are unproven.\n[35] On a balance of probabilities, the claimant is not a citizen of Eritrea, and he is not who he says he is. The claimant has presented to the Board a fraudulent document to prove his identity, which document is relied upon by the claimant to prove his identity, and which document is rejected by the Board.\nCredibility\n[36] In the event the Board's finding on identity is found to be in error, the panel also relies on the lack of credibility of the claimant to disallow this claim.\n[37] The claimant said in his oral testimony that he was smuggled from Eritrea into Ethiopia across the heavily-defended border. He went to Adua, Ethiopia. He stayed in Ethiopia for some seven years, during which he supported himself with money sent to him by his brothers who were working in the Gulf States. The claimant provided no evidence of his long-term residence in Ethiopia. He could not provide rent receipts. He could not provide receipts for the money received from his brothers. He claims that he stayed with friends and did not pay rent. He was asked if he could provide letters from those friends to confirm what he was saying. He could not. Even after the hearing resumed twice, three and a half and eight months after the hearing began, the claimant had no letters or other evidence corroborating his sojourn in Ethiopia. The failure of the claimant to obtain such evidence undermined his credibility.\n[38] The claimant testified that he lived in Ethiopia from approximately September of 2008 to October 2015, a period of over seven years. Yet, aside from an improperly obtained Ethiopian passport, the claimant could provide no evidence of having lived in Ethiopia for over seven years. He could produce no receipts for his expenditures, no letters from those he lived with, no doctor's reports, no school records, no photographs, nothing that would have placed him in Ethiopia at the material times.\n[39] A claimant's negative credibility can extend to all of his evidence, including documents, and can extend to requests to their acquaintances to corroborate allegations already found to be not credible25.\n[40] As noted above, the Minister's representative asked the claimant how old he was on the day of the October 18th sitting. The claimant clearly did not know his own age, as alleged by him. The claimant stated that he made a mistake in calculating his age. The claimant's inability to remember his age weakened his credibility.\n[41] The Minister's representative also asked the claimant about the arrangements made by the smuggler in Ethiopia to procure an Ethiopian passport for the claimant. The claimant stated that he gave the smuggler two photographs, and that he did not attend at a government office to obtain the photographs. The Minister's representative pointed out that the Ethiopian NDP26 requires that applicants for Ethiopian passports attend at Ethiopian government offices to have their photos taken and that there must be four photos taken to obtain the passport. The Minister's representative also pointed out that the documentary evidence indicates that the passport application must be supported by two pieces of identity issued in Ethiopia. How, the Minister's counsel wondered, could the claimant have had an Ethiopian passport issued to him if he did not comply with the strict requirements of Ethiopian law? The claimant could not explain how he obtained a proper Ethiopian passport without the requisite photographs and supporting documents, as he claimed that the smuggler he had hired did all that was required to procure an Ethiopian passport for the claimant.\n[42] The claimant stated that he feared a return to Eritrea because of his Jeberti ethnic affiliation. He alleged in his BOC (Basis of Claim form) that Jeberti in Eritrea are mistreated, but he could not give a single example of how Jeberti are mistreated, despite being asked three times if he could identify any way in which the rights of Jeberti are not respected. The panel notes the documentary evidence that there is discrimination against Jeberti in Eritrea. The panel also notes that the claimant did not allege a single instance of discrimination in his past because of his ethnicity, and the claimant was unable to provide any evidence satisfactory to the panel that he might be persecuted in Eritrea due to his being a member of the Jeberti clan. The panel finds that the claimant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution in Eritrea due to his Jeberti origins.\n[43] The panel concludes that the claimant has not told the truth, as he had undertaken to do at the beginning of the hearing. Even if the panel has made erroneous conclusions on the matter of identity, this claim must fail due to the lack of credibility of the claimant.\nMINISTER'S INTERVENTION\n[44] The Minister of Public Safety intervened in order to show that the claimant's allegation that the Ethiopian passport he travelled on was not fraudulent. The Minister presented evidence 27 that the passport used by the claimant was a genuine Ethiopian passport, and that therefore the claimant could not be believed when he said he travelled on a fraudulent passport. The claimant conceded that the Ethiopian passport he used to travel to Canada was improperly obtained by him.\n[45] The Minister believes and alleges that the claimant is a citizen of Ethiopia. According to the Minister, a request28 had been made to Ethiopian authorities to determine the authenticity of the Ethiopian passport on which the claimant travelled. As of the date of the determination, however, the Minister had yet to produce the evidence it had been seeking for over four months. It was therefore impossible for the panel to make a definitive determination as to whether the Ethiopian passport used by the claimant was improperly obtained, as alleged by the claimant, or was a genuine passport issued to the claimant, who is therefore a citizen of Ethiopia, as alleged by the Minister.\nSection 97\n[46] Given the numerous inconsistencies in the evidence, the inability of the claimant to provide adequate evidence of his identity, and the overall lack of credibility, it was not necessary for the panel to conduct an inquiry into s. 97 protection concerns.\nManifestly Unfounded\n[47] In light of the above findings, the issue becomes whether there is any independent and credible documentary evidence in the record capable of supporting a positive disposition of the claim29.\n[48] Section 107.1 of the IRPA prescribes that if the Refugee Protection Division rejects a claim for refugee protection, it must state in its reasons for the decision that the claim is manifestly unfounded if it is of the opinion that the claim is clearly fraudulent. In this case the claimant provided a clearly fraudulent document, namely his Eritrean national identity card in support of his claim. The document was provided in support of the claimant's identity as a citizen of Eritrea. Given that the claimant travelled on an Ethiopian passport to Canada, and given his inability to establish his Eritrean identity other than through a fake identity card, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is not a citizen of Eritrea. The panel makes no finding on whether the claimant is a citizen of Ethiopia, as the Minister of Public Safety had not completed his inquiries into the authenticity of the Ethiopian passport at the time of the rendering of this decision.\n[49] Given that the claimant's false allegations were of a material or substantive nature and relevant for the determination of his claim, the panel also finds, on a balance of probabilities, that this claim is clearly fraudulent. Therefore, the panel finds that this claim is manifestly unfounded.\n[50] Based on all the above, it is clear, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant or his parents acting at his behest fabricated an identity document in seeking to bolster his claim for protection in Canada.\nCONCLUSION\n[51] The burden of establishing whether the claimant faces a serious possibility of being persecuted or is a person in need of protection lies upon the person asserting such allegations. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, and on the basis of the totality of documentary evidence disclosed, as well as on the basis of findings and negative inferences noted above, that the claimant failed to establish his identity. In any event, his failure to establish his identity is fatal to his claim. The claim is clearly fraudulent and therefore manifestly unfounded.\n[52] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel determines that the claimant has not established that there is a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground or that, on a balance of probabilities, he would personally be subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if he were to return to Eritrea.\n[53] The panel therefore concludes that the claimant is not a Convention refugee, and he is not a person in need of protection, and the Division rejects his claim and finds that his claim is manifestly unfounded.\n(signed)\n\"R.

The claimants are citizens of Haiti and are claiming refugee protection pursuant to ss. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.1\n[2] The principal male claimant has been appointed as the designated representative of the two (2) minor children, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. The panel has considered the Chairperson's Guideline 3 for Child Refugee Claimants and Guidelines 4 for Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution in order to render its decision.\nALLEGATIONS\n[3] The allegations of the claimants are those contained in their Basis of Claim Forms (\"BOC\").2 All female claimants fear gender based persecution. The principal female claimant alleges she was a victim of sexual violence in XXXX 2012. The principal male claimant fears persecution because of his religion. The principal male claimant alleges he is a XXXX and went XXXX in Haiti in XXXX 2007. The principal male claimant alleges he was attacked by thugs sent by other pastors because he represented a threat to them. All of XXXX XXXX family members also fear being persecuted because of the principal male claimant's religious profile. It is also alleged that the youngest child, XXXX XXXX, fears persecution because he is a Haitian minor and could be recruited by criminal gangs.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] The panel finds that the principal male claimant and his children have not established that they face a serious possibility of persecution in Haiti, or a risk to their life, or a danger of torture, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, if they were to return to Haiti. However, the panel finds compelling reasons not to return the principal female claimant to her country of origin. Therefore, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is a Convention refugee.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[5] The principal claimants have been living in the Bahamas since the 1990s with no permanent status. XXXX XXXX was born in Haiti and lived with her aunt until she joined her parents in 2006 in the Bahamas on a temporary visa which expired. Both XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX were born in the Bahamas but did not obtain Bahamian citizenship. The documentary evidence also confirms that children born in the Bahamas from Haitian parents do not automatically obtain the Bahamian citizenship.3 All claimants have a valid passport from Haiti4 and provided additional documentary evidence such as their birth certificate or expired Bahamian visa.5 Therefore, I find the claimants' identity as nationals of Haiti has been established, and that they have no citizenship or permanent status in the Bahamas.\nCredibility\n[6] The principal claimants' testimony was detailed and straightforward. They also delivered testimony with no inconsistencies related to the allegations of their BOCs. There were inconsistencies between the narrative of the principal claimants and their port-of-entry notes.6 However, both principal claimants explained how they had issues communicating with the interpreter and the agent at the port of entry. I also consider the fact that the principal female claimant was asked about sexual violence she experienced and felt stressed and very uncomfortable providing details of this incident at the port of entry. I find these reasons reasonable explanations of the inconsistencies between the claimants' narrative and port-of-entry notes. Therefore, I have not impugned the principal claimants' credibility because of these inconsistencies. Given these reasons, I find both principal claimants to be credible witnesses.\nThe risk of persecution for the principal male claimant\n[7] The principal male claimant alleges he was involved with the Church of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in Bahamas. He testified about the details of his involvement and how he became a XXXX. The principal male claimant also provided abundant documentary evidence about his religious involvement, such as XXXX XXXX and certificate of XXXX XXXX studies.7 The latest Bahamian visa of the principal male claimant also indicates he was a XXXX for the Church of XXXX XXXX. Given the overall evidence, I find the principal male claimant has established his profile as a XXXX of the Church XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[8] The principal male claimant also alleges he returned to Haiti in December 2007, because he felt compelled to XXXX in his own country during Christmas. He explained he returned to his hometown of La Croix where he XXXX at the Eglise XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The principal male claimant also alleges he XXXX in public places, wherever he would find people who would listen. The principal male claimant alleges in his narrative he XXXX every day for about two weeks and got a lot of attention in his home town.\n[9] The principal male claimant testified that during the night of XXXX XXXX, 2007, two (2) individuals stormed into his sister's home where he was staying. He explained he ran out as soon as he heard noises, suggesting this is what you do when this happens in Haiti. That night, Mr. XXXX cousin was attacked by these two (2) individuals who were asking for the principal male claimant. Mr. XXXX cousin was severely beaten and suffered important injuries. The principal male claimant explained he fled to the city of Port de Paix and went into hiding until he left the country on January 3rd, 2008. Mr. XXXX testified that members of his family told him it was local XXXX who sent these individuals because of the threats he was representing to them. Because of this incident, the principal male claimant alleges he cannot return to Haiti, as he would likely be targeted as a new XXXX presenting a threat to the other XXXX XXXX who treat their XXXX as a business. Given that I found Mr. XXXX to be credible, I do believe he was targeted in an attack on XXXX XXXX, 2007. I also find on a balance of probabilities that the principal male claimant was targeted because he was XXXX in his local community of La Croix. However, I find that Mr. XXXX has an internal flight alternative in Port-de-Paix where he would not face a serious possibility of persecution, for the following reasons.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA) on the religious ground (all family members)\n[10] The IFA is a two (2)-prong test. Under the first prong, I initially have to consider if the claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution in the proposed IFA. Afterwards, I have to evaluate whether it would be reasonable for the claimant to move to the proposed location.\n[11] While I find it credible that the principal male claimant was attacked in La Croix due to the competition his XXXX caused with the other XXXX, I do not find that he would face the same harm in Port-de-Paix. The documentary evidence relating to the country conditions in Haiti reports that religious freedom is widely tolerated in this country.8 The general documentary evidence does not report systemic acts of violence targeting XXXX XXXX in Haiti.9 The principal male claimant testified there were many XXXX in Haiti, including in his hometown. Mr. XXXX did not provide any testimony indicating that all XXXX or XXXX were likely to be targeted in Haiti. Given the overall evidence, I do not find that all pastors or preachers (including new ones) face a serious possibility of persecution in Haiti. Mr. XXXX was targeted in the small village of La Croix where he came from and where he would easily be recognized. The principal male claimant was targeted in a local attack in La Croix and there is no evidence his agents of persecution have the motivation to find him elsewhere since he left his village. I also find this attack was an isolated event since no documentary evidence supports systemic attacks towards XXXX or XXXX in Haiti. Therefore, I find Mr. XXXX could XXXX or act as a XXXX in a bigger community, such as Port-de-Paix, a city in the northern part of Haiti which contains close to 500,000 citizens. Given the previous reasons, I find that the principal male claimant would not face a serious possibility of persecution in Port-de-Paix due to his XXXX or as a XXXX. Since I do not find that the principal male claimant faces harm in Port-de-Paix, I also find that the rest of the family members do not face harm because of Mr. XXXX religious activities should they live in Port-de-Paix.\n[12] As for the second prong, I find it would not be unreasonable for all claimants to relocate in Port-de-Paix. The principal claimants testified that their families (brothers and sisters) are now residing in Port-de-Paix. This city has an airport and would be quite easy to access. XXXX XXXX also recently spent one (1) year in Port-de-Paix residing with her aunt. The principal male claimant is a qualified XXXX and has years of experience as a XXXX worker. As for the principal female claimant, she used to work in a XXXX for years in Bahamas. The claimants have not provided sufficient reasons suggesting that the two (2) principal claimants could not find employment in a city of 500,000 citizens where they have a support network from their family members. Therefore, the three children could also live with their parents without difficulties. Because of these reasons, I find it would not be unreasonable for all claimants to relocate to Port-de-Paix. In conclusion, I find all claimants have a viable IFA with regards to the allegations of persecution given the principal male claimant's religious profile.\nThe risk of persecution for XXXX XXXX XXXX\n[13] The claimant's counsel argued that XXXX XXXX XXXX faces a serious possibility of persecution because he is a member of a particular social group, being a male Haitian child. It was submitted that Haitian children face persecution because of the overall violence, the risk of being recruited by criminal organizations and the incapacity of the Haitian government to protect them. I carefully reviewed the country condition documentary evidence and I do not reach the conclusion that XXXX XXXX XXXX is facing a serious possibility of persecution because he is a Haitian child. The documentary evidence reports abuses targeting Haitian children because some are more vulnerable.10 I don't find XXXX XXXX to be vulnerable because he has a strong support network from his family. The most recent documentary evidence is also silent in terms of having a specific issue with regards to the forced recruitment of Haitian children in criminal gangs. I find the overall documentary evidence does not support a serious possibility of persecution for every Haitian child. Because of the previous reasons, I do not find that XXXX XXXX XXXX has a well-founded fear of persecution because he is a Haitian child.\nThe risk of persecution for the female claimants\n[14] All female claimants allege that they fear Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV) if they were to return to Haiti. The principal female claimant alleges she was victim of rape when she visited her family in Haiti in XXXX 2012. Along with her testimony, deemed credible, Mrs. XXXX XXXX XXXX provided a medical report11 from the hospital she visited following the incident of XXXX 2012 which corroborates her allegations. The principal female claimant also provided a psychological report corroborating her allegations and stating she was severely affected by this incident.12 Therefore, I find the overall evidence supports the principal female claimant was a victim of rape in Haiti in XXXX 2012.\n[15] The question now is whether all female claimants are facing gender based violence. To this end, I will consider the Chairperson's Guideline no. 4 which states that in order to evaluate if the claimants have a well-founded fear of gender-based persecution, I need to evaluate the capacity and will of the state to protect the claimants, and more generally, whether their fear is objectively founded.\n[16] The documentary evidence reports that the issue of gender-based violence was a critical issue in Haiti following the earthquake of January 12, 2010. The zone touched by this earthquake created a high level of internally displaced persons in camps where rape and sexual violence became epidemic. It was reported that women living in the zones touched by the earthquake were likely to be subjected to gender-based violence in the months following the earthquake. For example, the Amnesty International (AI) Report of January 2011 stated that sexual and gender-based violence was omnipresent and that girls and women living in camps away from their families became even more vulnerable. The United States (US) Department of State's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2010 also recorded 974 cases of rape, compared to 218 cases between January and October 2009 and that is without considering the cases which were not reported. However, I find the situation with regards to gender persecution in Haiti has improved since 2010 and I do not find the female claimant's fear of SGBV to be objectively founded if we refer to the most recent country condition reports.\n[17] While the US Department of State's report of 201513 still identifies rape, violence and societal discrimination against women as a human rights problem in Haiti, it is not part of the most serious impediments to human rights in that country for the past year. This report identifies the most serious issues are weak governance in the country worsened by the dissolution of the parliament in January 2015. This situation caused insufficient respect for the rule of law, exacerbated by a deficient judicial system; and chronic corruption in all branches of government. The section 6 of the report relating to discrimination, societal abuses, and trafficking in persons more precisely related to women indicates that SGBV targeting women was but is no longer a chronic problem. The documentary evidence refers to the weakness of the justice system which made it difficult for SGBV survivors which contributed to underreporting and infrequent prosecutions. The report also states that the SGBV unit in the Haitian police remained under resourced and understaffed. I however find the documentary evidence relating to Haiti is supporting a will from the Haitian government and society to tackle SGBV. I also find the documentary evidence with regards to the country conditions indicates that the situation has improved significantly since the earthquake of 2010. While it may be under resourced and understaffed, Gender-Based Violence (GBV) Offices have been created by the Haitian police since 2010, present in the police station of the major cities. The GBV Team Leader had trained 972 police officers (out of 12,000 uniforms in Haiti), including 35 instructors (among which 17 are women).14 Attorneys who represented rape survivors said that authorities were reasonably responsive to cases involving the rape of minors, as the law is clear and judicial measures exist to deal with such cases. Students at the magistrate school who serve as new judges, prosecutors, and court clerks upon graduation received training on SGBV and strategies for improved investigation and prosecution of such crimes. Government and international partners also conducted mentoring sessions on SGBV as part of a pilot program for chief judges, prosecutors, and justices of the peace courts in order to increase the number of SGBV cases sent to the Prosecutors' Office for prosecution. I find the country reports to indicate that the Haitian government took serious measures to protect Haitian women from SGBV since 2010 and have been effective in reducing the risk of SGBV for women in Haiti. The documentary evidence no longer identifies SGBV as a chronic and structural issue in Haiti in 2016. The documentary evidence also support significant improvement with regards to SGBV since 2010. The Haitian government enforced numerous measures of protection in the past years and given the overall evidence, I find the Haitian authorities are actually providing effective state protection to women. Therefore, I find that female claimants do not have a well-founded fear of persecution in Haiti because of SGBV on a forward-looking assessment.\nCompelling reasons for the principal female claimant\n[18] Compelling reasons may be assessed if (1) the claimant experienced past harm, and (2) would have qualified as a Convention refugee and (3) the reasons for seeking protection ceased to exist.\n[19] In terms of past harm, I need to consider the seriousness of the acts suffered by the claimant and the repercussions on the claimant's physical and mental state. The past persecution must reach a very high level of harm to \"appalling\" or \"atrocious\". It has been established that the principal female claimant was a victim of rape in XXXX 2012. Mrs. XXXX XXXX XXXX never returned to Haiti following this incident. The principal female claimant provided a medical report from Dr. XXXX XXXX XXXX15 who is a Psychiatric specialist. In her report, Dr. Agarwal concluded that Mrs. XXXX XXXX XXXX is affected by a chronic and severe Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) because of this incident. The principal female claimant consistently experiences symptoms such as feeling unsafe; recurrent nightmares; intrusive memories; and flashback of the rape; emotional and physical distress when recalling the assault; sleep disturbance; inability to trust people; feeling intimidated by people who are in a relative position of power over her; inability to focus; poor memory; and hyper vigilance. Dr. XXXX concludes that it is important for Mrs. XXXX XXXX XXXX to be able to live with a sense of safety and stability on a long-term basis, in order to heal from her traumatic experience. The act of rape is horrific as torture and victims of such act often experience severe and ongoing psychological consequences following this act, similarly to the principal female claimant. Therefore, I find Mrs. XXXX XXXX XXXX faced a level of harm that the panel finds to be appalling and atrocious.\n[20] I also need to consider whether Mrs. XXXX XXXX XXXX would have qualified as a Convention refugee in XXXX 2012. It has been established that Mrs. XXXX XXXX XXXX was raped in 2012 when she visited her family. The claimant's counsel provided copies of Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) Responses to Information Requests (RIR) about SGBV issued in 2011 and 2012. The RIR dated June 2011 refers to a report from Amnesty International (AI) of the same year noting the following: \"sexual and gender-based violence are omnipresent in Haiti, although women and girls were already at high risk of being raped or subjected to other forms of sexual violence prior to the earthquake\"16. Likewise, according to a January 2011 Human Rights Watch report, the rate of sexual violence prior to the earthquake was high, but conditions in the camps have made women and girls even more vulnerable. As for the RIR date of June 2012, it described that rape is a particular problem in the urban slums across Haiti, while a United Nations (UN) representative stated that there has been an increase in the number of rapes and sexual assaults outside of IDP camps in 2011. Given the documentary evidence with regards to SGBV in 2012, I find Mrs. XXXX XXXX XXXX would have had a well-founded fear of persecution because of SGBV in XXXX 2012. The previously cited RIR also reported that no concrete plans or activities were implemented by the government to combat sexual violence in the camps but that UN police have a gender unit that addresses sexual violence in these camps with 20 police officers. Because of this, I find there was no adequate state protection offered to women fearing SGBV in 2012. Given the risk they faced in 2012 was spread across the country, I also find Mrs. XXXX XXXX XXXX would not have had an internal flight alternative. This is why I find that the principal female claimant would have faced a serious possibility of persecution in XXXX 2012 given her gender and would have qualified as a Convention refugee.\n[21] As for the change of circumstances, I find the documentary evidence relating to the situation and government initiatives facing SGBV in 2012 is significantly different from the reports of 2016. I refer more precisely to my analysis of the documentary evidence relating to SGBV in paragraphs 16 & 19, respectively treating of the issue in 2016 and 2012. Having found that women are not facing a serious possibility of persecution in Haiti in 2016 because of their gender and because the state is now offering effective protection to these women, I find the reason for requesting protection for Mrs. XXXX XXXX XXXX ceased to exist.\n[22] Given the previous reasons, I find that Mrs. XXXX XXXX XXXX falls under the exception of s. 108(4) and I therefore find compelling reasons for the principal female claimant not to be returned to Haiti.\nCONCLUSION\n[23] Given the previous reasons, the panel finds that the principal male claimant and his children have not established that they face a serious possibility of persecution in Haiti, or a risk to their life, or a danger of torture, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, if they were to return to Haiti.\n[24] However, the panel finds compelling reasons not to return the principal female claimant to her country of origin. Therefore, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX is a Convention refugee.\n(signed)\n\"G. Clermont-Daigneault\"\nG.

She claims for refugee protection pursuant to Sections 96, 97 (1) (a) and 97 (1) (b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant alleges that she is a bisexual female. She became aware of her sexual orientation at the age of 13. Thereafter, while she lived in Nigeria, she had more than one relationship with males and females.\n[3] In 2010, her former partner XXXX connected her with the \"Sunshine Sisters\" with whom she travelled to the USA in 2014. She returned to Nigeria in April of 2015.\n[4] Prior to returning to Nigeria she established a same-sex relationship with XXXX XXXX XXXX a Canadian citizen. XXXX visited the claimant in the USA while she was in USA in 2015 and 2016. Subsequently, XXXX provided the claimant money and ticket to visit her.\n[5] With the help of XXXX, the claimant returned to the USA. She did not come to Canada since she had no visa to enter Canada. While she was in the USA, on XXXX XXXX, 2016, her ex-partner XXXX called her to inform her that her former partner called XXXX was caught by the police. XXXX told her that XXXX had given the names of all her partners including hers to the police.\n[6] At that point the claimant decided not to return to Nigeria. She came to Canada to seek refugee protection.\n[7] Detailed narrative can be found in the claimant's Basis of Claim Form (BOC)1\nDETERMINATION\n[8] For the reasons that follow, the panel finds that that the claimant is not a credible witness and as such she is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\nIDENTITY\n[9] Documentary evidence2 establishes the claimant's identity as being a citizen of Nigeria.\nANALYSIS\n[10] In making this assessment, the panel considered the claimant's oral and written testimony, the presentations of his counsel and all of the documentary evidence provided. The determinative issue in this case is credibility including the claimant's failure to claim in the USA and her return to Nigeria in April 2015 from the USA.\n[11] Based on the totality of the evidence adduced, the panel finds that the claimant is not a credible witness and her fear of persecution at the hands of her community and the police is not objectively well-founded.\n[12] In assessing credibility, the panel was mindful of the claimant's age, education and her background. In addition, the panel is cognizant of the many difficulties faced by a claimant in establishing a claim, including cultural factors, the milieu of the hearing room, and the stress inherent in responding to oral questions through an interpreter. The panel has taken these considerations into account before arriving at negative credibility findings.\n[13] With regard to credibility, the panel is aware that testimony given under oath is presumed to be true, unless there is a valid reason to doubt its truthfulness.3 The panel is also aware that the real test of the truth of a story of a witness is that it be in harmony with the preponderance of probabilities which a practical and informed person would readily recognise as reasonable in that place and in those conditions.4 Furthermore, the panel cannot be satisfied that, \"the evidence is credible or trustworthy unless satisfied that it is probably so, not just possibly so\".5\n[14] At the hearing the claimant testified that she is a bisexual female and she fears her community and the police in Nigeria. Since her ex-partner XXXX has been caught by the police, and since her ex-partner has given her name to the police she fears to be arrested and mistreated by the authorities including the police because bisexuality is illegal in Nigeria.\n[15] In regards to her relationship with XXXX XXXX XXXX, allegedly a citizen of Canada, living in Brampton, Ontario, the claimant testified that she met XXXX in March of 2015. The claimant testified that XXXX told her to come to Canada because she wanted the claimant to be with her. She indicated that that relationship has ended now.\n[16] At the hearing the claimant did not provide any photo-identity or a photograph of her with XXXX. She did not provide any documentary evidence to substantiate that XXXX had provided her a ticket to leave Nigeria to go to the USA. The copy of the ticket6 she provided does not indicate that her alleged ex-partner XXXX had sent her that ticket or provided finances to buy the ticket purchased in Lagos. Also, there is no documentary evidence about the alleged financial help XXXX had given her to leave Nigeria.\n[17] As per her testimony, although XXXX is now married and lives in Brampton, Ontario, the claimant did not provide her address, her phone number or any other information that XXXX XXXX XXXX lives in Brampton and is a Canadian Citizen as alleged.\n[18] When asked to explain why she did not bring XXXX as a witness to the hearing, the claimant indicated that she has no contact with her. Her explanation is not reasonable given she testified that she lived in Brampton and for that reason her counsel could have subpoenaed her to the claimant's hearing. In the least, the claimant could have provided XXXX information including her address from internet. She simply did not.\n[19] The onus is on the claimant, represented by a counsel, to establish her claim. The panel expected to see XXXX at the hearing to be able to question her about her alleged bisexual relationship with the claimant. Therefore, without a photo-identity of XXXX or any other documentary evidence and her absence at the hearing, the claimant has not established persuasively that a female called XXXX XXXX XXXX lives in Canada and was at one time her bisexual partner.\n[20] As a result, based on the evidence adduced, the panel is not persuaded to believe that the claimant had a bisexual relationship with XXXX.\n[21] Also, without any other persuasive evidence, and her testimony that she had no same-sex relationship in Canada, the panel is not persuaded to believe that the claimant has had any bisexual relationship after her entry in Canada.\n[22] The photographs7 the claimant provided are not conclusive about her sexual orientation. Also, the letters from the 519 Community Centre, Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto and Africans in Partnership Against Aids do not indicate specifically that the claimant is a bisexual and was involved in Bisexual activities in Canada8.\n[23] Merely joining the 519 Community Centre and participating in Metropolitan Community Church does not make one bisexual particularly when there is no documentary evidence that states that these organizations offer memberships only to gay people. As a result, the panel finds that these documents9 are not conclusive about the claimant's alleged sexual orientation.\n[24] The psychological report10 the claimant provided is based on what she told the psychologist during her visit to the psychologist in Canada. The psychologist does not state that she has specific knowledge about the claimant's bisexual activities in Canada or in Nigeria. There is no psychological report or a medical report from Nigeria from a reliable and an independent source to indicate that the claimant had psychological issues due to her sexuality while she was in Nigeria. As a result, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities that the claimant's psychological issues at this time are not related specifically to her sexual orientation.\n[25] The claimant testified that she travelled to the USA in 2014 with the \"Sunshine Sisters.\" The claimant indicated that her mother had informed her while she was in Nigeria that bisexual individuals were targeted by the police and the society in general in Nigeria. She had knowledge about the laws against gay people in Nigeria, yet she failed to seek asylum or seek information about asylum during her six month visit to the USA. Her behaviour and her actions are indicative of lack of subjective fear of persecution in Nigeria.\n[26] Her testimony that she returned because she had never been targeted in the past is not reasonable since she had knowledge about the Nigerian laws against gay people and the treatment gay people were subjected to in that country and her mother had informed her about the mistreatment gay people receive in Nigeria. Hence, it is expected of a person having received university education to seek asylum in the USA and not return to the country she allegedly feared persecution. Therefore, her return to the country she feared persecution is indicative of lack of subjective fear of persecution in Nigeria.\n[27] The claimant testified that she returned to the USA in November 2015. During that visit she stayed in the USA for 6 months until her USA visas expired before coming to Canada. During this visit she once again failed to seek asylum in the USA, even after she was told in May 2016 that her alleged ex-partner had been arrested. Her behaviour and her actions are indicative of lack of subjective fear of persecution in Nigeria.\n[28] Therefore, based on the evidence adduced, the panel finds that the claimant's behaviour and actions are indicative of lack of subjective fear of persecution in Nigeria.\n[29] The claimant testified that her alleged first bisexual partner called XXXX XXXX introduced her to XXXX XXXX. She began that relationship in January of 2009.11 She testified that she met XXXX at a wedding of her friend from the university. When asked if she had any documentary evidence such as a wedding invitation card or photographs of the wedding, the claimant indicated she had none.\n[30] At the hearing the claimant was asked if she had a photo-identity of XXXX. She testified she had none but she indicated she had a photograph of XXXX12. The panel examined the original photograph the claimant provided at the hearing. The photograph contains the claimant and another female. The photograph is not dated nor is XXXX identified by a notary public or any other independent and reliable entity in that photograph. It does not even indicate if it was taken in Nigeria.\n[31] At the back of the photograph the hand written name of XXXX XXXX does not persuasively establish the identity of XXXX since the writer does not indicate his\/her name or the organisation he\/she represents.\n[32] The onus is on the claimant, represented by a counsel to provide documentary establish her claim. She was instructed in her BOC to provide documentary evidence to establish her claim. Therefore, based on the evidence adduced, the claimant has not established persuasively that the claimant had a bisexual relationship with XXXX XXXX as alleged. As a result, the panel finds that the claimant has connected her story with XXXX to bolster her refugee claim in Canada.\n[33] Moreover, the claimant provided media article that indicates that the police had arrested XXXX in 2014.13 The claimant's name does not appear in that article. At the hearing the claimant did not provide any media article of XXXX alleged arrest on XXXX XXXX, 2016. There is no documentary evidence about XXXX arrest on XXXX XXXX, 2016.\n[34] The claimant's testimony that her mother and her first bisexual partner XXXX tried to obtain documentary evidence such as newspaper article and other documents related to XXXX arrest on XXXX XXXX, 2016 but failed is not mentioned in the affidavits of both14.\n[35] Furthermore, in her affidavit XXXX does not even mention when or on what date XXXX was arrested the second time15. There is no documentary evidence from an independent reliable source to indicate that XXXX was arrested on XXXX XXXX, 2016 and at that time she gave the claimant's name to the police as her partner.\n[36] Her mother's affidavit16 is self-serving since she is a family having interest in the outcome of the claimant's refugee claim and hence the panel gives no weight to that document. Other affidavits17 are also from her family members. They are self-serving too since the writers have interest in the outcome of the claimant's refugee claim in Canada and as such the panel gives no weight to them too.\n[37] Therefore, based on the evidence adduced, the claimant has not established persuasively that XXXX was arrested on XXXX XXXX, 2016 as alleged and hence the panel is not persuaded to believe that XXXX gave the claimant's name as her bisexual partner to the police. Therefore, the panel is not persuaded to believe that the police in Nigeria have any interest to target the claimant for being a bisexual partner of XXXX as alleged.\n[38] The claimant indicated that she met XXXX XXXX in 1996 while both attended SS1 at the XXXX XXXX. She indicated that XXXX was her first bisexual partner and both lived in the dormitory at the college. When asked, the claimant testified that she had no documentary evidence from XXXX XXXX to indicate that XXXX and she attended that institution. When asked if she had contacted the college to obtain documentary evidence, the claimant indicated she had not.\n[39] The onus is on the claimant represented by a counsel to provide documentary evidence to establish her claim. She was instructed in her BOC to provide documentary evidence to support her claim. It is reasonable to expect documentary evidence from the college the claimant allegedly attended given she was able to provide documentary evidence such as her school credentials18. Without documentary evidence the panel is not persuaded to believe that the claimant and XXXX attended SS1 at XXXX XXXX and lived in school dormitory.\n[40] At the hearing the claimant provided an affidavit19 allegedly written by XXXX XXXX. The photo-identity20 she provided has not been notarized or certified by an independent reliable source to indicate that that was a true copy of the original. Also, at the hearing the claimant did not provide the original Identity document. Since fraudulent document21 can be procured in Nigeria, without notarisation or certification of the photo-identity of XXXX identity document, the panel is not persuaded to believe that the alleged identity document is authentic and is of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Counsel in her submissions connected the photograph of XXXX to her photograph on the identity document she provided22. There is no date on the original photograph provided. The names of the claimant and XXXX XXXX are hand written at the back of the photograph with no identity of the writer or the organisation the writer represented.\n[41] As a result, the panel is not persuaded to believe that that photograph the claimant provided was taken in Nigeria and since the photograph is not notarized, the panel does not find that the person with the claimant in that photograph is XXXX XXXX.\n[42] Also, the affidavit23 the claimant provided, from XXXX XXXX has not been notarized by an independent reliable entity and since the panel disbelieves that the claimant and XXXX attended the same school in SS1 and it disbelieves that the photo-identity of XXXX XXXX is authentic, the panel does not give any weight to the affidavit allegedly written by XXXX XXXX. As a result, based on the evidence adduced, the panel disbelieves that the claimant had bisexual relationship with XXXX as alleged. The panel finds that the claimant has fabricated her story about being in bisexual relationship with XXXX to bolster her refugee claim.\n[43] Moreover, in her BOC narrative24 and her testimony, the claimant indicated that she had another same sex relationship with XXXX XXXX who was introduced to her by a friend of XXXX called XXXX XXXX. She indicated that both XXXX and she were students at the XXXX XXXX University. At the hearing the claimant was asked if she had any photo-identity of XXXX or documents from the university indicating that XXXX attended the same university the claimant did. The claimant testified she had none.\n[44] At the hearing the claimant provided a photograph25 showing her with a girl she testified was XXXX. That photograph is not notarized nor is it dated nor is there any indication that it was taken in Nigeria. Although the claimant's and XXXX name are hand written at the back, the writer does not identify who he\/she is and what organisation he\/she represents.\n[45] Therefore, without documentary evidence and or a photograph notarized or certified by an independent and reliable organisation, the claimant has not established persuasively that XXXX and attended the same university the claimant did and became bisexual partner of the claimant at university.\n[46] As a result, based on the evidence adduced, the panel is not persuaded to believe that the claimant had bisexual relationship with XXXX since the panel does not believe that XXXX attended Delta State University at the time the claimant did.\n[47] Based on the totality of the evidence adduced, the panel finds the claimant not to be a credible witness and since the panel is not persuaded to believe that the claimant had any bisexual relationship in Nigeria and Canada, on a balance of probabilities, the panel does not find that the claimant to be a bisexual as alleged.\n[48] The panel finds that the claimant has fabricated her story about being a bisexual for the purpose of her refugee claim and as such her fear of persecution as a bisexual returning to Nigeria has no objective basis. As a result, the panel finds that there is not a serious possibility that the claimant will be persecuted at the hands of those she fears including the authorities in Nigeria.\n[49] The panel's credibility findings also apply to the claimant's assertion that she faces a risk to her life or of being subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Nigeria. Since the claimant is not a credible witness and her fear of persecution is not objectively well-founded, the panel finds that the claimant does not face a risk to her life or to being subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or to a danger of being tortured, should she return to Nigeria.\n[50] Also, the panel has reviewed all of the documentation entered as exhibits in this case. Based on the documentary evidence, there is no persuasive evidence to indicate that the claimant will be subjected to any other risk, other than the risk of general violence which all citizens in Nigeria are subjected to.\n[51] As a result the Refugee Protection Division determines that XXXX XXXX XXXX is not a Convention refugee nor is she a person in need of protection in Canada and hence the Refugee Protection Division rejects her claim for refugee protection.\n(signed)\n\"S.

The associated claimant left El Salvador and arrived in the U.S. in December 2014. Both claimants came to Canada and claimed refugee protection on August 18, 2016, fearing harm at the hands of the MS-13 gang for having defied them and fled from El Salvador.\nANALYSIS\n[6] The determinative issues in this case are credibility and an internal flight alternative to either San Salvador or Santa Ana.\nNexus\n[7] The panel notes that the claimants' counsel indicated in her submissions that the claimants were not advancing a claim pursuant to section 96 of the IRPA. The panel also notes that any claim made by the claimants under section 96 would not have succeeded as the panel finds that the claimants have not established that there is a nexus to one of the Convention grounds.\n[8] The claimants testified that they fear gang violence in El Salvador as the MS-13 previously tried to recruit them. As such, the panel finds that the claimants are victims of crime or of a personal vendetta. The Federal Court has held that victims of crime, corruption or vendettas generally fail to establish a link between their fear of persecution and one of the Convention grounds in the definition of Convention refugee.4\n[9] The panel finds that the claimants fear being a victim of crime is not linked to race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group and as such is not linked to a Convention ground. As a result, the claim would fail under section 96 of the IRPA. As such, an analysis under section 97 of the IRPA follows.\nCredibility and Failure to seek protection in the United States\n[10] The panel finds that the principal claimant's abandonment of his U.S. asylum claim and the associated claimant's failure to seek protection in the U.S. are detrimental to their credibility for the reasons below.\n[11] The panel notes that given that this claim is being assessed under subsection 97(1) of the IRPA, there is no subjective fear component to the analysis. However, in the absence of a satisfactory explanation, behaviour inconsistent with being fearful, including delays or omissions in seeking protection in the face of allegations of the possibility of severe harm or death as encompassed by subsection 97(1), may undermine a claimant's credibility regarding the existence of such a risk.\nThe principal claimant\n[12] The principal claimant arrived in the U.S. in December 2012 and claimed asylum after he was detained by U.S. immigration authorities for illegal entry.\n[13] The principal claimant testified that he did not attend the court date he was given for his asylum hearing because he followed the advice of others who told him his claim would be rejected and he would be deported back to El Salvador. He testified that his bail bondswoman had said that he could not live with her anymore and he feared he would be detained and deported for violating a condition of his bail. He also testified that he did not have the resources for a lawyer given that he was repaying the bail bondswoman the money she had paid for his release. When asked, the principal claimant testified that he assumed when he did not show up for his court date that a deportation order had been issued against him. The principal claimant testified that he never made any efforts, other than his abandoned asylum claim, to regularize his status in the U.S.\n[14] The panel finds the principal claimant's explanation for the abandonment of his U.S. asylum claim and subsequent failure to regularize his status in the U.S. to be not reasonable. The panel notes that the principal claimant fled to the United States out of fear for his life because of the gangs in El Salvador. Based on his testimony he made an asylum claim when he was detained because he did not want to be deported and yet he abandoned his asylum claim, thus ensuring that a deportation order would be made against him. The panel also notes that the principal claimant was in the U.S. for 4 years, without status, and as such was at risk of removal. In that context, his explanation that he abandoned his asylum claim for fear that he would be deported is not reasonable, particularly given his allegation that he would face violence from the MS-13 who tried to recruit him should he return to El Salvador and that the abandonment ensured a deportation order would be issued against him.\nThe associated claimant\n[15] The associated claimant arrived in the U.S. in December 2014. He testified that he never sought protection from the U.S. authorities because he was following the advice of others that he would be detained, his claim would be denied, and he would be deported back to El Salvador.\n[16] The panel finds that the associated claimant's explanation for his failure to seek protection in the U.S. to be not reasonable. The panel notes that like his brother, the associated claimant fled to the United States out of fear for his life because of the MS-13 in El Salvador. The panel also notes that the associated claimant was in the U.S. for 2 years, without status, and as such risked deportation. The panel would reasonably expect someone who fears return to their country to seek avenues to allow them remain outside of their country of alleged persecution. In that context, his explanation that he never sought protection for fear that he would be deported is not reasonable, particularly given his allegation that he would face violence from the MS-13 who tried to recruit him should he return to El Salvador.\nCounsel's submissions\n[17] The claimants' counsel submitted that the United States does not grant asylum to claimants from Central America as there is no equivalent to section 97 of the IRPA in U.S. asylum claims, and claimants have to bring their claims under one of the Convention grounds. The claimants' counsel also provided statistics to demonstrate that only a small portion of claims from El Salvador are accepted.\n[18] The panel is not persuaded by the counsel's submissions. The claimants were in the U.S. for almost 4 years and almost 2 years respectively. While both eventually made their way to Canada, their intention upon arriving in the U.S. was to stay there, and not return to El Salvador. Based on their testimony, other than the principal claimant's asylum claim, which he abandoned thereby ensuring a deportation order would be made against him, they did not make any efforts to seek protection or to regularize their status. They did not speak to any legal counsel regarding their situation, nor did they testify to having done independent research into possible ways they could remain outside El Salvador, other than speaking to members of their community.\n[19] When asked about why they decided to come to Canada, the principal claimant said that his brother saw on the internet that they were giving refugee protection to El Salvadorians in Canada. The panel notes that the claimants have proven themselves to be resourceful individuals, who were able to live and work in the United States, the principal claimant for almost 4 years and the associated claimant for almost two years. In addition, according to their testimony, the claimants were able to use the internet in order to find out that they could make a refugee claim here in Canada. As such, the panel finds that their failure to make any effort to regularize their status in the United States and the lack of a reasonable explanation for this failure to be detrimental to the credibility of the two claimants.\n[20] In this case, given the intention of the two claimants to remain in the United States and the length of time they remained there illegally, the panel finds the failure to seek protection by the associated claimant and the abandonment of the U.S. asylum claim by the principal claimant, as well as their failure to make any effort to regularize their status in the United States to be fatal to their refugee claims.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[21] The panel considered an IFA to San Salvador or Santa Ana, two of the largest cities in El Salvador and both several hours away from Guatajiagua where the claimants had problems with the gangs. Given the facts of this case, the panel finds that the claimants would be able to relocate to one of these two cities for the reasons below.\n[22] Claimants are expected to avail themselves of a safe haven in their own country where they would be free of persecution, unless they can show that it is objectively unreasonable for them to do so. It is not a matter of the claimant's convenience or the attractiveness of the IFA, but whether one should be expected to make do in that location before traveling half-way around the world to seek a safe haven, in another country. 5\n[23] The test to apply in order to determine whether a viable IFA exists is two-pronged: (i) there is no serious possibility of the claimants being persecuted or subjected, on a balance of probabilities, to a danger of torture or to a risk to life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in the proposed IFA area, and (ii) conditions in the IFA area must be such that it would not be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, for the claimants to seek refuge there.6\n[24] The claimants bear the burden of proof to show that they would be subject personally, on a balance of probabilities,7 to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in all of El Salvador and specifically in the potential IFA area, in this case San Salvador or Santa Ana.8\nRisk faced in San Salvador or Santa Ana\n[25] The panel finds that while the claimants may have faced a personalized risk in Guatajiagua in 2012 for the principal claimant and in 2014 for the associated claimant, they would only face a generalized risk in San Salvador or Santa Ana.\n[26] The claimants were asked if they could return to El Salvador and reside in either San Salvador or in Santa Ana. The principal claimant testified that he could not live in either place because the gangs are very big and they will ask him for identification when he arrives and they will have suspicions that he is fleeing. The associated claimant testified that he could not live in either place because the MS-13 gang is the biggest gang in El Salvador and the people looking for him were chiefs of the gang and they have a way of communicating so they would find him.\n[27] The panel finds that the claimants have not adduced any evidence to indicate that the gangs are currently looking for them. The principal claimant testified that his last communication with the gangs was XXXX 2012. When asked, the principal claimant testified that the gangs have not gone to his parents' home looking for him. The associated claimant testified that his last communication with the gangs was in XXXX 2014. The panel notes that the claimants provided an affidavit from their father,9 and there is no mention in the affidavit of the gangs currently looking for either claimant.\n[28] The associated claimant testified that his wife, who is currently living in San Miguel with the claimants' eldest brother XXXX, is worried because there are strangers outside the place where they are currently staying. Based on the questions asked, the associated claimant testified that the strangers have not approached the house and no one has come looking for him there. Based on this the panel finds it to be speculation as to who these strangers are and whether or not they are looking for the associated claimant.\n[29] The claimants' older brother XXXX is also currently living in San Miguel in El Salvador at an uncle's house. He was deported from the United States back to El Salvador following the rejection of his refugee claim. According to the testimony of the claimant, XXXX is allegedly in hiding but has not had any problems with the gangs since his return. The claimants also provided a letter from XXXX where he indicates that he is in hiding.10 The panel finds that this is not evidence that the gangs are currently looking for the claimants.\n[30] The panel finds that while the claimants may have been personally targeted in Guatajiagua in 2012 and 2014, on a balance of probabilities, they do not face a personalized risk in San Salvador or Santa Ana. The claimants may have previously been targeted for recruitment, but there is no persuasive evidence before the panel to suggest that the MS-13 are still interested in either of them today.\n[31] According to the objective country documentation, the level of crime in El Salvador is \"critical\", corruption is rampant, and businesses and citizens are subject to extortion on a regular basis.11 The country documents also indicated that gangs operate throughout El Salvador and that the crimes they commit include homicide, extortion, forced recruitment, forced disappearances, street-level drug trafficking (narcomenudeo), threats, and carjacking.12\n[32] Although the documents indicate that the gangs in El Salvador operate throughout the country and have a communication network which gives them the capacity to track and locate individuals, the panel finds that the claimants have not established that the Maras are currently looking for them. Given that 4 years has passed since the principal claimant left, and two years has passed since the associated claimant left, the panel finds that the claimants have not established that the gang members who tried to recruit the claimants in Guatajiagua would be looking for them in San Salvador or Santa Ana. As such, the panel finds that the claimants have not established that they would face a risk that is personalized or heightened as compared to the general population in San Salvador or Santa Ana. Consequently, the panel finds that the risk faced by the claimants in San Salvador or Santa Ana would be a similar risk as the general population.\nReasonableness test\n[33] The panel finds that it is not objectively unreasonable for the claimants to relocate to San Salvador or Santa Ana. The claimants are both young and have shown themselves to be quite capable and resourceful individuals. They lived in the United States without status almost 4 and almost 2 years respectively. In that time, they were able to find paid work and support themselves. The associated claimant said that he has his family and there is no work in El Salvador. The panel notes that these are not reasons which would make the IFA unreasonable.\n[34] Based on the particular facts of this case, the panel determines that there is an IFA for the claimants in San Salvador or Santa Ana. Therefore, the claimants have not established, on a balance of probabilities, that they would be subject personally to a risk to life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in El Salvador at the hands of the MS-13.\nCONCLUSION\n[35] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel finds that there is not a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground should the claimants return to El Salvador, or that, on a balance of probabilities, they would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\n[36] The panel concludes that the claimants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. Therefore, their claims are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Catherine Smith\"\nCatherine Smith\nDecember 6, 2016\nDate\n1 IRPA S.C.

They fear further persecution as Ismailis should they return to Pakistan. The details of their claims have been well set out in summary in the Federal Court decision,3 under the heading Background and Basis of the Claim,\n[2] The applicants are citizens of Pakistan. Mr. XXXX moved to Kuwait in 1994, when he was 15 years old. His sister XXXX remained in Pakistan and married XXXX XXXX. Mr. XXXX was violently abusive towards XXXX. As a result, XXXX joined her family in Kuwait. Mr. XXXX began harassing and threatening the family members who remained in Pakistan. The XXXX family are Ismaili Muslim, whereas Mr. XXXX is Sunni.\n[3] After leaving Pakistan, Mr. XXXX returned back only four times. He returned in 2003 to marry his current wife and the mother of his children. Mr. XXXX and his wife returned to Pakistan in 2004 for the birth XXXX XXXX, the two minor applicants. They returned again in 2005, for the birth of a second set of XXXX, and subsequently travelled to XXXX to visit with his grandmother. His last visit to Pakistan was in 2010 when he returned for nine days to obtain a new passport.\n[4] In 2005, a \"couple of days\" after they arrived in XXXX, two individuals dressed in traditional clothing broke into the grandmother's home. They hit Mr. XXXX wife with a cricket bat, the blow glancing off her head and breaking her shoulder. Mr. XXXX suffered a cut to his left eyebrow, and the assailants kidnapped the five day old son of the applicant.\n[5] Mr. XXXX and his wife went to receive medical treatment. After leaving the hospital to go to the police station to report the kidnapping, Mr. XXXX received a phone call from Mr. XXXX \"welcoming\" him to Pakistan. Mr. XXXX believes that Mr. XXXX may have been behind the attack and kidnapping.\n[6] Mr. XXXX says that police made him wait at the station to report the assault and kidnapping and seemed to have little interest in his case. They did take a report and said they would get back to him. The next day Mr. XXXX was called into the police station to identify the kidnapped baby's body. The baby's death was confirmed. The police stated they would investigate but nothing came of it. The family left for Kuwait on XXXX XXXX, 2005.\n[7] While in Kuwait, Mr. XXXX continued to receive harassing phone calls from Mr. XXXX. In 2011, XXXX and her family made refugee claims in Canada that were successful. The remaining family members continued to be harassed by Mr. XXXX. One of Mr. XXXX uncles, XXXX, converted to Sunni Islam and he then also harassed the applicant's family. On XXXX XXXX, 2013, Mr. XXXX grandmother's body was found in the street. The police investigation is ongoing\n[8] On XXXX XXXX, 2013, Mr. XXXX employer notified him that his employment was being terminated. He and his family applied for visas for Canada. Only Mr. XXXX visa application was accepted. He made a refugee claim on January 28, 2014. The two minor applicants had US visas and Mr. XXXX brought them over the border to Canada.4\n[3] These claims were initially heard in 2014 and were rejected in a decision dated July 7, 2014.5 The decision was quashed in a decision of the Federal Court decision dated XXXX XXXX, 2015.6 This is the decision in the redetermination of the claims.\n[4] The panel notes that while the Minister intervened in writing7 in the initial hearing of the claims, they did not participate further in the redetermination.\nDETERMINATION\n[5] For the reasons that follow, the panel finds that the claimants are neither Convention refugees, nor persons in need of protection.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity\n[6] The identity of the claimants as nationals of Pakistan has been established by the supporting personal documentation filed, including copies of Pakistani passports for all three claimants.8\n[7] The panel also accepts the identity of the claimants as Ismaili Muslims on a balance of probabilities, based on the supporting letter provided from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Shia Imami Ismaili Council for Ontario.9\nCredibility\n[8] In assessing credibility, the panel is mindful of the principal claimant's education and background. The panel notes that the principal claimant is relatively sophisticated, as an individual with a post-secondary education in XXXX XXXX, with more than 10 years of experience working as an XXXX Officer, followed by his more recent work as a XXXX XXXX.10 The panel notes that the principal claimant also has extensive experience living and travelling outside of his country of origin.\n[9] The panel also took into consideration some of the difficulties that claimants can face in the hearing room, including cultural factors, the milieu of the hearing room, and the stress inherent in responding to oral questions through an interpreter. On this point, the panel notes that the principal claimant opted to provide his testimony in English, with an Urdu-English interpreter on standby.\n[10] The panel also considered the psychiatric assessment11 provided for the principal claimant that identified concerns related to a speech disorder that can be exacerbated by stress, which the principal claimant worried would cause difficulties at the hearing, a concern he also expressed at the outset of the hearing. The panel advised the claimant to relax and take his time with his testimony, and noted that if he felt he needed a break to calm down and get his speech controlled, we could do so at any time. The principal claimant, while at times affected by a stutter, was able to provide his testimony without any concerns raised by himself or his counsel.\n[11] The panel had some concerns with the credibility of the principal claimant's allegations, some of which are noted below. The panel further notes that two witnesses provided testimony at the hearing: the principal claimant's father, and his brother-in-law, XXXX XXXX XXXX. The panel found that the witnesses' testimony did not remedy its credibility concerns but rather further detracted from the credibility of the allegations.\nOmission of claimants experiences from their relative's initial claim forms\n[12] The claimants and their relatives have allegedly faced years of ongoing harassment, threats, and attacks seemingly orchestrated by the jilted ex-husband of the principal claimant's sister XXXX, Mr. XXXX XXXX.\n[13] The panel notes, however, that despite the instructions in both the Personal Information Form (PIF) and BOC to provide details of problems experienced by not just the claimants, but also their family and other similarly situated people, the harm faced by the claimants, including the kidnapping and murder of the principal claimant's infant son, was not mentioned in any of the relative's initial claim forms. The panel notes that it was not until after the claimants filed their claims in Canada, which included these allegations, that the pending claims of other relatives were updated to include these details in amendments to their BOCs.\n[14] The panel finds it reasonable to expect these details to have been included in the PIF12 or additional statements13 filed in XXXX claim, given that it involves a serious attack by the same agent of harm against a close family member. This is especially so as other details from the same time period (2005) were provided in her claim. As well, the panel finds it reasonable to expect the initial BOC narratives14 provided related to the principal claimant's other siblings to have made reference to the experiences of these claimants, for the same reasons noted above. These details are significant and relevant to the claims, especially in the claim of XXXX,15 who had a very similar incident allegedly occur in 2009 when his family was visiting XXXX. The panel notes as well that the claimants and all of their relatives who have sought protection in Canada have been represented by the same counsel and the claimants and the two siblings who filed BOCs were claiming contemporaneously, and so the panel finds it even more reasonable to expect the claimants' details to have been included in all of the claims. Given the concerns of the panel in XXXX claim regarding evolving claim allegations,16 the panel finds it reasonable to expect that the subsequently claiming relatives would have endeavoured to file complete narratives from the outset of their claims.\n[15] When asked about his siblings' failure to include details of his experiences in their initial claim forms, the principal claimant suggested that this was perhaps because they understood that it should only include their own experiences. When asked about this during his testimony, the claimant's brother-in-law also suggested that this was the case.\n[16] Given the previously noted instructions for completing the forms, the panel does not find this to reasonably explain the omission. The panel draws a serious negative inference from this, and finds that the failure of all of the principal claimant's siblings to include details of the principal claimant's allegations in their initial claim statements raises questions as to whether these events ever occurred. The panel finds the most reasonable explanation for the addendums filed to include details of the claimants' allegations in the other claims is that these events had not actually occurred and so it was not until the allegations were made that they had to then be added into the other stories.\nCredibility concerns with the initial story of XXXX XXXX and XXXX other allegations\n[17] The panel notes that despite the sworn statement of the principal claimant in his affidavit for Federal Court, in which he states that three of his siblings have had successful refugee claims in Canada and, \"there were no issues of credibility raised in any of their claims,\"17 the decision in the claim of his sister XXXX18 shows otherwise.\n[18] The allegations in XXXX family's claims are set out in the decision in their claims. It is noted that,\n[6] The details of the claimants' allegations appear in the narrative to the principal and female claimants' Personal Information Forms (PIFs) as they have been amended several times, in a post-hearing affidavit of the principal claimant, and were further elaborated upon orally by the principal and female claimants during the hearing.\n[7] The claimants allege that they are practicing Ismaili Shia Muslims.\n[8] They further allege, to summarize much more detailed further allegations based on a number of events and incidents in Pakistan and Kuwait over many years, that the female claimant is bisexual and they have experienced a complicated history of honour violence and sexual orientation and anti-Ismaili Shia religious persecution in Pakistan and Kuwait at the hands of the female's claimant's ex-husband, his family and a number of other individuals dating all the way back to December 1994.19\n[19] Under the heading \"Analysis,\" the decision went on to note that,\n[10] I do not believe that the female claimant is bisexual or any of the other claim allegations summarized by paragraph 8 herein. The story with respect to these allegations kept changing far too many times for me to be satisfied that any of those claim allegations should be found true, on a balance of probabilities. Nevertheless, based on the claimants' last name and credible confirming letters from the XXXX XXXX councils for Alberta and Ontario, I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants are practicing adherents of the Ismaili Shia faith.20\n[20] The principal claimant was asked about the contradiction between his Federal Court statement and the decision in XXXX claim. It was first suggested that the claimant did not in fact know the details of the decision and the statement was based on what he believed was the case as their claims were heard and decided quickly. The panel does not accept this explanation as the claimant stated as fact that there were no credibility concerns and he should not have provided sworn statement about things he did not know as facts.\n[21] It was noted by the panel that the statement was sworn before the claimants' counsel, who also represented the principal claimant's siblings in their claims, and so she would have been aware that the principal claimant was provided inaccurate information in his statement. Counsel took responsibility for the wording of the statement, and suggested that it could have been worded more clearly and what was meant was that the supporting evidence was not questioned. The panel again does not find this reasonably explains the misrepresentation in the sworn statement. The panel finds the mischaracterization of the credibility of XXXX allegations to be an example of the principal claimant and counsel framing situations to suit their purpose.\n[22] The panel draws a serious negative inference from the misrepresentation of the findings in the decision of XXXX.\nDoes the family have a history of persecution at the hands of XXXX XXXX and his associates?\n[23] The panel notes that one of the concerns of the Court with the previous decision in these claims related to the acceptance by other panels of the history of persecution from Ameen XXXX faced by the family. It was noted that,\nThe Member failed to engage a reasonable analysis of the narratives provided by Mr. XXXX siblings which appear to speak to the heart of the persecution alleged by him. Rather, she writes that although she could have done so, \"they are only peripherally germane to the allegations of the claimant and his personal risk.\" Specifically, she fails to engage in an examination of how it could be that three other panels had accepted claims from three members of Mr. XXXX family based on their of persecution by Mr. XXXX, when she did not in this case, even though he alleged the same risk. [sic](emphasis added)21\n[24] As previously noted, the panel who heard XXXX claim did not accept the allegations in her claim outside of her being an Ismaili. The amendments and additions that were at the heart of the credibility concerns in her claim include that she had even been previously married, which was not included in her initial personal history;22 let alone the problems from her ex-husband (XXXX);23 or the problems from Uncle XXXX, which were only added in a post-hearing affidavit.24 The positive decision she received was not on the basis of persecution at the hands of XXXX XXXX.\n[25] Also previously noted are the present panel's concerns around the continually shifting story of the family's experiences in the various amended statements filed throughout the siblings' claims. The various claims of ongoing harassment by additional family members has shifted as new claims were filed, to cover off all the stories, which only serves to further undermine the story as a whole.\n[26] In view of all the above, the panel finds that the family's history of persecution at the hands of XXXX XXXX and his associates, including Uncle XXXX, has not been established on a balance of probabilities and that it is likely a fabrication. If XXXX, the source of all the family's problems with XXXX, did not credibly establish in her claim a history of problems at the hands of her ex-husband, it is stands to reason that he is not involved in the ongoing harassment of her extended family.\n[27] The panel is of the opinion that the principal claimant's statement,25 as to there being no credibility concerns with his siblings claims, misled the Court as to the credibility of XXXX allegations, and that the Court was also not aware of the ever-fluid nature of the family's allegations about the harm they have collectively faced at the hands of XXXX XXXX and those associated with him.\n[28] The panel finds that in this light, many of the impugned credibility findings of the previous panel26 become reasonable.\nOther concerns with the testimony and supporting document provided\n[29] While the panel agrees with the Court's assessment that, \"minor typographical errors in a completed form, whether found in a Pakistani medical report, a judgment of the Federal Court, or indeed reasons of a Member of the RPD, cannot be reasonably used to suggest that the document may be fraudulent\",27 the panel does have a concern with errors printed into the form itself, when printed in English in a country where English is not only one of two official languages, but the \"lingua franca of Pakistani elite and most government ministries.\"28\n[30] The birth document29 provided for the principal claimant's son who was allegedly kidnapped and murdered has printed into the form itself, \"sex of bavy (sic).\" The principal claimant was unable to reasonably explain this. The panel finds that an official form would reasonably not have such an error printed into the form itself. The panel finds this reasonably brings the veracity of the document into question.\n[31] In addition to this, the panel also had concerns around key information missing from the birth documents, such as the complete names of both parents as well as their National Identity Card numbers, especially given that these cards were purportedly used for the issuance of the birth document, as well as the time of birth for the babies. As well, the principal claimant's brother-in-law, who allegedly had a hand in obtaining this document from Pakistan, provided inconsistent testimony to that of the principal claimant as to the process for this and even for what document was being requested: a b-form or a birth registration document. When this was put to the principal claimant, he suggested that by b-form, his brother-in-law perhaps meant birth, but the panel notes that these are two very different documents.30\n[32] All of the above concerns, combined with the fact that a third-party was able to obtain this document without any formal authorization, only copies of the principal claimant and his wife's identity cards lead the panel to conclude that these are likely not genuine documents, especially in light of the prevalence of fraudulent documents in Pakistan.31\n[33] Another document with errors in English printed into the form itself is the medical report32 for the principal claimant's wife treatment in Pakistan. It was indicated by the principal claimant that this was at the XXXX General Hospital,33 which he confirmed at the hearing. The panel notes that the name \"XXXX\" is printed as \"XXXX\" on one part of the letterhead and as \"XXXX\" in the address section of the letterhead and under the doctor's signature on the letter. The panel asked the claimant about this and he suggested that while the name was \"XXXX,\" when said in Urdu it sounds like \"XXXX.\" The panel does not find this to reasonably explain why the name is spelled once correctly and twice incorrectly on the letter, and so finds this brings the provenance of the report into question.\n[34] The panel also had concern with the testimony and supporting documents around another key incident in the claims, the alleged murder of the principal claimant's grandmother. In the principal claimant's written statement,34 it was stated that his father had received an ominous call from a person who had asked about his mother, and when the father was unable to reach his mother (the principal claimant's grandmother) he went to Pakistan and reported the matter to the police, who two days later found the woman dead on the street. Provided in support of this was a death certificate for the grandmother listing the cause of death as kidnapping and murder,35 and a copy of the report purportedly made to police.36 The principal claimant's father provided testimony at the hearing on this matter, and in his version, his mother had called him to say she was having problems with enemies, and so he went to visit her in Pakistan. During his visit, approximately four-six days after his arrival, he went to market and came home to find his mother was not there and he received a call that she was lying in the street. When asked about this discrepancy, the father confirmed that it was his mother that called him to Pakistan, not a call from another individual, and that he was visiting with her prior to her death, not that she was missing. The principal claimant suggested that the discrepancy was due to memory problems suffered by his father following two strokes and a heart attack, however the panel notes that this is not a case of the father not remembering certain details but providing a completely different account. As such, the panel does not find this adequately explains the difference, and draws a negative inference from this. The panel finds that this brings into question the supporting documents provided related to this incident, as in the father's first-hand account there was no kidnapping reported to police on arrival, as his mother was not missing. Related to this, her death certificate should not reasonably refer to kidnapping and murder, as there was no kidnapping.\n[35] The panel notes as well that the documents themselves are inconsistent with the principal claimant's testimony, as according to the death certificate the mother was buried on XXXX XXXX, 2013, two days before the report to the police was filed (XXXX XXXX, 2015), which (1) does not accord with the principal claimant's statement that the body was found in the street two days after the report to police and (2) does not make sense that she could be buried before her body was found.\n[36] As well, a cause of death relates to the disease, condition, or injuries officially determined to have resulted in an individual's death. Neither kidnapping nor murder are causes of death, and as such, the panel finds it unreasonable for them to be listed as such on the various death certificates in evidence.37\n[37] In light of the above concerns with the credibility of the allegations, as well as the concerns noted with some of the supporting documents themselves, given the prevalence of fraudulent documents in Pakistan,38 the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that little weight can be given to the various documents provided in support of these claims.\nSituation of the principal claimant's wife and children in Kuwait\n[38] The principal claimant and counsel have made statements throughout the processing of the claims, right up into January 201639 that the principal claimant's remaining family in Kuwait (wife and children) were in hiding and facing immediate deportation if they were discovered in Kuwait. Counsel made reference to making contact with Amnesty International to assist with their situation, however nothing further was provided related to any contact with the group or any response received.\n[39] Prior to the hearing, the principal claimant provided a copy of two pages of his wife's passport including a residency permit for Kuwait that is valid until 2017.40 This permit was issued in 2015 and suggests that at least from that point in time, the claimant's wife had valid residency and so was not facing imminent deportation. This contradicts the statements made since that time about the residency status of the family in Kuwait and their risk of immediate deportation.\n[40] When asked about this, the claimant suggested that the permit was nothing more than a sticker in her passport that he had paid for, and that it offered her no protection from deportation. On questioning from the panel, the claimant could not explain why he would pay thousands of dollars for this permit if it offered no status or protection. In questioning from counsel, the claimant later suggested that while it offered no protection, it did allow his wife and children to access services. It does not make sense that the claimant would pay thousands of dollars for a sticker that did not protect his family from deportation, if his concern was that they could be discovered without status and swiftly removed to Pakistan.\n[41] Considering the above, the panel does not find the claimant's statements about the nature of the residency and the situation of his family in Kuwait to be reasonable or credible. The panel draws a negative inference from this.\n[42] The panel finds that this also brings into question whether his wife and children were ever out of status, as a complete copy of his wife's passport was not provided, which would reasonably include any previous residence permits and show any periods that were not covered by a residency permit. When asked why the whole passport was not provided, the principal claimant indicated that his wife's passport was available to him; however he only provided these pages. As such, the panel finds it reasonable that it could have been provided to establish her previous lack of residency status. The panel notes that the wife's passport was not provided post-hearing, although counsel provided other post-hearing disclosure. The panel finds that this further detracts from the allegations that the claimants' family in Kuwait were without status or that they were facing imminent deportation to Pakistan.\n[43] The panel notes that the principal claimant also alleges that despite the valid residency permit to 2017 his wife's sponsor has advised that they will need to leave the country by XXXX XXXX, 2016. Related to this, the panel notes the principal claimant's reference to \"a new Kuwaiti law\"41 that will result in his wife and children's deportation. When asked at the hearing about this, the principal claimant stated that it was a law that had come into effect in January 2016. The claimant was unable to provide details on the new law, and the panel finds it reasonable to expect documentary evidence to support this change in the law, given the other, older reports on issues related to residency permits.42 The panel notes that there is nothing on the file outside of the principal claimant's statements to support this and finds this to be an embellishment, like his other statements about his family's status in Kuwait.\nFailure to claim previously while in the United States (US)\n[44] The panel notes that the principal claimant twice visited the US in 2012, and rather than seeking protection in the US or entering Canada to seek protection through the Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA), he instead returned to Kuwait.\n[45] The panel finds the principal claimant's actions inconsistent with those facing the risk of harm he alleges in Pakistan, and who had only tenuous temporary status in Kuwait. The panel finds this to be especially so, given that he already had family who were seeking asylum for the same reasons in Canada, and given that there were already reports43 that in 2011 Kuwait was not issuing or renewing visas for Pakistani nationals, forcing his sister XXXX and her family to come to Canada and make refugee claims. It is not reasonable that once in the US, where the principal claimant also has a sibling, he would not take the opportunity to seek permanent protection in either the US or Canada.\n[46] When asked about this at the hearing, the principal claimant indicated that his sister in the US advised against claiming there, noting concerns with the situations for Muslims in the country. He provided an example of an Egyptian colleague that he had worked with who also claimed in the US around that time (2011-12) and who in 2016 were still awaiting an outcome on their claims. The panel does not find this reasonably explains his failure to claim in the US, as (1) no documentation has been provided to support his contention that being Muslim would affect his refugee process in the US; (2) while the Egyptian family are still allegedly awaiting and outcome of their 2011\/12 claims in the US, at that time, in 2012, this wait time would not have been an issue, as he would have only just recently claimed; and (3) despite concerns with being Muslim in the US, his sibling is a dual citizen and his parents took up green card residency in the country.\n[47] The panel notes that the minor claimants filed their claims at the Canadian border through the family exception to the STCA in January 2014, and given that his sister XXXX was in Canada in 2012, the principal claimant could reasonably have done this as well. When asked why he did not come to Canada in 2012 through the STCA, the principal claimant first stated that he did not know that he could apply at the border. When it was noted by the panel that as a tech-savvy individual he could have researched this, he conceded that he had seen this online but wasn't sure that it was true in practice. The panel draws a negative inference from his shifting explanation.\n[48] Given the tentative and allegedly precarious nature of the claimants' status in Kuwait and the seriousness of the alleged risk in Pakistan, the panel finds the principal claimant's actions inconsistent with those reasonably expected in the situation, and finds this brings into question both his subjective fear and the credibility of the allegations. The panel notes that this finding is consistent with its other concerns around the credibility of the claimants' allegations and the well-foundedness of his alleged fear of return to Pakistan.\nDisclosure of XXXX sensitive allegations\n[49] The panel notes another concern of counsel that was raised at the initial hearing of the claim, in the Federal Court proceedings, and in ongoing correspondence with the RPD was around the disclosure of unredacted documents related to sensitive allegations in XXXX claim. In a letter from counsel dated XXXX XXXX, 2014, cited in the Federal Court decision,44 she expressed concern that the previous panel's conduct \"directly exposed me to a breach of confidentiality claim by my former client, XXXX (who is not even aware of the breach as yet)\" [sic].\n[50] The panel notes, in reviewing the documentation on the file, that this is another situation that was not accurately represented by counsel. Prior to the previous panel's inadvertent disclosure of the amended PIF details in XXXX 2014, counsel herself put into evidence, in XXXX 2014, an unredacted statement45 from XXXX husband that makes reference to the aspect of XXXX alleged identity that was to be kept from being disclosed in these claims. So, rather than the previous panel exposing counsel to a breach of XXXX confidentiality, it appears that counsel first made that breach herself months prior.\n[51] The panel finds this to be consistent with its previous noted concerns with statements from the principal claimant and counsel in portraying situations in the manner that best suits them rather than sticking to the facts of a given situation.\nCredibility finding\n[52] In light of the cumulative negative inferences with regard to credibility, the panel finds the principal claimant to be generally not credible. In short, the panel found the claimants' allegations not to be credible and found that their story as a whole lacked the ring of truth.\n[53] Given the principal claimant's lack of credibility and the concerns with the supporting documentation, the panel finds that the claimants have failed to provide sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to establish their allegations on a balance of probabilities. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants did not face any of the alleged threats and attacks set out in their claims.\nObjective basis\n[54] While their allegations were found not credible, the panel did accept that the claimants are Ismaili Muslims. The panel notes that in XXXX claim, in which the only allegation accepted by that panel was that she and her family were Ismaili, the positive decision46 was based on their profile as Ismailis.\n[55] The panel notes that while it is not bound by the findings of other panels in the decisions made on claims of the principal claimant's relatives, they are relevant in the assessment of these claims. The panel has considered the decision of the Federal Court in Mendoza,47 a case involving different results for two brothers; the Court indicated that the RPD had an obligation to explain why a contrary result was reached:\nAlthough there are some differences, Mauricio's refugee protection claim was based on the same agents of persecution, the same conduct in seeking state protection, and largely on the same facts, as Edwin's claim. Moreover, since it was accepted, the RPD must have found that state protection was not available to Mauricio in Colombia. As the applicants submit, at the very least, Mauricio was a similarly situated individual. However, there is no mention at all in the decision under review of the successful RPD decision regarding Mauricio's claim.\nThis court has held that it is incumbent on the RPD Member when reaching a different result than was previously reached by another Member regarding a claim by a family member under similar circumstances, to explain why a contrary result was reached: Mengesha v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2009 FC 431 at para 5, 184 ACWS (3d) 193, and Siddiqui v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2007 FC 6 at paras 18 - 20, 154 ACWS (3d) 673 [Siddiqui]).\n[56] The panel notes that each claim is decided by a panel on the evidence before it, including the country condition documentation. The panel does not know on what evidentiary basis the other panels formed their decision that Ismaili Shia face a serious possibility of persecution in Pakistan, or that this risk extends throughout the country.\n[57] This panel has before it only the decision in XXXX claim, as there had been a Rule 21 application made to disclose her personal information, to which she did not object (outside of the requested redaction of certain elements), and for which it was found that there was not a serious possibility that disclosing the information will endanger the life, liberty or security of any person; and that disclosing the information was not likely to cause an injustice. No such Rule 21 application had been made for the disclosure of personal information from the other siblings' files, and while their BOCs were put into evidence by counsel, their decisions were not similarly disclosed.\n[58] In looking at XXXX decision, there is reference48 to documentary evidence filed by the claimants establishing the claims, with reference to sections of the National Documentation Package from May 2013 establishing that adequate protection is not available. There are no references to specific documents to clarify on what these findings were made, only broad general statements that the country documentation supports the panel's findings.\n[59] The present panel has carefully considered the evidence before it, from the most recent National Documentation Package for Pakistan,49 as well as the country documentation provided by counsel50, and finds on the evidence before it, that there is not a serious possibility that the claimants, as Ismailis, face a serious possibility of persecution in Pakistan, or that they likely face a danger of torture, a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\n[60] While the country documentation does speak to problems of sectarian tensions and incidents of violence targeting some of the religious minority groups in Pakistan, the panel finds that the situation described is not such that merely being Ismaili would be sufficient to establish a claim for refugee protection.\n[61] The panel considered the statements from the Court in the judicial review of the previous decision on these claims, wherein it was stated that,\nThe most troubling aspect of the decision under review is the Member's failure to examine the risk to the Ismaili within the risk to its larger sect, the Shia Muslims. Ismailis are a minority within a larger minority but have the same risk as a minority religion. The Member writes that the \"persecution of Shias is something different than persecution faced by Ismailis, although Ismailis are a sub-sect of the Shias. The panel has little difficulty accepting that mainstream Shias are persecuted.\" She reaches the conclusion that while the Shia are persecuted, its sub-sect, the Ismaili, is not, based on her conclusion that there are only two references to Ismailis being targeted in Pakistan in the national documentation package. From this she concludes that \"the Ismaili community had previously been shielded from the religious-based violence that happens in Pakistan.\"\nI agree with the submissions of the applicant at paragraphs 12 to 22 that the Member's findings in this regard are unreasonable because it ignores and fails to address documentary evidence to the contrary. Specifically, it ignores statements such as the following found in the article 'Pakistan's Shia genocide 101:' \"[T]he militant anti-Shia organizations see all Shia as just Shia and do not care about what subsect they come from. It is the overriding Shia belief which is the cause of their killing. All Shia of Pakistan have been victim of persecution.\"\nIn light of this observation, the court accepts the submission of the applicant that \"while some minorities, such as Shias, receive much more attention and media coverage, the lack of specific reference to Ismaili does not support the ... inference that they have been shielded from persecution.\"51\n[62] In reviewing the country documentation, the panel notes that a number of documents before it indicate that until recently, the Ismaili community had previously been shielded from the religious-based violence that happens in Pakistan, and that the Ismaili community does not have the history of problems of some of the other groups within the larger Shia community.\n[63] For example, the country report State of Human Rights in 2013 noted, in talking about two attacks against the Ismaili community in 2013, that prior to the attacks \"the peaceful and progressive Ismaili community had only faced communal violence in Gilgit Baltitstan and Chitral.\"52 This was similarly reported in the report Religious Minorities. Muslims Sects. Maps of Pakistan. Pakistan: Challenges and Perspectives, which noted that prior to 2013 the group was spared of being the target of terrorist attacks.53 A number of news reports provided by counsel54 reporting on the 2013 attacks also noted that this community was previously spared such violence.\n[64] The panel notes that even in XXXX positive decision,55 the panel made reference to counsel's documentation establishing that Ismailis had until recently been able to avoid falling under the shadow of sectarian violence.\n[65] The panel notes that the previously cited human rights report56 also went on to note that the main target for faith based violence in 2013 was the Hazara Shia community in Balochistan, which is consistent with the information provided throughout the documentation reporting on sectarian violence in Pakistan. The panel notes that the Hazara are not only religiously but also ethnically, visibly different from other communities. Outside of this, the majority of reports speak of incidents occurring in other hotspots for such violence, with UNHCR noting,\nSuch attacks were carried out predominantly in the North-West of the country - including in Dera Ismail Khan, Hangu, Kohat and Tank districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, and Kurram and Orakzai Agencies in FATA - as well as in urban centres throughout the country - including Gilgit (Northern Areas), Lahore(Punjab province), Karachi (Sindh province) and Quetta (Balochistan province).57\n[66] The country documentation makes clear that certain subgroups of Shia, like the Hazara and Turis,58 are more targeted than others, such as the Ismailis, and that some areas are significantly riskier than others as well.\n[67] The panel notes that UNHCR, while noting concern with sectarian violence in Pakistan against religious minorities, does not suggest that the situation is such that all Shias face a serious possibility of persecution in the country, what they do say is that,\nUNHCR considers that members of the Shia community, particularly those in areas where Taliban-affiliated groups are active, such as the northwest of Pakistan and in urbancentres, may, depending on the individual circumstances of the case, be in need of international refugee protection on account of their religion and\/or (imputed) political opinion.\n[68] Similarly UNHCR does not suggest that those who do face such harm would be unable to relocate within the country, but rather suggest that a viable internal flight alternative could even exist in the case of Ahmadis, a group that reportedly faces much more reported violence, discrimination and marginalization, including anti-Ahmadi legislation.\n[69] This is consistent with other reports that indicate,\nBecause of Pakistan's size and diversity, internal relocation offers a degree of anonymity and the opportunity for victims to seek refuge from discrimination or violence. In most cases, there are options available for members of most ethnic and religious minorities to be able to relocate to areas of relative safety elsewhere in Pakistan. In particular, many large urban centres are home to mixed ethnic and religious communities and offer greater opportunities for employment, access to services and a greater degree of state protection than other areas. In practice, internal relocation is most successful when these conditions exist, but is limited mostly by a lack of financial resources and in some cases due to debts owed to landowners or money lenders.59\n[70] Another report60 notes that while Shia Muslims may be subject to attacks by anti-Shia and militant groups, this varies from region to region and there are many towns across Pakistan with no intercommunal sectarian tensions.\n[71] While incidents do still occur, with an attack on the Ismail community occurring in Karachi in 2015, it has been recently reported that overall, sectarian violence has statistically declined in the past 1.5 years.61\n[72] The panel notes that counsel made reference to the situation of Ismailis becoming like that of Ahmadis, however the panel finds that the country documentation does not bear this out. While an article from 200562 expresses concern that a dispute over education issues has raised fears that this could be a sign of Ismailis becoming like the Ahmadi, in the more than 10 years since, this has not come to pass.\n[73] The panel notes that while the constitution declares Ahmadis as \"non-Muslim\" and the penal code makes it illegal for Ahmadis in Pakistan to call themselves Muslims and practice or propagate their faith as Muslims,63 this is not the case for either the Shia community generally or the Ismaili community specifically. As well, though reports64 indicate that the Pakistani government proactively victimizes the Ahmadis socially, economically, and educationally and that Ahamdis are marginalized or excluded from the electoral process, again this is not reported to be the case of Ismailis, or the larger Shia community.\n[74] While a report65 on religious minorities notes that most religious minority groups reported discrimination in hiring, the noted exception was the Shia. The same report further noted that there are no discriminatory laws or government policies that discriminate against Shias in Pakistan. Neither are there any legal restrictions on freedom of religion for Shias. There is little societal discrimination that would restrict Shias in their daily life. Another report before the panel66 speaks to marginalization faced by some religious minorities and provides details of such faced by Ahmadi, Christian, and Hindu communities, but is silent on such problems for the Shia or Ismaili in Pakistan.\n[75] The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants have not satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on the basis of their Ismaili faith, or that, on a balance of probabilities, they would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life, or face a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, if they were to return to Pakistan.\n[76] The panel has reviewed all of the country documentation, including counsel's, which included many instances of multiple sources reporting on the same incident and one case where one report67 from a source the panel has little information about, viewpointonline.net, was provided in duplicate. In considering the evidence, the panel has given further weight to more recent reports over dated information as it better reflects the current conditions, and also prefers the information from recognized, neutral sources with expertise in country of origin information to that from unknown sources.\n[77] While incidents of sectarian violence do occur, and extremists do oppose the Shia generally and may wish harm upon all Shia sub sect communities, and so and it is within the realm of possibility that religious minorities will be targeted by extremists going forward, and that as Ismailis they may conceivably face such harm, the situation is not reportedly such that the claimants, merely by being Ismaili, face a serious possibility of persecution in Pakistan.\nThe additional concerns for the female minor claimant\n[78] The panel also considered whether there was a risk to the female minor claimant on the basis of her gender. The panel notes that this was not presented in the initial BOC, or in the additional statement provided by the principal claimant. This was raised during the hearing by counsel, and was elaborated on by the principal claimant. The panel finds it reasonable to expect that if such a concern existed for the child, that it would have been raised in the initial claim or in the years between her claim being filed in January 2014 and the hearing date in April 2016.\n[79] The panel notes that the country documentation does not establish the situation in Pakistan as alleged by the principal claimant and counsel, on a balance of probabilities. The panel notes that the attacks on schools, including the military school in Peshawar, occurred in regions where the Taliban and other extremists are active or have control. These incidents do not take place across the country.\n[80] The panel also does not find support in the country documents for the proposition that the minor female claimant would be forced to wear hijab or that her failure to do so would present problems for her or her family members. The panel finds that this was an embellishment, with details being made up on the spot, which is consistent with it having not been raised as an issue until two years into her refugee claim process. The panel notes that there has not been a change in country conditions during this time period that would reasonably explain the addition of this new risk to the minor female claimant.\n[81] While counsel spoke of Malala (who counsel at one point suggested had died and that she had had a bomb thrown at her) this is not an average female student in urban Pakistan, but an activist, who was also the child of a father who was outspoken and active in promoting education for girls living in the SWAT Valley in rural Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. While the story of Malala grabbed headlines around the world, hers is not the story of your typical girl in Pakistan, and she is in no way of the same profile as the female minor claimant before the panel, a young girl who would reasonably be living in an urban centre with her family, if not their home city of XXXX, then one of those proposed for relocation by the panel.\n[82] The panel notes that all Sunni groups are not the same.68 While extremist groups are largely from the Deobandi sect, the predominant Sunni sect is actually Barelvi, a group that shares some common practices with the Shia.69 Pakistani society, while largely Sunni, is not the picture painted by counsel of forced wearing of hijab and burqa and restricted access to education for girls. Instead, it was noted that the Barelvi majority are generally seen as moderate, more open-minded and shunning of violence and extremist views.70 While it may well be the case in some areas under Taliban influence it is not the situation throughout the country, and certainly not in the urban centres the claimants would reasonably reside in should they return to Pakistan.\n[83] The panel finds that the female minor claimant (and her female relatives) would be reasonably free to choose to wear the hijab or not, and would be free to pursue an education and pursue a career. The panel points to the fact that Pakistan has had a female Shia politician elected to power as Prime Minister.\n[84] The panel notes, from its observing of counsel's comments during the hearing, that counsel's understanding of the situation on the ground in Pakistan did not seem rooted in fact but in what she believed the situation to be. She did not seem to have a firm grasp on the geography or differences within and between regions, an example being her having never heard of the fourth largest city in Pakistan (Hyderabad), and not knowing where some of the hotpots for sectarian violence were located within Pakistan (Peshawar, Quetta). The panel finds that counsel's references to Pakistan being a \"crazy\" country, her lack of knowledge of basic Pakistani geography and her seeming to confuse the situation in the tribal areas with the situation across Pakistan, in referring to having to wear either the burqa or hijab, brings into question on what evidentiary basis her submissions on this issue were being made.\n[85] The evidence before the panel does not establish that there is more than a mere possibility that the minor female claimant, as a female Ismaili who does not wish to wear hijab and enjoys such freedoms as attending school, would face treatment that amounts to persecution on a Convention ground or that she faces a danger of torture, risk to life, or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\nInternal Flight Alternative (IFA)\n[86] In the event the panel erred in its assessment of the situation facing the claimants in XXXX\n[87] as Ismaili Shia, the panel also considered, whether, if the claimants were to face a serious possibility of persecution in Karachi, this situation would be faced by the claimants throughout Pakistan.\n[88] The test to be applied in determining whether there is an IFA is two-pronged. Firstly, the Board must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no serious possibility of the claimants being persecuted in the proposed IFA. Secondly, the conditions in the proposed IFA must be such that it would not be objectively unreasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claimants for them to seek refuge there. Both prongs must be satisfied for a finding that the claimants have an IFA.\nNotice of the issue\n[89] The panel gave notice at the outset of the hearing that IFA was an issue in these claims. The principal claimant was asked during the hearing about their ability to relocate in Pakistan to Hyderabad and Islamabad, the proposed IFA locations.\nThe first prong - no serious possibility of persecution\n[90] The principal claimant was asked whether they could return to Islamabad or Hyderabad, and what he thought was the situation they would face in these cities, and he responded that XXXX would be able to locate them, based on their registration, and so they would continue to face a risk from him and his associates. He further indicated that he had concerns relocating in these cities as an Ismaili, as he would face problems on this basis.\n[91] As noted previously, given the credibility concerns, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimants and their family do not have the history of persecution alleged in their claims. As such, the panel does not find that there is a serious possibility that the claimants face persecution or that they face a danger of torture, risk to life, or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment on this basis.\n[92] As noted under the heading objective basis, the panel finds that the claimants do not face a serious possibility of persecution as Ismailis in Pakistan. Even accepting, given the generally dangerous situation in Karachi, that the claimants would choose to relocate, the panel finds that the objective evidence does not establish a risk to the claimants in either of the proposed IFA locations. This is consistent with the information in the detailed breakdown of such violence71 provided by counsel, which speaks of only a handful of incidents in the two locations out of the more than three thousand incidents in Pakistan as a whole, for which details were provided.\n[93] The panel notes that it was elsewhere reported72 that Sindh is relatively liberal, and outside of XXXX, incidents of sectarian violence in the rest of Sindh are rare; and in Islamabad problems are also comparatively few, with it noted that it has been mainly spared by sectarian attacks and saw just a few low-scale general attacks in recent years.\n[94] While counsel has provided a travel report for Pakistan issued by the United Kingdom,73 which speaks to concerns of increased criminality in Hyderabad and concerns of crime and kidnapping in Interior Sindh, as well as instructions for British High Commission staff in Islamabad to avoid certain areas, the panel notes that these instructions are for a target audience (foreigners visiting the country) and may speak to risks to this audience rather than for nationals of Pakistan. As well, few details were provided related to these concerns as to how these would speak to risk under sections 96 and 97(1) of the IRPA for these claimants.\n[95] Thus, on the evidence before it, the panel finds that there is no serious possibility that the claimants would be persecuted, or that they would be subjected, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture in Hyderabad or Islamabad.\nThe second prong - reasonable in all the circumstances\n[96] Regarding the reasonableness of the IFA locations, the panel finds for the reasons that follow that it is reasonable in all of the particular circumstances of the claimants' situation, that in returning to Pakistan, they could relocate to Hyderabad or Islamabad.\n[97] Hyderabad is a city of approximately 1.15 million74 in the province of Sindh75 in the south of the country. Islamabad, the capital city, has a population of between 800,00076 and 919,00077 and is located in the Islamabad Capital Territory78.\n[98] Looking at the claimants' particular profiles, the panel notes that the principal claimant is a married 36-year-old male with a post-secondary XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and more than 10 years of experience working in the XXXX field in Kuwait. The minor claimants are 11-year-old XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The principal claimant's wife and four other children are currently in Kuwait, and while not claimants to be considered in this assessment, the panel notes as family members they would reasonably join the claimants, should they return to Pakistan.\n[99] The panel also considered that the claimants are members of the minority Ismaili Shia faith, as well as the fact that they speak Urdu and English, the two official languages of Pakistan.\n[100] When asked if there was anything outside of their fear of harm that would prevent them from relocating, the principal claimant identified his concerns with his ability to work, attend mosque, and his children's ability to attend school. The panel notes that nothing in the documentary evidence was pointed to, to support these concerns. The panel again notes the documentary evidence79 before it reporting that: unlike other religious minority groups, Shia had not reported discrimination in hiring; there are no discriminatory laws or government policies that discriminate against Shias in Pakistan, nor are there any legal restrictions on freedom of religion for Shias; and there is little societal discrimination that would restrict Shias in their daily life.\n[101] Hyderabad and Islamabad being urban centres, there is little beyond the speculation of the principal claimant to establish that he would be unable to find work, that his children would not be able to attend school, or that they would be unable to practice their faith. Given its concerns with the principal claimant's mischaracterization of situations to suit his needs, the panel gives little weight to the principal claimant's statements in this regard and prefers the neutral country documentation.\n[102] The panel notes that the country documentation stands in contrast to the principal claimant's testimony regarding the discrimination he alleges he would face as an Ismaili Shia in Pakistan. A report from February 2015 on the Shia in Pakistan,80 indicates that:\nThere are no discriminatory laws or government policies against Shias in Pakistan; neither are there any legal restrictions on freedom of religion for Shias .There is little societal discrimination that would restrict Shias in their daily life (see Representation in the country information). There are a significant number of Shia communities across Pakistan. Shia mosques and places of worship are located in most major cities and towns. In most cases there are options for Shia Muslims to relocate to other areas in Pakistan. Shias in Pakistan are often employed in Government and hold high offices. Notable examples include former Presidents and Prime Ministers. Shias are well represented in Parliament, the police, judiciary and other institutions. Shias are represented on Pakistan's Council of Islamic Ideology, the Constitutional body that provides advice to the Government of Pakistan on issues of Islamic jurisprudence and practice. Shias also have representation in the Shariat Courts.\n[103] While counsel and claimant suggest that this was for the larger Shia community and not the sub sect Ismaili community, the panel notes that there is little beyond their statements to establish this and finds it reasonable to expect that if a sub sect of the community were marginalized and discriminated against or treated significantly differently from the larger group, that this would appear in either the NDP or counsel's documentation.\n[104] The panel has little beyond the principal claimant's words to suggest that relocating would be unreasonable. The panel notes that the claimants are relatively sophisticated individuals who are mobile and adaptable, having lived first in Kuwait and now Canada for years, and finds that they would reasonably be able to do the same in either of the proposed IFA locations.\n[105] In view of the above, the panel finds on a balance of probabilities, that there are no serious social, economic, or other barriers to the claimants relocating in Hyderabad or Islamabad.\n[106] The panel therefore finds that it would not be unreasonable, in all circumstances, including those particular to the claimants, for them to seek refuge in either of these cities.\n[107] For all of the reasons above, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants have a viable IFA in Hyderabad or Islamabad.\n[108] As IFA is determinative of both sections 96 and 97(1), the panel finds the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\nCONCLUSION\n[109] For the reasons set out above, the panel finds the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.\n[110] The panel therefore rejects these claims.\n(signed)\n\"J.Wagner\"\nJ.

The claimants are citizens of Turkey and are claiming refugee protection to ss. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act1 (IRPA).\n[2] These claims were heard jointly pursuant to Rule 552 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules.\n[3] In accordance with s 167(2)3 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the Refugee Protection Division designated XXXX XXXX to be the representative for the minor claimant for the purpose of this refugee claim.\n[4] In deciding this claim, the panel considered the Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender Related Persecution.4\n[5] The panel considered a written submission provided by counsel dated December 21, 2015.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] The panel finds that the claimants have not established that there is a serious possibility on a Convention ground or that on a balance of probabilities, they would personally be subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if they were to return to Turkey today.\n[7] The determinative issue in this case is credibility.\nALLEGATIONS\n[8] Regarding the allegations, these are noted in the claimants' Personal Information Forms (PIF).5 The following is a summary.\nXXXX and XXXX XXXX\n[9] The claimants are a married Alevi couple from Turkey. The male claimant is 26 years and the female claimant is 23 years.\n[10] In 2008 while working as a seaman, the male claimant was involved in a heated political argument. He was reported to the gendarme and was detained questioned and tortured. The claimant's XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX with gas.\n[11] In 2007 the male claimant became involved with the DTP. In XXXX 2010 the male claimant joined the Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) and was selected as a party delegate. In XXXX 2012 the female claimant became a party XXXX of the BDP. In XXXX 2012 the claimants were detained and tortured. Police came to their house twice while the male claimant was away at sea. The claimants decided to leave Turkey for their safety. The male claimant was also afraid of having to participate in military service. The claimants made claims for protection in Canada in April 2012.\nXXXX XXXX\n[12] The claimant is 17 year old Arab Alevi female. In XXXX 2012 the claimant was detained by police. She was held overnight and beaten. The police were interested in her brother, the male claimant. In XXXX 2013 the claimant was mistaken for a political protestor. She was assaulted by police, including sexual assault. In XXXX 2014 a man named XXXX XXXX proposed marriage to the claimant. The claimant refused. In XXXX 2015 this man tried to abduct her. At the end of XXXX the claimant complained to police about this man. In XXXX 2015 the man appeared and the claimant called the police. The police did not respond. The claimant went to police again and the police blamed her for the situation. The police knew she was Alevi and told her she should convert to Islam and said not to come back with stupid reasons.\n[13] Later the claimant went to the prosecutor's office to file a complaint. The prosecutor refused to open an investigation as there was no evidence against the XXXX XXXX. The prosecutor ordered the claimant and her father off of the premises and threatened the claimant. When the claimant's father resisted, police officers detained the claimant and her father. The claimant was assaulted. The police told the claimant not to mess with XXXX XXXX. The claimant complained to the Ministry of Justice and Directorate of General Security about police and the prosecutor.\n[14] After this occurrence, the claimant was sent to live in Istanbul, but XXXX XXXX found her in Istanbul. He was dressed as an ISIS fighter. He threatened the claimant's father with death. The claimant's parents helped her to escape from Turkey. The claimant also fears to return to Turkey because she is Arab Alevi.\nIDENTITY\n[15] The claimants' identities as nationals of Turkey was established by their testimony and by the supporting documents filed, such as their Turkish passports.6 XXXX and XXXX identities as political activists of interest to the Turkish authorities were not established.\n[16] The claimants' identities as Alevi was established by their testimony, and by supporting documents filed such as letters from the Canadian Alevi Culture Centre.7.\nCREDIBLITY\n[17] In assessing credibility, the panel was mindful of the claimants' education, age, and background. The panel is also cognizant of the many difficulties faced by claimants in\nestablishing a claim, including cultural factors, the milieu of the hearing room, and the stress inherent in responding to oral questions through an interpreter and nervousness. However, the panel finds the claimants' testimony not to be credible with respect to the central allegations of their claims.\nXXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX\n[18] The male claimant was interviewed by an Immigration officer when he first made his claim in Canada. The officer notes that the claimant said, \"I want to add something. During my last arrest, the police dragged me down the stairs and XXXX XXXX XXXX. They then blindfolded me and XXXX XXXX XXXX. That's why I am including my medical report. This is why I am afraid and want to make a refugee claim.\"8 However, during the hearing the claimant said that his last detention was XXXX XXXX, 2012, and he was released from this detention on XXXX XXXX, 2012. In response the claimant said that he never told the Immigration officer that his XXXX XXXX XXXX during the last detention. The interpreter was on the phone and the interpreter did not sign the declaration. When the panel asked what the claimant told the Immigration officer about XXXX XXXX XXXX, the claimant said he was asked if he had ever been injured and he told of his XXXX XXXX. The panel does not accept this explanation as reasonable. The Immigration officer's notes clearly indicate that the claimant made the statement about his XXXX XXXX without being prompted by the officer. In the panel's view, there is no reason for the Immigration officer to falsify the claimant's immigration notes. Although the interpreter was on the phone and not available to sign the declaration, it is clear that an interpreter was used given that the claimant requested an interpreter and given that the Immigration officer was able to complete the interview. In the panel's view, if the claimant was detained and his XXXX XXXX XXXX it is reasonable to expect that he would be able to recall, with consistency if this occurred as a result of his last detention. As such the panel is drawing a negative inference regarding the claimant's credibility.\n[19] The male claimant provided a medical report from 2008 that he injured XXXX XXXX.9 The claimant also provided a medical imaging report noting a scar from a previous surgery.10 However the report does not indicate that this was a result of police brutality. As such, given the credibility concerns, the panel is giving little weight to this medical report in regards to the claimant's allegations that he is a target of police in Turkey.\n[20] The male claimant states that he was a delegate for the BDP party in Turkey. When asked about his most recent political activities the claimant said that he was going door to door asking other Arab Alevis to vote for his party. However, the claimant could not remember when he was going door to door on behalf of the party in 2011. The claimant could not remember if he was asking for votes because there was an election coming up. The claimant could not remember if there was an election in 2011. In response to the concern that it seems a delegate of the BDP in 2011 would know of the elections in Turkey in June 2011, the claimant said that he could not even use his vote in the election because he was away at sea. When it was pointed out to the claimant that he was in Turkey to get married in XXXX 2011, the claimant could not remember if the elections took place before or after he got married. There was a general election in Turkey on June 12, 2011. The claimants got married on XXXX XXXX, 2011.11 In the panel's view if the claimant was going door to door asking for votes in 2011, then it is reasonable to expect that he would be able to recall whether the general election was before or after he got married.\n[21] The male and female claimant have provided a psychological report which states that they are both suffering from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and the panel accepts that an aspect of XXXX can be memory problems. However, given that the male claimant could recall asking for votes and going door to door it is reasonable, in the panel's view, that he would be able to recall if he was asking for votes pending an upcoming election. Elections are the driving force of political parties. Entire campaigns are developed around elections. The claimant not being aware of the elections in June 2011 in Turkey given his allegations of being a BDP party delegate and activist has led the panel to draw a negative inference regarding the claimant's credibility.\n[22] The female claimant also could not recall if there was an election around the time of her wedding. She said she was busy planning a big wedding. The panel does not accept this explanation as reasonable. If the female claimant's husband was a party delegate, and was going door to door asking for votes, it is reasonable to expect that the female claimant would be able to recall the election that her husband was canvassing for.\n[23] As such the panel is drawing a negative inference regarding the claimants' credibility.\n[24] The claimants have provided a letter from the People's Democratic Party (HDP) which states that the claimant and his wife went door to door as HDP delegates.12 However the male claimant said that the last time he went door to door was in 2011. The claimant's wife, the female claimant, did not become a delegate until 2012. When asked why the HDP representative said they both went door to door as delegates when that was impossible given that the male claimant last went door to door in 2011, the claimant said they both participated in women's day so maybe the HDP representative got that mixed up. The panel does not accept this explanation as reasonable. The letter states that the records were passed from the BDP. If the claimants were delegates for the party and working going door to door it is reasonable to expect that the party would be able to corroborate this with consistency and not make up information that was not true. As such, the panel is drawing a negative inference regarding the credibility of the claimants and is giving little weight to the letter from the HDP. As well, the letter was written by a party official but no identification or corroboration of the letter's author was provided. As well, the panel notes that the letter does not have security features that would impede the creation of the letter simply to support a refugee claim.\n[25] The claimant does not remember any BDP events from the summer of 2011 just prior to his departure from Turkey. The claimant also could not recall the results from the June 2011 election in Turkey. In the panel's view, even if the claimant has memory problems, if the claimant\nwas a delegate of this party and he was going door to door on behalf of the party it is reasonable to expect that he would be able to recall some BDP events from this time period and he would be able to recall at least generally the results from the last election he took part in in Turkey.13 For example, the documentary evidence notes that many BDP representatives were detained in 2011.14 This was widely protested by the BDP party. However, the claimant was unaware during the first sitting of the hearing of any of the BDP members that were detained at that time. As such the panel is drawing negative inference regarding the claimant's credibility.\n[26] The claimant could not recall that Nevroz, the Kurdish New Year celebrations, were banned in many places in Turkey in March 2012. The BDP is a Kurdish party and many BDP officials were attacked as a result of trying to protest this issue.15 In the panel's view, if the claimants were delegates of the BDP in XXXX 2012 it is reasonable to expect that they would be able to recall this very significant event in BDP history. Again, even with memory problems from PTSD, it is reasonable that they would be able to recall something of these events given their alleged profile as BDP delegates in XXXX 2012. As such the panel is drawing a negative inference regarding the claimants' credibility.\n[27] The male claimant at the second sitting was able to recall some of the BDP members that had been detained in Turkey. The claimant was asked if he looked up this information since the last sitting so that he could answer correctly. The claimant said no, and that he was just under a lot of stress during the last hearing. As well the male claimant was able to recount some information about the BDP and HDP in Turkey. However, given that the claimant could not recount the details in regards to the basic information put to the claimant by the panel, the panel is giving the claimants unsolicited information about his knowledge of politics in Turkey little weight as this is of little value to establish the claimant's own political activities and profile in Turkey prior to XXXX 2012.\n[28] The male claimant states that his father was beaten up in Turkey recently. He said it might be because of his sister's issues, but that he was the one who was politically active so likely it was due to him. However the documentary evidence does not indicate that Turkish authorities go after family members of former political activists. The male claimant has not been in Turkey since April 2012. There is information of family members being interrogated due to active members, but there is no information that family members of former BDP activists are being targeted. In response the claimant said that he knows that both his father and sister did face this situation. The panel does not accept this explanation as reasonable. In the panel's view if the Turkish authorities target former BDP member's families it is reasonable to expect that this would be recorded somewhere in the documentary evidence. Further if the claimant has not been in Turkey since 2012, there is no reason for authorities to pressure family members in order to have the claimant stop his political activities. As such the panel is drawing a negative inference regarding the claimant's credibility.\n[29] The male claimant states that he decided to leave Turkey right after his last detention in XXXX 2012. However in his PIF16 the claimant states that \"because of our prior problems my wife and I had already been planning to leave Turkey; to this end my wife had earlier applied for a passport which was issued on the same day that we were detained.\" In response the claimant said that he has psychological problems. The panel does not accept this explanation as reasonable. The claimant did not say that he could not remember when he decided to leave. The claimant mentions his memory problem when confronted with the inconsistency. The male claimant said he decided to leave Turkey after his last detention which is inconsistent with what is in his PIF. The claimant further explained that in 2006 he wanted to leave but it was not until after the 2012 detention that he decided to leave with his wife. Again this is not consistent with the explanation in the PIF that they had already applied for their passports prior to the XXXX 2012 detention. On this point the claimant said he knew it would be difficult to get the passports because they were BDP delegates. Again the panel does not accept this explanation as reasonable given that it is\ndifferent from the explanation in the PIF. Further there is no indication in the documentary evidence that BDP members were restricted from travel or restricted in getting passports in 2012. As such the panel is drawing a negative inference regarding the claimant's credibility.\n[30] The female claimant said that she was also politically active but only for a very short time, two months. However this is inconsistent with her PIF17 which states that she joined the party sometime after XXXX XXXX when her husband returned from sea and she was detained XXXX XXXX. The female claimant confirmed she was not politically active after this detention. Therefore her political activities lasted about 6 days. However the female claimant also said that she was politically active up until she left Turkey in XXXX 2012. In response to these inconsistencies the female claimant said she belonged to the party until she came to Canada, but that she was not active. The panel does not accept this explanation as reasonable. In the panel's view if the claimant was politically active in Turkey it is reasonable to expect that she would be able to recall with consistency how long she was active for. The female claimant was not asked how long she was a member of the BDP, she was asked how long she was politically active. The panel has also considered the claimant's psychological report which notes that she has PTSD. However, on this point the claimant did not say that she could not remember, she provided inconsistent answers. As such the panel is drawing a negative inference regarding the claimant's credibility.\n[31] The female claimant states that they got their passports because they knew that police prevented BDP members from getting passports, however this is not consistent with the documentary evidence. The documentary evidence does not indicate that BDP members were restricted in travel or that they had problems getting passports. In response the female claimant said she was actually afraid that if she got detained then she would not be able to get a passport. In the panel's view this is not reasonable and is not consistent with the claimant's first explanation that she knew police prevented BDP members from getting passports. As such the panel is drawing a negative inference regarding the claimants' credibility.\n[32] Given the serious credibility concerns, the panel finds the claimants are not political activists and were not targeted by Turkish authorities. The panel further finds that the claimants have not established that they would be targeted by Turkish authorities if they return to Turkey.\n[33] The claimant provided a letter from his uncle in Canada in support of his political profile.18 However given serious credibility concerns and the fact that the uncle was not available for cross-examination, the panel is giving little weight to this document in regards to the claimant's political profile.\n[34] XXXX and XXXX both provided BDP delegate cards19 and copies of BDP application forms.20 However, given the serious credibility concerns, the panel gives little weight to these documents. The panel further notes that these cards and applications have hand written elements and could be easily manufactured.\n[35] The male claimant provided a PayPal receipt from XXXX 2015 and a copy of his Facebook page showing the HDP logo.21 However, given credibility concerns the panel gives these documents little weight in establishing the claimants activities in 2012 and earlier in Turkey. As well there is nothing before the panel to indicate that authorities in Turkey are aware or offended by the claimant's donation or his interest in the HDP from Canada.\n[36] In assessing the claimants' credibility, the panel was cognizant of the claimants' psychological report.22 The psychologist notes that just prior to the hearing the claimants had a joint three hour session with a psychologist. Just prior to their hearing, they attended walk in clinics and got some medication for anxiety and stress. The doctor reports that the claimants suffer from XXXX. The panel accepts that XXXX may involve memory problems. The panel accepts the doctor's professional opinion based on the claimant's self-reported symptoms. However, given the credibility concerns the panel gives little weight to the events reported by the doctor as causing the claimants' psychological conditions. These events were self-reported to the doctor and were found not to be credible.\n[37] The panel notes the case of Czesak v. Canada where Justice Annis discusses the utility of expert evidence obtained for the purpose of litigation and particularly, that obtained for use in proceedings before administrative tribunals. The court said the following:\n\"This is not to say that every expert report prepared for litigation should be dismissed as having no, or little, weight. But what the court's experience with forensic experts does suggest in relation to these reports being proffered before administrative tribunals where there exists no defined procedure to allow for their validation, is that caution should be exercised in accepting them at face value, particularly when they propose to settle important issues to be decided by the tribunal. In my view therefore, unless there is some means to corroborate either the neutrality or lack of self-interest of the expert in relation to the litigation process, they generally should be accorded little weight.\"23\n[38] Further, as stated in Danailov, 24 with respect to the assessment of a physician's evidence and the question of the assessment of credibility, \"that opinion evidence is only as valid as the truth of the facts on which they are based.\"\n[39] In regards to military service the male claimant said that it was his intention to pay to avoid his military service and this is not a reason for his refugee claim. As such the panel accepts that the claimant is not at risk in Turkey due to his not having completed his military service.\nXXXX XXXX\n[40] In assessing the claimant's credibility the panel is aware that the claimant is very young at 17 years old and that she was emotional trying to give her evidence. The panel is also aware that the claimant did visit with a clinical psychologist one time for an hour and a half and during this session the claimant was emotional and admitted to the doctor that she missed her parents terribly and was having trouble adjusting to living in Canada. As a result of this session the doctor believes the claimant to be suffering from some XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as well as being very sad.25 The panel also notes that the doctor does not state that the claimant has any problems with her memory other than the claimant's own attestation that she does not like to remember. The panel accepts, based on experience from hearing many other claimants with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that memory problems can be part of XXXX. In this case the claimant has not presented any medical evidence to suggest that she has XXXX or that she has memory problems.\n[41] As the claimant is 17 she under the legal age for marriage in Turkey.26 When asked why the police would not help her with a man that wanted to kidnap and force her to marry before she was legal to marry, the claimant said it was because she was Arab Alevi. However this is not consistent with the documentary evidence. The documentary evidence does not indicate that police refuse to respond to Arab Alevis in Turkey. The documentary evidence notes that child marriages are a problem in Turkey but not that police refuse to respond when a child marriage is against the will of the child and her guardians. In the panel's view if Turkish authorities were known to refuse service to Arab Alevis, and if Turkish authorities refused to respond to a guardian's complaint that their child was being sought for an illegal marriage, it is reasonable to expect that this would be recorded in the documentary evidence. As such, the panel is drawing a negative inference regarding the claimant's credibility.\n[42] In response to this concern the claimant added that the police did not help her because Mr. XXXX has connections with police. However, as noted below, the panel finds that the claimant is not credible in regards to her experiences with Mr. XXXX.\n[43] The claimant said that she went to the police in XXXX 2015 because Mr. XXXX tried to kidnap her. Mr. XXXX wanted to force her to marry him. However the claimant and\/or her parents did not contact the police until one week after Mr. XXXX tried to kidnap the claimant. The claimant states in her PIF that Mr. XXXX came with friends in order to ensure the kidnapping and that Mr. XXXX was only deterred when a security guard threatened him with his gun. In the panel's view this is a serious situation and it is reasonable to expect, if not the child\/claimant, then her parents would report this incident immediately to police given the claimant was almost kidnapped. In response to this concern the claimant said she was afraid Mr. XXXX would kidnap her again. The panel does not accept this explanation as reasonable. If the\nclaimant was in imminent danger and she knew her attacker, it is reasonable to expect that her parents would seek protection with police. There is no reasonable explanation for the claimant and\/or her parents to have waited one week to contact authorities. At this time there was no indication that Mr. XXXX was connected to police, the claimant and her father did not find this out until later. If they went to police a week later, why not go to police immediately? In the panel's view this is not plausible. As such the panel is drawing a negative inference regarding the claimant's credibility.\n[44] The claimant said she was afraid to leave her house since the attempted kidnapping in XXXX 2015. The claimant states in her PIF that her father barred her from going out due to the threat. Although the claimant states that she did miss some school due to the threat, she continued going to school and finished her school year in XXXX 2015. When asked why she would risk going out given the threat to her life the claimant said it was the last months of school and that was her education. The panel does not accept this explanation as reasonable. If there was a threat to her life and a man wanted to kidnap her and she was not safe, it is reasonable to expect that the claimant would forego school in order to save her life. As such the panel is drawing a negative inference regarding the claimant's credibility.\n[45] The claimant was asked how many times she went to the police to seek help in Turkey. The claimant said the police were contacted once in XXXX 2015 and then the claimant went to the public prosecutor in XXXX 2015. However, this is inconsistent with the information the claimant provided in her PIF. In her PIF the claimant notes that her father contacted police on her behalf a second time after XXXX and told police Mr. XXXX was back. When asked why she noted in her PIF that her dad had contacted police a second time, the claimant said she could not remember that her father had called the police. The claimant said that maybe her father called the police when the claimant was not around. In the panel's view if the claimant was seeking help from police because of a threat it is reasonable to expect that she would be able to recall the number of times police were contacted. Further if the claimant was able to remember this detail for her PIF it is not reasonable that she did not know of this call because maybe she was not around when the call was made. As such the panel is drawing a negative inference regarding the claimant's credibility. Further, the claimant did not say that she could not remember how many times the police were contacted. She said once, and it was not until the inconsistency was put to her did she state that she could not remember. In the panel's view even if the claimant has PTSD, which the claimant does not, a medical problem affecting her memory cannot explain this inconsistency.\n[46] The claimant also states in her PIF that she went to police again after her father called the police. This time with several of her relatives. When asked why she said she contacted police once, the claimant said she could not remember mentioning in her PIF that she went to police again. In the panel's view if the claimant went to police a second time with relatives it is reasonable to expect that she would be able to recall this with consistency. Again, the claimant did not say that she could not remember how often she contacted police, she said she contacted police once. As such, the panel is drawing a negative inference regarding the claimants credibility.\n[47] The claimant said that the prosecutor's office gave no reason for their refusal to file a complaint against Mr. XXXX. However in her PIF the claimant states that prosecutor said there was no solid evidence against the accused that is why they would not file a complaint. In response the claimant said it was her opinion they did not think it necessary because Mr. XXXX had connections to police. The panel does not accept this explanation as reasonable. In the panel's view, if the claimant went to prosecutor's office and could not file a complaint it is reasonable to expect that she would be able to recall with consistency if any reasons were given for the failure of the prosecutor to accept the complaint. Again, the claimant did not say that she could not remember if a reason was given, she said no reason was given. As such the panel is drawing a negative inference regarding the claimant's credibility.\n[48] The claimant said she used a law student to file a complaint with the Ministry of Justice in Turkey. However the claimant has not provided any documentation in support of this complaint\nand\/or the use of the law student. Rule 11 of the RPD Rules27 requires supporting documentation in support of a claim. In response the claimant said that she did not think of that. The panel does not accept this explanation as reasonable. The claimants in this case have provided corroborating documentation. The claimant's brother brought a medical report and provided it at the POE in 2012 to support his claim. Therefore it is clear that the claimants have understood the importance of supporting documentation for the claim. As well the claimants are represented by counsel for this proceeding. As such the panel is drawing a negative inference regarding the claimant's credibility.\n[49] Given serious credibility concerns, the panel finds the claimant is not sought for kidnap and forced marriage, that she was not detained by police in Turkey, nor will she be at risk of detention if she were to return to Turkey today.\nArab Alevis\n[50] As the panel accepts the claimants are Arab Alevis the panel has consider the claims on these grounds and finds that what they fear as result of their religious and ethnic identity does not amount to persecution. To be considered persecution, the mistreatment suffered or anticipated must be serious, such as the sustained or systemic violation of basic human rights demonstrative of a failure of state protection. The requirement that the harm be serious has led to a distinction between persecution on the one hand, and discrimination or harassment on the other, with persecution being characterized by the greater seriousness of the mistreatment which it involves. On this point, the panel finds that although Alevis have experienced discrimination, the panel concludes and agrees with the determination made in the United Kingdom's Operational Guidance Note of May 2013 that: \"A claimant of the Alevi faith is unlikely to encounter ill-treatment by the authorities amounting to persecution solely on the grounds of religious belief.\"28\n[51] The documentary evidence notes that as many as 20 million Alevis live in Turkey, about half-million of whom are Arabic-speaking.29\n[52] The minor claimant sates that because she is Alevi and Arab the authorities do not care about any of their problems. However this is not supported in the documentary evidence. In the panel's view, if this were the case in Turkey, it is reasonable to expect that this would be recorded somewhere in the documentary evidence. On this point the panel finds that the minor claimant is attempting to embellish her claim.\n[53] The male claimant states that he is Alevi and that his religion is not recognised as a religion and it does not get state support like Islam. On this point the panel agrees as this is supported in the documentary evidence however, Alevis are not prevented from practicing their religion in Turkey. They worship at privately funded Cem houses.30 In examining the evidence, the panel was not presented with evidence that the claimants, as Alevi, had difficulty practicing their faith or would that they would have difficulty practicing his faith should they be required to return to Turkey today. The US Department of State Report on Religious Freedoms notes discrimination and difficulties faced by Alevis in Turkey in particular with regards to the Alevi efforts to pursue equality in Turkey.31\n[54] The female claimant states that she does not want to go back to Turkey because of the pressure to not speak the mother tongue and that she always has to hide her identity as Arab Alevi. However the document evidence does not support this allegation. Further the panel finds that what the claimants have expressed as their fears related them being Arab Alevi does not amount to persecution.\n[55] In regards to the female claimant's allegation that she cannot speak her mother tongue, the panel notes that \"in addition to Turkish, the High Board of Radio and Television allowed radio and television stations to broadcast in Arabic and that newspapers are allowed to publish in Arabic.32\n[56] The US DOS notes that \"the constitution provides a single nationality designation for all citizens and does not expressly recognize national, racial, or ethnic minorities except for three non-Muslim minorities: Armenian Orthodox Christians, Jews, and Greek Orthodox Christians. Other ethnic or religious minorities--including Alevis, Assyrians, Protestants, Roman Catholics, Caferis, Yezidis, Kurds, Arabs, Roma, Circassians,and Laz--were not permitted to exercise their linguistic, religious, and cultural rights fully.33\n[57] The documentary evidence indicates that Alevis may face discrimination in employment, delivery of public services, and may be victims of harassment by authorities. However the documentary evidence notes that these are informal practices, fragmented partial.34\n[58] After considering the evidence, the panel finds that as Arab Alevis the claimants may face discrimination, but that they have not established that there is a serious possibility of persecution. The panel further finds that the claimants have not established that the discrimination that they have faced cumulatively amounts to persecution.\nCONCLUSION\n[59] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel determines that there is not a serious possibility that the claimant would be persecuted in his country, or that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in his country.\n[60] The panel conclude that the claimants are not Convention refugees, nor are they persons in need of protection. The claims are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"C.Gibbs\"\nC.

He claims refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant alleges in his Basis of Claim (BOC) form2 that he is bi-sexual and that he is being targeted as a result of his sexual orientation. He states that he was in a long-term, romantic same-sex relationship with his childhood friend XXXX. As a result of a public show of affection between the claimant and XXXX in a discotheque on XXXX XXXX, 2015, the relationship came to be known in his village. His father was infuriated for the shame and dishonor it brought to the family. The claimant's uncles and cousins have threatened to kill him.\n[3] The claimant arrived in Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2015, using a fraudulently obtained Italian passport. He made a claim for protection on August 21, 2015.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] The Panel finds that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nANALYSIS\n[5] The determinative issues in this claim is the claimant's credibility, in regard to both the issue of identity and the issue of his sexual orientation. The Panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has not been a credible witness in this regard. The reasons for these findings are set out below.\nCredibility\n[6] In assessing credibility, the Panel was mindful of the claimant's education and the fact that he claims not to have travelled outside of Albania. In addition, the Panel is cognizant of the many difficulties faced by a claimant in establishing a claim, including nervousness, cultural factors, the milieu of the hearing room and the stress inherent in responding to oral questions through an interpreter. The Panel has also considered these factors in arriving at negative credibility findings.\n[7] The claimant omitted from his BOC narrative that he also had sexual relationships with women. He states \" I am attracted to both men and women..\"3, yet, aside from this statement, the claimant did not include any other reference to these relationships in the BOC narrative. He was asked the reason he did not and replied that they were not important and he thought that by stating he was bi-sexual it was implied that he also had relationships with women. He stated that he did not provide any details in his BOC narrative because these were not important relationships, they were just irrelevant details and he had no important details to tell.\n[8] The Panel does not find this to be a reasonable explanation. The very basis of the claim is that the claimant is bi-sexual. It would therefore be reasonable to expect the claimant to also provide some details of his relationships with women. Furthermore, the BOC instructions, under the heading of \"Why you are claiming refugee protection\" at p. 2 specifically direct \" ...explain everything in order, starting with the oldest information and ending with the newest. Include everything that is important for your claim. Include dates, names and places wherever possible.\" The claimant referred only to the one incident with XXXX and makes no reference to any other same sex relationships in the BOC narrative, nor does the claimant make any reference to sexual relationships with women. The Panel notes that the claimant had the benefit of Counsel and an interpreter. The Panel draws a negative inference from this lack any of details in regard to his relationship with women in his narrative, as his bisexuality is the very basis of his claim.\n[9] There was an inconsistency as to how many serious, intimate same sex relationships the claimant had in Albania. The claimant was asked three times how many serious, same sex partners he had in Albania. The first reply to this question was that he felt closest to XXXX. The question was again put to the claimant with the Panel reminding the claimant that this was not the question asked. He responded with a question: \" you mean how many?\". The Panel asked the question the third time. The claimant stated that he had not had that many in Albania; that he was afraid and introverted. The Panel notes that the claimant did not provide a response to the actual question asked. Further on in the questioning by the Panel he was directly asked whether XXXX was his only same sex partner. The question was asked twice for clarification purposes. Each time the claimant confirmed that XXXX was his only same sex partner in Albania.\n[10] The Panel draws a negative inference from the manner in which the claimant responded to this question, the lack of information provided and the apparent inconsistency in the claimant's own oral response. The Panel notes that this is a simple, direct question which answer is within the claimant's personal knowledge. This is also a central element of the claim as it goes to the claimant's sexual orientation. The Panel also considered that the claimant only provided a specific response to this question when it was directly put to him and also notes that the specific response seems to be internally contradictory. The Panel is cognizant that not having many same sex partners could be interpreted the same as having only one same sex partner, but the Panel notes that claimant was asked the specific number and did not respond with a number. The claimant's response was \" not many\". The Panel finds that this undermines his general credibility and specifically undermines his sexual orientation and the incidents that occurred to him as a result of his sexual orientation.\n[11] There is an inconsistency in regard to whether the claimant ever obtained an Albanian passport. According to the referral document4, he never had an Albanian passport. According to the claimant's oral evidence he obtained an Albanian passport, which expired in about 2012. The claimant explained that he did have an Albanian passport at some point and he told the Immigration Officer at the Port of Entry (POE) that he did not have an Albanian passport with him. The claimant stated that maybe this is what is meant in the referral document and that the Immigration Officer at one point asked if he had an Albanian passport with him along with the Italian passport. The claimant states he told the Immigration Officer he did not have an Albanian passport with him.\n[12] The Panel does not find this to be a reasonable explanation. The Panel notes that the wording in the handwritten response to question 5 of Schedule 12 : \"Client came using a fraudulent Italian passport, name in the passport something like XXXX XXXX?, date of birth unknown, client's photo in the passport. The agent took the passport. Client never had an Albanian passport.\" The Panel notes that there is no doubt as to the meaning of the word \" never\", as opposed to not having the passport with him. The Panel further notes that the claimant had the benefit of an interpreter at the time he made the claim for protection and he signed the document attesting that it was true, complete and accurate5. He furthermore had the benefit of Counsel and an interpreter at the time he filled out his BOC and in preparation for this hearing. 6 The Panel notes that identity is a central issue of this claim, as the claimant has not submitted any identity documents containing a photograph supporting his personal identity and his Albanian nationality. Furthermore, the claimant states he entered Canada with a fraudulent identity and fraudulent nationality. He also states he never obtained an Albanian Identity Card, which would contain his photographs and nationality. The Panel notes that he destroyed or lost documents which would substantiate his identity and nationality. He states he destroyed the allegedly fraudulent Italian passport, thereby not allowing the RPD the opportunity to verify the authenticity of this passport. He states he lost his expired Albanian passport. He also states he lost his military booklet. Therefore, the issue of whether the claimant ever had an Albanian passport is a central issue. The Panel finds that this inconsistency undermines the claimant's general credibility, undermines his personal identity and undermines his nationality as an Albanian citizen.\n[13] The claimant has provided scant details of his relationship with XXXX in the BOC narrative and no information on other aspects of being bi-sexual. The Panel takes note that while he gives some information on the incident that lead to his departure from Albania, he does not provide details of when he realized he was bi-sexual, does not detail how he and XXXX became sexual partners, makes no reference to whether he and XXXX encountered any difficulties as same sex-partners in Albania, makes no reference to whether XXXX encountered difficulties in Albanian due to his sexual orientation, the claimant does not state whether he had any other same sex relationships, does not provide information regarding relationships with women, nor does he provide detail of his life as a bi-sexual in Albania. The claimant also provides only two dates in the BOC narrative: the date of the kiss in the discotheque and the date he left Albania. The claimant was asked the reason he did not include details of his relationship with XXXX. He stated that he did not think to write it down.\n[14] The Panel does not find this to be a reasonable explanation. This is information is in the direct knowledge of the claimant. The BOC instructions specifically direct at p. 2 \" ...explain everything in order, starting with the oldest information and ending with the newest. Include everything that is important for your claim. Include dates, names and places wherever possible.\" The claimant also had the benefit of Counsel and an interpreter. Furthermore, this is the very basis of his claim. It would therefore be reasonable to expect a more fulsome account. The Panel also takes into account that the claimant is a 29 year old male who was continuously self-employed from 20057 and therefore appears to have had the acumen to find employment and, according to his own oral testimony, the acumen to ask around and find Canada as the ideal destination and also the acumen to find a way out of Albania. The Panel finds that the lack of detail in regard to central elements of his claim undermines the claimant's general credibility and specifically undermines his sexual orientation, his relationship with XXXX and whether the incident set out in the BOC narrative occurred as alleged.\n[15] There was an inconsistency as to who made the arrangements for the claimant to leave Albania. His BOC narrative8 states \"While in hiding at my aunt's house, my brother's made arrangements for me to flee from the country\". The claimant was asked in the hearing who was responsible for making all the arrangements for leaving. He stated that the smuggler took care of it. He stated that he gave the smuggler the money and they gave him the passport, the ticket and all he needed. The claimant was asked whether he was responsible for contacting the smuggler. He replied that other people helped him contact the smuggler. He was asked who helped him and he responded that he did not know these people, that he asked around by word of mouth. His BOC narrative9 states \"While in hiding at my aunt's house, my brother's made arrangements for me to flee from the country\". This inconsistency was put to the claimant. He replied that his brothers also helped him find these people, that his brothers were with him the entire time and helped him make these arrangements.\n[16] The Panel does not find this to be a reasonable explanation. The Panel notes that the claimant had a number of opportunities to respond to this question and only made reference to his brothers being involved when the inconsistency was directly put to him. This was a simple, straightforward question within the direct knowledge of the claimant. Furthermore his response still remains inconsistent with the information contained in the BOC narrative, which states he was in hiding. This is inconsistent with the claimant obtaining information regarding a smuggler by \"asking around\" and by \"word of mouth\". In addition, the BOC narrative does not state that the claimant himself was involved in making arrangements to leave Albania. The Panel finds that theses inconsistencies undermine the general credibility of the claimant and specifically undermine whether the claimant was in fact in hiding and whether arrangements were made for a fraudulent passport.\n[17] The claimant did not think of obtaining and Albanian passport through regular channels and leaving for a country in Europe. He states he did not do so because he had heard by word of mouth that Canada was very accepting of persons of his sexual orientation. It was put to the claimant that Germany, France, the UK are all countries very accepting of his sexual orientation. He was asked why he would pay 10,000 USA dollars to a smuggler if he could simply obtain an Albanian passport and travel to European Union countries. He replied that at that time he did not think of it. His life was in danger and he thought the further he moved away the better.\n[18] The Panel does not find this to be a reasonable explanation. The claimant was in hiding waiting for a fraudulent passport with no reference to a time-line as to when such a passport would be provided. During this time he was searched for by his cousins who were threating to kill him. This is a dire situation. It does not seem reasonable that one would face such grave danger of death, the uncertainty of the time-line in obtaining a passport and the high cost of 10,000 USA dollars, if the option were to obtain an Albanian passport through regular channels, pay a fee of approximately 64 Canadian dollars10, obtain the passport in fifteen days 11and leave for a country in Europe. The Panel notes that the claimant stated that he had obtained an Albanian passport previously which expired in approximately 2012. He would therefore have been aware of the basic procedure to follow. The documents indicate \"non-biometric passports were removed from circulation in Albanian as of 1 March 2012\"12, which year accords with the loss of the claimant's Albanian passport. At page 2 of the same document it states that '..the implementation of biometric passports in Albania was 'one of the principal conditions for the EU to include Albania in its list of countries whose citizens can travel without a visa to the Schengen bloc of states\". Furthermore, the pick-up of the passport can be completed locally by a third party with authorization13, which method the claimant has used to obtain other documents such as his Birth Certificate and Military Card. The Panel draws a negative inference from this course of action in such a dire circumstance. The Panel finds that this undermines his general credibility and specifically undermines his subjective fear, undermines the threats of death, undermines the reason for the death threats as a result of his sexual orientation, undermines whether the Italian passport was in fact a fraudulent passport and the reason for coming to Canada.\n[19] The claimant did not make a claim for protection in his transit through Rome, Italy. The claimant explained that his plan was to come to Canada and he did not think of making a claim for protection in Rome. The Panel does not find this explanation to be reasonable. The one specific, long-term relationship that the claimant refers to in his BOC narrative is with his same sex partner XXXX, who lives in Italy. At the time that the claimant left for Canada, he continued to be in this relationship. The Panel takes into account the claimant's clarification that he knew it was difficult for him to move to Italy, it was difficult to obtain citizenship in Italy as XXXX had been living in Italy for a long time. But the Panel also considers that Italy is a democratic country that is tolerant of the claimant's sexual orientation and most importantly, that the claimant would have had the opportunity to be with his long-term partner. Yet the claimant did not do so. The claimant stated in his oral evidence that XXXX lived in Italy and therefore they had no plans for the future. He was asked whether XXXX wanted him to come to Italy. The claimant replied that it was not that XXXX never asked him to come to Italy, XXXX just wanted the claimant to be safe. The Panel finds that the failure to make a claim for protection in the very country that his only and long-time same sex partner lives in and which is a democratic and safe country undermines his general credibility and specifically undermines his sexual orientation, his subjective fear, whether he fled due to threats of death and his reason for coming to Canada.\n[20] The claimant delayed in making a claim for protection on entry to Canada. He did not make a claim for protection at the Port of Entry. He was asked whether he told the officer at the Port of Entry that he had problems in Albania because of his sexual orientation. He replied that he did not because he did not have problems at the Port of Entry. The Panel put to the claimant that this question was being asked because the purpose of obtaining the fraudulent passport was to make his way to his chosen destination of Canada. He replied that he was accompanied by a smuggler who directed him and also that he was afraid as this was his first time travelling. The claimant also waited approximately three weeks before making a claim for protection on entry to Canada. He states that he did not know how things worked.\n[21] The Panel does not find these explanations to be reasonable. The very purpose in obtaining the fraudulent passport was to be able to travel specifically to Canada because, as the claimant stated, he had heard that Canada was very accepting of persons of his sexual orientation. The Panel is cognisant that waiting to make a claim for protection for approximately three weeks is not a very long period of time, but notes that the very purpose in the claimant coming to Canada was to make a claim for protection. The Panel draws a negative inference from the delay in making a claim for protection. The Panel finds that this undermines his general credibility, undermines his subjective fear and undermines his sexual orientation as this is the reason he states he came specifically to Canada.\n[22] The claimant submitted the following documents in support of his identity and his claim: 1. Copy of a copy of a Personal Certificate14, copy of a copy of a Military Booklet15, a statement from XXXX16, a photograph17, a Birth Certificate18, a Family Certificate19, an Education Certificate20 and two statements verifying the claimant's residency in Albania21\n[23] The claimant did not obtain an Albanian Identity Card. He was asked the reason he did not do so. He stated that he did not have reason to obtain an Identity Card as he did not travel, had no plans to travel and so did not need it. He stated that he only had an older version of the Albanian passport and now in order to obtain a new passport or the Identity Card you must be there in person. That is why he does not have an Albanian Identity Card. He states that when he was in Albania the passport was the only identity document he obtained, but now they have other documents, such as the Identity Card. He also stated that once his passport expired he used his Birth Certificate as his identity document.\n[24] The Panel does not find this to be a reasonable explanation. Identity is a central element of this claim as the claimant entered Canada on an allegedly fraudulent identity and passport and has not provided any identity documents containing his photograph and which set out his citizenship. He has also not provided the fraudulent passport on which he travelled to Canada in order for the RPD to be able to verify that it is fraudulent. The Panel notes that the Identity Card has been in circulation since January 200922, during which time the claimant was still in Albania. This document is one of the very documents that would establish the claimant's personal identity and nationality, the other such document being a passport. The Panel also notes that \"Albanian state authorities indicate that all Albanian citizens 16 years of age and over are required to have a biometric identity card.\" 23 The Panel also notes that the document which sets out information on this requirement is dated XXXX XXXX 2011, at which time the claimant's Albanian passport was still valid and he was still in possession of same. The requirements for the issuance of an Identity Card is \"....a valid identity document containing a photographs, such as a passport....\"24 The Panel draws a negative inference from the lack of the very document that could have been easily obtained by the claimant and could have established his personal identity and citizenship. The Panel finds that this undermines his general credibility and undermines his personal identity and his Albanian citizenship.\n[25] The claimant states that his Albanian passport expired in about 2012 and he thereafter used his Birth Certificate as an identity document. According to the documents, \"....there are two standard formats that are used for Albanian Birth Certificates, which are also referred to as 'Personal Certificates'. One of the formats is in Albanian while the other is multi-lingual. The Albanian language format is entitled 'Certificakete Personale' and the multi-lingual version is entitled 'Certificakete Lindje'. 25\n[26] The Panel notes that the Birth Certificate (Certifikate Lindje) submitted by the claimant is issued on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX2015 (XXXX XXXX, 2015) and officially stamped on XXXX XXXX XXXX\/2015 (XXXX XXXX, 2015)26. The Panel also notes that a 'Certifikate Personale' was submitted at the time of the claim for protection. This document is dated XXXX XXXX XXXX.2015 ( XXXX XXXX, 2015) and officially stamped on the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX2015 (XXXX XXXX, 2015). 27 Therefore neither of these documents is the Birth Certificate used by the claimant in Albania as his only form of identification. This document is not before this Board.\n[27] The Panel further takes note that both Birth Certificates submitted by the claimant were issued only a short time prior to the incident of XXXX XXXX, 2015 which made the claimant depart for Canada. According to the claimant's testimony, they were obtained by the claimant's brother after the claimant arrived in Canada. The date of issuance of both Birth Certificates is inconsistent with the Birth Certificate having been obtained after the claimant arrived in Canada. The Panel also notes that the claimant would have had access to these document prior to his departure to Canada and prior to the hearing. The Panel also takes into account that neither of these document contain security features nor do they have a photograph of the claimant and the documents was obtained by a third party. No specific authorization or documents were required to obtain either of these documents according to the claimant's own testimony. The claimant stated that the Personal Certificate was obtained by a family member, his brother, who goes to the Municipality, tells them the first and last name of the family and the Municipality issues the Certificate. Therefore, the Panel places no weight on these two documents.\n[28] The claimant provided an original military booklet at the hearing. The Panel notes the inconsistent oral testimony in regard to how the military booklet was obtained. The claimant stated that his brother went to the local Military administration and obtained the military booklet for him. He states he did not travel to Canada with the Booklet, but he has it with him now. He explained that this is the card that was given to him at the time he served his military service. He had left it at home when he came to Canada. He was asked why his brother could not simply find the Booklet at home where the claimant had left it instead of going to the Military for it. He replied that he could not remember if he left it at home or if his brother would have to go to the military to obtain it. They looked around the house and found it. It was put to the claimant that he had just stated that his brother had gone to the Military to obtain the booklet. He explained that he was trying to say that at the time he spoke with his brother he could not remember if the military booklet was a the house or if he needed to go to the Military branch , which is also very close to the house and so he could have just gone by if he needed to.\n[29] The Panel does not find this explanation to be reasonable. The explanation does not explain the inconsistency. The Panel also takes into consideration that this document contains no security features nor does it have a photograph of the claimant and in one explanation the document was obtained by a third party. Therefore, the Panel places no weight on this document.\n[30] The Panel has also considered the Education Certificate.28 The Panel notes that this document has no security features and does not contain a photograph of the claimant. The Panel notes that the Education Certificate was issued XXXX XXXX, 2015, after the claimant left Albania. The Panel takes into account that this document was only obtained after the hearing and only after the Panel raised identity as an issue, although identity is a self-evident issue in light of the manner of entry to Canada and lack of identity documents with photograph indicating citizenship. Furthermore, no specific authorization or documents were required to obtain this document and this document was obtained by a third party, the claimant's brother. The Panel therefore places no weight on this document.\n[31] The Panel has also considered the two Verifications of Residency in the village of XXXX 29 submitted by the claimant. The Panel places no weight on these documents as they were provided after the hearing, no specific dates or a time-frame for the claimant residing in that town are provided and . In fact, the Verification from the Head Elders30 refers to the claimant as still being a resident in the village on XXXX XXXX, 2015, when it was issued. The verification reads \" \"we verify that Mr. XXXX XXXX XXXX is a resident in the villageXXXX XXXX....\". Yet, the claimant states he left the village approximately XXXX XXXX, 2015, went to hide in XXXX and then left Albania on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015, never having returned to the village.\n[32] The claimant provided a letter from his same sex partner XXXX31, as well as a photograph of him with XXXX32. The letter has no attached identity documents from XXXX, nor does it set out any additional details as to their relationship. It does not even provide the date and details of the one incident that caused the claimant to flee, an incident that XXXX was party to and would therefore reasonably be expected to be referred to. The photograph has no attached identity document which could identify the other person in the photo as XXXX and has no date stamp. The photograph shows the claimant standing beside another man. The Panel asked the claimant if he had other photos. He stated that he broke his cell phone and lost all his photos. The Panel draws a negative inference from the lack of the very documents that could establish the claimant's sexual orientation, the central element of the claim. The Panel has also taken into account the credibility concerns already set out in these reasons in giving no weight to the letter and the photograph.\nCredibility Conclusion\n[33] On the basis of the above-noted credibility findings, negative inferences and omissions, the Panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant is not a credible and trustworthy witness, and that he has not established central elements of his claim, namely his identity and his sexual orientation.\n[34] The Panel finds that the claimant is not bisexual, that he is not being sought by his family members in order to kill him as a result of his sexual orientation and that he did not leave his country of nationality and come to Canada for that reason. The Panel does not believe the events occurred as alleged. The Panel finds that the claimant fabricated these events in order to bolster his claim for refugee protection.\n[35] Furthermore, the Panel finds that this general lack of credibility extends to all relevant evidence emanating from his testimony33. Whether this claim then was based on Section 96 or 97 it would fail owing to this lack of credibility.\nIdentity Conclusion\n[36] Section 106 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act34 requires, with respect to the credibility of the claimant, that the Board take into account whether the claimant has acceptable documentation establishing identity, and if not, whether a reasonable explanation has been provided or whether reasonable steps to obtain the documentation have been taken. Rule 11 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules 35 re-iterates this requirement.\n[37] A claim for refugee protection must be rejected as soon as the Board determines that the claimant's identity has not been established.36 Based on the review of the identity documents presented by the claimant and the claimant's testimony, the Panel finds that the claimant has failed to provide sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to establish his identity. The Panel does not know who this claimant is.\n[38] The Panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant has failed to produce sufficient credible documents and evidence to establish his personal identity as required by section 106 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and Rule 7 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules. Where on the totality of the evidence, the claimant's identity has not been established, the Panel need not go on to analyze the merits of the claim.37\n[39] Based on the above-noted analysis, the Panel rejects this claim.\nNo credible basis\n[40] Furthermore, in accordance with Section 107(2) of the IRPA, the Panel concludes that there was no credible or trustworthy evidence upon which the Board could have determined that the claimant is a Convention refugee or person in need of protection, and therefore there is no credible basis for the claim.\n\"H.

He is claiming protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The alleged circumstances underlying the claim are contained in the Claimant's Basis of Claim (\"BOC\") form,2 and are supplemented by the Claimant's oral testimony and supporting documents.\n[3] The Claimant alleges that he is a young Tamil male from XXXX, in the north of Sri Lanka. XXXX was previously controlled by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (\"LTTE\"). The Claimant's father was required to be a member of the village's vigilance committee, a committee which was set up by the LTTE to observe and report on the local population. His father was a reluctant member who initially refused to accept his appointment.\n[4] In XXXX 2009, the family surrendered to the Sri Lankan army. The father was separated and detained for two years as a suspected LTTE supporter. The Claimant and his other family members were held in a detention camp. While there, in XXXX 2009 and XXXX 2009, the Claimant was questioned, including with respect to potential links to the LTTE. He was beaten when he denied involvement. The Claimant and his family, save for his father, were released in XXXX 2010. The father rejoined the family in XXXX 2011. The father was monitored by Sri Lankan authorities after his release.\n[5] In XXXX 2011, the Claimant's uncle travelled from the United Kingdom to visit Sri Lanka. The Claimant served as the uncle's escort during the visit, which included travel to LTTE battle locations.\n[6] In XXXX 2013, the Claimant was arrested by the army while on his way to class. He was questioned about his father's activities and his uncle's visit to Sri Lanka in 2011. The Claimant was then released after six hours. In XXXX 2013, the Claimant was arrested again by the army and taken to a \"CID\" camp. The Panel understands that the CID is a reference to the Criminal Investigation Division, which is part of the Sri Lankan Police Service.3 The Claimant was questioned with respect to the activities of his family and friends, whether they were linked to the LTTE, and whether the Claimant was an LTTE supporter. He was beaten during questioning and then released after a number of hours. Finally, in XXXX 2013, the Claimant was abducted by a number of individuals which he identified as the Karuna Group. He was questioned about his family and potential LTTE links. He was asked to join the Karuna Group. The Claimant was able to secure his release after promising to join the group if he were permitted to complete his General Certificate of Education XXXX XXXX XXXX (\"XXXX XXXX XXXX examination\").\n[7] The Claimant then returned home to XXXX and completed the XXXX XXXX XXXX examination during XXXX 2013 but was unsuccessful. He departed to XXXX in XXXX 2013, where he went into hiding from both the Karuna Group and Sri Lankan authorities. He re-sat the XXXX XXXX XXXX examination in XXXX 2014 and was successful in his results. In XXXX 2014, the Claimant's friend was arrested for leading a student demonstration. The Claimant then travelled to Columbo, where he remained in hiding. The Claimant departed Sri Lanka on XXXX XXXX, 2015 with the assistance of a smuggler. He then travelled through a number of countries before being arrested by immigration authorities in the United States in late XXXX 2015. After his release in XXXX 2015, the Claimant travelled to Canada and made a claim for refugee protection at a port-of-entry in XXXX 2015.\n[8] As the Panel understands the evidence, the Claimant fears arrest and further mistreatment by the authorities if he returns to Sri Lanka.\nDETERMINATION\n[9] For the reasons that follow, the Panel determines that the Claimant is not a Convention refugee, nor a person in need of protection. Therefore, the claim is rejected.\nANALYSIS\n[10] In the context of this claim, it is necessary to consider whether the Claimant has established his identity as a national of Sri Lanka, and whether, as per s. 96 of IRPA, the Claimant has established, through credible and trustworthy evidence, that he is at serious risk of persecution in Sri Lanka. A consideration of the evidence as it relates to ss. 97(1) of IRPA is also necessary, and will be briefly set out below.\n[11] The determinative issue in this case is credibility.\nIdentity\n[12] The Claimant's personal identity and identity as a citizen of Sri Lanka is addressed by his testimony and the documents filed as exhibits, including a copy of the Claimant's temporary identification card.4 The copy of the temporary identification card was certified as a true copy by a Sri Lankan Justice of the Peace.5 There is no aspect on the face of the copy that causes the Panel to doubt its genuine nature. The Panel notes that the original card purportedly remains in Sri Lanka; the Claimant explained that he did not request the original card to be sent to him as his original driver's license was lost when it was sent from Sri Lanka to Canada. On this latter point, the courier envelope that allegedly contained the original driver's license was provided to the Panel. That envelope bore a sticker that indicated it had been opened and inspected while en route to Canada. There was no indication, however, that a document had been removed. Of course, this does not discount the potential loss of a document within the unsealed envelope.\n[13] The Panel also examined a copy of the Claimant's National Identity Card (\"NIC\"), a copy of which was tendered as an exhibit.6 Its format and appearance is consistent with the examples contained in the objective country conditions package.7 Again, the original card was not before the Panel; it had purportedly been seized by United States immigration officials when the Claimant was arrested for entry into that country. There is documentation in evidence that indicates that the Claimant was held in United States immigration custody; the Panel notes that United States officials appeared to be satisfied with the Claimant's identity as the documents bear his name and because he was released from custody on bond.8 There is also a letter from a New York-based lawyer, who apparently represented the Claimant in his United States immigration proceedings, confirming that the NIC had been seized by United States officials.9\n[14] Also before the Panel is a copy of the Claimant's birth certificate.10 The Claimant stated that he had been in possession of the original birth certificate and would have turned it over to authorities; however, it is unclear if those authorities were United States officials. Canada Border Services Agency notes indicate that only a copy was provided to Canadian authorities.11\n[15] The Panel did examine original school records in the name of the Claimant as well as a confirmation of residency signed and stamped by a \"grama\" officer, which the Panel understands is a Sri Lankan local official.\n[16] Finally, although it is not determinative, the Panel notes that the Claimant satisfied Canadian authorities at the port-of-entry as to his personal and national identity.12 It appears that a relative of the Claimant also attended at the port-of-entry in support of his identity.13\n[17] Given the limited original records before the Panel and in the custody of Canadian immigration authorities, especially standard identity documents, the Panel has some concerns on the issue of identity. However, after having taken into consideration all of the circumstances, the Panel finds that the Claimant has established his personal identity and identity as a national of Sri Lanka.\nCredibility\n[18] Sworn testimony is presumed to be true, unless there is a valid reason to doubt its veracity. The determination as to whether a claimant's evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities, the burden of which is upon the claimant to satisfy. The Panel also notes that the entirety of a claimant's relevant evidence may be undermined if the claimant is found generally lacking in credibility.14\n[19] In assessing credibility, the Panel has considered the challenges faced by a claimant in a hearing room setting within the context of the age and background of this particular Claimant. The Claimant's evidence indicates that he was born in XXXX 1994 and has completed his XXXX XXXX XXXX education.15 The Claimant has remained unemployed since the end of his studies, which fully concluded in 2014, when he successfully passed his second sitting of the XXXX XXXX XXXX examination.16\n[20] After having heard the testimony of the Claimant and carefully considering the whole of the relevant evidence, as well as his counsel's able submissions, the Panel has the following credibility concerns.\nKaruna Group Incident in XXXX 2013\n[21] The Claimant alleges that he was abducted by members of the Karuna Group in or about XXXX XXXX, 2013 and detained for three days in an old house located in a jungle area. He also alleged at certain points in his testimony that members of the CID, which he referred to as a military intelligence unit of the Sri Lankan army, were amongst these individuals. When asked why he believed that CID officials were involved, he said that the Karuna Group works closely with the CID. However, the individuals who abducted the Claimant were in plainclothes. The Claimant noted that the individuals identified themselves as Karuna Group members. On this evidence, it is somewhat unclear as to the CID's involvement in the XXXX 2013 abduction; the overall thrust of his evidence is that the Karuna Group directly perpetrated the abduction.\n[22] The Karuna Group, also known as the Tamil Makkal Viduthali Pulikal,17 is a paramilitary group tied to serious human rights violations and is known to engage in criminal activities that include extortion, attacks, kidnappings, and collection of ransoms.18 Their motivations appear to be both political and criminal.19 During the civil war, its members apparently assisted Sri Lankan military forces in fighting the LTTE.20 There are reports of continuing close links between the Karuna Group and government security forces.21 However, documentation from 2012 appears to be mixed as to whether the Karuna Group, and paramilitary forces in general, continue to be active in Sri Lanka.22 It appears that many members were integrated into government security forces in the years following the conclusion of the civil war.23 One source from 2012 reports continuing activity at least insofar as the northern and eastern areas of the country.24\n[23] On the day of the abduction, the Claimant's captors arrived at his home in XXXX, blindfolded him, and transported him in a van. The Claimant testified that he feared for his life while in detention; he witnessed two other individuals being beaten. The Claimant was questioned about his activities, as well as those of his uncle and father. It appears his captors were interested in potential LTTE links. He was pressured to join the group; he did not wish to join, but was afraid of the repercussions of refusal. Therefore, he allegedly told his captors that he would join if they released him so that he could complete his XXXX XXXX XXXX examinations, scheduled for XXXX. As the Panel understands the evidence, the captors initially refused his request; after being told that the examination was very important and a dream of his parents, the captors apparently agreed to the Claimant's terms and released him. They demanded that he return once the examination was completed or they would not spare him.\n[24] After his release, the Claimant returned to his home in XXXX and wrote his XXXX XXXX XXXX examination, which apparently extended over multiple dates in XXXX 2013. After the completion of the examination, the Claimant departed for XXXX, a location in northern Sri Lanka.25\n[25] The Claimant was asked why he did not flee from XXXX immediately upon his release. He stated that he was given time to do his examination and so he completed the examination before departing to XXXX. The Claimant was asked whether he was worried that the Karuna Group might decide to take him away before finishing his examination. He stated that, as they had let him go, he had a belief that they would not return. The Claimant was asked whether it was difficult to complete his examination knowing there was the issue with the Karuna Group; he stated there was difficulty and that he failed his XXXX 2013 examination as a result.\n[26] The Panel rejects the Claimant's explanation for not fleeing immediately upon his release by his captors. The Claimant spoke of fearing for his life while in the custody of his captors. He was warned that he would not be spared if he did not return after his examination. The Claimant was detained for three days and witnessed physical assaults against two other people. It appears that the Claimant had every intention of not returning to the Karuna Group. Despite all of this, the Claimant returned to the home from which he was abducted and remained for more than a month while he completed his school examination, apparently secure in the belief that the Karuna Group would not return for him against their word. The Claimant's conduct is inconsistent with an individual who allegedly feared for his life. Indeed, in the Panel's view, this is a striking incongruity. It was open for him to flee from the danger posed to his life by the Karuna Group; instead, his studies were allegedly the priority.\n[27] The Panel further rejects the Claimant's explanation as to how he secured his release from his captors. The Karuna Group, on the Claimant's evidence and the objective country documentation, is an organization engaged in kidnappings, ransoming victims, attacks, and other serious human rights violations. On the Claimant's evidence, they initially refused his offer to join after completing his examination. However, despite being held captive and without any apparent bargaining power over his captors, he was able to simply impress upon them that the completion of his examination was of central importance to himself and to his parents, thereby triggering his release. This lacks an air of reality and is inconsistent with both the objective country documentation and the Claimant's own evidence of what is essentially a criminal organization. Although the Panel must avoid speculating as to the mindsets of others, it also notes the following statement from the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Faryna v. Chorny, which is apposite to the case at bar:\nIn short, the real test of the truth of the story of a witness in such a case must be its harmony with the preponderance of the probabilities which a practical and informed person would readily recognize as reasonable in that place and in those conditions.26\n[28] In all of the circumstances, the Panel draws a negative inference with respect to the Claimant's evidence of abduction and detention by the Karuna Group or individuals professing to be members of such a group.\nConduct while in Hiding\n[29] The Claimant testified that he first wanted to leave Sri Lanka in July 2013 as a result of the Karuna Group abduction. After completing his XXXX XXXX XXXX examination, the Claimant left XXXX, located in the Northern province, in XXXX 2013 and travelled to XXXX, also located in the Northern province, where he went into hiding at the home of a friend.27 He remained in XXXX until XXXX 2014 before moving onto Colombo, Sri Lanka.28 The Claimant stated that he did not have the resources available to flee Sri Lanka during this period.\n[30] Soon after the Claimant went into hiding in XXXX, in XXXX 2013, members of the Karuna Group went to his home in XXXX where they spoke to his father. They asked for the Claimant's whereabouts and then threatened the Claimant's father. His father paid them 50,000 Rupees. However, the Karuna Group members stated that they had been cheated and would not spare the Claimant. Subsequently, in XXXX 2014, they again visited the home in XXXX and asked for the Claimant's whereabouts. Further threats were made at this visit.\n[31] In XXXX, the Claimant attended private tutoring classes. He was not registered in a school, as registration would indicate his presence in XXXX and could, therefore, result in him being located. The Claimant only attended classes, although he would not attend if authorities were actively conducting checks. He did not leave his residence for any other activities, as he was afraid that he could be stopped and questioned by the military or the police. He stated that if the authorities learned of his presence in XXXX, then his information could be passed to the Karuna Group.\n[32] A school record before the Panel indicated that the Claimant re-sat the XXXX XXXX XXXX examination again in XXXX 2014;29 he testified that he wrote this examination in XXXX. The Claimant was successful in his results.\n[33] The Claimant applied for his Sri Lankan passport while in hiding in XXXX; when asked the purpose of the passport, he stated that he wished to flee the country. The Claimant stated that he did not need to attend at a government office to obtain the passport, as he could mail in the necessary documentation and the passport would be mailed to him. The Claimant testified that he had the passport mailed to the location where he was in hiding which, as noted, was the home of his friend.\n[34] The Claimant was asked whether providing his address to the passport office would give away his hiding location to government officials. He stated, essentially, that it was a possibility, but he was not certain if the Karuna Group would check with the passport office, apparently located in Columbo. The Claimant was then asked whether he had considered that providing his address to the passport office would permit the government, and therefore the Karuna Group, to learn of his whereabouts. He stated that the passport officer would only provide information to the Karuna Group if he were aware of the Claimant's circumstances. He then noted that he had been arrested and detained by the Karuna Group, but not by anyone in government. At this point, the Claimant was asked why he would state that he had not been arrested by the government when his BOC narrative indicated that he had been arrested by government authorities in XXXX and XXXX 2013.30 He stated, as the Panel understands his evidence, that the passport office is separate from the security services, that he had not been bothered by the military after XXXX 2013 in any event, that his problems were with the Karuna Group, and that he did not believe that his hiding location would be compromised by having his passport mailed to XXXX.\n[35] The Claimant was also asked why he would re-sit his XXXX XXXX XXXX examination in XXXX 2014 if he was in hiding at that time. He stated that he was hopeful that he would pass his examination and be able to enter university, where he would find safety on campus from the Karuna Group and other paramilitary organizations. This intention does not appear to be consistent with his initial intent of leaving Sri Lanka. In any event, the Claimant was asked why university study would change his circumstances. He stated that he would be able to obtain university identification, which he could present if he was stopped by authorities. He also stated that armed groups were not permitted to enter university grounds. It was noted to the Claimant that the Karuna Group blindfolded and kidnapped him; he was asked why he believed that they would be stopped because of his university involvement. He stated that the Karuna Group does not obey rules, but if he was arrested and taken away, there would be an appeal to higher authorities within the government, such as at the Ministerial level, which would result in his release. The Claimant was asked whether such remedies would be available to him even without university studies; he stated that he would not have such an option because he would be considered to be a young male from XXXX and so, as the Panel understands the evidence, he would be subject to further mistreatment. The Claimant was asked whether he was concerned that the Karuna Group or authorities would locate him while he sat the XXXX XXXX XXXX examination; he stated that he was concerned, but that no one was aware that he was in XXXX.\n[36] The Claimant's explanations related to his passport application and his re-sitting of the XXXX XXXX XXXX examination are problematic. The Claimant alleged fear of both the Sri Lankan authorities and of the Karuna Group to the extent, save for attending private tutoring, that he remained in his residence at all times. He indicated that detection by the authorities could result in the Karuna Group also learning of his location. While under examination by his counsel, the Claimant expanded on his understanding of the relationship between the authorities and the Karuna Group, indicating that the Karuna Group assists the authorities. On his own testimony, it is evident that he was aware of the relationship at the time he was allegedly in XXXX. Indeed, the Claimant had such an apparent concern with detection that he believed that school registration while in XXXX could identify his location.\n[37] Despite these factors, the Claimant requested that a key travel and identity document, his passport, be mailed by the Sri Lankan government to the location of his hiding. In addressing his reasons for doing so, he was inconsistent in his testimony, indicating that he had not been arrested by the government when indeed he had alleged in his BOC narrative that he had been arrested and detained by government authorities on two occasions in 2013 alone, the latter occasion being only XXXX months prior to the Karuna Group kidnapping. In addressing this inconsistency, he indicated that his problems were with the Karuna Group. This again is inconsistent with his numerous assertions that he feared contact with government authorities. The Panel also notes, as indicated above, that the Claimant indicated a belief elsewhere in his testimony that CID officials had been part of the XXXX 2013 abduction. Further, whether government authorities or the Karuna Group would check with or be informed by the passport office is not a central issue here. The Claimant, on the one hand, believed that such incidental contact as school registration could compromise his hiding in XXXX; on the other hand, he alleges that he did not believe that providing the address of his hiding location to the government's passport office would betray his safety. The Claimant's testimony in this area is beset with numerous internal inconsistencies.\n[38] Additionally, the Claimant alleged that his apparent drive to succeed at his XXXX XXXX XXXX examination was tied to a desire to enter university, where he would find protection from the Karuna Group. As noted, this is inconsistent with his plan to flee the country. The concerns here, however, lie beyond this issue. The Claimant referenced the prohibition of armed groups on university campuses as one of the reasons he believed he would be safe as a student. When it was noted that the Karuna Group has no apparent regard for rules, the Claimant agreed, but then noted that he would be able to rely on higher authorities to secure his eventual release, a remedy only available, according to him, if he were a university student. The Claimant's assertion that he would be able to obtain a remedy through the very government he identifies as one of his oppressors is not consistent with the overall tenor of his evidence.\n[39] For the reasons outlined above, the Panel rejects the Claimant's explanations related to his passport application and his re-sitting of the XXXX XXXX XXXX examination; further, the Panel draws a negative inference upon the Claimant's evidence that he was in hiding from government authorities and the Karuna Group.\nTravel from Sri Lanka to Canada\n[40] The Claimant departed Sri Lanka on XXXX XXXX, 2015. He arrived in Canada some months later, in early XXXX 2015. The Claimant alleges a length and circuitous travel route on his way from Sri Lanka to Canada, passing through the United Arab Emirates, Brazil, Mexico, Guatemala, back into Mexico, and finally into the United States.31 Upon his entry into the United States in XXXX 2015, he was arrested by immigration authorities and detained until XXXX 2015. Upon his release, he travelled northward and claimed for refugee protection at the Fort Erie, Ontario port of entry.32\n[41] The Claimant stated that his passport was stamped by customs officials as he transited through various airports. However, his passport, or a copy thereof, was not before the Panel during the hearing. The Claimant alleged that a smuggler who assisted him asked for his passport, while in Mexico in XXXX 2015, which the Claimant surrendered; the smuggler did not provide reasons for taking the passport. When asked if he was concerned to travel without his passport, the Claimant said that he had to comply with any requests made of him by the smugglers.\n[42] The Claimant took a total of four different flights during his journey from Sri Lanka to the United States while en route to Canada,33 which he confirmed in his oral testimony. The Claimant was asked whether he had any boarding passes from the flights. He stated that he did at the time of travel, but that they were taken away by one of the smugglers in Guatemala. The Claimant was asked whether he had any flight itineraries; he stated that he did not, as he was not permitted to have copies by the smuggler. The Claimant stated that he did not know the reason for this restriction. He was asked whether he had any luggage tags; he indicated that he did not and that he did not check any luggage. The Claimant was asked whether he had any documentation related to his travel or presence in the various countries that he transited up to his arrival in the United States. He stated that he did not have any such documentation. When asked for a reason, he stated that everything had been taken by the smuggler. When asked if he was aware of the reason that the smuggler would want all of his travel documentation, he stated that he did not know.\n[43] In Elazi v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), the court stated as follows:\nI take this opportunity to add that it is entirely reasonable for the Refugee Division to attach great importance to a claimant's passport and his air ticket. In my opinion, these documents are essential to establish the claimant's identity and his journey to come to Canada. Unless it can be assumed that a refugee status claimant is actually a refugee, it seems unreasonable to me to ignore the loss of these documents without a valid explanation. In my view, it is too easy for a claimant to simply state that he has lost these documents or the facilitator has taken them. If the Refugee Division insists on these documents being produced, the facilitators may have to change their methods.\nMinimizing the importance of the passport and air ticket as documents to be produced or ignoring their non-submission for all sorts of reasons in my opinion only serves to encourage all those whose only purpose is to take advantage of a system which is intended solely to enable genuine refugees to come to Canada.34\n[emphasis added]\n[44] The Panel does not accept as reasonable the Claimant's explanation that he possesses absolutely no documentation to evidence his timing and manner of travel from Sri Lanka to the United States. International commercial air travel involves the use of passports, visas, flight itineraries, boarding passes, luggage tags, and other attendant documentation. In considering the number of documents alleged not to have been retained, so as to completely erase any documentary evidence of four flight segments of international air travel, the Panel finds that it is not probable that the Claimant would be unable to produce any documentation if he did travel by air in the timeframe and manner alleged. Further, the Panel notes that the Claimant travelled on his own genuine passport. It follows that his airline arrangements would be in his name. Even without knowledge of the specific airline, as appears to be the case for three of the four flights,35 the Claimant should have been able, with reasonable effort, to locate and obtain copies of at least some of his airline arrangements. In the circumstances, the Panel rejects the Claimant's testimony as a credible explanation for the lack of travel documentation submitted in this proceeding.\n[45] A review of the other documentation in the file indicates that the Claimant obtained a NIC in 2011.36 There is also an English-version copy of the Claimant's birth certificate with a certification date of XXXX XXXX, 2014.37 Additionally, there is a copy of a birth register certificate with a certification date of \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX,\" which may refer to either XXXX or XXXX of 2014.38 In any event, this is simply the certification date and is not clearly probative of the Claimant's presence in Sri Lanka in either August or December of 2014. An almost illegible copy of a driver's license appears to indicate that the Claimant took a driving test on XXXX XXXX, 2013 and was issued the license on XXXX XXXX, 2014.39 A letter from the aforementioned \"grama\" officer indicates that the Claimant lived in that grama's administrative division from 1994 to 2013.40 The Claimant's school records indicate that he wrote the XXXX XXXX XXXX examination in XXXX 2013 and again in XXXX 2014.41 Those records were apparently signed by the school principal in XXXX 2016, and so were clearly obtained by the Claimant after his arrival in Canada. Although some of these records are simply photocopies without accompanying originals, given a consideration of the quality of these documents on their face and the totality of the documents, the Panel is satisfied to accept the records. Therefore, the latest clear documentary evidence of the Claimant's presence in Sri Lanka is XXXX 2014, when he wrote his XXXX XXXX XXXX examination.\n[46] As there is a lack of travel documentation, the Claimant's location is not re-established by credible supporting documentation until his detention by United States immigration authorities which, in itself, does not indicate his date of detention, but does indicate that he was in detention at least by XXXX 2015.42 There is also a United States immigration document dated \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX15.\"43 The content of the letter appears to refer to the period after the Claimant's release; having considered that the Claimant does not allege he was in United States custody until late XXXX 2015, the Panel infers that this date is XXXX XXXX, 2015.\n[47] The Panel is also not satisfied by the Claimant's testimony as to his travels from Sri Lanka to the United States. The Claimant provided his travel route and dates to Canadian immigration officials through the Schedule 12 claim form.44 However, during the hearing, it became evident that the Claimant was inaccurate in the dates provided, alleging that he simply guessed at many of the dates. According to his testimony, one of the dates of transit between two countries as declared in his claim form was inaccurate by approximately one month. The Claimant also testified that he had difficulties determining whether he was in Guatemala or Mexico. In these circumstances, the Panel does not find the Claimant's testimony of his travel to be trustworthy.\n[48] As there is no documentation to show that the Claimant travelled as described, when such documentation should reasonably be available, and because the Claimant's testimony of his travels is not trustworthy, per Elazi,45 the Panel draws a negative inference that the Claimant travelled from Sri Lanka to the United States during the timeframe and in the manner as described to the Panel.\n[49] The overall circumstances leave open the serious possibility that the Claimant was no longer in Sri Lanka after August 2014. While this does not directly undermine the Claimant's allegations of arrest and detention by the Sri Lankan authorities and the Karuna Group during 2013, it does bring into question whether he exited Sri Lanka on the date alleged and his location, and therefore his activities, during the period from August 2014 until he entered United States immigration custody, which the Panel will presume, without finding, was in late XXXX 2015. Such evidence is highly relevant to the Claimant's allegations that he was fleeing persecution in Sri Lanka.\nLetter of Corroboration\n[50] The Panel notes that a handwritten letter purportedly from the Claimant's father was tendered in evidence.46 Its contents were certified as true before a Sri Lankan Justice of the Peace. The letter itself is brief; it indicates that the Claimant was detained by the army and intelligence unit three times because of the Claimant's uncle's visit and because of the father's earlier detention. It also affirms that the Claimant faced persecution and hardships, although without detail as to the mistreatment. It further asserts that the Claimant's life will be in danger if he returns to Sri Lanka. The contents are essentially repetitive of the BOC narrative and the Claimant's testimony, but in much less detail. Although the letter is certified as true, the Claimant's father was not called as a witness. The Panel appreciates the difficulties in arranging for a witness present in another country to be heard; however, there are alternatives to in-person attendance, such as through the telephone. In any event, the Panel was unable to test and assess the father's evidence. Accordingly, the letter is assigned little weight.\nCredibility Assessment\n[51] The Panel has made negative findings and drawn negative inferences upon the Claimant's evidence related to the XXXX 2013 abduction by the Karuna Group, his hiding in XXXX from XXXX 2013 to XXXX 2014, and his timing and routing of travel from Sri Lanka to Canada. These are all key aspects of the claim. As per Sheikh,47 the Panel is of the view that the cumulative effect of such negative findings and inferences going to central aspects of the claim undermines the credibility of the Claimant in general.\n[52] As a result of these negative credibility findings, the Panel finds that the Claimant's evidence of the events that led to his exit from Sri Lanka have not been established on a balance of probabilities. Specifically, the Panel finds that the Claimant was not arrested or detained by Sri Lankan authorities, paramilitary groups, or other parties on the three occasions in 2013 as alleged by him.\n[53] It is not necessary to make findings related to the alleged mistreatment by Sri Lankan authorities following shortly after his family's surrender and the conclusion of the civil war in 2009 due to the evolution of country conditions since that time, which will be discussed below.\nResidual Profile\n[54] A claim for refugee protection is forward-looking. Although the Panel has determined that the Claimant is not a credible witness with respect to the events surrounding his exit from Sri Lanka, it is still necessary to consider whether his residual profile places him at any risk. It is accepted that the Claimant is a young Tamil male from XXXX, located in the northern region of Sri Lanka. Similar profiles have faced many difficulties in the past due to the civil war between the government and the LTTE; however, the documentary evidence indicates that circumstances facing such individuals have changed.\n[55] Country condition documentation before the Panel indicates that simply being of Tamil ethnicity is insufficient to establish a refugee protection claim.48 Further, past or present residency within a formerly LTTE-controlled area does not, in itself, trigger a need for refugee protection.49 The UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Asylum-Seekers from Sri Lanka (\"UNHCR Guidelines\") indicates that the LTTE, at its height, controlled 76% of the northern and eastern provinces of Sri Lanka, and so residents throughout those areas came into regular contact with the LTTE and its civilian administration.50 Information from 2014 indicates that the \"vast majority\" of detained former LTTE combatants have been released by the Sri Lankan government; already in February 2014, 11,758 of these combatants had been rehabilitated and reintegrated into society.51\n[56] However, certain real or perceived previous links to the LTTE within the northern and eastern provinces, described as being more \"elaborate\" links, may attract serious mistreatment by government authorities.52 Examples of such links are outlined in the UNHCR Guidelines, and include persons who held senior positions in the LTTE civilian administration, were former LTTE combatants, were LTTE supporters actively involved in assisting the LTTE, have actual or perceived links to the Sri Lankan Diaspora that supported the LTTE, and have family links or close associations to those with \"elaborate\" connections to the LTTE.53 Country condition documentation from the United Kingdom indicates that a post-civil war link of some significance to LTTE actors is required to draw attention and mistreatment by the authorities.54 By contrast, other sources of information indicate that authorities may take an interest in individuals with more tenuous or minor associations with the LTTE.55\n[57] The UNHCR Guidelines also notes that failed Tamil asylum-seekers are sometimes detained and seriously mistreated after rejection of their asylum claims.56 This issue is echoed in documentation submitted by Claimant's counsel, which indicates this issue continued into at least 2015.57 A majority of returnees are also contacted after returning to their homes for further \"registration,\" which appears to mean these individuals were subjected to further interviews by either military or police services.58 It appears that individuals with actual or perceived involvement of some significance in the Sri Lankan Diaspora, which is present in Toronto, as well as, predictably, those subject to legal action are of primary concern upon return to authorities.59 It does not appear, however, that low-level involvement in the Diaspora, even to the point of participating in demonstrations, will sufficiently trigger the concern of authorities.60 Again, there is other material to the contrary on this point, which indicates that \"real or perceived past connection to the LTTE, at whatever level and whether directly and\/or through a family member or acquaintance\" is sufficient to draw mistreatment of returnees.61\n[58] The Panel further notes that an Asian Human Rights Commission report, cited in the UNHCR Guidelines, states that torture is \"endemic in Sri Lanka and is practised at every police station and detention centre.\"62 Further, military and other security authorities subjected \"detainees in the north and east to interrogation, frequently including torture.\"63 The detainees were apparently civilians who were suspected of LTTE connections.64\n[59] The documentation is somewhat mixed as to the point when suspected LTTE connections will trigger the attention of, and therefore potential mistreatment by, Sri Lankan authorities. However, after carefully considering the material in evidence, the Panel finds that the preponderance of the documentary evidence indicates that Sri Lankan authorities target those individuals with post-civil war involvement of at least some significance with LTTE-linked activism or whose circumstances suggest such an involvement. In coming to this conclusion, the Panel has considered the overall trend toward reintegration in Sri Lankan society.\n[60] Therefore, taking the Claimant's evidence as true that his father was detained during the Sri Lankan civil war for involvement in an LTTE vigilance committee, which appears to have been a low-level role, the Panel finds that this link is insufficient to suggest that the Claimant will draw the attention of Sri Lankan authorities. As noted, significant numbers of actual LTTE combatants have been released and re-integrated into Sri Lankan society. The Claimant's father's involvement in the LTTE was far more tenuous than an actual soldier; the Claimant's link to the LTTE is even more remote, simply being the son of a low-level functionary.\n[61] Further, taking the Claimant's evidence as true that he has an uncle who visited from the United Kingdom in 2011, the Panel finds that this link is insufficient to suggest that the Claimant will draw the attention of Sri Lankan authorities. The Panel has already rejected the evidence that Sri Lankan authorities were triggered into action by this uncle's visit in 2011. There is insufficient evidence before the Panel to suggest that simply having a relative in a Diaspora location, such as London, is enough to trigger interest by Sri Lankan authorities. There was some oral testimony from the Claimant to suggest that his uncle has taken steps in the United Kingdom to arrange for aid for Sri Lankans. The evidence on this point is insufficient to suggest that the uncle is any kind of pro-LTTE activist.\n[62] Additionally, the Panel has considered whether the Claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution upon his return to Sri Lanka by virtue of being a failed refugee Claimant, especially one from a location with a significant Diaspora population. The Panel has found that the preponderance of evidence indicates that a returnee must engage in post-civil war LTTE activism of some significance to draw the attention of authorities. There is no evidence before the Panel to indicate that the Claimant has undertaken any activism while present in Canada or elsewhere outside of Sri Lanka. Further, there is no evidence before the Panel to indicate that the Claimant may be perceived to have undertaken any such activism. Therefore, the Panel finds that there is insufficient evidence to establish that the Claimant will face mistreatment as a returnee.\n[63] Finally, the Panel has also considered the various residual factors from an accumulative standpoint, or as a whole, and finds that this evidence is insufficient to establish that the Claimant faces a serious possibility of persecution in Sri Lanka.\nCONCLUSION\n[64] The Panel concludes that the Claimant is not a Convention refugee, pursuant to s. 96 of IRPA, as he does not face a serious possibility of persecution in Sri Lanka. As there is no further evidence that the Claimant would satisfy the risks delineated pursuant to ss. 97(1) of IRPA, which requires a higher standard of risk than s. 96 of IRPA, the Panel further finds that the Claimant is not a person in need of protection. Therefore, the claim is rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Robert L. Gibson\"\nRobert L.

She claims refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The alleged circumstances underlying the claim are contained in the Claimant's Basis of Claim (\"BOC\") form,2 and are supplemented by the Claimant's oral testimony and supporting documents.\n[3] The Claimant alleges that she was a XXXX in XXXX, Afghanistan who has XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for a total of approximately five years. She holds a less restrictive view of Islam; she dressed in a relatively liberal fashion and also held liberal views on the rights of women. She alleges experiencing a number of negative incidents in Afghanistan. The Claimant was harassed for her liberal appearance and for her employment. Her husband, as well, would receive criticisms regarding the Claimant's various freedoms.\n[4] In 2015, the Claimant was approached twice by men in vehicles, who she identified as Taliban, while she was on her way to work at her school. She was threatened due to her attire. Additionally, the Claimant's school was targeted in a poisoning attack, which the Claimant believed was carried out by the Taliban. The Claimant was treated at hospital for this attack.\n[5] After the Claimant's arrival in Canada, her husband received criticisms for his wife's departure on her own; he also received letters from the Taliban summoning him and the Claimant to a Taliban court for involvement with Western individuals and for acting against Islam.3\n[6] The Claimant fears that she will be subjected to threats and physical harm if she returns to Afghanistan.\nDETERMINATION\n[7] For the reasons that follow, the Panel determines that the Claimant is not a Convention refugee, nor a person in need of protection. Therefore, the claim is rejected.\nPRELIMINARY MATTERS\n[8] At the conclusion of this hearing, the Claimant was permitted to provide further documentation with respect to her alleged background as a XXXX. Those documents were received by way of letter dated XXXX XXXX, 2016 and entered as Exhibit 8.4 As such, those documents were taken into consideration in assessing the overall evidence.\n[9] As this claim relates to a woman's role in society, the Panel must consider and apply Chairperson Guidelines 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.5 Therefore, amongst other considerations, the Panel recognizes that social, cultural, and traditional norms can impact the testimony of those fearing gender-based persecution, and the Panel must consider the interplay of those factors in assessing the evidence in this matter.\nANALYSIS\n[10] In the context of this claim, it is necessary to consider whether the Claimant has established her identity as a national of Afghanistan, and whether, as per s. 96 of IRPA, the Claimant has established, through credible and trustworthy evidence, that she is at serious risk of persecution in Afghanistan. A consideration of the evidence as it relates to ss. 97(1) of IRPA is also necessary, and will be briefly set out below.\n[11] The determinative issue in this case is credibility.\nIdentity\n[12] The Claimant's personal identity and identity as a national of Afghanistan is established through her testimony and the supporting documentation filed, specifically a certified true copy of her passport issued by Afghanistan.6 The passport was seized by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada at the time that she filed her refugee protection claim, and so the Panel was unable to examine the original document.7 However, there was no aspect on the face of the copy that caused the panel to doubt its genuine nature. The passport has complexity to its design. Further, although it is not determinative, based on the United States entry stamp in the passport, the Panel notes that it was accepted as a legitimate travel document upon the Claimant's entry into the United States.8 The Panel, therefore, finds that the Claimant has established her personal identity and identity as a national of Afghanistan.\nCredibility\n[13] Sworn testimony is presumed to be true, unless there is a valid reason to doubt its veracity. The determination as to whether a claimant's evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities, the burden of which is upon the claimant to satisfy. The Panel also notes that the entirety of a claimant's relevant evidence may be undermined if the claimant is found generally lacking in credibility.9\n[14] In assessing credibility, the Panel has considered the challenges faced by a claimant in a hearing room setting within the context of the age and background of this particular claimant. The evidence indicates that the Claimant, born in 1990, has XXXX XXXX XXXX post-secondary education in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX The Claimant also allegedly worked as a XXXX XXXX at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX levels for approximately five years. However, as will be discussed further, the Panel has concerns with respect to the personal profile alleged by the Claimant. As noted above, the Claimant's evidence must be assessed with serious consideration to the applicable Chairperson's guidelines respecting gender-based persecution.10\n[15] After having heard the testimony of the Claimant and carefully considering the whole of the relevant evidence, as well as her counsel's able written submissions, the Panel has the following credibility concerns.\nNo Mention of Core Incidents in Basis of Claim Form\n[16] During testimony, the Claimant described two incidents where she was directly threatened and which she attributed to the Taliban.\n[17] In the first incident, the Claimant described a white car stopping in front of her near the school at which XXXX XXXX as she walked there in the morning. The occupants of the car were men with their faces covered and were, therefore, not recognizable. She described them as using bad words against her, asking why she was wearing a certain type of hijab, and warning that if she was seen again by them, she knew what would happen to her. She described the hijab that she wore that day as going to her knees; she also described wearing some make-up on her face. When asked when the incident occurred, she stated that it occurred in the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, by which the Panel understands she was referring to the current Afghan calendar year, which varies somewhat from the Julian calendar. As a reference, she stated that the Afghan date at the time of the hearing was the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX; the hearing was held in February 2016. A month in the Afghan calendar year is comprised of 30 or 31 days, depending on the month, and there are twelve months in a year.\n[18] In the second incident, the Claimant described another incident that occurred a week later, again as she walked to her school in the morning. Once she was near the school, she was approached by two men on a motorcycle; they wore black glasses and at least one carried a gun. She was asked, it appears rhetorically, if she had ever heard of the Taliban and why she did not take their warning seriously. She was told it was her last warning.\n[19] The Claimant's husband filed complaints with the police respecting both incidents one to two days following the latter occasion. Those reports were submitted in evidence.11\n[20] Neither incident was included in the Claimant's BOC, which indicates that it was signed on December 29, 2015. The Claimant was asked to explain. She stated that she was stressed and shocked after both incidents, and did not feel like speaking of the incidents, preferring instead to forget them. The Claimant was asked if she understood that she needed to provide complete information in her BOC. She agreed, but noted that she did not feel well and that she was not in a proper situation; as the Panel understands it, she needed time to adjust to her environment. Under examination by her counsel, the Claimant further explained that she did not think that the incidents were important to mention and that she did not understand the process of a claim.\n[21] The BOC form instructions state, \"INCLUDE EVERYTHING THAT IS IMPORTANT FOR YOUR CLAIM. INCLUDE DATES, NAMES AND PLACES WHEREVER POSSIBLE.\"12 There are a number of subheadings with various \"prompts,\" including questions related to the identity and actions of the alleged persecutors.13 As also mentioned, the Panel notes that the Claimant's purported signature appears in the BOC, under a statement confirming that the entire content of the BOC and all attachments had been interpreted to the Claimant.14 There was no allegation raised that the BOC form was not correctly interpreted or understood.\n[22] The Panel does not accept as reasonable the Claimant's explanation for the omission of the car and motorcycle incidents. Both incidents were significant incidents of direct threats against her and are clearly core aspects of her allegations when considered in the claim's overall context. The Claimant noted in her own testimony that these were serious threats. With respect to her statement that she required time to adjust to her environment, the Panel notes, as per her evidence, that the Claimant entered Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2015; the BOC form indicates that it was signed on December 29, 2015, some twelve days after the Claimant's arrival.15 By that time, the Claimant had the assistance of counsel in completing the BOC materials, the same counsel who ultimately represented her at the hearing.16 The Panel notes that no BOC amendments were made prior to the hearing, although the Panel did receive police reports related to the incidents on XXXX XXXX, 2016.17\n[23] In all of the circumstances, the Panel rejects the Claimant's explanation for her failure to mention the alleged car and motorcycle incidents in the BOC form; the Panel further draws a negative inference upon the veracity of the Claimant's evidence respecting the alleged car and motorcycle incidents.\nInconsistences and Errors in Police Reports\n[24] The Panel notes, further, issues with respect to the supporting police reports, of which three were provided.18 Two of the reports, on letterhead for the \"Headquarters of Security of Province XXXX XXXX,\" bear sealing stamps. The stamps bear inscriptions in Dari; on many of the stamps, there is, as well, an English inscription which reads XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX This issue was brought to the Claimant's attention; she stated that the Dari script indicated XXXX. No explanation was provided as to why the sealing stamps would misspell the provincial name. The Panel anticipates that an official sealing stamp would correctly spell the provincial name.\n[25] The Panel also notes that the police reports related to the car incident, as described above, indicate that the Claimant was told that she was warned not to attend at school because she did not wear a hijab. In the Claimant's testimony, as noted above, she stated that she was warned away from school because she wore a different type of hijab than apparently expected, and went on to provide a description of the hijab that she wore on the day of the incident. This is a clear inconsistency between the police report and the Claimant's testimony.\n[26] In all of the circumstances, the Panel rejects the police reports as genuine documents and draws a further negative inference upon the Claimant's evidence with respect to the alleged car and motorcycle incidents. Further, and in consideration of these document issues, the Panel also draws a negative inference upon the veracity of documents submitted in this matter.\nInconsistencies and Errors in Medical Records\n[27] The Claimant provided a letter, dated XXXX XXXX, 2016, from a Dr. XXXX XXXX XXXX, which indicates that the Claimant was under the doctor's care from XXXX XXXX, 2013 to XXXX XXXX, 2015 due to a diagnosis of conversion disorder.19 The Claimant was asked to explain her experience of a conversion disorder. As the Panel understands it, when under stress, the Claimant would fixate on a thought or momentarily blank out.\n[28] The Claimant confirmed that the letter was issued in English; an original in Dari was not provided. There are a number of concerns with this document. The letter is drafted on XXXX Regional Hospital letterhead, and bears what appears to be the Afghanistan coat of arms, although the copy provided to the Panel is somewhat poor quality. In the letterhead portion of the document, above XXXX Regional Hospital, is noted \"Minestry of Health,\" as opposed to the anticipated spelling, \"Ministry of Health.\" The letterhead also indicates that the letter is from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX the body of the letter states that the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of the hospital certifies the information contained therein. Further below, in the contact information, is the notation \"XXXX Regional Hospital \/ XXXX XXXX.\" The originating department of the correspondence is clearly named in a confusing and inconsistent manner.\n[29] The Claimant also provided a hospital admission form, which indicates that she attended at the XXXX Regional Hospital on XXXX XXXX, 2015, following the above-noted poisoning attempt at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX The letterhead portion of the form indicates \"XXXX Regional Hospital\" and is signed in English by the \"XXXX XXXX.\" Although a handwritten notation by an unknown doctor is understandably subject to misspelling, a misspelling of the hospital name in an admission form is of concern.\n[30] When taken together, the number of inconsistencies and errors in the medical records leads the Panel to reject them as genuine documents and to draw a further negative inference as to the veracity of documents submitted in this matter.\nInconsistencies as to XXXX Career\n[31] The Claimant indicated in her IMM 5669 claim form that she was a XXXX at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX 2011 to XXXX 2012; she was then a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX 2012 to XXXX 2015.20 The Claimant submitted a certificate that indicates that she was a XXXX at the XXXX XXXX from 2011 to 2015.21\n[32] The Claimant was asked to explain the date inconsistencies. The Claimant stated that she was surprised when she saw the reversal in school locations; the Claimant indicated that she was at the XXXX XXXX for approximately ten months, then moved onto the XXXX XXXX XXXX for approximately four years. She stated that there were many documents to sign, and that she may have been unclear as to the contents of the form. The Claimant was asked whether the IMM 5669 form had been translated to her; she said that perhaps she was unclear, did not pay attention, or there were potential interpreter issues. As the Panel understands it, she had provided Afghanistan calendar dates to the interpreter. The Claimant was asked whether the dates provided in the form had been translated to her in a manner that she could understand; she said she thought so. The Claimant confirmed that she knew, when signing the form, that her signature was a declaration that its contents were true, correct and complete.\n[33] The Panel rejects the Claimant's explanations as to the date inconsistencies of her school employment. The Claimant signed the IMM 5669 form twice, once before a Canadian immigration official, declaring that its contents were truthful, complete and correct. She knew the effect of her declaration at the time of signing the document. The Claimant also had a Dari interpreter assist in the completion of the form, who also signed a declaration that the form had been accurately interpreted to the Claimant. The Claimant, on her own evidence, is an educated individual who has authored XXXX XXXX. In the circumstances, the Panel draws a negative inference with respect to details of the Claimant's XXXX career.\n[34] The Panel also notes that the Claimant's Afghanistan passport, issued on September 16, 2015, indicates that her occupation is that of \"house wife.\"22 When asked why her occupation was listed as such, as opposed to XXXX, she explained, as the Panel understands it, that Afghanistan authorities place little value on women and did not ask for her current occupation.\n[35] Material in the country conditions package details the documentation that is submitted to obtain an Afghanistan passport, which includes the submission of the applicant's tazkira, which is a national identity document.23 In this case, a copy of the Claimant's tazkira was submitted in evidence, bearing an issuance date of XXXX XXXX, 2015.24 Somewhat curiously, the tazkira bears an issuance date five days after the passport, which suggests that perhaps another tazkira was submitted for the passport application. In any event, the tazkira in evidence notably does list the Claimant's occupation as a XXXX, which indicates that passport officials should have occupational information before them upon receiving an application. Taking this into account and considering that a passport is a key identity document that should normally be accepted as truthful save for sufficient evidence to the contrary, and in the context of the above-noted issue respecting the credibility of the Claimant's XXXX history, the Panel rejects the Claimant's explanation and draws a negative inference as to the veracity of the Claimant's alleged XXXX occupation.\nCredibility Assessment\n[36] The Panel has made a number of negative findings and drawn a number of negative inferences related to core allegations of her claim, documentation in support of her allegations, and her professional profile as a XXXX. Given the constellation of negative inferences, the Panel finds that the Claimant is not a credible witness with respect to the events leading to her exit from Afghanistan or details of her personal background. Consequently, significant aspects of the Claimant's allegations have been impacted by credibility issues.\n[37] As per Sheikh,25 the Panel is of the view that the cumulative effect of the negative findings and inferences with respect to the above-noted aspects of the claim undermines the credibility of the Claimant in general. These general credibility issues include not only the Claimant's oral testimony, but the documentary evidence submitted in support. As the Panel has found that a number of non-genuine documents have been submitted in this matter, the Panel is left in considerable doubt as to the veracity of all of the corroborative documents in evidence. Accordingly, the Panel rejects documents submitted as evidence of other threats and harms faced by the Claimant, such as the Taliban court summons.26 Further, the Panel rejects documents submitted as evidence of the Claimant's XXXX occupation.27\n[38] As a result of this negative credibility assessment, the Panel finds that the Claimant's allegations of threats and harm in Afghanistan have not been established on the basis of credible and trustworthy evidence. For the same reasons, the Panel also finds that the Claimant's alleged professional profile as a XXXX has not been established.\nResidual Profile\n[39] After having rejected the Claimant's allegations of threats and harms outlined in her BOC narrative, the Panel must still consider whether any aspect to the Claimant's residual profile is sufficient to establish a claim under s. 96, IRPA.\n[40] Given the Claimant's general credibility issues, it is difficult to make many findings of fact in this regard. The Panel accepts that the Claimant is a pregnant, married female who has travelled to Canada. She appears to be on good terms with her husband; there was no allegation made to the contrary.\n[41] The UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Asylum-Seekers from Afghanistan provides guidance as to risks faced by individuals based on their profile.28 The Panel has considered the material, particularly with respect to women. Based on the accepted profile of the Claimant, it is appropriate to consider whether the Claimant, having left her husband behind in Afghanistan to travel to Canada, has contravened social mores in such a way as to be interpreted as \"running away from home.\" Although the Claimant has provided some evidence that her husband has faced criticism for her departure, the Panel again must consider those allegations within the context of her general lack of credibility; consequently, that evidence is not accepted. The Panel also notes that a woman is permitted to leave home with her husband's permission.29 As unfortunate as the practice may be, it indicates that a woman being outside the home is not automatically considered in breach of social norms. Consequently, there is insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to indicate that the Claimant would be interpreted as having \"run away from home.\"\n[42] The Panel also notes that the Claimant resides in XXXX. According to the February 2015 Operational Guidance Note: Afghanistan from the United Kingdom Home Office, citing a May 2012 report, Afghan National Police \"is functioning well in terms of providing security, especially in Kabul and other big cities like XXXX.\"30 Although the Panel accepts that the security situation is far from perfect in XXXX, as numerous security incidents still occur there, it appears that the Taliban do not have effective control in XXXX.31 The Panel is unaware of any evidence before it to the contrary. Accordingly, the Claimant does not currently face the curtailment of rights brought by residence within a Taliban-controlled area.32\n[43] Further, based on the Claimant's apparent good relationship with her husband, she will have the male accompaniment generally required by Afghan social customs.33\n[44] There are no other apparent risk profiles on the evidence relevant to the Claimant.\nCONCLUSION\n[45] The Panel concludes that the Claimant is not a Convention refugee, pursuant to s. 96 of IRPA, as she does not face a serious possibility of persecution in Afghanistan. As there is no further evidence that the Claimant would satisfy the risks delineated pursuant to ss. 97(1) of IRPA, which requires a higher standard of risk than s. 96 of IRPA, the Panel further finds that the Claimant is not a person in need of protection. Therefore, the claim is rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Robert L. Gibson\"\nRobert L.

A friend, XXXX XXXX, introduced her to a religion called Almighty God. Her friend explained that the world was in the Era of Kingdom when god would return to earth. This was a period of \"the dooming of the world.\" The claimant began attending services at a house church in XXXX 2012. The house church was raided in XXXX 2012 and she went into hiding at a cousin's house. The PSB came to the claimant's house looking for her. She hired a smuggler and arrived in Canada XXXX XXXX 2013. The smuggler took her passport and identity card. The smuggler returned her identity card in 2014 when the smuggler's fee was paid but did not return her passport. She learned in January 2016 that the smuggler had been arrested and a month later she learned that the others arrested in the raid had been sentenced to four years in prison and that the PSB was still looking for her. She made a refugee claim in April 2016.\n[4] Documents were provided in support of the claimant's allegations - both country condition documents3 and personal documents.4 These included a copy of her Resident Identity card, her family's Household Register, a divorce certificate, summons, and a dismissal letter from her work, medical notes, a notice of arrest regarding XXXX XXXX XXXX, and letters from her employer of three years in Canada and letters from other members of the Church of Almighty God in Toronto. The package also included photographs of the claimant with other persons at church activities.\n[5] The Minister provided GCMS notes regarding multiple applications for Temporary Resident Visas.5\n[6] The Claimant testified at the hearing.\nDETERMINATION\n[7] The Panel finds that the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor is she a person in need of protection. The determinative issue is credibility.\nANALYSIS\nIdentity and Passport\n[8] The claimant did not present her passport when she made her claim nor did she present it at the hearing. Her explanation that she had given it to the smuggler who brought her to Canada in 2013 and then remained in Canada without this vital identity document for several years is not accepted as reasonable. As the Federal Court stated in Elazi: The passport not only confirms nationality and identity; it also tells the Panel where the claimant has travelled, where he was when events he claimed as the reason for his fear occurred, along with when and through which countries the claimant traveled to get to Canada. It is too easy for a claimant to simply state that...the facilitator has taken (it)\".6 These are serious questions which go to the core of a claim and without the passport, remain largely unanswered. The Panel finds that the failure to provide her passport without a reasonable explanation, in addition to leaving serious questions unanswered, also impugns the claimant's overall credibility.\n[9] The claimant did provide her National Identity Card7 issued by the government of China in her name along with the other documents in her name included in her disclosure package.8 The Panel notes also that her passport would have been seen by the visa post when she made applications for Temporary Resident Visas. The GCMS notes do not indicate any concern about the validity of the passport. Taking these together, the Panel finds that these documents are sufficient to establish the claimant's identity and Chinese nationality, on a balance of probabilities.\nCredibility\n[10] The onus is on the person making a refugee claim to present evidence that is credible, on a balance of probabilities, to support the allegations which form the basis of his claim. In this case the Panel finds that the claimant has not met that onus.\n[11] While statements given under oath are presumed to be true, that presumption can be rebutted by contradictions or inconsistencies in the evidence.9 In reviewing the evidence the Panel \"may also conclude that a claimant's evidence is implausible, or improbable, or dubious, or untenable, or unreliable, or absurd, or unconvincing.\"10 The Panel \"also is entitled, in assessing credibility, to rely on criteria such as rationality and common sense.\"11 In a claim where the core of the claim, i.e. the sincerity of the alleged religious belief, cannot be verified but other elements can, negative credibility findings on related matters may also affect the credibility of the claimant's evidence on those core elements. The Panel must also consider the requirement in RPD Rules, Rule 11, for the claimant to provide acceptable documentation in assessing the credibility of the claimant's evidence.12\nEvents in China\n[12] The Panel noted that the narrative was vague on the claimant's motivation for joining the Church of Almighty God in China. Efforts by the Panel to clarify this point with the claimant at the hearing were unsuccessful. The Panel specifically asked how believing the world was doomed made her calm, as this was the only element of the church's beliefs she included in her narrative and this effect was the benefit she reported receiving from her participation in the church. The claimant gave vague, disjointed responses which repeated parts of her narrative. She could not give any further detail to explain her motivation for taking part in an activity she knew to be illegal.\n[13] The Panel also asked the claimant how, when the house church was raided, she managed to escape while the others were captured. She replied that the PSB had come to the front door and she had simply escaped out the back door. The Panel finds it implausible that the PSB, who the claimant alleges are so intent on arresting followers of her church that they still seek her years after she left the country, would make it easy to evade them by leaving an exit uncovered during their raid.\n[14] The Panel finds it more likely that the claimant's inability to provide detail about her motivation in joining the church and her dubious story of escape are indications that these events she alleges did not actually occur.\nChurch Activities in Canada\n[15] The claimant presented two brief notes allegedly from members of the Church of Almighty God in Toronto.13 One was six lines; the other seven lines. Both stated that the writer was a member of the church and had known the claimant since XXXX XXXX, 2013 in one, and XXXX XXXX, 2013 in the other. Both go on to state the claimant \"attends church activities every week,\" that she and the brothers and sisters \"take in and digest God's words\" and end with \"I attest that XXXX XXXX is a believer of God at our church\" in one note, and \"I believe that she is a faithful believer in our Church of Almighty God\" in the other. Neither of the writers was present at the hearing to provide more detail beyond these brief, suspiciously similar, statements.\n[16] The Panel asked the claimant about the letters. She said that she had asked for them 1 June 2016 because of her upcoming hearing. The Panel then asked if she had discussed her predicament with either of them before requesting the letters. The claimant initially said she had not, and gave as the reason, the shortness of study sessions. The Panel was surprised that the claimant was alleging she attended a church which originated in China where its members are oppressed by the government and many have come to Canada to escape this persecution but yet she had never discussed her situation with other members of the church in the more than three years of attending there and so the Panel confirmed with the claimant that she had never discussed it. The claimant again stated that she had never discussed it. A moment later she stated that she had told them about her persecution in China shortly after she arrived but that she had never asked for, and they had never offered, advice about how to stay in Canada. Considering the nature of the church, as discussed above, the Panel finds it unlikely that the claimant attended there weekly, as stated in the notes from two other members referred to above, and never discussed her situation with them. The change in the claimant's testimony to say the she did tell the other church members, along with leading the Panel to conclude that her testimony was evolving as she gave it, makes this even less likely. Had either of the letter writers been present to address this question, the issue may have been resolved. As it stands, the Panel finds this part of the claimant's testimony not credible and gives no weight to the letters presented as being from members of the church.\n[17] The claimant also presented photographs which she testified showed her involved in church activities. The claimant testified that one was taken in 2014 but she had no idea when the others were taken. The Panel asked why the photos were taken. She replied that they were to prove that she was a genuine believer doing work for the church. The Panel asked why she would have to prove that in 2014 - she did not make a refugee claim until two years later - and the claimant then said they were taken to keep as mementos. Again, the claimant's testimony was evolving as she gave it.\n[18] The Panel finds that, considering the totality of the testimony on the issue of the claimant's involvement with this church, any involvement she may have had was for the purpose of this claim only and not an indication of true religious belief or practice on the part of the claimant. The Panel finds that the documents provided in support of the claimant's involvement are either fraudulent or, if they were actually written by the persons whose names appear on them, were provided to support a fraudulent claim.\n[19] A further issue which arises from the claimant's testimony on her involvement with the church is the matter of the lengthy delay in making a claim in Canada. The claimant alleged that she believed she could not make a claim until she had her passport back from the smuggler. The Panel has already found this allegation regarding the whereabouts of her passport not credible but even if it were true it is insufficient to explain a more than three-year delay. She testified that she made no inquiries on this matter. If the claimant had been attending the church as alleged, this explanation is not reasonable. The fact that the claimant was living in Canada without status for years is inconsistent with the allegation that she feared arrest and imprisonment in China during this time.\n[20] Regarding the documents from China presented in support of this claim, the Panel finds the claimant so lacking in credibility on the core issues of this claim, and considering the ease of access to fraudulent documents in China14 the Panel gives them no weight.\n[21] The Panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant did not attend a house church in China and did not attend the Church of Almighty God for the past three years here in Canada. The Panel finds it unlikely that she is being sought by authorities in China.\nCONCLUSION\n[22] Considering the totality of the evidence and the cumulative effect of the credibility findings set out above, the Panel finds the claimant is not a Convention refugee pursuant to s. 96 of IRPA. This credibility assessment also applies to any claim to be a person in need of protection under s. 97(1) of IRPA.\n[23] As the Panel has found that core aspects of this claim were fabricated and likely supported by fraudulent documents, the Panel finds that this is a manifestly unfounded claim in accordance with s 107.1 of IRPA.\n(signed)\n\"D.

In a narrative dated July 8, 2016, he states that he fears members of the Mara MS13 who murdered his friend and who extorted money from him.\n[3] The claimant left El Salvador on July 30, 2012 and travelled through Guatemala and Mexico to the United States where he resided with family members before coming to Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2016.\n[4] The claimant fears members of the Maras will harm or attempt to recruit him should he return to El Salvador.\nANALYSIS\n[5] The determinative issues in this case are nexus and generalized risk.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] The panel finds that the claimant has not satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, or that, on a balance of probabilities, he would personally be subjected to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture upon return to El Salvador.\nIdentity\n[7] The claimant's identity as a national of El Salvador is established through his testimony and the supporting documentation filed, namely, a copy of his National Identity Card and Birth Certificate2.\nSection 96: Nexus\n[8] The determinative issue in this Section 96 analysis is nexus, or whether there is a link to any of the Convention grounds.\n[9] The claimant testified that he fears the Maras because they killed his friend XXXX. He testified that XXXX died on XXXX XXXX, 2012 and that thereafter members of the Maras asked him for money twice a week when he was en route to school. He gave them money and they did not harm him. The panel asked whether the Maras wanted anything else from him and he said no, only that he remained silent about the extortion.\n[10] The panel asked whether his problems with the Maras had anything to do with his family and he said no, they did not know his family.\n[11] The Federal Court has held that victims of crime, corruption or vendettas generally fail to establish a link between their fear of persecution and one of the Convention grounds in the definition of a Convention refugee. The Board has been upheld in its finding of lack of nexus where the claimant was a target of a personal vendetta or where the claimant was a victim of crime.\n[12] The claimant's fear in this case is not linked to race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. The panel finds that the claimant fears being a victim of crime and as such is not linked to a Convention ground. As a result, this claim must fail under section 96 of the IRPA. However, a separate analysis pursuant to section 97 of IRPA follows.\nSection 97(1)\n[13] Section 97(1) of the IRPA states:\nA person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally...\n(b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if...\n(ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country\n[14] A determination of whether a claimant is in need of protection requires an objective assessment of risk. The claimant must establish that, on a balance of probabilities, he faces harm that amounts to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.3 The evidence must establish a specific, individualized risk of harm with regard to the particular claimant, and not merely generalized human rights violations in their country.4\n[15] The panel notes that a person who is a direct victim of crime is not automatically a person in need of protection within the meaning of 97 of the IRPA. In order to find that a claimant would be subjected personally to one of the risk in section 97 of the IRPA, there must be evidence that establishes on a balance of probabilities a specific individualized risk of harm with regards to a particular claimant.5 The claimant testified that the demands for money were made to him by unknown members of the Maras.\n[16] The documentary evidence states that crime is prevalent in throughout El Salvador.6 The gang problem in is widespread and homicides, drug trafficking and robberies are frequent.\n[17] The Maras demanded money from the claimant. Although objectionable, the panel does not find that a demand for money from a criminal gang is a personalized risk. Even though the claimant may have been specifically targeted in 2012 by the Maras in El Salvador, he faces a similar risk as the general population of the country. The risk faced by the claimant is one generally faced by other people in El Salvador who may have something the gang wanted: money.\n[18] There was no persuasive evidence before the panel that the claimant was targeted for any other reason than that the gang wanted his money and although the panel notes the claimant's testimony that the Maras killed his friend XXXX, the panel notes that the claimant did not witness the murder, nor did he speak to gang members about his friend.\n[19] The claimant testified that the Maras wanted him to remain silent. When asked what he could say, the claimant said they would hurt him if he said that they took money from him.\n[20] The panel asked whether he reported anything to the authorities and he said no. The panel asked when was the last time he had contact with any members of the Maras and he said it was in July 2012. When asked whether he had any reason to believe the Maras were still interested in him four years after the last contact, he said they can still recognize him.\n[21] The panel asked who he was living with before leaving the country and he said his mother. When asked if she had problems with the Maras he said no and also stated \"they never found out where I lived.\" The panel asked whether Mara members knew his name and he said \"no.\"\n[22] The claimant has not seen the people he fears since July 2012. He testified that he did not report them to police and that they do not know his name or where he lived. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant was extorted while en route to school. The targeting was not personal and the Maras did not know his name but simply demanded money from him. The panel finds the claimant has not established that he was personally targeted. There was no persuasive evidence before the panel that the claimant was targeted for any other reason than that the gang wanted his money.\n[23] The panel concludes that the claimant faces a generalized risk, faced by a large number of other people in El Salvador. The fact the claimant was once a target does not remove him from the generalized risk category since the nature of the risk is one faced generally by others in El Salvador.\n[24] The panel finds that on a balance of probabilities, the risk which the claimant faces is generalized and one which is faced generally by the population of El Salvador. Based on the particular facts of this case, even if the claimant faced a particularized risk of harm in accordance with section 97 of the IRPA, the risk faced by him is generalized, which falls under the paragraph 97(1) (b) exception.\nCONCLUSION\n[25] The panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimant does not have a nexus to a Convention ground and finds that this claimant has not established that the risk he faces is not one faced generally by the population of El Salvador. Whether his claim then was based on section 96 or 97, it would fail. The panel concludes that the claimant is not a Convention refugee or person in need of protection and rejects his claim.\n(signed)\n\"Sarah Morgan\"\nSarah Morgan\n\"August 26, 2016\"\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96, 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b).\n2 Exhibit 1, Package of information from the referring CBSA\/CIC.\n3 Li v.

In summary, the claimant was an active member of the Bangladesh Nationalists Party (BNP). Due to his involvement with BNP, he became targeted by the armed gang of the Awami League. Members of this gang went to his house and harassed his family members, threatened to abduct his sons and demanded a large sum of money. Fearing for their safety, the claimant made arrangements for his family to leave Bangladesh on Canadian visas that they had obtained and initiated their claims for refugee protection in Canada.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] The panel determines that the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\nANALYSIS\n[5] The determinative issue is credibility.\nIdentity\n[6] The claimants' identities as nationals of Bangladesh are established through testimony and the supporting documentation filed.3\nCredibility\n[7] When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are indeed true unless there is valid reason to doubt their veracity.4 The determination as to whether a claimant's evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities.5\n[8] The panel finds the claimant not credible with respect to his material allegations, namely that he is being threatened and targeted by members of the Awami League for his active membership with the BNP. Furthermore, the panel does not find the claimant credible in his assertions that he is an active member of the BNP.\nThe claimant's political profile\n[9] The panel asked the claimant when he joined the BNP. The claimant stated that he does not remember the date. When asked if he knew approximately when he joined the BNP, the claimant stated it has been at least three to four years.\n[10] The panel noted to the claimant that his testimony was not consistent with his BOC and the supporting documentary evidence which states that he joined the BNP in 2007, which would be approximately nine years ago not three or four years ago and asked him to explain the difference. The claimant explained that he did not remember the year he joined.\n[11] The panel rejects the claimant's explanation. The inconsistency is material as it concerns inconsistencies regarding how long he was been a supporter of the BNP. The claimant's political profile forms the basis of his claim for refugee protection. Whether the claimant joined the BNP in 2007 or more recently, three or four years ago, is a significant difference that should reasonably be recalled without prompting from the panel. The panel draws a negative inference to the claimant's credibility concerning his allegations that he was an active member of the BNP.\n[12] The claimant presented a letter from the Joint Secretary of the BNP confirming his membership, activities and problems he faced from the Awami League goons. The panel noted to the claimant that this letter was not an original document. The claimant explained that he cannot find the original document as it has been two years since he obtained it. The panel gives the letter from the BNP little probative weight as it is difficult to ascertain the veracity of a copied document.\n[13] The claimant alleges that the Awami league goons are interested in him because he was an active supporter of the BNP in his local area of XXXX. He indicated that he participated in local meetings and attended local programs. When asked how many BNP supporters were in his area, the claimant estimated that there were 4000-5000 supporters. The claimant further estimated that there would be 1000-2000 BNP supporters in attendance at the meetings and events that he attended.\n[14] Given the vast number of BNP members and of the BNP members participating in local meetings and events, the panel does not find that the claimant's profile is such that he would be targeted by the Awami League goons. The claimant has not provided credible or trustworthy evidence as to why his profile as a supporter of the BNP is such that he would be singled out of a crowd of 1000-2000 and targeted for his active support.\nOmission regarding the continued interest of the agents of persecution:\n[15] The claimant testified that since he arrived in Canada in 2014, he has learned from his brothers that the Awami League goons continue to look for him. He explained that the goons visit his family once or twice a month and they leave threatening messages with his family that they will harm or kill him.\n[16] The panel noted to the claimant that this information was not included in his BOC or amended BOC and asked him to explain the omission. The claimant explained that he submitted an email from his brother regarding the Awami League goons but that he did not include any amendment of these incidents.\n[17] The panel rejects the claimant's explanation. The omission is material as it concerns the continued, frequent and persistent interest of the agents of persecution. That the Awami League goons continue to visit his family once or twice a month since 2014 is significant to the claimant's story, it is not a peripheral detail. The claimant submitted an amended BOC therefore he was aware of the process to submit an amendment. The claimant was represented by competent counsel and he confirmed at the start of the hearing that his BOC was complete, true and correct. The panel draws a negative inference to the claimant's credibility and finds that Awami League goons are not continuing to search for him in Bangladesh.\nCredibility summary\n[18] On the basis of the foregoing findings and negative inferences, and, on a balance of probabilities, the panel finds that the claimant's allegation that he was being targeted by the Awami League goons because of his active support of the BNP is not credible.\n[19] In coming to this conclusion, the panel has not ignored the corroborative documentary evidence disclosed. The claimant disclosed the following documents to corroborate his allegations.\nEmail from XXXX XXXX XXXX6\n[20] The claimant disclosed an email from his brother dated XXXX 2014 which states that the Awami League goons are still searching for him. The panel gives the email little probative weight. The email is not a sworn statement or affidavit and the panel has previously found the claimant not credible regarding his allegations.\nLawyer's letter 7\n[21] The claimant disclosed a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX who provides a background on the history of the BNP party and speaks to the personal risks the claimants will face upon their return to Bangladesh. The author states that he knows that the Awami League goons continue to search for the claimants. He also states that he is aware that the police, Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and other secret service personals are looking for the claimant to arrest him. The panel gives this letter little probative weight as the author does not indicate how he knows that the police and RAB are seeking to arrest the claimant. The panel further notes that the claimant did not indicate in his BOC that the police or RAB are seeking to arrest him. Finally, the panel finds the author's conclusion that the claimant will be detained by the police and that his children will be kidnapped upon return to Bangladesh to be speculative as his conclusion is based on his interpretation of the current political situation in Bangladesh and he does not support or substantiate his conclusions with any facts relating to the claimant's personal circumstances and how he came to be aware of such facts.\nCONCLUSION\n[22] The panel finds that the claimants have not satisfied their burden of establishing that there is a reasonable possibility of persecution on a Convention ground or that, on a balance of probabilities, they would be personally subjected to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture in Bangladesh.\n[23] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel determines that the claimants are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.\n[24] The Refugee Protection Division therefore rejects their claims for refugee protection.\n(signed)\n\"J.

In short, they allege that they face a risk of harm in Jordan from the family of a married woman named XXXX, who has alleged to have been involved in an extra-marital affair with the male claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[5] After problems allegedly began in XXXX 2015, the claimants obtained visitors visas for the United States (US) in XXXX 2015, and left Jordan for the US on XXXX XXXX, 2015. The claimants stayed visiting family for almost XXXX months however and did not seek protection in the US. The claimants subsequently came to Canada and sought protection at the port of entry on XXXX XXXX, 2016.\nDETERMINATION\n[6] The panel finds that the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. The panel's reasons are as follows.\nANALYSIS\n[7] The determinative issue in this case is credibility.\nIdentity\n[8] The identity of the claimants and their citizenship as nationals of Jordan have been established by the testimony and supporting documentation provided, including copies of their Jordanian passports, birth certificates, and the marriage certificate for the male and principal claimant.4 These documents also confirm the family relationship of the claimants.\nCredibility\n[9] In assessing credibility, the panel is mindful of the claimants' education and background. The panel notes that the principal claimant is a 32-year-old married female with a Bachelor's degree in XXXX and some experience working in this field before becoming a housewife after the birth of her children. The male claimant is 34-years-old, also with a degree in XXXX, and more than ten years of experience working as an XXXX.\n[10] The panel also took into consideration some of the difficulties that claimants can face in the hearing room, including cultural factors, the milieu of the hearing room, and the stress inherent in responding to oral questions through an interpreter.\n[11] The panel had a number of concerns with the testimony of the male and principal claimant, including material omissions and inconsistencies, some of which are noted below.\nThe claimants' period of hiding in XXXX\n[12] The claimants allege that after threats began in XXXX 2015, they fled to XXXX, where they remained until leaving the country in XXXX 2015. In the IMM5669 forms completed for their refugee claims, the male and principal claimant do not include this period of time in XXXX in their personal history.5 The panel finds it reasonable to expect the claimants to have included having to hide for months in XXXX, a significant detail, in their initial forms, and not just the subsequent BOC form, if it had in fact occurred.\n[13] The claimants were asked about the months that they were in XXXX, and how it was that XXXX family, who were allegedly looking to kill the male claimant, had not located them. The male claimant stated that it was because they did not know where his wife's family was from or where they lived. The panel asked the claimant whether or not XXXX family would be able to find out if the claimants were in XXXX, if in fact the brothers of XXXX were making an effort to find the male claimant. He stated that it was possible for them to find out but that Amman is a big city and XXXX is a big township. He then suggested that they would have eventually found him in XXXX. The panel accepts that in the case of a stranger as the agent of persecution, the male claimant's explanation may reasonably explain how they lived for months without being discovered. The panel notes that in this case, XXXX and the male claimant's sister have a connection through marriage, and so it is reasonable to expect that they would be able to find out through these connections who the male claimant is married to and where his wife (the principal claimant) comes from. The panel finds that it does not make sense that they would not have attempted to find the male claimant through the principal claimant's family relations in the months before they left Jordan. The panel draws a negative inference from this.\nDelay in departure from Jordan\n[14] In their BOCs6 the male and principal claimants indicate that they left on XXXX XXXX, 2015, and not sooner as the Mukhtar (village headman) was trying to solve the problem. In the male claimant's BOC narrative7 he provided further details, indicating that he applied for the US visas in late XXXX 2015 because the Mukhtar's attempts were unsuccessful and he knew that it was impossible to stop XXXX family from trying to kill him.\n[15] The panel asked the male claimant about the delay in leaving Jordan until XXXX 2015 despite having visas to the US since XXXX 2015, if in fact XXXX family were looking to kill him. The male claimant stated that it was because at that time they did not have money for the plane tickets and so he had to sell his car and get money together and even then, when he was booking, he waited a month to get a cheaper rate.\n[16] The panel mentioned to the male claimant that in his narrative, he had indicated that he immediately got the ticket and did not mention a delay in getting the money together to travel. The male claimant's explanation for this omission was that he did not know he was supposed to mention these details and only had 10 days to complete the forms. The panel does not find that this reasonably explains the discrepancy between his oral testimony around his delay and his written statements. If financial reasons were the significant factor, it is reasonable to expect this to have been mentioned in the BOC, either in the narrative or in response to question 2(f). The panel finds this to be a hearing room embellishment to explain away the concerns of the panel around the delay in departure. The panel does not find the inconsistency or the delay to have been reasonably explained.\n[17] The panel finds these actions inconsistent with those reasonably expected of individuals whose lives were in peril in Jordan as alleged.\n[18] The panel draws a negative inference as to both subjective fear and the credibility of their allegations from the unreasonable delay in leaving Jordan and the inconsistent testimony provided on the issue.\nFailure to claim in the US\n[19] The claimants have close family ties in Canada and the US and were visiting family in the US for approximately XXXX months before coming to Canada for protection. The male claimant was asked why they did not seek protection in the US, and he indicated that his brother-in-law in\nCanada advised him that Canada could provide the claimants with protection and that he would be able to assist them here in Canada. The male claimant was asked why, since they were already safely in the US, did they not seek protection there, and he stated that he realized that Canada was the better option and that things would be harder for them in the US. The panel notes that under questioning from counsel, it was also suggested that as Muslims there were also concerns about the political climate and the Trump bid for presidency. The male claimant noted however that he and his family did not have problems while in the US, and that he felt generally welcome as a Muslim.\n[20] Although the claimants did come from the US as family exceptions to the Safe Third Country Agreement, the principal claimant does have close family in the US, and so reasonably could have sought protection there. While the panel does not draw a further negative inference from this, the panel finds this consistent with the subjective fear and credibility concerns already identified by the panel.\nMaterial omissions related to the situation with XXXX and her family\n[21] The panel also had concerns with material omissions from their written statements of details related to the situation with XXXX and her family that lies at the heart of their claims.\n[22] In the male claimant's BOC narrative, while XXXX full name is given and reference is made to her husband XXXX, there is no indication that XXXX is anything more than some woman in the neighbourhood that was observed to be having an affair by the male claimant's sister. In oral testimony however, the male claimant indicated that XXXX husband was in fact his sister's XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and so there was a relation between the families. The panel finds this to be a significant detail, and as such finds it reasonable to expect it to have been mentioned by the claimants in their narrative. The panel asked why it was not included in the narrative and the male claimant stated that it was mentioned, but perhaps wrongly translated. The panel notes that the narrative was affirmed to be complete, true, and correct at the outset of the hearing and that an interpreter was used in completing the form. The panel notes that reference is made at least three times in the male claimant's narrative to the husband of XXXX, with no reference of any relation to the male claimant's sister. The panel does not find this omission to have been reasonably explained and as such draws a negative inference from it.\n[23] The male claimant also provided details in his oral testimony about XXXX making her claim against the male claimant to her brothers on XXXX XXXX, 2015. The male claimant was asked why this key detail was not included in his narrative and he indicated that he only had ten days to present his case and so he may have overlooked some details. The panel does not find this to reasonably explain the omission. The panel notes that the male claimant included details about XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, 2015, and so finds it reasonable to expect him to have mentioned the events of XXXX XXXX, given that the reporting by XXXX to her brothers is a significant incident that set the wheels in motion for his problems with the brothers. The panel draws a negative inference from this omission.\n[24] Regarding his XXXX XXXX, 2015, report to the Mukhtar, the male claimant indicated at the hearing that he told the Mukhtar about threats made by the brothers against him. The panel asked why he would have reported being threatened if he had not yet been threatened by anyone. The male claimant stated that it was because he was taking extra precautions. The panel does not find that this reasonably explains the inconsistency in the timing and reporting of the alleged threats and finds this further undermines the credibility of the allegations.\n[25] The principal claimant indicated in her oral testimony that the male claimant's sister had overheard threats made against not just the male claimant, but also his family (i.e. the principal and minor claimants), as she was living in the same building. The panel asked why there was no mention of threats against them in the narrative, and the principal claimant explained that they did not have experience with this and did not know they needed to include minute details. While the panel agrees that minor details may reasonably not make their way into a BOC, this is not a minute detail but a relevant and significant one, as it would be the only mention of a threat made beyond the male claimant. The panel does not find this omission to have been reasonably explained and as such draws a negative inference from it.\nThe claimants' supporting documents\n[26] The claimant did not have any documents available from the court case of XXXX divorce due to her adultery. The panel accepts that the claimant would not reasonably have access to court documents in a case to which he is not a party, and so would not expect him or someone acting on his behalf to be able to request and obtain a document directly from the court. In the circumstances alleged here however, the male claimant's sister is a witness in the court case that involves her husband's family. As such, the panel finds it reasonable for him to have access to some documentation through his sister, given her involvement in the case, such as those documents relating to her being a witness and having to attend court to give her testimony.\n[27] The panel notes that three supporting statements8 were provided from the male claimant's brother, sister, and the Mukhtar. The originals of these documents were not available to the panel as the male claimant said that they were received by email. When asked why he did not ask for the originals, he stated that no one had drawn attention to this matter. The panel notes that Rule 42 of the RPD Rules9 clearly indicates that originals are required, and the claimants are represented by competent counsel who should reasonably have made the claimants aware of this. Despite this concern arising at the hearing, the claimants did not provide the documents post-hearing, although time was granted for other post-hearing disclosure.\n[28] The panel also asked the male claimant whether he still had copies of the email messages to which the documents were said to be attached, and the male claimant indicated that he still had them in his email. He further indicated that these were not provided as his counsel had printed only the attachments and not the email. Like the originals of the documents, these were not provided post-hearing, despite the questions about them at the hearing and the time granted for other post-hearing disclosure.\n[29] The panel finds the lack of originals and proof of receipt to reduce the weight that can be granted to the documents. The panel also had other concerns with the documents, as will be noted below.\n[30] Looking at the statement from the male claimant's brother,10 the panel notes that it is a handwritten, undated letter, and not a sworn statement. The panel notes that it was accompanied\nby pages of the identity page of his brother's passport. The letter gives few details as to the problems, but mentions that he tried to obtain documents from XXXX divorce but was unable because the case is in military court due to XXXX husband being a soldier in the Jordanian army. The panel notes that the country documentation provided by the claimant11 indicates that divorces are adjudicated in religious courts, which is consistent with the information in the National Documentation Package.12 There is nothing in the country documentation before the panel to establish that military courts are involved in divorce proceedings in Jordan, and the panel does not find it to be reasonable that they would. The panel draws a negative inference from this, and finds that it detracts from the weight that can be assigned to the statement from the brother. Given this and the previously noted concerns around the lack of original documents, and lack of evidence of their provenance, the panel gives this document little weight.\n[31] With regard to sister's statement13 the panel notes that it is also an undated personal letter and not an affidavit. When asked about when he requested the letter from his sister, the male claimant was unable to give an indication of when this was. The panel also notes that unlike the brother's statement, it was not accompanied by any supporting identity documents. Given this and the previously noted concerns around the lack of original documents, and lack of evidence of their provenance, the panel gives this document little weight.\n[32] In looking at the statement, the panel notes that while it mentions XXXX making a threat to identify the male claimant as the person with whom she was having an affair, and the sister relaying this to the male claimant, no further details are provided about the situation. As the sister is involved in the trial, and given her relation to XXXX husband as well as her physical proximity to XXXX home (which purportedly allowed her to learn of the XXXX XXXX reporting by XXXX to her brothers), the panel finds it reasonable to expect her to provide a more fulsome statement in support of her brother's claim.\n[33] As to the purported statement from the Mukhtar,14 the panel notes that it is also an undated personal statement. While it bears a stamp at the bottom, this has been translated as \"illegible\", and so the panel cannot ascertain anything from it. The panel also noted to the male claimant that the writer identified himself as the Mukhtar of the XXXX Tribe, whereas the male claimant indicated that he was from the XXXX XXXX clan of the XXXX tribe. The male claimant explained that XXXX was a clan within the larger XXXX tribe. The panel notes that the letter does not mention the XXXX tribe at all, nor the clans of the male claimant or XXXX. The panel finds these to be reasonable details to expect in setting out the situation and the Mukhtar's role.\n[34] The information in the letter from the Mukhtar was not consistent with the male claimant's testimony. In his oral testimony, the male claimant indicated that the whole process involving the Mukhtar took place in less than a month, after which he washed his hands, and advised the claimants to leave the country. The letter from the Mukhtar however states that the attempt at conciliation was from XXXX 2015 until XXXX 2015. When asked about this apparent discrepancy, the male claimant stated that after the month or so of deliberations he went into hiding and made plans to leave the country and so was not sure whether the Mukhtar continued in his efforts. The panel does not find this to be a reasonable explanation as he had stated in oral testimony that he followed what was happening from XXXX and had included in his BOC narrative that the Mukhtar continued in his efforts. The panel draws a negative inference from the male claimant's shifting testimony on the conciliation process and finds that this discrepancy diminishes the weight that can be accorded the Mukhtar's letter. Given this, and the previously noted concerns around the lack of original documents and lack of evidence of their provenance, the panel gives this document little weight.\nReasonableness of the allegations\n[35] The male claimant alleges that he and his family are at risk of honour violence due to a false allegation of adultery levelled against him by a woman who has previously been caught in a relationship with a man outside of marriage. After these allegations were made, her word was taken and rather than face harm herself from this relationship, the male claimant was threatened with death by her family.\n[36] The panel finds it unreasonable that in a patriarchal society in which women are not equal to men before the law,15 that if it were down to XXXX word against the male claimant, that she would be believed over him.\n[37] Also related to the weight given to XXXX allegation, it further does not make sense that given her previous behaviour (an earlier case of her having sex outside of marriage), her word would be given any weight let alone more weight than the male claimant's, as XXXX reputation would have reasonably been tarnished and with it, the reliability of her statements.\n[38] The panel notes as well that the male claimant also had his sister's word in his defence, as she had been witness to XXXX with another man and she had received the threats from XXXX. His sister could reasonably testify as to what she had truly seen and to XXXX subsequent threats and so it does not make sense that any weight would be given to XXXX word in this matter.\n[39] When asked to explain these concerns, the male claimant provided shifting and inconsistent testimony. For example at one point the male claimant stated that XXXX husband really suspects that the male claimant had an affair with XXXX, then when asked why XXXX would be believed over the male claimant's sister, he stated that it was not that he believed XXXX but that he wanted to get rid of her.\n[40] In addition to the previously noted concerns with the allegations, the panel notes as well that the country condition documentation does not support the allegations.\n[41] A Response to Information Request (RIR)16 on the issue of the risk to men in Jordan in cases of illicit affairs, noted that in the country documentation consulted for the RIR, there were only reports of women as victims of so-called honour crimes, not men, although it was noted that\nit was possible that men could also be victims. One source consulted indicated that he had never come across a case in which a man had been killed in an honour crime, as women are generally blamed when an honour crime involves illicit sex. It was also noted that men tend to receive lighter punishments in these types of cases. This was similarly reported in counsel's documentation,17 with it further noted that male victims of honour crimes were rare, and this was usually when the woman was also killed.18\n[42] While counsel provided two articles19 post-hearing referring to incidents in which men were killed in Jordan in 2012, the panel does not find that they relate to the male claimant's situation. One article involves a man being killed by his rape victim's family; as there are no allegations of rape in this case, this is not an individual similarly situated to the claimant. The second article does not mention anything about honour or any improper relationships with women, only that the victim was killed in a personal dispute with no details as to the nature of the dispute; this again does not suggest he was similarly situated to the claimant.\n[43] The panel notes as well that nothing in the country documentation suggests that whole families are targeted for punishment in these situations. While there may be some shame as the wife of an adulterer, and perhaps the same for a child, there is nothing in the neutral country documentation to suggest that this would present the principal or minor claimants with a risk of harm as set out in sections 96 or 97(1) of the IRPA.\n[44] As noted above, the country documentation indicates that women are often killed in so-called honour cases, especially in cases of sex outside of marriage. The male claimant indicated that XXXX was still alive and had not been harmed. It does not make sense that XXXX brothers would want to kill the claimant and leave their sister, the source of the dishonour to the family, unharmed. When asked about this, the male claimant suggested that her brothers were hoping to make money off of her divorce from her husband, but this simply does not make sense. The panel\nasked the male claimant whether her cheating on her husband would negate the obligation in the contract to pay a sum of money for divorce. The male claimant agreed, but noted that if he could not prove betrayal, he would still have to pay and that the lawsuit was ongoing. The panel does not find this reasonable or credible, as XXXX had allegedly confessed to cheating with the male claimant, and so by doing this has acknowledged the betrayal (whether it was truly with the male claimant or another person).\n[45] The panel finds that the claimants' allegations are not consistent with the situation reported in the country condition documentation. The panel draws a negative inference from this.\nGeneral credibility finding\n[46] Given all of the above concerns, the panel finds the principal and male claimants to have been generally not credible. Given the above concerns, the panel finds that the story as a whole lacks the ring of truth.\n[47] The panel finds that it has insufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to establish the allegations in these claims. The panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that XXXX did not threaten the male claimant's sister with false allegations against him; that she has not told anyone that it was with the male claimant that she was having an affair; and that the claimants are not being threatened related to false allegations against the male claimant.\n[48] As the claimants have not established their allegations, on a balance of probabilities, and have not presented any other risk or harm feared in Jordan, the panel finds that there is no serious possibility that the claimants would be persecuted, or that they would be subjected, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture in Jordan.\nCONCLUSION\n[49] In view of all of the above, the panel finds that the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection and therefore rejects their claims.\n[50] These claims are therefore rejected.\n(signed)\n\"J.Wagner\"\nJ.

His allegations are detailed in his Basis of Claim Form (\"BOC\"),2 but I will provide a brief summary.\n[2] The claimant was married in 2008 to a woman whose father is wealthy. The couple has two children. Beginning in 2014, the claimant's father-in-law has tried to destroy his marriage, largely because the father-in-law believes his daughter deserves a more wealthy and successful husband. The father-in-law's intense dislike of the claimant is illogical, and this conflict led to the claimant being depressed. He began going to the mosque in order to obtain peace of mind through praying, and began attending mosque on Fridays beginning in October 2014. When the claimant would travel outside of Uzbekistan, he would visit websites about corruption in politics and religious persecution in his country, and when he returned to Uzbekistan, he would share this information with his friends. On XXXX XXXX, 2014, the claimant had a birthday party for his wife. The father-in-law attended the party and told the claimant that he did not like that the claimant went to the mosque so frequently, and he noted that young men who go to the mosque so frequently are radicals. The father-in-law also complained that the claimant traveled too much and visited too many foreign countries. The father-in-law threatened to call the security service in Uzbekistan and tell them that the claimant was a terrorist.\n[3] In XXXX 2015, the claimant was called to the local mahalla's office. The mahalla chief is a friend of the claimant's father-in-law, and he told the claimant that his father-in-law reported that the claimant had become a radical, that he visited banned websites and that he traveled to many countries. The claimant denied all of these allegations, and the mahalla warned the claimant to stop bringing suspicion upon himself and just make his father-in-law happy. He was told to stop attending the mosque, and that if he continued to attend the mosque and if he grew a beard he would be arrested. The claimant traveled extensively during this time period, with and without his family. In XXXX 2015 the father-in-law took the claimant's wife and children to his house. The claimant went and tried to argue with him, but his father-in-law called the police. When the claimant argued with the police, they told him that his father-in-law had more rights than he did and that they had heard he was a religious fanatic. He was told to avoid problems with his father-in-law. The claimant was trying to relocate to another city within Uzbekistan but discovered he was unable to do so, as his father-in-law had ensured that he would not be able to register into another city. The claimant had a United States (US) visa, and he landed in New York, New York, on XXXX XXXX, 2016. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, he proceeded to the point of entry (POE), where he made his asylum claim. He was able to do so as an exception to the Safe Third Country Agreement due to the fact that he has a brother here in Canada.\n[4] The Minister declined to intervene but provided the biometrics reports for the US and the United Kingdom (UK).3\nISSUES\n[5] There are two issues in this claim:\n1. Has the claimant established his identity as a national of Uzbekistan?\n2. Was the claimant credible?\nHas the claimant established his identity as a national of Uzbekistan?\n[6] I have before me a certified copy of the claimant's passport from Uzbekistan.4 Therefore, on a balance of probabilities, I find the claimant is a national of Uzbekistan.\nWas the claimant credible?\n[7] It is a trite principle of refugee law that when a claimant asserts that certain facts are true I must accept them as true unless I have a valid reason to doubt their veracity. The essence of the claimant's asylum claim is that he has a difficult father-in-law who is making life very troublesome for him in Uzbekistan. These troubles began on XXXX XXXX, 2014, at the claimant's wife's birthday party. However, the claimant's passport undermines this allegation as it indicates that he was in Finland on this date, not in Uzbekistan.5 Additionally, the claimant has submitted very little in the way of supporting documentary evidence regarding the persecution he allegedly faced in Uzbekistan, so I am left with his word about this story. The claimant is a successful businessman in Uzbekistan who has travelled extensively all over the world. I find him to be sophisticated. However, given the paucity of evidence before me about the claimant's travails in Uzbekistan, I am left with the claimant's word and in this case, his actions in light of his alleged fears. I find that his actions are not consistent with someone who is afraid of persecution in Uzbekistan. In particular, the claimant's frequent re-availment back to Uzbekistan and his extensive travel to first world countries without claiming asylum in any of them undermines his allegations of fear back in Uzbekistan. I had many concerns with the claimant's evidence but I will discuss the most glaring.\nThe claimant is accused of being a terrorist\n[8] The claimant's narrative states that on XXXX XXXX, 2015, he was called into the mahalla's office where he was told that his father-in-law had reported to the mahalla that the claimant was \"behaving strangely and he [the father-in-law] says that I have become an Islamic Radical.\"6 By way of background, according to Freedom House's Freedom in the World 2014 report on Uzbekistan, the mahalla's are local neighborhood committees that wield much power in that country:\nOpen and free private discussion is limited by the mahalla committees, traditional neighborhood organizations that the government has turned into an official system for public surveillance and control.7\n[9] I take from the claimant's narrative that his father-in-law told the mahalla that the claimant had become a radical. A letter from the claimant's father, adduced on the day of the hearing states that the claimant's father-in-law, \"reported to our Mahala that my son is behaving like an Islamic extremist, that my son imports prohibited propaganda into Uzbekistan and that my son agitates others to be against the government.\"8 I asked him if either the mahalla or his father-in-law accused him of being a radical or a terrorist. He replied no, that they did not accuse him, but they said they could call the security services and say that the claimant had joined a terrorist group. This is not consistent with the information in his narrative, or in the letter from his father and I therefore asked him for an explanation for this inconsistency. The claimant said \"that person hates me and for that reason he just says that.\" This answer is non-responsive. The claimant has either been accused of being a radical or a terrorist, or he has not. I do not know why he denied this at the hearing but it is contradictory to his BOC and his response was not reasonable. This undermines his credibility. It also limits the weight I can assign to the letter from the claimant's father.\n[10] In addition, when taking into account the implications of being accused of being a radical in Uzbekistan, the claimant's later actions become even more incomprehensible. I have carefully considered the National Documentation Package (NDP) for Uzbekistan in reaching this decision and have reviewed the annual report of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) for 2015 where it states the following about those individuals who step outside the state's severe limits on practicing their religion:\nThe Uzbek government continued its decade-long policy of arresting and imprisoning, some for as long as 20-year terms, individuals who reject state control over religious practice or for their suspected religious affiliation. Many are denied due process and are tortured; some are detained in psychiatric hospitals. Observers estimate that upwards of 12,000 Uzbek Muslims are in jail on these related charges. In 2013, approximately 200 religious believers were arrested, according to the Uzbek Initiative Group of Independent Human Rights Defenders. The government claims that many detainees are associated with extremist groups that it labels \"Wahhabi\" or \"jihadist,\" but often without evidence of use or advocacy of violence.9\n[11] This is very sobering information, and I would therefore expect that someone who was accused of possibly being a radical by a mahalla might be sufficiently worried about his options for leaving the country. The USCIRF also states the following:\nWhile Uzbekistan faces security threats from groups using violence in the name of religion, the government has arbitrarily used vague anti-extremism laws against peaceful religious adherents and others who pose no credible security threat.10\n[12] The interaction with the mahalla allegedly occurred in XXXX of 2015. After this date, the claimant travelled to the United Kingdom (with his family), South Korea, New Zealand, Italy (for a cruise with friends) and the United States. Moreover, he returned to Uzbekistan after every trip. I find the claimant's actions to be inconsistent with his stated fear. Counsel has also provided me with a Uzbek-German Forum for Human Rights and Human Rights Alliance report on Uzbekistan which states the following:\nDistrict police maintain detailed lists of religious people and regularly force them to report to the police station for questioning, to describe their activities, or to sign statements promising to inform police of their whereabouts and activities. In recent years, authorities have intensified this surveillance and monitoring of religious people, particularly independent Muslims.11\n[13] The claimant appears to have been subjected to no such monitoring or surveillance, even though the local mahalla allegedly believed him to be a radical Muslim. Instead, the claimant was permitted to leave and return to Uzbekistan on many occasions after the mahalla was made aware of his views. I find therefore that these interactions with the mahalla did not occur as described, if at all, nor has the claimant come to the attention of the government of Uzbekistan. In addition, I find that the claimant's assertions contradict the NDP and counsel's own disclosure, and I prefer the more neutral evidence contained in the documentary evidence. I also find that the claimant has lied about being identified as a possible radical in Uzbekistan by his vengeful father-in-law. This undermines the claimant's credibility on a material point.\nThe claimant does not tell the truth about his visa applications\n[14] The claimant completed forms when he made his asylum claim at the POE.12 In his Schedule A - Background\/Declaration (IMM 5669) form, he was asked whether he had ever \"been refused ... an immigrant or permanent resident visa ... or visitor or temporary resident visa, to Canada or any other country?\"13 The claimant indicated that he was \"[r]efused Temporary Visitor Visa twice in Canada - in 2012 and 2014[.] South Korea rejected my application in 2008 or 2009.\"14 The panel obtained both his Canadian Temporary Resident Visa (TRV) application15 and a biometrics match from the UK.16 The biometric information from the UK indicates that he was refused a visa to the UK in 2009 and a biometrics match from the US indicates that the claimant applied for visas to that country seven times between the years 2009 and 2015.17 I asked the claimant if he had been refused US visas at any point and he said he had been refused five or six times. I asked him why he had not indicated that he had been refused US visas on many occasions and a UK visa at least once when completing his forms at the POE. He replied \"I think I did not understand when I was filling the form.\" This claimant is not an unsophisticated traveler. Indeed, his passport is filled with evidence of extensive international travel, as will be discussed below. If anyone understands the meaning of being rejected or accepted for a visa, it is this particular claimant. In addition, at the time of making his claim, the claimant made a correction to his IMM 5669 form, changing the dates when he was refused a Canadian TRV. I find therefore that not only did he understand the forms he was completing, but also he was concerned enough about it to go back and make a correction to his form. This therefore leads me to the conclusion that the claimant was deliberately trying to obfuscate his travel history from Canadian immigration authorities. This can do nothing but undermine his credibility.\nThe claimant's actions undermine his assertions of fear\n[15] Subjective fear relates to the existence of a fear of harm in the mind of the claimant. The objective basis requires there to be a valid basis for the fear.18 Both subjective fear and an objective basis for it are crucial elements for a claim to succeed under section 96 of IRPA. In Kamana,19 Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer held that the panel's finding that the claimant had not credibly established the subjective element was reasonable and:\nThe lack of evidence going to the subjective element of the claim is a fatal flaw which in and of itself warrants dismissal of the claim, since both elements of the refugee definition-subjective and objective-must be met.\n[16] Failure to seek the protection of another country which is also a signatory to the Refugee Convention may be a significant factor to consider but is not in itself determinative. Voluntarily leaving a country where one could safely live is another example of behaviour that can cast doubt on a claimant's subjective fear. Indeed, the Federal Court has also consistently found that re-availment to the jurisdiction where a claimant fears harm undermines allegations of fear, and can be determinative.20 As Mr. Justice Crampton said in Kostrzewa v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration):\nAs has been repeatedly held by this Court, a refugee claimant's reavailment to the jurisdiction in which he or she fears persecution or a type of harm contemplated by section 97 of the IRPA seriously undermines allegations of subjective fear, particularly in the absence of a compelling reason for such reavailment (Hernandez v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 197 (CanLII) at para 21; Ortiz Garcia v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2011 FC 1346 (CanLII) at para 8; Mughal v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FC 1557 (CanLII) at paras 33-35; Natynczyk v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2004 FC 914 (CanLII) at para 69).21\n[17] The claimant in this case has failed to claim asylum in a number of safe countries and continually re-availed to Uzbekistan, which strongly undermines his assertions of a fear in his country. I will explain further below.\nThe claimant travels and returns to Uzbekistan multiple times\n[18] This is one of those unique cases where the actions of the claimant so strongly undermine his assertions of fear that it becomes determinative of the claim. The claimant has travelled extensively. I will provide a brief summary of his travels in the last several years, taken from his passport, issued in XXXX of 2014, after his alleged difficulties with his father-in-law began:\n* New Zealand: XXXX2015\n* South KoreaXXXX XXXX 2014, XXXX 2015, XXXX 2015\n* Finland: XXXX XXXX XXXX 2014\n* United Kingdom: XXXX 2014, XXXX 2015\n* Italy: XXXX 2015\n* United States: XXXX 2015, XXXX 2016\n[19] It is of critical importance to note that the claimant returned to Uzbekistan after every single one of these trips except the one to the US in XXXX of 2016. I asked the claimant why he kept returning to Uzbekistan and he replied it was because his family was back in Uzbekistan and he did not want to leave them. While I can understand this motivation, I find it more difficult to reconcile when considered against the incredibly harsh and oppressive actions of the Uzbek government against individuals with the profile that the claimant would have me believe he possesses. I asked the claimant why he did not claim asylum in the UK when he was there with his family in XXXX of 2015. He replied that the family had a terrific time in the UK, his father-in-law had calmed down and he was not thinking about claiming asylum in the UK at that time. The claimant also testified that he was able to freely go to the mosque in the UK and attended one in XXXX. Part of the claimant's asylum claim is that he is not able to practice his Muslim faith in the way that he wishes to in Uzbekistan and without the unwanted interference of his father-in-law. He also alleges his fear that the mahalla believe he is a radical Islamist. The claimant was in the UK, where he was allegedly freely practicing his chosen religion without difficulty, with his family, and he chose not to claim asylum there but instead returned to Uzbekistan where his father-in-law resides and allegedly wields a large amount of power, and where the mahalla was ostensibly keeping a close eye on him due to his radical views. I do not accept the claimant's account of events as credible, given his actions and the country conditions I referred to earlier. Taking into account the foregoing and the claimant's not credible evidence about his claim coupled with the claimant's lack of the requisite subjective fear, leads me to find that his claim fails under section 96 of IRPA. I also find that the claimant's allegations to not be credible on a balance of probabilities and I find that his claim fails under section 97(1) of IRPA, as well.\n[20] As for the claimant's assertions that he is a devout Muslim and that he cannot practice his religion in his country freely, I do not accept that the claimant is as devout as he would have me believe and I reject this element of his claim as well. He has submitted a letter from a mosque in Canada attesting to his religiosity and I find that he has attended mosque here in Canada, however, this is not convincing or persuasive evidence that the claimant's religion led to difficulties for him back in Uzbekistan.\n[21] As a result of my credibility findings above, and the claimant's lack of a reasonable explanation as to why he would leave many countries of safety to return to a country of alleged danger, I find that the claimant's allegedly self-endangering actions belie his fear and make his motivations suspect. His claim fails under both sections 96 and 97 of IRPA.\nCONCLUSION\n[22] I find the claimant to not be credible and to have fabricated a refugee claim where none exists. Therefore, there is not a serious possibility of persecution, and the claimant would not be subjected personally, on a balance of probabilities, to a risk to life, a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture, should he return to Uzbekistan. Accordingly, the claimant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.\n[23] The claim is rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Catherine Gaudet\"\nCatherine Gaudet\nMay 26, 2016\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 as amended.\n2 Exhibit 2.\n3 Exhibit 8.\n4 Exhibit 1.\n5 Exhibit 1.\n6 Exhibit 2, BOC narrative at para 32.\n7 Exhibit 3, National Documentation Package (NDP) for Uzbekistan (17 July 2015), item 2.3.\n8 Exhibit 9.\n9 Ibid., item 12.2, at p. 78.\n10 Ibid., at p. 77.\n11 Exhibit 4, at p. 17.\n12 Exhibit 1.\n13 Ibid., Schedule A - Background\/Declaration IMM 5669 form, at p. 1.\n14 Ibid.\n15 Exhibit 6.\n16 Exhibit 5.\n17 Exhibit 8.\n18 Rajudeen, Zahirdeen v.

All three Claimants are claiming refugee protection pursuant to Section 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.3 I will herein periodically refer to the Claimants together as \"the Family.\"\nDETERMINATION\n[4] For the reasons that follow, I find that XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX have not established that there is a serious possibility on a Convention ground, or that on a balance of probabilities, they would each personally be subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if they were to return to Turkey.\nALLEGATIONS\n[5] The Family's allegations are set out in the Basis of Claim forms4 and were elaborated upon in oral testimony. The Family bases their respective claims on their Alevi-Kurdish ethnicity and participation in leftist political life in Turkey. XXXX XXXX also alleges that his membership in a large, anti-government union exposes him to risk. XXXX XXXX also alleges that her ex-husband, the minor Claimant XXXX father, has threatened to kill her. The Family alleges that they and their house were targeted by Daesh because of their Alevi faith. Both Mr. and Mrs. XXXX allege that due to their attendance at various pro-Kurdish political activities beginning in 1991, they have each suffered detentions and harsh treatment from the Turkish police. This treatment continued episodically until the family fled Turkey on XXXX XXXX, 2016. The Family claimed refugee status in Canada on or about July XXXX, 2016.\nANALYSIS OF ISSUES\n[6] The determinative issue in these claims is credibility.\nPersonal and National Identities are Established\n[7] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX are each nationals of Turkey. They provided copies of their Turkish passports5 and Nufus (National Identity Cards)6 to establish their personal and national identities.\nIdentity as Supporters of the HDP is Established\n[8] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX were mild supporters of the HDP. Mrs. XXXX provided a donation receipt to the HDP from 20167 and Mr. XXXX provided photographs of him attending an HDP event.8 I note that Mr. XXXX was not able to identify the HDP MP that was elected at the congress at which he was photographed and that he simply knew that this MP was a lawyer.\nMr. XXXX Identity as a KESK Union Member is Established\n[9] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that Mr. XXXX is a member of the KESK union in Turkey. He provided a copy of his union dues statement,9 as well as photographs of him attending an HDP\/KESK union event.10\nMr. XXXX Identity as a Person of Kurdish Ethnicity is Established\n[10] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that Mr. XXXX is of Kurdish ethnicity, as established by his testimony and a letter from the Toronto Kurdish Community & Information Centre which corroborated his Kurdish ethnicity.11 Mrs. XXXX did not provide a similar letter, despite her claiming to also be of Kurdish ethnicity. Aside from her testimony, there is little else to establish that she is of Kurdish ethnicity. Given the concerns with Mrs. XXXX credibility in the reasons that follow, I am not prepared to find that she is of Kurdish ethnicity on the basis of her testimony alone.\nThe Family has Not Established Their Alevi Faith\n[11] Mrs. XXXX provided an undated letter from the Alevi Cultural Association in Turkey to corroborate her allegation that she is of the Alevi faith. The original copy of the letter had what appeared to be an ink signature, but was otherwise photocopied, and poorly so.12 On a balance of probabilities, I find that this letter is not a genuine document and I ascribe no weight to its contents. The only other evidence that the family is of the Alevi faith is the respective testimonies of Mr. and Mrs. XXXX, which due to credibility concerns outlined below, causes me to find that on a balance of probabilities, the family is not of the Alevi faith.\nMr. and Mrs. XXXX Actions Are Inconsistent with Their Testimony\n[12] Mr. and Mrs. XXXX both testified that they are afraid to return to Turkey. They stated that they are afraid of being detained, jailed and mistreated by Turkish authorities, as they both have experienced this mistreatment in the past.\nDetentions\n[13] Mr. XXXX alleges that he was detained and\/or severely mistreated by Turkish police on XXXX XXXX, 1991 while attending a Newroz event. He was detained overnight and beaten. In XXXXXXXX, 2014 while at a protest, he was detained again and alleged that \"[the Turkish police] tied my hands and feet and beat me mercilessly.\" He was released after one night. On XXXX XXXX, 2016 after giving a speech at an event XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, he was detained by plainclothes police officers and subjected to \"psychological torture\" and was threatened with death. Finally, at a protest against the resettlement of Syrian refugees in XXXX, 2016, Mr. XXXX was beaten by police truncheons and affected by tear gas.\n[14] Mrs. XXXX alleges that she was detained and severely mistreated by Turkish police, including being sexually assaulted in 1999. She allegedly developed XXXX and XXXX as a result of this event. She was injured again while attending the aforementioned protest against the resettlement of Syrian refugees in XXXX, 2016, at which time she alleges that she lost consciousness due to the tear gas.\n[15] The entire family attended the XXXX 2016 protest, including the 10 year-old Claimant, XXXX, who was allegedly hit by a police truncheon and affected by tear gas.\n[16] Mr. and Mrs. XXXX both continued to attend political events in Turkey when they knew that they were at risk of severe treatment by the Turkish authorities. Mr. XXXX alleged that he was threatened with death by the Turkish authorities in XXXX 2016, but still attended a protest with his entire family three months later. Mrs. XXXX alleged that her 1999 detention caused her to develop major medical issues, yet she also attended the protest in XXXX 2016. It is reasonable to infer that given both of the adult Claimants' purported histories with Turkish authorities, that the possibility of severe physical harm, psychological harm, sexual assault and detention would be a very real possibility faced by protestors. Nevertheless, the entire family attended the protest in XXXX 2016.\n[17] When I asked why they would put their son at risk by attending a protest with a child, the adult Claimants responded that they did not suspect that this protest would become violent. Further, they had no childcare available to them that day and there were other protestors who attended with children who were even younger.\n[18] Mr. and Mrs. XXXX actions are not consonant with people who have a genuine fear for their safety. After each experiencing severe physical harm, psychological harm, sexual assault and detention at the hands of Turkish authorities, a reasonable person who purports to fear further, similar treatment, would leave the country, or at the very least not attend an event which could expose them or their child to continued brutal treatment.\n[19] Due to their attendance at the protest in 2016, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that Mr. and Mrs. XXXX alleged prior treatment at the hands of the Turkish authorities was not as harsh as they purport it to be, if it occurred at all. This is evidenced by their actions which speak to their lack of subjective fear. Due to the fact that they testified that they did have fear, I draw a negative inference with regard to their credibility.\nAttendance at Political Events\n[20] Mr. XXXX stated that he worked as a XXXX XXXX in the Turkish Health Department. He stated his duties involved XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He provided a copy of his government worker identification in support of this.13\n[21] Mr. XXXX stated that he is a member of the KESK union, which is the umbrella organization for another series of smaller unions, each related to government workers. This is a voluntary membership and he pays dues to the union. The union is large: apparently with approximately 100,000 members and purportedly is leftist, anti-government in its positions.\n[22] Mr. XXXX was a Turkish government employee. He was also purportedly an anti-government protestor and provided written and oral evidence of his attendance at anti-government rallies. If his attendance at such rallies and resultant detentions is to be believed, then he knowingly risked his job and potentially life for the causes which those rallies or gatherings supported. I asked Mr. XXXX how he could be a government employee involved in anti-government activities, he stated that he kept his political activities discrete. In fact, he stated that he was not a member of the HDP, but rather only a supporter, since it was illegal for him to be a member of an opposition party.\n[23] This testimony is inconsistent with other aspects of Mr. XXXX claim. He stated that he was part of a union with a strong anti-government stance and he provided a document which shows his name as a due-paying member.14 Documentary evidence of membership in an anti-government organization is not consistent with keeping political views discrete. Nor is Mr. XXXX attendance at political events which led to him being detained and mistreated by police. Not only was he purportedly detained three times by police, during which detentions the police photographed, fingerprinted and documented Mr. XXXX, he was also purportedly at the forefront of certain political events, such as his allegation that he gave a speech XXXX XXXX XXXX to 100 people at a vigil for the XXXX XXXX XXXX Neither a police detention in which Mr. XXXX personal information was logged nor a speech to a large crowd XXXX XXXX XXXX is consistent with keeping political activities discrete.\n[24] Further, when I asked Mr. XXXX about his injuries after being released from police detention, he stated that he had been beaten very badly. I asked if he sought medical attention for his injuries. He stated that he did not, and that he feared that his attendance at a hospital might lead to his political involvement being discovered by authorities, thereby leading to the loss of his job as a government employee. This response, again, did not make coherent sense, given Mr. XXXX allegedly very visible political actions, his various police detentions in which he was identified and his voluntary membership in an anti-government union.\n[25] There was no reasonable explanation for why Mr. XXXX considered some of his activities to be risky and others not. He claimed to keep his political activities discrete, but was at the forefront of open-air gatherings and was allegedly repeatedly detained by Turkish police. These inconsistencies caused me to doubt the veracity of much of what Mr. XXXX alleged was his political conduct in Turkey. Given that he did not provide any reasonable or intelligible explanations for the inconsistencies noted above, I draw a negative inference about his general credibility.\nMrs. XXXX' Ex-Husband Does Not Pose a Threat to the Family\n[26] Mrs. XXXX alleges that she married XXXX father in 2000 and divorced him in 2010. XXXX was born in 2005 and the adult Claimants were married in XXXX, 2016. Mrs. XXXX allegedly experienced years of violence at the hands of her ex-husband, and stated that both she and Mr. XXXX have received death threats from him up until the time they fled Turkey. She stated that he is an alcoholic and a psychopath and was set on ruining her life. The adult Claimants stated that they sought the assistance of police in XXXX 2016, but the police refused to intervene. There is no documentary evidence of the Family having approached the police. I asked if the Family had considered retaining a lawyer to assist in creating protection for them, and they replied that they had not as it could lead to a 'blood feud.'\n[27] Mrs. XXXX stated that she had custody of XXXX and that XXXX father was only allowed to see XXXX if XXXX wanted to see him, which he did not, as XXXX was also subjected to physical violence by this man.\n[28] XXXX, the minor Claimant, accompanied Mr. and Mrs. XXXX to Canada for the purpose of making a refugee claim. The Family provided a copy of the Consent executed by Mrs. XXXX ex-husband to allow his son to travel internationally.15 I examined the original copy of the Consent and am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that it is a genuine document.\n[29] I asked Mrs. XXXX why a person who was set on ruining the lives of his ex-wife and son would ever consent to anything asked by her. Withholding consent for international travel would be an ideal way to continue to victimize a former spouse. Mrs. XXXX responded that XXXX father realized that if he did not consent, the adult Claimants would leave Turkey and leave XXXX in his care. Since XXXX father was unable or unwilling to care for XXXX, this duty would fall on his mother, XXXX grandmother. XXXX grandmother was allegedly unable or unwilling to care for XXXX, so XXXX father was forced to sign the consent for travel.\n[30] This explanation lacks any rational sense. The adult Claimants cannot allege that their son is in life-threatening danger at the hands of both his father and the Turkish authorities, yet also imply that they were prepared to leave XXXX behind in Turkey with one those agents of persecution. I also note that such a suggestion, along with the fact that the adult Claimants brought XXXX to a violent protest, makes it very difficult to accept that Mrs. XXXX fully appreciated her role as Designated Representative of her son at the hearing.\n[31] On the basis that there is no documentary evidence to show that the minor Claimant's biological father consented to the minor Claimant possibly being removed from Turkey permanently, the Refugee Protection Division advised the Minister in writing after the hearing of a possible violation of the Hague Convention. The Minister did not respond to the Division.\n[32] I also asked why the family did not simply move cities to escape from Mrs. XXXX abusive ex-husband. They responded that he would continue to find them and that since he needed to be in XXXX life, they needed to remain close to this person. This statement is at odds with Mrs. XXXX statement that she has custody of XXXX and due to prior abuse, XXXX was scared of seeing his father.\n[33] It is highly unlikely that Mrs. XXXX account of why XXXX father signed the consent for XXXX international travel occurred for the reasons she stated it did. Due to the Family's unwillingness to pursue legal action to protect themselves from the threat of violence or death from XXXX father; the Family's failure to relocate to escape the threat of violence or death from XXXX father and the lack of any other corroborating evidence to show that the family experienced a threat from XXXX father, I find, on a balance of probabilities that XXXX father does not pose the threat to the Family which they allege he does. I find that this element of the Family's claim is at least embellished, if not outright false, and that the family included it to bolster their claims for protection. I draw a negative inference regarding the Family's credibility as a result.\nMrs. XXXX Was Not Targeted by Daesh\n[34] The Family alleges in their narrative that at some time in 2012 or 2013, members of Daesh marked Mrs. XXXX house with a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and threatened her with death. This was done to approximately XXXX XXXX XXXX her area, purportedly as a result of the homes' inhabitants being Alevi Kurds. Mrs. XXXX was not married to Mr. XXXX at that time. In her oral testimony, Mrs. XXXX stated that she and her neighbours went to their local 'Headman' who resolved the issue with Daesh by going to the province. When I asked how this threat to her, her son and her neighbourhood was extinguished, Mrs. XXXX stated that she did not know. It was simply dealt with.\n[35] I found Mrs. XXXX explanation wanting, as it seems reasonable to assume that a person who is facing such a threat, only to have that threat lifted, would want to know exactly how that happened. This is particularly so when that threat comes from such a well-known, vicious terrorist organization, like Daesh. Mrs. XXXX simply repeated that the Headman dealt with it. She also stated that in 2014 she moved to an apartment.\n[36] The foregoing is another example of how the adult Claimants' testimony was lacking in coherent, reasonable explanations to questions I posed. I could not understand how a threat from Daesh was apparently so easily dispatched by the local Headman and how Mrs. XXXX did not seem to require any further details about how that threat was averted. This confusing testimony and lack of clear explanation to straightforward questioning causes me to draw a negative inference regarding her credibility.\nThe Family's Medical\/Psychotherapy Reports Do Not Rehabilitate the Foregoing Credibility Concerns\/Findings\n[37] Both adult Claimants submitted psychotherapy reports in support of their claims.16 The minor Claimant submitted a psychiatric report.17\n[38] The adult Claimant's psychotherapy reports each noted that they suffer from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Contrary to his report, Mr. XXXX did not appear to have any difficulty in testifying at the hearing, as he purportedly had during the one-hour interview with the psychotherapist. MrsXXXX XXXX, however, did have an episode of distress early in the first of the two hearings: she began hyperventilating and yelling and Mr. XXXX poured an entire bottle of water on her head and neck in the hearing room. They refused my offer to summon medical assistance, saying that she simply needed to take medication. Mr. XXXX provided Mrs. XXXX a pill and we recessed the hearing for half an hour. When we returned, Mrs. XXXX was collegial and calm, as though nothing ever happened. We continued for the remainder of the hearing and for another half-day hearing without further incident. After this episode, Mrs. XXXX affect was similar to her husband's in that she was calm and without the external indicia of psychological or emotional discomfort, despite prolonged questioning on sensitive issues. Neither adult Claimant requested any accommodation during the hearing and neither appeared to have difficulty testifying. I therefore place little weight on the psychotherapy reports submitted, at least insofar as those reports suggested that the adult Claimants may have difficulty testifying at their hearing. There is nothing to suggest that their testimony was affected in any way.\nResidual profile\n[39] Mr. XXXX is of Kurdish ethnicity. I accept that Kurdish people in Turkey face discrimination and harassment and in some cases persecution. A number of documents in evidence with regard to Turkey country conditions outline the difficulties Kurdish people face, particularly in the southeast of Turkey. I do not find, however, that every Kurdish person in Turkey or every Kurdish person in a particular area of Turkey faces persecution due to ethnicity alone.\n[40] The United Kingdom (UK) Operational Guidance Note at 1.18 of the National Documentation Package states:\nEven when taken cumulatively the discrimination faced by Kurds does not in general amount to them being subject to action on the part either of the populace or the authorities which would amount to persecution within the terms of the Refugee Convention or otherwise inhuman or degrading treatment.18\n[41] Consequently, Mr. XXXX residual profile as a person of Kurdish ethnicity is not sufficient to ground a claim in refugee protection.\n[42] Mr. XXXX is a member of the KESK union. Following the same analysis as above, I find that simply being a member of this particular union is insufficient to ground a claim in refugee protection. There was no evidence before me to show that all the members of the union were under threat by virtue of their membership.\nCONCLUSION\n[43] I find that XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX have not established, on a balance of probabilities, the factual basis for their alleged fears that they would be persecuted or harmed in Turkey. Based on their alleged actions and inconsistent testimony, they have not established, on a balance of probabilities, that they have a subjective fear of persecution and the cumulative negative credibility findings noted above lead to the adult Claimants' overall impugned credibility.\n[44] Having considered all the evidence, and based on the above analysis, I find that the Family has not established that they face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground upon return to Turkey. I also find that the Family has not established, on a balance of probabilities, that they will face a danger of torture or a risk to his life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, upon return to Turkey.\n[45] I therefore reject the Family's claim pursuant to both s. 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\n(signed)\n\"E.McMonagle\"\nE.McMonagle\nNovember 30, 2016\nDate\n1 Refugee Protection Division Rules (SOR\/2012-256), Rule 55.\n2 Refugee Protection Division Rules (SOR\/2012-256), Rule 20.\n3 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, as amended, sections 96 and 97(1).\n4 Exhibit 2-4 (inclusive).\n5 Exhibit 1.\n6 Ibid.\n7 Exhibit 7.\n8 Ibid.\n9 Ibid.\n10 Ibid.\n11 Exhibit 11.\n12 Exhibit 7.\n13 Exhibit 6.\n14 Exhibit 7.\n15 Exhibit 13.\n16 Exhibit 10.\n17 Exhibit 12.\n18 Exhibit 5, National Documentation Package (NDP) for Turkey (30 June 2016) Item 1.18, Country Information and Guidance.

Also claiming with her is her daughter XXXX XXXX, in respect of whom Ms. XXXX acts as Designated Representative. They are citizens of Iran. XXXX XXXX was excused at the outset of the proceeding, due to her young age, and her mother's preference in that regard. The claimant has family in Canada, and previously submitted an economic immigrant application which was rejected in 2012. This visit in 2016 is her second visit to Canada on a legally acquired Temporary Resident Visa; her first visit to Canada was in 2014. The claimants have made a claim for refugee protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act1 (IRPA). The hearing was conducted on September 30, 2016.\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The claimant alleges that she is a licensed XXXX. She alleges that she is wanted by agents of the Iranian state as a result of her conversion to Christianity, and also because she performed a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on a young woman, whose family, the claimant alleges, wishes to kill her. She alleges that before performing the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, she voluntarily and from memory recited passages from the Bible with this young woman, in an attempt to comfort her. She alleges that very shortly after her recent trip to Canada to visit her sister, her husband was threatened by family members of this woman who were looking for the claimant. She alleges that her husband was then summoned to court, where the authorities played an audio recording of her reciting the said Bible verses with the young woman upon whom she is alleged to have performed the XXXX procedure.\nIDENTITY\n[3] The panel accepts that the claimants are citizens of Iran.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] The panel finds that the claimants have not established that there is a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, or, on a balance of probabilities, that they would personally be subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to their lives or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment upon return to Iran. The panel's reasons are as follows.\nANALYSIS\n[5] The issue in this claim is credibility as it pertains to:\n(a) The absence of corroborating documents, particularly with respect to the medical procedure the claimant is alleged to have performed, and the letter placed in her Human Resources file which allegedly included a negative report regarding her interest in Christianity;\n(b) The claimant's lack of relevant medical knowledge and inability to explain the XXXX XXXX she alleges having performed;\n(c) The claimant's alleged mystical experience in Iran;\n(d) The alleged XXXX, the alleged angry relatives, and the alleged state enquiries; and\n(e) A sur place claim.\nCredibility: Absence of corroborating documents\n[6] The panel asked the claimant for the records with respect to the XXXX she is alleged to have performed. She had none. She indicated that the practise in her office is to keep no records of a medical procedure unless a general anesthetic is administered.\n[7] The panel suggested to the claimant that her answer was problematic; the panel suggested that, as a XXXX, she would have been required to maintain some form of record of a XXXX XXXX, such as the one she alleged having performed. The claimant maintained that this was not so. For clarity, she did not allege that she deliberately kept no record of the procedure. Rather, she alleged that standard practise in Iran is to keep no records of medical procedures that do not entail a general anesthetic.\n[8] Iran has a functional health care system. The panel takes judicial notice of the fact that the practise of medicine and related disciplines cannot function if clear and consistent records are not made and kept. The claimant alleged that most recently she worked in a clinic with other medical practitioners. The claimant's allegation that it is common in Iran for no records to be kept of medical procedures that do not involve a general anesthetic is not credible. The panel draws an adverse credibility inference against the claimant in this regard.\nHuman Resources letter\n[9] The claimant alleges that she had to leave a job working in a hospital because the hospital administrator had become aware of her interest in Christianity. Her Basis of Claim Form (BOC) describes this event as follows:\nEventually, I had to leave my workplace following numerous mental and verbal harassments and my work record permanently included a letter that described my work history and involvement with Christianity which prevented me from being hired in the government sector.2\n[10] The panel asked to see this letter. The claimant said she did not have it, but that it was placed in her file. The panel asked why she was not given a copy. The claimant was evasive. Eventually she said that this letter did not actually say anything about her being a Christian, it simply referred to \"un-Islamic\" conduct because of someone she was seen sharing food with. I asked the claimant why her BOC alleged that the letter, and the allegation of the circumstances surrounding her departure from the hospital job, made reference to her \"involvement with Christianity.\" The claimant offered no cogent reply to this inconsistency. The panel makes a negative credibility finding in this regard.\nCredibility: The claimant's lack of relevant medical knowledge and inability to explain the XXXX XXXX she alleges having performed\n[11] The claimant alleges that she is a XXXX who has XXXX XXXX XXXX. Item 4 of Exhibit 6 purports to be the claimant's XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. However, the claimant's face cannot be read from the photograph, which is blurred. She claims to have worked in a hospital and, most recently, in a private clinic with a variety of other medical professionals.\n[12] The claimant alleged that on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2016 she performed XXXX XXXX on a woman to, in the words of the BOC, \"return her virginity.\"3 The claimant stated at the hearing that prior to performing the procedure, in an effort to comfort her client, she recited some Bible passages from memory.\n[13] The panel asked the claimant to explain the procedure. The claimant stated that she used thread to \"put together the tissues that have been damaged or fell apart.\"\n[14] The claimant stated that this was only the second time that she had performed the procedure.\n[15] The claimant submitted documents suggesting that she was a licensed XXXX.4 The panel asked the claimant if she had studied relevant anatomy in the context of her training to become a XXXX. She stated that she had. The panel then asked the claimant to name the bodily organ or tissue that she claims to have stitched together in the context of her BOC narrative. She could not name the organ which in English is called the XXXX. Her own lawyer attempted to elicit this from her during his questioning, but the claimant did not possess the basic anatomical knowledge required to give even a simple description XXXX XXXX XXXX she alleges having performed. The panel makes a negative credibility finding against the claimant for this reason. Even if the panel were to accept the claimant's allegation that this was only the second time she had performed the procedure, it is reasonable to expect her to be able to explain the procedure, and name the relevant anatomy.\n[16] Accordingly, the panel finds that the claimant has never performed a XXXX, and that the XXXX the claimant is alleged to have performed on XXXX XXXX, 2016 did not happen.\nCredibility: The claimant's alleged mystical experience in Iran\n[17] One of the factors indicated by the claimant in the story of her alleged conversion to Christianity involved a special experience she had in March, 2016. One night she was in her bedroom, lying on her bed, while her husband watched television in the next room. In her room there was a mirror mounted on a statue of the Virgin Mary holding the baby Jesus. Suddenly the statue began to glow with a blue light. At the same time this happened, she heard audibly in the room where she lay what she describes in her BOC as \"angelic music.\"5 She said this reinforced her belief in Christianity.\n[18] The panel discussed this incident with the claimant in some detail.\n[19] The claimant's BOC,6 BOC amendment,7 and testimony, asserted that she had hidden her interest in Christianity from her husband her entire life. The claimant stated that she had a good relationship with her husband and that they communicated well, but that she felt she had to keep her interest in Christianity a secret from him. The panel then asked why she had a statue of Mary and Jesus in the bedroom she shared with her husband. The panel put to the claimant the inconsistency between the presence in her home of this statue and the strong emphasis she had placed in her written materials and at the hearing upon the secrecy of her Christian faith. She dismissed that as a simple aesthetic preference for the object and suggested that in a typical Iranian family it would be perfectly normal. The panel finds this answer does explain the inconsistency. The claimant stated that she lived in a Muslim environment at home for many years, in which she had to hide her interest in Christianity. The presence in her home of a Christian statue is not consistent with that allegation. The panel makes a negative credibility finding in this regard.\n[20] The panel then asked the claimant, when the statue began to glow and the music sounded in the room, why did she not run to fetch her husband from the next room where he was watching television, to witness what was happening.\n[21] The claimant said that she did, but that the moment her foot hit the floor there was an earthquake, and the glowing light and music stopped. Then her husband came rushing in to make sure she was okay. She claims that she told him about the blue statue and music, but in the aftermath of the earthquake he dismissed the notion as silliness. I asked the claimant if the earthquake was reported the following day in the news. She claimed that indeed it was. The panel then attempted to correlate the alleged earthquake with the month of March, 2016 in order to ascertain the date of this remarkable allegation. The claimant then said that it would not be possible, because earthquakes are so common in her part of Iran, in fact they happen all the time. The panel draws an adverse credibility inference from this inconsistency of the claimant, from suggesting first that the date of the earthquake could be ascertained, to immediately denying the possibility of same.\n[22] The panel finds these answers of the claimant to be inconsistent, and not credible. The claimant appeared to be making up details as the process of questioning her about these incidents continued. For example, when asked why she did not alert her husband of the blue light and angelic music, she added in a detail omitted from her BOC, that a sudden earthquake took place at that very moment that her feet touched the floor, which was reported in the news, but because such earthquakes happen so frequently there would be no way to verify it.\nCredibility: Alleged XXXX, alleged angry relatives, and alleged state enquiries\n[23] It was noted above that the panel finds that the claimant has never performed a XXXX, and specifically that the XXXX the claimant is alleged to have performed on XXXX XXXX, 2016 did not happen.\n[24] As a consequence of those findings, the panel also finds that the claimant did not recite Bible verses with the alleged young woman before the alleged XXXX. The panel finds that there was no angry member of a woman's family seeking retribution against the claimant, mere days after the claimant arrived in Canada. The panel finds that the claimant's husband was not summoned by the police. The panel finds that Iranian authorities are not looking for this claimant for any reason.\nCredibility: Sur place claim\n[25] The claimant has submitted a letter and baptism certificate from the Toronto Iranian Christian Church.8 When describing her experience the first time she entered this church in Toronto, the claimant alleged that upon entering this church she heard the same angelic music that she did the day the statue in her room glowed blue and the earth shook, in March 2016 in Iran.\n[26] Her evidence to the panel was that when that same music was once again audible, it was then that she knew that the Toronto Iranian Christian Church was the place she wanted to attend. The panel does not believe this claimant. The panel finds that the claimant is not a genuine practitioner of Christianity. As such, she would not be at risk in the event of her return to Iran for any alleged religious practise that she has carried out in Canada. The panel finds that if the claimant has attended church in Canada, it was for the purposes of manufacturing a refugee claim. The Panel finds that there is no reason why this conduct would come to the attention of Iranian authorities. It would not have the effect of placing the claimant at risk upon return to Iran.\nDETERMINATION\n[27] The cumulative negative inferences with regard to the credibility of the claimant's allegations lead the panel to find that the claimant is generally not credible. Based on the foregoing reasons, the panel finds that the claimant has not provided credible or trustworthy evidence in support of these claims. The panel finds that the claimant has not established, on a balance of probabilities, the factual basis for her fear that she or the minor claimant would be persecuted or harmed in Iran.\n[28] In short, the panel found the claimant's allegations not to be credible and found that her story as a whole lacked the ring of truth. Given this finding on the claimant's general credibility, the panel does not accept as true the allegations in these claims and finds it has insufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to establish the claimant's alleged experiences in Iran or in Canada, on a balance of probabilities. The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that the claimant is not a genuine religious convert.\n[29] The panel finds on a balance of probabilities that:\n(a) The claimant did not convert to Christianity in Iran;\n(b) Iranian state authorities are not looking for the claimant for alleged apostasy;\n(c) No person or agent of the Iranian state is seeking the claimant as a result of a XXXX procedure; and\n(d) The claimant is not a genuine Christian in Canada, and the Iranian authorities would not pursue the claimant as a result of her alleged religious activities in Canada.\nCONCLUSION\n[30] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel determines that the claimants have not satisfied the burden of establishing a serious possibility or reasonable chance of persecution on a Convention ground, or that, on a balance of probabilities, they would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life, or face a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, if they were to return to Iran. The panel finds that the claimants have manufactured claims where none exist and that these claims are clearly fraudulent. The panel finds that these claims are manifestly unfounded, within the meaning of section 107.1 of IRPA.\n[31] These claims are therefore rejected.\n(signed)\n\"James Yousif\"\nJames Yousif\nOct. 28, 2016\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, as amended.\n2 Exhibit 2, BOC narrative, at para 9.\n3 Ibid., at para 13.\n4 Exhibits 6 and 8.\n5 Exhibit 2, BOC narrative, at para 12.\n6 Exhibit 2.\n7 Exhibit 9.\n8 Exhibit 6, at pp. 1-2.\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRPD.29.1 (August 31, 2012)\nRPD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SPR : TB6-10363\nTB6-10395\n",

He claims refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The alleged circumstances underlying the claim are contained in the Claimant's Basis of Claim (\"BOC\") form,2 and are supplemented by the Claimant's oral testimony and supporting documents.3\n[3] The Claimant was born on XXXX XXXX, 1994 and alleges that he is a XXXX with a limited education from Heibei Province, China. On XXXX XXXX, 2014, the Claimant was introduced to the practice of Falun Gong; he thereafter became a practitioner. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, his Falun Gong practice group was raided by the Chinese Public Security Bureau (\"PSB\"); officers then attended at the Claimant's home on the same evening to arrest him. He went into hiding and exited China on XXXX XXXX, 2016 with the assistance of a snakehead. He claimed for refugee protection in Canada as he fears that he will be arrested, incarcerated, and physically harmed by Chinese authorities because of his practice of Falun Gong.\nDETERMINATION\n[4] For the reasons that follow, the Panel determines that the Claimant is not a Convention refugee, nor a person in need of protection. Therefore, the claim is rejected. Further, the Panel finds that the claim has no credible basis.\nANALYSIS\n[5] The determinative issue in this case is credibility.\nIdentity\n[6] The Panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the Claimant has established both his personal identity, insofar as his name, and identity as a national of China on the basis of his Resident Identity Card (RIC), a certified true copy of which was provided by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.4\nCredibility\n[7] After having heard the testimony of the Claimant and carefully considering the whole of the relevant evidence, as well as his counsel's able submissions, the Panel has the following credibility concerns.\nThe Claimant Exited from the XXXX Airport while Wanted by Chinese Authorities\n[8] The Panel draws a negative credibility inference upon the Claimant's evidence that he was wanted by the PSB at the time that he departed China as he exited the country through an international airport under his own identity.\n[9] The Claimant departed from China by air via the XXXX airport, which the Claimant described as a large international airport, on XXXX XXXX, 2016. He travelled on a genuine passport issued by China, which he confirmed was in his name. At the time of his departure, PSB officers had attended at his home on three occasions seeking his arrest: XXXX XXXX, 2016; XXXX XXXX, 2016; and XXXX XXXX, 2016.\n[10] The Claimant indicated that he travelled with the snakehead and a group of XXXX other people; however, the Claimant denied knowing any background details of his ten fellow travellers. The Claimant was asked to describe the procedures he followed at the XXXX airport. He described going to the check-in counter with the snakehead. The Claimant indicated that the snakehead presented the Claimant's passport in order to obtain a boarding pass for the Claimant. The boarding pass was in the Claimant's name.5 He did not observe whether his passport was scanned into a computer; he indicated that he did not have any idea how \"they\" operated. The Claimant was provided his boarding pass and, subsequently, his passport by the snakehead.\n[11] The Claimant then proceeded to customs, where he presented his passport, boarding pass, and RIC to the customs officer. The Claimant indicated that he did not recall whether any of his documents were scanned into a computer. He did confirm that the customs officer stamped both his passport and boarding pass. Following customs, the Claimant proceeded to security screening, where he presented his passport and boarding pass to the security officer. He did not observe whether his documents were scanned into a computer. His luggage and body were checked for contraband items. The Claimant then proceeded to the boarding gate, where the attendant checked both his passport and boarding pass, but did not scan the documents into a computer.\n[12] The Claimant described being escorted by the snakehead at all times. When asked if he overhead any conversations between the snakehead and airport personnel, he indicated that he overhead a conversation in English at the security screening checkpoint. When asked whether he understood the conversation, the Claimant indicated that he believed it was with respect to contraband items, as the snakehead then asked the group about lighters and liquid items.\n[13] When asked if he knew how he was able to pass through the XXXX airport despite being sought by Chinese authorities, the Claimant indicated that the snakehead made all the arrangements and bribed customs.\n[14] The National Documentation Package (\"NDP\") for China describes the general security procedures at Chinese airports.6 According to a Canadian embassy official in Beijing, a traveller will pass through four points: a check-in counter, a security checkpoint for entry into the airport's secure zone, departure immigration where border authorities are located, and the boarding gate; at each of the points, the traveller's passport may be checked, with scanning occurring at the check-in counter and the immigration checkpoint.7 The Panel infers here that the immigration checkpoint is the same as a customs checkpoint. Another source cited in the NDP, an assistant director for aviation security at the International Air Transport Association (\"IATA\"), indicates that three checkpoints exist, without making reference to the boarding gate, and states that a traveller's passport is checked at each of these locations.8 The IATA official also noted that specific departure procedures vary at each airport, but that the general procedures are consistent.9\n[15] As the Claimant indicated that he did not notice whether his passport was scanned at the check-in counter and that he did not recall whether his passport was scanned at customs, thereby indicating that his observations were unreliable on these points, the Panel prefers the objective country documentation as indicative of the procedures experienced by the Claimant at the XXXX airport. Therefore, the Panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the Claimant's passport was scanned into a computer both at the check-in counter and at customs.\n[16] The NDP also indicates that freedom to exit China is not absolute.10 Under Article 12 of the Exit and Entry Administration Law of China, exit from the country is denied under certain circumstances, including instances where the citizen does not hold valid exit documents, or is a suspect or defendant in a criminal case.11 Chinese border authorities have also effectively implemented exit control measures, although there are isolated incidents of successful evasion.12 As an aid to exit control measures, border authorities have access to a government computer system known as \"Policenet\" or \"Golden Shield,\" which contains a database of fugitives and those convicted of offences; it appears that this database is automatically searched when border authorities scan a passport.13\n[17] In addition, Chinese border authorities are provided what is described as \"advance passenger information\" on arriving and departing passengers.14 This information contains a number of details of that passenger, including full name; date of birth; gender; nationality; country of residence; travel document type; and passport number, expiry date, and issuing country.15 With respect to flights into the country, it appears that China maintains a \"stop list,\" which bars the passenger from boarding the aircraft; however, the NDP remains silent on whether a similar list exists for outbound flights.16 In any event, it is evident that border authorities are provided detailed information on the passengers aboard outbound flights.\n[18] The Panel does not accept the Claimant's evidence as credible with respect to his passage through the XXXX airport while wanted by the PSB. Although the Panel does accept that there may be successful evasion of border controls and that a smuggler may successfully bribe border authorities, in the circumstances described in this matter the Panel finds that the Claimant was not able to circumvent such controls if he were wanted by the PSB.\n[19] The Panel is cognizant of the explanation that the snakehead made the requisite arrangements, including bribes, in order to successfully pass through the XXXX airport. However, the Claimant, on his own evidence, appears to have followed a generally standard boarding procedure. His genuine passport was presented at the check-in counter, where a boarding pass in his own name was obtained; his passport and boarding pass were checked and stamped at the customs checkpoint; his passport and boarding pass were checked at the security screening checkpoint; and his passport and boarding pass was again checked at the aircraft gate. Further, the Claimant did not detail any special procedures or methods employed to evade the airport's security measures.\n[20] Even if it is accepted that the Claimant passed through the customs checkpoint with the assistance of a compromised customs officer, the Claimant's own, genuine passport was used as identification at the airport. Further, his boarding pass was also in his name. These factors indicate that he would be registered in the airport's computer systems and, considering the objective country documentation regarding advance passenger information, his travel would be subject to detection by the authorities.\n[21] If the Claimant was wanted by the PSB at the time he exited China, as per his evidence, the number of variables that the Claimant would need to manipulate via a smuggler, or snakehead, in order to successfully evade detection is formidable. The Panel finds the following comments in the Refugee Appeal Division decision of X (Re), 2015 CanLII 72857 (CA IRB), addressing similar circumstances, to apply equally here:\nAPI [advance passenger information] requirements which have been in effect for years, in conjunction with the highly effective Golden Shield program, makes it, on a balance of probabilities, unlikely a wanted person could depart China from an international airport using a passport with his own name, date of birth, and photograph in it. The likelihood of bribing so many people as would be involved in a person's departure is miniscule. From the person selling the ticket, to the check in counter, to the security checkpoint, the customs and immigration people onto the person who checks the Boarding pass, all of these people may be randomly in place and make it nearly impossible for anyone to know who to bribe at what point. It is simply implausible that a wanted man will escape China on his own legitimate documents.17\n[22] The Panel notes that the Claimant's allegation that he travelled in an organized group appears to find some corroboration in visa officer notes,18 in which the Claimant is recorded as part of a group of XXXX applicants that share the same contact and XXXX XXXX. Following the filing of a refugee claim by another of the group members, visa officials cancelled the group's visas, including the Claimant's, on or about XXXX XXXX, 2016, after the Claimant's arrival in Canada.19 However, simply because the Claimant may have been part of an organized group who used an agent to facilitate travel does not in itself establish that such an agent had the ability to circumvent airport security procedures such that a wanted individual could escape in the manner described by the Claimant.\n[23] As the Claimant was able to exit China on his own identity with his own travel documents in the manner described, the Panel finds that he was not wanted by the PSB when he passed through the XXXX airport. While the Panel acknowledges that Federal Court jurisprudence is mixed on the issue of exiting China on one's own identity while wanted, there are decisions of that court that have found such a finding to be reasonable in circumstances similar to the case at bar.20 Based on the evidence before the Panel in this matter and for the reasons set out above, the Panel draws a negative credibility inference upon the Claimant's evidence that he was wanted by the PSB.\nThe Claimant was Unable to Provide any Public Security Bureau Documentation\n[24] The Panel draws a negative credibility inference upon the Claimant's evidence that PSB officers attended his home on four occasions but did not leave any documentation to indicate their interest in him.\n[25] The Claimant's practice group was allegedly raided by the PSB on XXXX XXXX XXXX 2016.21 The PSB attended his home that same evening to arrest him.22 The Claimant alleged that PSB officers attended his home on three further occasions: XXXX XXXX, 2016; XXXX XXXX, 2016; and XXXX XXXX, 2016. The PSB officers indicated to his parents, with whom he resided, that he was sought for involvement in Falun Gong. They instructed his parents that the Claimant was to turn himself in; the parents were also told by the PSB that his failure to do so would result in his parents bearing the consequences. The Claimant indicated that no documentation was left by the PSB during any of their four visits; he confirmed that he checked with his parents.\n[26] The current National Documentation Package (\"NDP\"), in a United Kingdom Home Office report, indicates that Falun Gong practitioners are detained under Article 300 of China's Criminal Procedure Code, which addresses criminal involvement in evil cults;23 however, it appears the reference should be properly made to Article 300 of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China.24 The current NDP also indicates that the authorities issue summons in criminal investigations, and summons may be left with an adult family member if the subject of interest is absent.25 However, the Panel accepts that there may be inconsistencies in this practice.\n[27] In the circumstances described by the Claimant, the Panel does not accept as reasonable the Claimant's contention that the PSB did not leave any documentation, such as a summons, another process to compel his attendance, or even a document with contact information for an investigator, despite the PSB allegedly visiting his residence on four occasions. The nature of these visits, involving multiple attendances over a number of months, demands for the Claimant to surrender himself, and threats against the parents that they would bear the consequences if he did not return, all indicate a more than casual or passing interest by the PSB in the Claimant. In consideration of these alleged actions and the NDP information, the Panel finds, if the PSB were indeed in pursuit of the Claimant, that a summons or other documents indicating the PSB's interest and demands would have been left at the Claimant's residence. The Panel is guided in this finding by the Federal Court decision of Zhang v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), which upheld such a finding as reasonable in circumstances similar to this matter, as well as other Federal Court jurisprudence addressing comparable circumstances.26\n[28] Accordingly, the Panel draws a further negative credibility inference upon the Claimant's evidence that Chinese authorities sought him for his purported practice of Falun Gong in China.\nThe Claimant did Not Claim for Protection upon his Arrival at the XXXX Airport\n[29] The Panel draws a negative credibility inference upon the Claimant's evidence that he fled China in fear of arrest, imprisonment, and physical harm as he did not claim for protection upon his arrival at either the XXXX or XXXX airports.\n[30] The Claimant entered Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2016;27 he arrived by air at XXXX airport and cleared Canadian customs before proceeding on a connecting flight to XXXX airport later that same day.28 His BOC form was signed August 8, 2016;29 his claim for refugee protection was then made inland.30 The Claimant was asked about his reasons for fleeing China. He indicated that the Chinese authorities were seeking to arrest him. When asked what he thought the authorities would have done if he were arrested, he indicated that he would have been imprisoned and persecuted. When asked to describe how he thought he would have been persecuted, he indicated that he would have been beaten and tortured. The Claimant confirmed that he was in hiding in China prior to his departure. He also confirmed that he understood that his Canadian visa had been obtained through fraudulent information.\n[31] The Claimant was asked as to why he did not claim for refugee protection sooner, such as upon his arrival at the airport. He indicated that he lacked awareness and that he only learned about making a claim from a friend at the end of July 2016. It was put to the Claimant that he had made expensive arrangements with a snakehead to travel to Canada on a visa containing false information and that he intended to remain in Canada; he was asked to explain the apparent lack of planning and research regarding his plans upon arrival in Canada. He then indicated that he learned from a friend in China, with whom he was staying while in hiding, that the Canadian government accepted refugees and that he came to Canada wanting protection from the Canadian government. The Claimant was asked to explain why he had earlier indicated he did not learn about refugee protection until the end of July 2016, then indicated that he learned about refugee protection from a friend in China. He indicated that when he was in China, he was told about the Canadian refugee system and that after he arrived, a friend in Canada told him where he could go to make a claim for refugee protection. The Claimant was asked why he did not claim for refugee protection at the XXXX or XXXX airports if he was seeking refugee protection from the Canadian government. He indicated that he did not know how to make a claim. The Claimant was asked whether he had considered identifying himself as seeking protection from the Canadian government to the customs officer, when clearing customs, or to other Canadian authorities at the airports. He indicated that he did not know he could do so at the time.\n[32] As reflected in Semextant v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) and the cases cited therein, the Federal Court and the Federal Court of Appeal have consistently held that a refugee claimant has an obligation to claim asylum as soon as possible upon entry in a country where protection is available.31 This is also the case where the claimant is present in Canada on a still-valid visa.32 A claimant's failure to seek protection at the earliest available opportunity may undermine the claim, as such a failure may indicate a lack of subjective fear.33 Such conduct may also undermine the credibility of the testimony.34 Although such actions are not an automatic bar to a claim, the Panel is entitled to consider such factors in its assessment of a claimant's credibility.35\n[33] The Panel rejects the Claimant's reason for not identifying himself as seeking protection by Canada at either the XXXX or XXXX airports. The Claimant fled China, allegedly through complex and expensive arrangements, with the intention of seeking Canada's protection against arrest, imprisonment, and alleged assault, including torture. He was aware that the Canadian government offered asylum through the refugee protection system. Despite this, he did not take any steps to identify his desire to seek asylum from the Canadian government at either airport, even during a direct interaction with a Canadian border official when clearing customs. Instead of identifying himself as seeking protection, he bypassed both opportunities and entered Canada, aware that his visa had been illegally obtained through a snakehead. Although the Claimant alleges that he has a limited education and was a peasant XXXX in China,36 he is not entirely lacking in sophistication and ability, as he was able to make arrangements to allegedly escape China, had previously attempted to obtain a United States visa,37 and he clearly understood that protection was available from the Canadian government. The Claimant's actions are inconsistent with an individual who is fleeing not just persecution, but an alleged fear of physical harm, including torture. The Panel also notes the Claimant's shifting testimony in regard to explaining his failure to claim at either airport. The Panel finds that the shifting nature of his testimony in this area also undermines the credibility of his explanation.\n[34] In the circumstances, the Panel draws a negative credibility inference upon the Claimant's evidence that he feared Chinese authorities and, further, that Chinese authorities actively sought him for his alleged Falun Gong practice.\nThe Claimant Misrepresented Himself in a Previous United States Visa Application\n[35] The Panel draws a general negative credibility inference upon the Claimant's evidence as he attempted to obtain a United States visa by providing false information to United States authorities without a compelling reason for the misrepresentation.\n[36] In XXXX 2013, prior to the Claimant allegedly becoming a Falun Gong practitioner, he unsuccessfully attempted to obtain a business\/pleasure visa to the United States.38 He alleges that he pursued the visa application because he had a difficult life in the countryside, and he hoped to pursue education and employment in the United States, where he could enjoy a better life. He obtained the services of a snakehead to apply for the visa, although he alleged he was unaware that he had hired a snakehead until shortly before his visa interview with United States officials. The Claimant testified that two days prior to the interview, he was provided with documents; at that time, he realized that the visa application had been based on fraudulent information. He was instructed by the snakehead to answer questions as per the falsified documentation. He denied reviewing the visa application before its submission. The visa application indicates, amongst other details, that the Claimant attended Senior High School, that he resided at a different location than indicated in his refugee claim documents, and that he planned to attend the XXXX University Summer Camp.39\n[37] The Claimant was asked whether he advised United States authorities once he discovered there was false information in the visa application. He indicated that he did not, as he was told by the snakehead that the false information would make it easy to obtain a visa. The Claimant indicated that he listened to the snakehead because he wished to study abroad and change his life. He confirmed that he proceeded to attend the interview and maintain the false information presented in the visa application. The Claimant was asked whether he had any concerns in making false statements to United States authorities; he indicated that he thought about it. The Claimant was asked what he thought; he indicated that he had already paid 60,000 RMB and did not want to waste the payment. The Claimant was asked why he went along with the misrepresentation once he learned of it; he explained, beyond his concern about losing his payment, that he was told he would be unable to obtain a visa by relying on truthful background information.\n[38] While it is somewhat dubious in itself that the Claimant would be initially unaware that he had hired a snakehead who then, without the Claimant's prior knowledge, completed a visa application containing false information, the more central issue here is that the Claimant acquiesced and actively promoted the misrepresentations once he learned of them. He directly attempted to deceive United States authorities during an interview. The Claimant's explanations, while perhaps candid, do not excuse his actions insofar as this assessment is concerned. This was not a situation where the Claimant was attempting to flee persecution, but rather an attempt to simply seek a better life abroad. The Claimant's actions are indicative of an individual who is willing to engage in deception in his dealings with foreign government officials in order to gain such an advantage and, more particularly, who is willing to engage in deceit in order to obtain entry to another country. This deception occurred recently and during the Claimant's adult life.\n[39] Consequently, the Panel finds that the Claimant's actions are relevant to the present circumstances and serve to undermine his general credibility. Therefore, the Panel draws a general negative credibility inference upon his evidence that he was a Falun Gong practitioner in China and now in Canada as well as his evidence that Chinese authorities seek him for his alleged practice.\nThe Claimant's Falun Gong Practice Details are Not Compelling\n[40] The Panel finds that the Claimant's evidence regarding his practice of Falun Gong is not persuasive in establishing that he is a genuine Falun Gong practitioner.\n[41] The Claimant alleged that he started practicing Falun Gong in XXXX 2014 while still resident in China. He provided details as to his alleged practice in both China and Canada, including by describing his regular attendance and activities at practice groups in both countries. The Claimant alleged that, in China, he attended group practice weekly and also practiced apart from the group on a daily basis. Now that he is in Canada, he allegedly attends a practice group at Milliken Park, in the Toronto area, on Saturdays and Sundays, and a practice group at Finch and Birchmount, also in the Toronto area, on days that he is not at Milliken Park.\n[42] The Claimant was asked whether he was aware the Falun Gong was illegal at the time that he joined the practice; he indicated affirmatively. He indicated that he thought he would possibly be incarcerated if he were discovered as a practitioner. The Claimant was asked what persuaded him to join Falun Gong if he thought he might be incarcerated; he indicated that Falun Gong helps him to get rid of attachments and to maintain an optimistic attitude toward life. He was again asked why he would take the risk of being jailed by becoming a practitioner; he indicated that he had been told practising Falun Gong was safe and that his introducer, XXXX XXXX, had not been discovered since joining two years prior. The Claimant was asked what personally appealed to him about the practice; he indicated that he was told it was not a cult and that it is very good. The Claimant was prompted again as to his personal interest in joining; he indicated that his friend told him about and had truthfulness, compassion, and forbearance. He had also explained earlier that Falun Gong helps him in every way and could guide him to know life. In examination by his counsel, he spoke briefly about the benefits of Falun Gong for him, such as he learns to get rid of attachments, gives him a correct view towards life, and that life is beautiful. When asked to expand on the concept of attachments by his counsel, he indicated that it helps him to forget previous matters. He did not provide any details around any such matters.\n[43] The Claimant's reasons for his initial involvement in Falun Gong, an illegal practice for which he was aware at the time of joining that he could possibly be jailed, are lacking in cogency. He required repeated prompting in discussing his motivations. His personal interest in joining Falun Gong was essentially that his friend had not been arrested and had told him about the three principles of the practice. He did not describe why being told of these principles had any personal appeal to him. He did not describe how the practice addressed any issues in his own life. A generalized discussion of benefits, such as learning to be rid of attachments, is not indicative of why those benefits are of personal importance. He did not discuss any issues with his own attachments, if any. The Panel finds that this testimony is unpersuasive in establishing why the Claimant would knowingly risk jail by joining an illegal practice and, further, detracts from his credibility that he is a genuine Falun Gong practitioner.\n[44] The Claimant was asked whether he possessed a copy of Zhuan Falun, the central text of Falun Gong.40 He indicated that he did not obtain a copy and that he only studied it in group practice. When asked why he did not obtain a copy for use in his group study, he indicated that he did not have any money and that they take turns studying with a single book. The Panel noted its understanding to the Claimant that Zhuan Falun is the central text of Falun Gong; he agreed. The Claimant was asked why he would not obtain the central text of Falun Gong; he stated that he does not understand most of the book and that he needs to be with a group to understand it owing to his limited education level.\n[45] There was no credible evidence before the Panel to indicate that a copy of Zhuan Falun was not available to the Claimant if he had sought it. On the Claimant's own evidence, he frequently associates with other practitioners. Falun Gong practice is described as an \"advanced system of cultivation and practice\" for which there is a \"body of fundamental knowledge essential for the task of undertaking proper cultivation towards higher stages of attainment.\"41 In this context, and noting that the Claimant is allegedly a fervent practitioner, the Panel finds that the Claimant's failure to obtain a copy of the central text of Falun Gong in Canada, due to an apparent lack of effort on his part, detracts from his credibility that he is a genuine practitioner.\n[46] The Claimant confirmed that he sends righteous thoughts three times a day on a daily basis. The Claimant was asked to explain the purpose of sending righteous thoughts. He indicated that it is to clean up oneself and to get rid of bad things. When asked to explain what he meant by bad things, he indicated it was the black substance, which he went on to explain was karma. He was asked whether there were any other purposes; he indicated to clarify the truth. He was then prompted as to any further purposes; he indicated that he did not recall anything else and that he felt nervous.\n[47] Righteous thoughts pertain to destroying or stopping evil beings who persecute practitioners; destroying evil is the central aspect of the concept.42 The Claimant made no reference to stopping evil in his brief discussion of righteous thoughts. When the Claimant was asked why he did not mention the elimination of evil beings, he indicated that he was too nervous to remember. The Panel finds that the Claimant's failure to explain the central purpose of sending righteous thoughts, despite engaging in the activity multiple times a day on a daily basis, detracts from his credibility that he is a genuine practitioner.\n[48] Beyond the Claimant's testimony, there was no other evidence tendered in support of the Claimant's allegations that he practiced Falun Gong in China or in Canada. There were no supporting affidavits, letters, photographs, or witnesses.\n[49] In all of the circumstances as discussed, the Panel draws a negative credibility inference upon the Claimant's evidence that he was a practitioner of Falun Gong in China and, further, upon his evidence that he is a continuing practitioner in Canada.\nThe Claimant's Allegations are Not Credible\n[50] The Panel has drawn a number of negative credibility inferences upon the Claimant's evidence related to the PSB's interest in him and the Claimant's practice of Falun Gong, both in China and in Canada. These were central aspects of the claim. Further, the Panel has drawn a general negative credibility inference upon the Claimant's evidence owing to his misrepresentations regarding the United States visa application.\n[51] Therefore, given the constellation of negative inferences on central aspects of the claim, the Panel finds, as per Sheikh v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration),43 that the cumulative effect undermines the credibility of the Claimant in general. Accordingly, the Panel finds that the Claimant is not a credible or trustworthy witness. Further, the Panel finds that this lack of general credibility extends to all relevant aspects of his testimony.\n[52] There were no witnesses called or witness testimonials tendered in this matter. As noted, there is no documentation in evidence to indicate that the PSB has an interest in the Claimant. Further, as noted, there is no documentation in evidence to indicate that the Claimant was a Falun Gong practitioner in either China or Canada.\n[53] Consequently, the Panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the Claimant was never sought by Chinese authorities nor was he ever a practitioner of Falun Gong in China. Further, the Panel finds that the Claimant is not a continuing practitioner of Falun Gong in Canada. Accordingly, the Panel is not satisfied that the claim, insofar as the allegations, is established whether it is assessed pursuant to s. 96 or ss. 97(1) of IRPA. The specific allegations are not credible or trustworthy.\nRefugee Sur Place\n[54] As indicated, the Claimant alleges that he continues to practice Falun Gong in Canada. The Panel has already found that the Claimant was not a Falun Gong practitioner in China, nor is he a continuing Falun Gong practitioner in Canada. Consequently, the Panel is not satisfied that the Claimant would be a Falun Gong practitioner upon return to China.\n[55] However, the Panel must also consider whether the Claimant's alleged participation in Falun Gong activities in Canada has come or will come to the attention of Chinese authorities and whether the Claimant will face more than a mere possibility of persecution as a result.44 As the Claimant has been found not to be a credible witness in general and there is a lack of any documentary evidence to demonstrate Falun Gong involvement in Canada, the Panel finds that there is insufficient evidence to establish that the Claimant actually participated in any Falun Gong activities in Canada, much less the extent and nature of any such activities. It follows, then, that there is insufficient evidence to establish that Chinese authorities have taken or will take an interest in the Claimant because of alleged Falun Gong activities in Canada.\n[56] Therefore, the Panel is not persuaded on the credible and trustworthy evidence before it that the Claimant would be identified as a Falun Gong practitioner upon return to China. Accordingly, there is no objective basis to find that the Claimant would face a serious possibility of persecution in China as a result of any activities in Canada, pursuant to s. 96 of IRPA. The evidence in this area also does not establish a claim pursuant to ss. 97(1) of IRPA, which requires the Claimant to meet an even higher standard of risk than that required in s. 96 of IRPA.\nCONCLUSION\n[57] The Panel concludes that the Claimant is not a Convention refugee, pursuant to s. 96 of IRPA, as he does not face a serious possibility of persecution in China. The Panel further finds that the Claimant is not a person in need of protection pursuant to ss. 97(1) of IRPA. Therefore, the claim is rejected.\nNo Credible Basis\n[58] As the Panel has rejected the Claimant's credibility, and further credible or trustworthy evidence has not been provided in relation to grounds under s. 96 or ss. 97(1) of IRPA, there is no credible or trustworthy evidence upon which the Panel could have come to a favourable decision. The Panel, therefore, finds that the claim has no credible basis pursuant to ss. 107(2) of IRPA.\n(signed)\n\" Robert L. Gibson \"\nRobert L.

The XXXX XXXX testified that they became affiliated with the AWB in 1992 because it was their understanding that the organization was helping the Afrikaans community in the country by keeping the rights of the community, such as maintaining their language. They testified that they did not participate at a national level, rather, they attended community meetings in their town. Mrs. XXXX XXXX participated in what she referred to as self-defense training which involved a target shooting and some bush survival skills. Mr. XXXX XXXX did not receive self-defense training. MrXXXX XXXX XXXX became affiliated with the organization since the foreman of the mine who hired him was a member of the AWB and demanded membership in the AWB as a condition of being hired. Mr. XXXX XXXX testified that he never did become a member of the organization despite repeated promptings of his foreman, because he was too busy with his job to take time out to officially join the AWB. The XXXX XXXX testified that they were aware that the AWB was complicit in bombings and other violent activities, but they stated that this happened in the major centers and they were isolated from these events since they were from a small town. They testified further that initially they did not believe the AWB was capable of the violence they were accused of and only became aware of this after they were arrested for participating in the Freedom Front at the World Trade Center in 1992.\n[3] The claimants testified that while on their way to a family funeral in 1992, they detoured to attend the Freedom Front at the World Trade Center protest organized by the AWB in Johannesburg. The XXXX XXXX testified that there were between 3000 to 4500 people in attendance. At one point, one of the leaders of the organization drove an armored vehicle through the glass doors and windows of the World Trade Center. The XXXX XXXX testified that they were swept up in the surge of people who raced into the building. There were media reports of widespread destruction and vandalism and intimidation of the people in the building. The\nXXXX XXXX testified that afterwards they left the protest to attend the funeral. In the meantime, they were made aware that their faces, among other participants, were being broadcast on the media as the police wanted to interview these people. The XXXX XXXX testified that they turned themselves into the police. They were detained along with other protesters. Lawyers from the AWB provided legal assistance to most of the other protesters; however, the XXXX XXXX and one other couple were not actually members of the AWB, but merely affiliated with it, so they did not receive legal support from these lawyers. Mr. XXXX XXXX testified that he had to work an extra job for over a year in order to pay for his legal services. In the end, the XXXX XXXX were not charged for their participation in the protest at the World Trade Center. Since the XXXX XXXX received no legal assistance from the AWB lawyers, they disassociated themselves with the organization shortly afterwards.\n[4] It became obvious throughout the testimony that the XXXX XXXX, although unsophisticated, answered the Minister's questions to the best of their ability. There was no evidence that the\nXXXX XXXX were withholding information, rather they testified regarding their involvement with the AWB to the seemingly detriment of their case. The XXXX XXXX demonstrated an ill-informed awareness of the purposes and intent of the AWB.\n[5] The test to determine whether a claimant is excluded from refugee protection pursuant to Article 1(F)(a) of the Convention is set out by the Supreme Court in Ezokola.3 There are three components to the test: a) Voluntary Participation; b) Significant Participation and c) Knowing Participation. At the end of her questioning, the Minister stated that she had not established these three criteria and therefore withdrew the application for exclusion. I concur. Although the\nXXXX XXXX voluntarily joined the organization, Mr. XXXX XXXX only did so because the foreman who hired him for a mining job was a member of the AWB and would only hire people affiliated or who were members of the AWB. Mr. XXXX XXXX never followed through on his commitment to join the organization. The XXXX XXXX only participated in community town hall meetings. They were ill-informed of the organizations national activities. Other than attending the protest at the World Trade Center, they took part in no significant events organized by the AWB. In this protest, there were no charges laid against the claimants for their participation. The XXXX XXXX testimonies were simple, straightforward and unsophisticated. It was not demonstrated that they took a knowing activity in contributing or promoting the larger activities of the AWB.\n[6] Since the Minister withdrew her application to exclude the XXXX XXXX and I found no reason that they should be excluded under Article 1(F)(a), I find that they are included in the refugee claim along with their family. Following is a consideration of the extended family's claim for refugee protection.\nALLEGATIONS\n[7] The following is a brief synopsis of the allegations that the claimants put forth in their Basis of Claim forms.4\n[8] The principal claimant testified that he fears the level of criminal activity in South Africa and that in his opinion the police are spread thin. The principal claimant testified that he would not let the children play in the front yard without supervision. He testified regarding a house burglary which occurred in 2013 that when he reported the incident to his fellow police officers, and later tried to follow up with the detectives, they told him that they were too busy to follow up with the case.\n[9] The claimant's spouse and his mother-in-law testified that in 2004, while living on a farm, they were assaulted by four black males who enter their home and robbed them of their belongings. The claimant's mother-in-law was able to chase them away with a knife. They called the police and filed a report but the attackers were not identified, having escaped through the sugarcane. The claimant's mother-in-law testified further that in 2014 her vehicle was stolen from in front of the house. The police investigated and the vehicle was returned the same day, with one indicator light on the vehicle broken.\n[10] In addition to the incident on the farm in 2004, the claimant's spouse testified that in 2014, while working in a video store, three unidentified black males tried to rob the store and tried to rob her of her cell phone. The security company employed by the store arrived on the scene first. The police came 45 minutes later. The security company employees searched the small town to look for the assailants but did not find them.\n[11] The claimant's father-in-law testified that in 1995, his vehicle was hijacked. The police became involved with the incident, but they never recovered the vehicle. The claimant's father-in-law testified that the police did not issue a report, because he was unable to describe the people involved in the incident, since it happened too quickly.\nDETERMINATION\n[12] I have read and I have considered counsel's post-hearing submissions.5\n[13] I find that the claimants did not establish that they are Convention refugees or that they are persons in need of protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Act. I disagree with counsel's submissions that the claimants have a nexus to the Convention grounds because they are white South Africans, more specifically Afrikaners. There is no reliable evidence arising from the claimants' allegations that the claimants were attacked due to their race. Rather, based on the incidents described, it is more probable than not, that these were random attacks or that the assailants targeted the claimants to illegally obtain their possessions.\n[14] Under section 97 of the Act, the claimants must demonstrate that they would be at personal risk to a danger of torture, or at risk to their lives, or at risk to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment based on a balance of probabilities. The evidence in this case indicates that the claimants were subject to criminal risks generally faced by the population in South Africa. Assessing the claimants' allegations, there is no persuasive evidence that they would face a personalized or individualized risk in the future. Following are my reasons.\n[15] The claimant's allegations contain sporadic, infrequent criminal events spanning 20 years. Regarding the 2004 incident where assailants broke into the family home on the farm, while there may have been threats that the assailants did not want white people on the farm, it is clear from the actions of the assailants that they were more interested in robbing the claimants of their possessions. The assailants fled after the claimant's mother-in-law chased them out of the house with a knife and before the police could arrive. In any event, shortly after this event, the claimants moved away from the farm into a town. On a balance of probabilities, this was either a random or targeted robbery; the point being that it was the claimants' possessions that were targeted, not the claimants themselves.\n[16] Regarding the incidents relating to the claimant's in-laws' vehicles, it is obvious from the testimony that the assailants targeted the vehicles and not these claimants themselves. There is no reliable evidence that the claimant's in-laws were targeted personally in these attacks.\n[17] Concerning the robbery of the video store, there is no reliable evidence that the claimant's spouse was personally targeted. Rather, it is more probable that the store itself was targeted for robbery and that the claimant as an employee of the store was incidental in the attention of the robbers. There is no reliable evidence that the claimant's spouse was personally targeted in this attack.\n[18] To summarize, there is no reliable evidence that the claimants were ever personally targeted after the 2004 robbery of their farm home. The incidents regarding the stolen vehicles, in probability, are incidents of generalized or randomized theft. It is more probable than not that the video store was targeted for robbery and not the claimant's spouse. Based on the claimants' testimonies, there is no reliable evidence that the claimants, on a balance of probabilities, would be personally targeted under section 97 of the Act if they were to return to South Africa. It is acknowledged that they might fall victims to generalized acts of criminality, but this does not rise to a balance of probabilities, nor would it amount to individualized or personalized risk.\n[19] Whether under section 96 of the Act or section 97(1) of the Act, the claimants have failed to establish that they face a possibility of persecution or on a balance of probabilities, a risk to their lives or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture if returned to South Africa.\nState Protection\n[20] The claimants have not establish that they would face a forward-looking risk if they were returned to South Africa; therefore, it is not necessary to conduct a full analysis on whether or not they have rebutted the presumption that state protection exists for them in South Africa. Nevertheless, based on the claimants' testimonies, they have not provided clear and convincing evidence that the authorities in South Africa cannot protect them.\n[21] The principal claimant was a policeman from 2007 until 2015. The principal claimant testified that from his experience, the detectives in his police department would have up to 500 dockets open at a time and it was difficult for them to investigate. If a crime was ongoing the police might take over an hour to respond. The principal claimant related and experience that when he tried to report a burglary to his home in 2013, the detectives told him that they did not have enough time to investigate it. While the principal claimant may have demonstrated that the police in his department were very busy or that in this particular incident, the police did not assign a high priority to the burglary, this is not indicative of their own experiences arising from past incidents.\n[22] Relating to the home invasion on their farm in 2004, it is the claimants' testimony that the police responded, although the assailants were able to escape through the sugarcane. Regarding the claimant's mother-in-law's stolen vehicle, the police recovered that vehicle on the same day. Concerning the claimant's father-in-law's hijacked vehicle, the police were not able to investigate the matter further, because the incident happened so quickly that the claimant's father-in-law was not able to give the police a description. The police responded to the 2014 robbery of the video store where the claimant's spouse was, albeit late, but the assailants had already escaped. Even though the store's security personnel responded almost immediately, they were unable to locate the assailants. It is clear from the evidence that has been provided to me, that the police are willing to offer protection to the claimants in most of these incidents, even though they were unable to apprehend the assailants in these acts of randomized a generalized crimes.\n[23] Most significant to the issue at hand, however, are the experiences of the claimant's in-laws. They took part in a protest in which the World Trade Center was damaged and vandalized and where people in that building were threatened. After turning themselves into the police, the police investigated the matter for approximately one year, after which the claimant's in-laws were not charged with any crimes. The in-laws significant concern in this matter was that they were not represented by lawyers of the AWB, but had to obtain their own legal counsel and pay for it themselves. It is clear from the evidence before me that this was a well-coordinated investigation where charges were laid against the suspects of these acts against the World Trade Centre and where the claimant's in-laws were let off with no charges laid against them.\n[24] Based on the claimants' own testimonies, the police responded to the claimants' calls for assistance, demonstrating that there is a willingness on the part of the police to offer protection. The results were mixed. On one occasion a vehicle is recovered. In another time, a vehicle is not recovered. The police responded to the incident on the farm and again a decade later, in different circumstances, the police responded to the video store robbery. Even though the assailants escaped in these instances, there is no persuasive evidence that the police did not act adequately or that there were inappropriate responses on their part. And finally, the XXXX XXXX were able to establish their own innocence after a lengthy police investigation into the incident involving the World Trade Centre. The evidence regarding the police protection in their own circumstances might be mixed, but it is certainly not the clear and convincing evidence that is needed to rebut the presumption that adequate state protection exists in South Africa.\nCONCLUSION\n[25] The claimants have not established that they are Convention refugees or persons in need of protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97(1) of the Act. The Board therefore rejects each of their claims.\n(signed)\nDouglas Cryer\nDouglas Cryer\nNovember 16, 2016\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27.\n2 Exhibit 1.\n3 Ezokola v Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, 2013 SCC 40.\n4 Exhibit 2.\n5 Exhibit PH-1.\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n1\nRPD 29.1 (2014\/02\/18) )\nRPD File No. \/ N\u00b0 de dossier de la SPR : VB6-01155\/ 01151\/ 01152\/ 01179\/ 01180\/ 01181\n",

They claim refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The alleged circumstances underlying the claims are contained in the Claimants' Basis of Claim (\"BOC\") forms and are supplemented by their oral testimony and other materials in evidence.2 The Claimants, during all material times were residents of Guangdong province, China; they are members of the majority XXXX ethnic group.3 The Principal Claimant married her husband, who remains in China, on XXXX XXXX, 2000 and gave birth to her only son, the Minor Claimant, on XXXX XXXX, 2001.\n[3] Approximately two months after the birth of the Minor Claimant, family planning officials allegedly required the Principal Claimant to wear an intrauterine device (\"IUD\") for birth control. This caused some health problems for the Principal Claimant. Over the years leading to XXXX 2014, the Principal Claimant made a number of requests of family planning officials for permission to remove the IUD. In each instance, the request was denied. In XXXX 2014, despite the use of the IUD, the Principal Claimant was found to be pregnant during an IUD check; family planning officials forced the Principal Claimant to have an immediate abortion. The Principal Claimant was forced to wear a different IUD beginning in XXXX 2014, which again resulted in ongoing health issues. In XXXX 2014, the Principal Claimant had a private doctor remove her IUD, although it was briefly reinserted during the Claimant's XXXX 2014 IUD check-up.\n[4] In XXXX 2015, the Principal Claimant again became pregnant. The Principal Claimant resolved to leave China and went into hiding in the interim. She retained the services of a smuggler, who obtained United States visas for the Principal Claimant and the Minor Claimant. The Claimants departed China on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and arrived in the United States; the Claimants then entered Canada on XXXX XXXX, 2015 at an allegedly uncontrolled border location.\n[5] Family planning officials attended at the Principal Claimant's home and at the home of her relatives while she was in hiding and after her departure from China, indicating that she is subject to penalties for her failure to comply with family planning rules.\n[6] The Principal Claimant alleges that she fears forced abortion and forced sterilization if returned to China. The Principal Claimant also indicated that she is opposed to the violation of her bodily integrity through the mandatory use of an IUD. She also wishes to have more children. With respect to the Minor Claimant, it was alleged that he would be unable to pursue an education in China due to his family's violation of the family planning rules. The Principal Claimant also expressed concern for the ability of her unborn child, if not aborted, to pursue an education in China as the child would be an out-of-plan birth.\nDETERMINATION\n[7] For the reasons that follow, the Panel determines that the Claimants are not Convention refugees, nor persons in need of protection. Therefore, the claims are rejected.\nPRELIMINARY MATTERS\n[8] The Principal Claimant agreed to act as a designated representative of the Minor Claimant. The Minor Claimant was born in XXXX 2001 and was fourteen years old at the time of the hearing; beyond initial preliminary questions, the Minor Claimant was excused from the hearing.\n[9] As this claim relates to a woman's reproductive rights, the Panel must consider and apply Chairperson Guidelines 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution.4 Therefore, amongst other considerations, the Panel recognizes that social, cultural, and traditional norms can impact the testimony of those fearing gender-based persecution, and the Panel must consider the interplay of those factors in assessing the evidence in this matter.\nANALYSIS\n[10] In the context of this claim, it is necessary to consider whether the Claimants have established their identities as nationals of China, and whether, as per s. 96 of IRPA, the Claimants have established, through credible and trustworthy evidence, that they are at serious risk of persecution in China for their family planning views and practices. A consideration of the evidence as it relates to ss. 97(1) of IRPA is also necessary, and will be briefly set out below.\n[11] The determinative issues in this claim are whether the Claimants have established a well-founded fear of persecution and whether they are credible in their testimony.\nIdentity\n[12] The Claimants' personal identities and identities as nationals of China are established through their testimony and the supporting documentation filed, which included certified true copies of their Resident Identity Cards5 provided in the Minister's evidentiary package. Additionally, the Minor Claimant's birth certificate was submitted into evidence,6 which reflected his place of birth as Guangdong province, China, and which also indicated that the Principal Claimant is a national of China. Further, the Claimants submitted their household registration, or hukou,7 which indicates that their places of birth were in Guangdong province, in China. There were no aspects on the face of the Resident Identity Cards, birth certificate, or hukou that caused the Panel to doubt their genuine nature. The Panel, therefore, finds that the Claimants have established their personal identities and their identities as nationals of China.\nCredibility\n[13] Sworn testimony is presumed to be true, unless there is a valid reason to doubt its veracity. The determination as to whether a claimant's evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities, the burden of which is upon the claimant to satisfy. The Panel also notes that a finding that a claimant is generally lacking in credibility may impact the entirety of the claimant's relevant evidence.8\n[14] In assessing credibility, it is necessary to consider the challenges faced by a claimant in a hearing room setting within the context of the particular claimant's age and background. The Principal Claimant, born in XXXX 1970, had eleven years of formal education and had graduated from XXXX college. She worked as a XXXX XXXX and XXXX for at least ten years prior to departing from China.9 The Principal Claimant also spoke of her international travel experience over the preceding years, having travelled to Japan and Australia in 2007 and to Europe in 2008. As noted above, the Principal Claimant's evidence must be assessed with serious consideration to the applicable chairperson's guideline respecting gender-based persecution.10\n[15] After having heard the testimony of the Principal Claimant and carefully considering the whole of the relevant evidence, as well as the able submissions of their counsel, the Panel has the following credibility concerns.\nFamily Planning Violation Notices\n[16] The Claimants submitted two notices that were purportedly issued by family planning officials in 2015. The first notice, dated XXXX XXXX, 2015, indicates that the Principal Claimant contravened family planning rules, specifically by failing to attend at an IUD and pregnancy check-up, and that she is subject to a 10,000 yuan fine as well as mandatory abortion and sterilization.11 The Panel takes judicial notice that a yuan is a unit of China's RMB currency and the two designations are commonly used interchangeably. The second notice, dated XXXX XXXX, 2015, indicates that various personal electronics and appliances had been seized from the Claimants, presumably from their home as no seizure location is clear on its face.12\n[17] Mandatory abortions and sterilizations, at least officially at the national level, are illegal in China; officials have been disciplined for forced pregnancy termination in at least some instances.13 Article 62 of the Regulations of Guangdong Province on Population and Family Planning (\"Guangdong Regulations\") indicates that the penalty for failure to take a pregnancy test is a fine of less than 200 RMB, which appears to only be triggered after failure to comply with a warning.14 The violation notice, dated XXXX XXXX, 2015, indicates that a fine of 10,000 yuan, or RMB, was to be imposed, and that mandatory abortion and sterilization were to occur as well.15 The Panel notes that the Principal Claimant does not allege that family planning officials had learned of her pregnancy prior to the issuance of the notices; therefore, the inclusion of the demand for mandatory abortion is not consistent with the Principal Claimant's circumstances. Further, the penalties set out in the violation notices are at significant variance with the permissible penalties and also describe intended measures that are illegal under Chinese law. Although the Panel accepts that there are instances where family planning authorities do not respect the law in their enforcement practices,16 the Panel finds that such illegal intentions would not be baldly stated in an official notice due to the obvious risks for the official issuing the notice.\n[18] With respect to the second notice, dated XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015, the Panel notes an irregularity on the face of the document.17 Under an enumerated list setting out \"points of attention,\" the list begins with the Arabic numeral \"5,\" as opposed to \"1\"; the list is also in the sequence of \"5, 6, 7, 4,\" as opposed to the expected sequence of \"1, 2, 3, 4.\" When the issue was brought to the attention of the Claimant, she stated, as the Panel understands it, that perhaps the officials who issued the notice were selecting from a list of several points. That may be a plausible explanation; further, official documents certainly may contain obvious errors on their face. However, the issue with this document must be considered in the broader circumstances.\n[19] The Panel notes that fraudulent documentation is easily obtained in China, in particular in Guangdong province, and so documentation from there must be considered with caution.18 In this case, both notices are simplistic black and red ink documents that are easily produced by any colour printer. The XXXX XXXX, 2015 notice prescribed mandatory abortion prior to family planning officials discovering that the Principal Claimant was pregnant and also set out penalties at significant variance with those available under Chinese law. The XXXX XXXX XXXX 2015 notice includes an error on the face of the document. Considering all of these factors together, the Panel draws a negative inference as to the authenticity of the family planning violation notices.\nLack of Claim in the United States\n[20] The Claimants departed Guangzhou, China by air on XXXX XXXX, 2015 for Los Angeles, United States. The Claimants remained in Los Angeles for XXXX days before boarding a flight to Seattle on XXXX XXXX, 2015, where they stayed an additional night before crossing the Canadian border with the alleged assistance of snakeheads.\n[21] When asked why she did not claim in the United States, the Principal Claimant said that she was told by a snakehead that the United States would return a pregnant refugee claimant to China. When asked how she knew she would not face the same issue in Canada, she stated that the snakehead told her that Canada was humane. The Principal Claimant was asked, as she testified that she conducted her own research regarding refugee protection outside of China, including that available in the United States, whether she considered the snakehead's advice unusual. The Principal Claimant said that it was the policy of the United States, and that she had come across Internet and newspaper reports of pregnant women deported from the United States upon discovery of their pregnancies. However, the Principal Claimant was unable to provide any copies of these alleged reports.\n[22] The United States, like Canada, is a signatory to the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.19 It is presumed, absent of evidence to the contrary, that the United States will carry out its duties and obligations under the Convention as appropriate.20 The Principal Claimant is an educated, well-travelled individual who, additionally, researched the topic of refugee protection. The Claimants successfully entered the United States and remained for a number of days. Instead of claiming in the United States, the Claimants risked arrest by illegally entering Canada. Further, once in Canada, the Claimants did not make a claim near their port of entry, but instead travelled inland to Toronto before finally making a refugee protection claim. The Panel concludes that the Claimants engaged in \"asylum shopping,\" which is inconsistent with an individual living in fear of persecution in their country.21 Refugee claimants are expected to claim as soon as practicable.22 Although such actions are not an automatic bar to a claim, the Panel is entitled to consider such a factor in its assessment of a claimant's credibility.23\n[23] Given the circumstances here, the Panel draws a negative inference upon the Principal Claimant's evidence that she feared persecution in China.\nCredibility Assessment\n[24] Given the negative inference noted above with respect to the family planning violation notices, the Panel concludes that the Principal Claimant is not a credible witness with respect to the alleged pursuit of the Claimants by family planning authorities. Further, given the negative inference drawn with respect to the Claimants' failure to claim in the United States, the Panel also concludes that the Principal Claimant is not a credible witness with respect to her alleged fear of persecution in China. Both the alleged pursuit of the Principal Claimant by family planning authorities, as the agents of persecution, and the Claimant's fear of forced abortion and sterilization in China, as a key factor contributing to her fear in China, are central components of the claim. As per Sheikh,24 the Panel is of the view that the cumulative effect of the negative inferences and findings, especially the finding that non-genuine documentation was submitted as evidence, undermines the credibility of the Principal Claimant in general. As the Minor Claimant relies on the Principal Claimant's BOC narrative, the credibility issues impact his claim as well.\n[25] However, although the Panel has found that the Principal Claimant is not credible with respect to her specific allegations, the Panel must still assess whether the Claimants face a risk of persecution based on their residual profile.\nWell-Founded Fear of Persecution\nLocal Family Planning Practices in Guangdong Province\n[26] Family planning laws in China are established at the national level; however, the implementation of those laws varies by province and locality, both through local regulations and actual enforcement.25 As the Claimants are from Guangdong province, the local rules and practices in that province are relevant here.\n[27] Generally, Guangdong province has had a lenient approach to family planning enforcement, with many two- and three-child families in the 1980s, a baby boom in 2008, despite pressure from the national government for stricter enforcement action, and a 2011 request by provincial family planning authorities to relax child-bearing restrictions.26 There are also numerous circumstances that permit families to have more than one child.27 Articles 47 and 53 of the Guangdong Regulations mandate that families that have children in excess of the prescribed limit shall be charged social compensation fees.28 The Guangdong Regulations do not set out mandatory abortion or sterilization procedures for families that have out-of-plan births, although Article 25 of the regulations states that emergency contraception shall be taken where there is an unauthorized pregnancy.29 The Panel does note that mandatory sterilization and abortion procedures, at least to a limited extent, were carried out in Guangdong province as recently as 2009 and 2010,30 and potentially into 2012,31 although the Panel is unaware of any documentary evidence before it which indicates that such incidents have occurred there since 2012. As noted, forced abortions and sterilizations are banned at the national level.32\n[28] The Panel also notes that there are isolated references to indirect enforcement pressure from officials occurring post-2012 in Guangdong province, such as some primary schools in Guangzhou requiring proof of parental contraceptive use or tubal ligation in order to permit enrolment of children in first grade33 or officials in Nanhai District, Foshan, requiring women's use of an IUD in order to register their newborns, including in cases where the newborn was an only child.34 However, these reports lack detail as to the degree and extent of such pressure, and appear to be of limited geographic scope.\n[29] The Panel further notes that while IUD use is \"preferred\" where each parent already has a child, there is no legal requirement that an individual use an IUD; couples are able to select their form of contraception.35 It appears that the failure to implement contraception use \"in accordance with relevant provisions\" would result in a fine of less than 200 RMB.36 Although the Panel notes that Guangdong officials were urged to implement family planning measures that included the use of IUDs as late as 201237 and migrant women potentially face an ongoing requirement to use IUDs in order to secure household registration,38 the Panel is unaware of any evidence before it which indicates Guangdong officials do not currently act in accordance with regulations that allow couples in the general population to choose their form of contraception. The Panel is also unaware of any evidence before it that indicates family planning officials in Guangdong province would require penalties in excess of the monetary penalty prescribed by law for failure to use contraception as required.\n[30] The Panel notes that China announced plans at the end of October 2015 to end the \"one-child\" policy nationwide and permit the birth of second children, although the law was not in effect at the time of the hearing and there is still some question as to the specifics of its implementation.39 However, insofar as one- and two-child families, at least, the planned change is indicative of a continued liberalization of China's family planning policies.\n[31] The Panel recognizes that the documentary evidence respecting family planning rules and practices in China is mixed. However, after weighing the available evidence of country conditions, as set out in the current National Documentation Package40 and the Claimants' Country Conditions Package,41 the Panel finds that the preponderance of the evidence indicates that the violation of family planning rules in Guangdong province would result in the imposition of social compensation fees. In accordance with decisions of the Federal Court, the imposition of such fees is not, in itself, persecutory.42\n[32] The Principal Claimant's residual profile as a member of the majority XXXX ethnic group resident in Guangdong province, married, mother of one child and pregnant with another, does not indicate that she would be of any particular interest to family planning officials for the imposition of penalties in excess of the prescribed social compensation fees. Given the recent policy changes in China, it is questionable whether the Principal Claimant would even be subject to social compensation fees for the birth of her second child; if the Principal Claimant chose to have more than two children, then she would face the imposition of such fees.\n[33] Consequently, the Panel finds that there is insufficient evidence before it to establish that the Principal Claimant would be subject to forced abortion or forced sterilization in Guangdong province.\n[34] Additionally, the Panel is not satisfied on the evidence that the Principal Claimant would be forced to wear an IUD in Guangdong province, although the Panel does find that the Principal Claimant and her husband would be required to use some form of contraception between them. However, the type of contraception would be their choice, and, if they refused to use contraception, a monetary penalty of less than 200 RMB would be the consequence which, again, the Panel finds is not persecutory in accordance with Federal Court decisions.43\n[35] With respect to the Minor Claimant, the Panel is unaware of any credible evidence before it which indicates that he would be unable to continue his education or that he would otherwise be deprived of social benefits after his parents addressed any social compensation fees. Accordingly, the Panel finds that there is insufficient evidence to establish that the Minor Claimant would be subject to persecutory penalties for his parents' violation of family planning rules.\n[36] As noted, the Principal Claimant also expressed concern that she will be unable to register her unborn child in China and, consequently, the child will be deprived of an education. The Panel notes that the unborn child is not a party to this claim and so the Panel would ordinarily decline to assess his or her potential difficulties in China. However, given the Principal Claimant's concern, the Panel has considered the issue. Documentation indicates that a parent should be able to register an out-of-plan child with the payment of a social compensation fee.44 Once registered, the child will be entitled to education and other social benefits.45 There is some indication that local governments may refuse to register an out-of-plan child, although this is inconsistent with national policy.46 An unregistered child may still access private education;47 nonetheless, that education may be more costly and inferior to public education.48 There may still, in any event, be issues with access to social benefits.49 However, given the Panel's conclusion that the violation of family planning rules in Guangdong province would result in the payment of social compensation fees, the Panel finds that the Principal Claimant would be able to register her unborn child and, therefore, the child would not be faced with the difficulties associated with lack of registration.\n[37] Accordingly, in all of the circumstances, the Panel finds that the Claimants do not have a well-founded fear of persecution in Guangdong province, China.\nCONCLUSION\n[38] The Panel concludes that the Claimants are not Convention refugees, pursuant to s. 96 of IRPA, as they do not face a serious possibility of persecution in China. As there is no further evidence that the Claimants would satisfy the risks delineated pursuant to ss. 97(1) of IRPA, which requires a higher standard of risk than s. 96 of IRPA, the Panel further finds that the Claimants are not persons in need of protection. Therefore, the claims are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Robert L. Gibson\"\nRobert L.

He claims refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The alleged circumstances underlying the claim are contained in the Claimant's Basis of Claim (\"BOC\") form,2 and are supplemented by the Claimant's oral testimony and supporting documentation.3\n[3] The Claimant was born in Wardak province, Afghanistan and subsequently moved to Kabul, Afghanistan in 2001, where he resided until departing to Canada. He is a Sunni Muslim. He alleges that he was employed as a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX from March to July 2014. A colleague, XXXX XXXX, attempted to persuade the Claimant to provide him with sensitive information to which the Claimant had access through his position. The Claimant did not cooperate. The Claimant received threatening phone calls, indicating that he should work with XXXX XXXX and the Taliban. The Claimant also received a threat from Taliban in his home village to leave his employment with the government.\n[4] The Claimant left his employment in July 2014. He travelled to India in January 2015 to study English. The Claimant's uncle, referred to as Uncle XXXX XXXX insisted that the Claimant's cousin join the Claimant in India. While there, the Claimant associated with individuals from different ethnic and religious backgrounds. The Claimant also attended nightclubs, house parties, and Christian and Hindu religious places.\n[5] The Claimant returned to Kabul in July 2015. During a religious gathering, the Claimant's cousin mentioned the Claimant's association with foreign individuals and his activities while in India. The Claimant then stated that his cousin had gone to a nightclub and become intoxicated. Uncle XXXX blamed the Claimant and his father for the cousin's behaviour; a fight between Uncle XXXX and the Claimant's father ensued. Uncle XXXX warned the Claimant to stay away and made threats related to the Claimant's comments.\n[6] The Claimant again received threats from XXXX XXXX XXXX it appears that XXXX XXXX was upset about his own employment termination and wished for the Claimant to return to the Ministry in order to provide XXXX XXXX with information.\n[7] In September 2015, the Claimant's application to a university in the United States was accepted. The Claimant subsequently obtained a United States visa. The Claimant departed Afghanistan on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX; he travelled to the United States and onward to Canada, where he arrived on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He was arrested for eluding examination while entering Canada at Peace Arch Park in British Columbia. He made a claim for refugee protection.\n[8] The Claimant fears harm from the Taliban, XXXX XXXX, and Uncle XXXX if he returns to Afghanistan. He also alleges that he is at danger because he will be perceived in Afghanistan as having become Westernized.\nDETERMINATION\n[9] For the reasons that follow, the Panel determines that the Claimant is not a Convention refugee, nor a person in need of protection. Therefore, the claim is rejected. Further, the Panel finds that this claim has no credible basis.\nRULING ON APPLICATION TO EXCLUDE EVIDENCE\n[10] At the resumption of the hearing on April 28, 2016, the Claimant brought an application on short notice to exclude the interview notes of Gary Fei (\"Fei\"), an Inland Enforcement Officer for the Canada Border Services Agency (\"CBSA\"), from an interview that occurred on January 6, 2016. The application was made pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms4 (\"Charter\") for alleged breaches of s. 2(b), 7, and 13 of the Charter. The impugned conduct was alleged to be a failure by the CBSA to provide the Claimant with an interpreter at the interview and access to counsel. As evidence on the application, counsel submitted a statutory declaration sworn by the Claimant on April 28, 2016, which was entered as an exhibit in the hearing proper as it was potentially relevant to credibility issues.5 Counsel also made reference to the disputed interview notes.6 Counsel did not call any witnesses on the matter or cite any case law in support of his position.\n[11] The Panel ruled that a breach had not been established on the evidence before it and, therefore, the interview notes were found to be admissible. The Panel indicated that more detailed written reasons would follow the oral ruling, which are set out below.\n[12] The Panel must first address the applicable sections of the Charter. As noted at the time of the application, it is unclear how s. 2(b) of the Charter was engaged in the circumstances of the Claimant. Section 2(b) relates to the freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression. That is not engaged on the evidence before the Panel. Section 13 relates to the issue of self-crimination in a proceeding; this section normally applies to circumstances where a person is compelled to testify in a judicial or quasi-judicial hearing.7 The Panel is not satisfied that s. 13 is appropriately engaged during an immigration interview. Although it was not specifically plead, the Panel is not satisfied that s. 14 is specifically engaged during an immigration interview, which is the right to an interpreter in the language of the proceedings.8\n[13] At the time the Claimant was interviewed by Fei, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police had arrested the Claimant for eluding examination,9 an offence pursuant to IRPA.10 It is evident from Fei's interview notes that the purpose of the interview was to further that investigation.11 Therefore, the Panel is satisfied that s. 10(b) and s. 7 of the Charter are the appropriate sections under which to consider the application.\n[14] The notes provided by Fei are a summary of his interview with the Claimant. Although a transcript of the interview would have been of greater assistance to the Panel, the summary is sufficiently detailed in assessing the application. The notes indicate that the interview was conducted in the family room at the British Columbia Immigration Holding Centre, where the interview was conducted in English; Fei indicates that the Claimant was able to understand and respond to questions with no issues. Fei also records that the Claimant previously studied English in India and \"therefore his English is quite good\"; additionally, the Claimant is able to speak Pashto and Dari. The officer notes that he asked the Claimant as to the language of interpretation if a translator was required; the latter indicated Pashto. The Claimant was provided with his Charter and Vienna rights, although there is no indication as to the content of those rights. The notes indicate that the Claimant understood the rights; he asked to contact his father's friend to assist him in finding a lawyer and he is reported to have declined his Vienna rights. Fei further records that the Claimant was asked whether he would like to speak to Legal Aid; he indicated he would instead prefer to contact his father's friend who would find a lawyer for him. The officer then asked whether the Claimant would be willing to answer \"a few\" questions before speaking with a lawyer; the Claimant indicated yes. Fei read the Claimant the secondary caution from the \"standard issue Charter\/Caution card\", and also provided the card to the Claimant to read on his own; the Claimant indicated that he understood the caution. Fei then stated to the Claimant that he was under no obligation to speak to the officer; the Claimant indicated that he would answer Fei's questions. The interview then proceeded, with questions regarding the Claimant's activities in the United States, his purpose and method in coming to Canada, details of his personal and family background, and risks that he faced in Afghanistan. As part of these details, he spoke of using \"Youtube\" to determine ways to cross the border into Canada, as well as that he had applied for and obtained a United States visa to study English at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[15] As noted, the Claimant provided a statutory declaration setting out his own evidence on the application.12 The Claimant deposes that he did not \"fully\" understand the questions asked by Fei because of \"all of those questions spoken to me in English language\" and because the officer was a \"fast spoken\" person. He also states that although he understands English, he is not fluent and does not fully understand English; he characterized his understanding to be at the beginner level. He indicates that he asked the officer for an interpreter, but was refused; he also notes that he believes the officer ignored his request for an interpreter. The Claimant also notes that he was essentially intimidated by the situation and did not fully understand the rights provided to him, including his right to counsel. He states that he answered the questions truthfully, insofar as his understanding permitted, and that some of his responses were incomplete as a result of his limited English proficiency.\n[16] It is trite law that the party alleging a Charter breach has the burden of so proving it. The evidence in this application is insufficient to establish any such breach.\n[17] With respect to the use of an interpreter, it is apparent from the Claimant's own evidence that he has at least a basic understanding of English. From the contents of Fei's interview notes, it is also evident that the Claimant was responsive to the interview questions across a number of different subjects. Indeed, the Claimant himself states, \"Nonetheless, my narrative attached to my BOC and answers the officer questions [sic] are very similar and correct.\"13 While the Claimant refers to a \"refusal\" by Fei in permitting an interpreter, there is little detail before the Panel as to the underlying circumstances. Fei's notes indicate that the Claimant did not request an interpreter and that he was willing to proceed in English. The Panel notes that Claimant's counsel was satisfied to address this application only on the basis of written statements, being the Claimant's statutory declaration and Fei's notes. It is not necessary for the Panel to resolve an issue of credibility here; rather, it is sufficient to note that the evidence on the application record does not establish any clear action, deliberate or accidental, by Fei to deprive the Claimant of an interpreter. The Panel also notes that the purpose of the interview details in the present context is not that of a prosecution for an offence, but rather as to the Claimant's credibility in his claim for refugee protection. The issue of language difficulties can be appropriately addressed as a matter of weight. In the circumstances, the Panel finds that no Charter breach has been established on the interpretation matter.\n[18] With respect to the s. 10(b), right to counsel issue, the case law establishes that there are two aspects to the right: information and implementation.14 Although the interview notes do not explicitly state the content of the Charter cautions and Vienna rights, it is evident that the issue of access to counsel was communicated to the Claimant at the outset of the interview. Following the Charter warning, the Claimant advised that he wanted to contact his father's friend in order to locate a lawyer; there is also a reference to an offer to speak to Legal Aid and the officer's query as to whether the Claimant will speak to him prior to contacting a lawyer. The Panel also notes that the Claimant was told, prior to proceeding with substantive questions, that he was under no obligation to speak to the officer. The Claimant's statutory declaration indicates, essentially, that he did not understand the rights as provided to him, despite responding affirmatively when asked by the officer. In explanation, it is noted that he did so because it \"sounds good\". The Panel is satisfied that Fei discharged the informational component of the s. 10(b) right. The Claimant's decision to advise that he understood the various warnings because it \"sounds good\" does not negate that he was advised of his rights to contact a lawyer. It is evident, in any event, that the Claimant was aware that he could contact counsel, given his indication that he wanted to contact his father's friend to make lawyer arrangements. The Panel was not directed to any authorities to indicate that the Claimant required any further understanding of this right.\n[19] The remaining issue, therefore, is implementation of the s. 10(b) right. The evidence indicates that the Claimant initially invoked his right to counsel by asking to make arrangements for counsel through his father's friend. However, when asked if he would speak to Fei prior to speaking to a lawyer, the Claimant stated that he would do so, and confirmed his agreement to speak to Fei even after being advised that there was no obligation. In the Panel's view, this signalled a clear and unequivocal intention. It is open for an individual to change his mind, after initially invoking the right, and proceed to speak to authorities without triggering a s. 10(b) breach.15 It was open for the Claimant to again invoke his right to counsel as the interview proceeded; there was no evidence on the application that he made such an assertion. Despite the Claimant's indication in his statutory declaration that he found the process to be intimidating, there is insufficient evidence before the Panel to establish that conditions were such as to vitiate his consent to speak to the officer. The Panel finds that no Charter breach has been established on the right to counsel matter.\n[20] In all of the circumstances, the Panel finds that the Claimant failed to establish a breach of s. 10 and s. 7 of the Charter. Therefore, as noted, Fei's interview notes of January 6, 2016 are admissible in the hearing proper.\nANALYSIS\n[21] In the context of this claim, it is necessary to consider whether the Claimant has established his identity as a national of Afghanistan, and whether, as per s. 96 of IRPA, the Claimant has established, through credible and trustworthy evidence, that he is at serious risk of persecution in Afghanistan. A consideration of the evidence as it relates to ss. 97(1) of IRPA is also necessary, and will be briefly set out below.\n[22] The determinative issue in this case is credibility.\nIdentity\n[23] The Claimant's personal identity and identity as a national of Afghanistan is addressed through his testimony and the supporting documentation filed, specifically a copy of his passport issued by Afghanistan.16 The passport was seized by Canadian immigration officials at the time that he filed his refugee protection claim, and so the Panel did not examine the original document.17 However, there was no aspect on the face of the copy that caused the Panel to doubt its genuine nature. The passport has considerable complexity of design. Although it is not determinative, based on the United States entry stamp in the passport, it is evident that the passport was accepted as a legitimate travel document upon the Claimant's entry into the United States.18 The Panel, therefore, finds that the Claimant has established his personal identity and identity as a national of Afghanistan.\nCredibility\n[24] Sworn testimony is presumed to be true, unless there is a valid reason to doubt its veracity. The determination as to whether a claimant's evidence is credible is made on a balance of probabilities, the burden of which is upon the claimant to satisfy. The Panel also notes that the entirety of a claimant's relevant evidence may be undermined if the claimant is found generally lacking in credibility.19\n[25] In assessing credibility, the Panel has considered the challenges faced by a claimant in a hearing room setting within the context of the age and background of this particular claimant. The Claimant's evidence indicates that he was born in October 1995 in Wardak, Afghanistan and has twelve years of formal education, having completed high school, as well as approximately six months of English studies. When asked about his level of English comprehension, he initially stated that it was \"okay\", although the Claimant's views of his English capabilities became more nuanced as the hearing proceeded. In terms of employment in Afghanistan, the Claimant worked as a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in Kabul from March 2014 to July 2014. However, as will be discussed below, the Panel has concerns with respect to the Claimant's alleged profile as a former government employee.\n[26] After having heard the testimony of the Claimant and carefully considering the whole of the relevant evidence, as well as his counsel's submissions, the Panel has the following credibility concerns.\nInauthentic Employment Documents\n[27] The Panel draws a negative credibility inference upon the Claimant's allegation that he was an employee of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXn Afghanistan as a result of the sealing stamps smearing on the Claimant's employment certificates, inconsistencies on the face of those same documents, and issues surrounding the provision of originals of other employment records.\n[28] At the outset of the third sitting of this matter, on June 23, 2016, the Claimant provided two certificates with respect to his alleged employment at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX which were entered as exhibits.20 The first certificate, dated \"12\/08\/2014\", confirms that the Claimant was employed at the \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXAfghanistan\" as \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in the XXXX XXXX from March 2014 to July 2014. The Claimant stated that the human resources department manager issued the certificate to him on August 12, 2014. The second certificate, which was undated, indicates that the Claimant conducted a two-day workshop at the \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\". The Claimant stated that he received the certificate from the human resources department manager on June 15, 2014. Both certificates were only in English, save for small inscriptions on the logos and sealing stamps.\n[29] The Claimant alleged that his eldest brother mailed the certificates to him; he indicated that he received them on or about May 7, 2016. He stated that he disposed of the mailing envelope because he did not believe that he needed to retain it. He also did not submit the documentation at the time of receipt as he was waiting for other original documents.\n[30] The Panel noted, in handling the certificates, that the sealing stamps on both certificates smeared on the paper when touched, especially so with respect to the second certificate. This was demonstrated during the hearing to counsel. When asked for an explanation, the Claimant stated that he did not know, but that from the time that he received them, he kept them in plastic envelopes. The Panel notes that the certificates were not submitted in plastic envelopes.\n[31] The Claimant was asked to explain why the header on the first certificate indicated \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\", whereas the logo indicated \"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\". The Panel notes that the second certificate also bore the same inconsistencies. The Claimant stated that he did not have an explanation and the certificates were as he had received them.\n[32] The Panel draws a negative inference upon the authenticity of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX certificates. As the Claimant indicated that the certificates were approximately two years old at the time they were submitted to the Panel, the sealing stamps should have cured and not have been subject to smearing when touched. Accordingly, the Panel finds that the documents were not issued in 2014, as alleged. The Panel also draws a negative inference from the inconsistency of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX name as between the certificate headers and the Ministry's seals, as the Panel anticipates that a government department would use a consistent name in the form headers on official documentation. The Panel also notes, while not fatal in itself, that the Claimant was unable to establish that the certificates had been sent from Afghanistan, as the envelope had been destroyed. In the circumstances, the Panel finds that the two certificates are not authentic.\n[33] The Claimant also submitted copies of two employment records purportedly from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which summarize aspects of his employment.21 The Claimant alleged, during the third sitting on June 23, 2016, that the originals were lost, it appears, while being sent to him in the mail. The Panel notes that the originals of these records were requested by the Panel at the first sitting on March 3, 2016. At the time of the second hearing, on April 28, 2016, the Claimant alleged that they were still in transit to him from Afghanistan, having been sent approximately one and a half weeks prior to the second hearing. When asked at that time why he had not been prepared with the originals at the initial hearing, he indicated that he forgot the documents were in Afghanistan. The Claimant was asked why he would provide copies, but not obtain the original documents. He stated that he had received electronic copies and that he was under the impression that originals were not necessary. It was noted to the Claimant that on March 3, 2016, he had been asked to obtain the originals; he was asked why the originals were only being sent approximately one and a half weeks before the second sitting on April 28, 2016. He explained that his brother had difficulty locating the original documents. The Claimant was asked why there was difficulty in locating the original documents if he was able to provide copies; he stated that he had electronic copies in his computer.\n[34] The purported loss of the documents aside, the Claimant was not diligent in meeting his obligations pursuant to the Refugee Protection Division Rules.22 Pursuant to Rule 11, the Claimant is expected to submit acceptable documentation to substantiate his claim, or to provide reasons for not doing so. Rule 42(1)(b) requires that original documents corresponding to any copies submitted in evidence must be provided no later than the beginning of the proceedings. In this case, the Panel had explicitly requested originals of his employment documentation at the initial sitting; his employment was a central aspect of his allegations. Nearly two months later, the documentation had only recently been sent to Canada and was still unavailable for the hearing resumption. The Panel further rejects the Claimant's explanations for their unavailability at the first and second sittings. He alleged that he had simply forgotten the original documents were in Afghanistan; however, the Panel does not accept that, as he was obviously alive to the issue of supporting his claim and had provided the copies of the very documents he alleged he had forgotten were in Afghanistan. He was also represented by experienced counsel throughout the proceedings, who is recorded as having assisted the Claimant in completing his amended BOC form, which was signed on January 25, 2016.23 As well, it stretches credulity that the Claimant's brother required nearly two months to locate the requested documents, sending them a few days prior to the second sitting, only to have the much-delayed documentation allegedly go missing in the mail prior to the third sitting, on June 23, 2016. The Panel is entitled to draw a negative credibility inference from a Claimant's failure to meet the requirements of Rules 11 and 42(1) where an explanation is not satisfactory.24 In all of the circumstances, the Panel draws a negative inference upon the authenticity of the employment summary records.\n[35] The Panel notes that the Claimant did not provide any other employment documentation, such as pay records or an employee identification card. On the latter point, the Claimant alleged, during the second sitting, that he had such a card, but that it was located in Kabul. Neither the original nor a copy of the card was submitted to the Panel. Therefore, no further documentary evidence has been submitted to assess and consider respecting the Claimant's employment.\nInconsistent Statements regarding Period of Government Employment\n[36] The Panel draws a negative credibility inference upon the Claimant's inconsistent statements regarding his period of employment at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[37] During the Claimant's second interview with a CBSA officer, Vanessa Andreatta, on January 7, 2016, at which he had an interpreter present, the Claimant indicated that he had worked at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for a period of three months.25 In the Claimant's IMM 5669 form, also signed on January 7, 2016, he indicates that he was employed by the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX from March 2014 to July 2014, which is consistent with his testimony and the employment certificates.26 During the second sitting, the Claimant was asked why he had stated in his interview that he had been employed for three months. He stated that he had not specifically reported three months, but rather had stated three to four months. The Claimant was asked if the interview notes, which were set out in a transcript format, did not accurately record his response when asked his length of employment; he confirmed that was the case. The Claimant was asked whether anything else in the notes from that interview were incorrect; he confirmed that there were no other inaccuracies.\n[38] The Panel rejects the Claimant's explanation for the inconsistency in the interview notes versus his testimony and other evidence. The Panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the interview notes correctly record the Claimant's statements. The Claimant had the benefit of an interpreter during the proceedings, the notes are set out in transcript format, and there were no other inaccuracies alleged by the Claimant. A three-month period versus a roughly five-month period, from March to July 2014, is material given the relative difference over the brief period of employment. In the circumstances, the Panel draws a negative credibility inference upon the Claimant's evidence that he was employed at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX from March to July 2014.\nNo Mention of Government Employment during Initial CBSA Interview\n[39] The Panel notes that the Claimant did not mention his alleged employment at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX when questioned during his initial CBSA interview on January 6, 2016 as to whether he faced any risks in Afghanistan.27 The Panel draws a negative credibility inference on this issue as it is central to his claim.\n[40] The Claimant alleged that he did not have a lawyer during the interview and that he wanted a lawyer in order to share his concerns. He also indicated that he was tired and cold during the interview. The Panel rejects this explanation as unreasonable; the Claimant discussed other risks that he faced in Afghanistan, including the general security situation and his belief that he would be interpreted as a Hindu for having travelled to India. It is, therefore, apparent that there was no barrier to the Claimant discussing a detail that would later be central to his allegations.\n[41] Given the central role of his employment, the Panel draws a negative credibility inference from his failure to mention that employment during the initial CBSA interview when specifically asked about risks that he faced in Afghanistan.\nInconsistent Testimony respecting the Number of Threatening Phone Calls\n[42] The Panel draws a negative credibility inference upon the Claimant's inconsistent testimony regarding the number of threatening phone calls that he received while in Afghanistan.\n[43] At the Claimant's second CBSA interview, which was on January 7, 2016, the Claimant was again asked about his purpose for making a refugee claim.28 He stated that the Taliban threatened him in Kabul and that he worked for the XXXX XXXX XXXX as a XXXX for three months. When asked how he was threatened, he indicated that he was threatened in person and by phone. However, he went on to state that he was contacted once by phone and not in person. When the officer asked why he had indicated he had been threatened in person and by phone, he stated that the Taliban told his relatives that they would kill him if he continued to work for the government. When asked when he was contacted by phone, he stated that it was \"three to four months ago\"; given the timing of the interview in January 2016, that would place the single phone call to approximately September 2015. When asked about the content of the phone call, the Claimant said that he was told to leave his government job and return to his village or they would kill him. When asked when the Taliban had contacted his relatives, he stated that there was one occasion after the phone call. He denied that he received any other threats.\n[44] At the hearing, the Claimant stated that when he came back from India, he started to receive phone calls from his aforementioned former supervisor, XXXX XXXX, and individuals who introduced themselves as the Taliban. He was asked when he first started to receive phone calls from the Taliban; he stated August 7 or 8, 2015. The Claimant stated that he was told that he needed to cooperate with XXXX XXXX and that he was threatened with death if he did not cooperate. The Claimant stated that he received six or seven threatening phone calls altogether and that is was an ongoing occurrence until he arrived in Canada.\n[45] The Claimant was asked why he indicated in the CBSA interview that he received a single threatening phone call, whereas in his testimony, he stated that he received multiple threatening phone calls. The Claimant indicated that the single phone call was in reference to contact with the Taliban, while the multiple phone calls were in reference to phone calls from the Taliban and his colleague, XXXX XXXX. The Claimant was asked how many times he was contacted by XXXX XXXX XXXX he stated three to four times. When asked how many times the Taliban had contacted him, he indicated that XXXX XXXX's three to four instances of contact came with the incitement of the Taliban. When asked again as to the number of phone calls from the Taliban, separated from XXXX XXXX, he stated that he could not separate the calls, as some calls came with a Taliban identity. When asked what was meant by a Taliban identity, he stated that the caller identified himself as a representative of the Taliban and that the Claimant must do tasks for the Taliban.\n[46] The Claimant was then asked why he would tell the officer that there was only a single phone call from the Taliban if he was unable to draw a distinction between the threatening phone calls that he received. He indicated that he was in fear because he was hoping to be released from custody; he went on to say that he wanted to meet his lawyer in order to go through the details. When asked why the total number of phone calls was a detail that he would withhold, he indicated that he was not in the right state of mind and that he wanted to finish the interview immediately.\n[47] The Panel rejects the Claimant's explanation. He confirmed during the interview that there was a single phone call and no further threats. He attempted to draw a distinction between the single phone call he mentioned in the interview and the multiple phone calls he alleged in his testimony; however, his inability to separate the phone calls from XXXX XXXX versus Taliban callers undermined that alleged distinction. Further, this alleged desire to speak to counsel and to promptly end the interview in order to secure his release does not satisfactorily account for why he would confirm inaccurate details during an interview with Canadian authorities. He provided a direct response when asked about the number of phone calls; he was also able to provide other details of the alleged threats that he faced. He is simply inconsistent between his testimony and his statement during the second CBSA interview as to the number of Taliban phone calls. Accordingly, the Panel draws a negative credibility inference as to his allegation that he received threatening phone calls from the Taliban.\nInconsistent Testimony Respecting the Timing of Threatening Phone Calls\n[48] The Panel draws a negative credibility inference upon the Claimant's inconsistent testimony as to when he first started to receive threatening phone calls in Afghanistan.\n[49] As noted, he had initially indicated in his testimony that he had started to receive Taliban-linked phone calls in August 2015. The Claimant also confirmed at that point in his testimony that he did not have any prior trouble with the Taliban or individuals alleging a Taliban link. The Claimant was asked why his BOC narrative indicated that he travelled to India, which he had earlier testified was from January to July 2015, because of Taliban phone calls threatening his life if those calls did not commence until August 2015.29 The Claimant indicated that he started to receive phone calls in 2014; he alleged that soon after he quit his employment in July 2014, he started to receive phone calls in that same month. The Claimant was asked why his testimony as to the start of the phone calls had changed from August 2015 to July 2014. He responded that he believed the Panel was asking about phone calls since he returned from India. The Panel asked if he had understood the Panel's question as to whether he had any trouble with Taliban-linked phone calls prior to August 2015 as being limited to the period since he returned from India; he indicated that is how he interpreted the question.\n[50] It was put to the Claimant that his BOC narrative indicated that he started to receive threatening phone calls while he was still employed at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.30 The Claimant testified that he had actually started to receive phone calls prior to July 2014, while he was still employed at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The Claimant was asked why he had told the Panel that the phone calls commenced in July 2014. He testified that these were not death threats, but only very dangerous calls; the threats only became serious once he left his employment. He stated that he was not directly told that he would be killed, only that he would suffer the worse of situations. The Claimant was asked why his BOC narrative indicated that he was told he would be killed while he still worked at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.31 He stated that he received threats, but they were not clear that he would be killed. He was again asked why his BOC narrative indicated that he was threatened with death. He indicated that perhaps it was an issue with translation, but that the end result of the threats was death in any event; he alleged that the BOC narrative was accurate in its detail on the issue.\n[51] The Panel rejects the Claimant's explanation for the inconsistencies in his testimony respecting the timing of the threatening phone calls. His testimony evolved throughout questioning on the point. He was asked straightforward questions regarding the start of the phone calls; his testimony changed from August 2015, to later in July 2014 after his employment ended, to prior to July 2014 while he was still employed. His distinctions are circular and nonsensical. He was directly asked if he had any trouble with Taliban-linked individuals prior to August 2015; he confirmed that there were no issues. However, once inconsistencies began to be put to him, he alleged that he only believed he was asked about problems arising since his return from India. There was no aspect of his initial examination that would indicate that the Claimant was being questioned only with respect to issues arising since India, especially once he was asked the broad question as to whether he had any problems with Taliban-linked individuals prior to August 2015. Further, on his own evidence, there was no actual distinction between the \"dangerous\" phone calls that he received while he was still employed versus the calls that directly threatened his life after the end of his employment. His explanation, then, as to why he again changed his testimony on the point is rejected. In all of the circumstances, the Panel draws a negative credibility inference as to the Claimant's receipt of threatening phone calls in Afghanistan.\nNo Mention of Principal Threats during CBSA Interviews\n[52] The Panel draws a negative credibility inference as the Claimant did not mention threats at his CBSA interviews in January 2016 that would later form the basis of his central allegations.\n[53] During the Claimant's initial interview on January 6, 2016, as already noted, the officer asked the Claimant why he was making a refugee claim in Canada.32 He indicated that he wished to obtain citizenship. When asked by the officer if he had any fear of returning to Afghanistan, he stated that he feared the security situation in Afghanistan, and made reference to the danger of suicide bombers. The officer then asked the Claimant whether he faced any specific risk; he stated that he lived in India from January to July 2015 and studied English there; he stated that he would be perceived as a Hindu in Afghanistan, despite remaining a Muslim.\n[54] The Claimant was questioned during the hearing as to why he did not mention the threats that he subsequently alleged in his BOC form, being threats from the Taliban, XXXX XXXX XXXX and his Uncle XXXX. As already noted above, he indicated that he wanted a lawyer before providing further details and that he was tired and cold during the interview, and so he simply wished for it to end. There was, also, a general \"theme\" that the Claimant had difficulty understanding the officer at this interview and was intimidated.\n[55] The Panel rejects the Claimant's explanations. The Claimant was specifically asked about risks that he faced in Afghanistan. It is clear that he understood the officer's questions, as he was responsive to them and was able to articulate two areas of concern. It is also evident, based on the length and amount of detail in the interview notes, some of which is noted with respect to the Charter application, that the Claimant generally understood the nature of the questions that were put to him. Further, this is not a case where he simply provided more fulsome details of his circumstances following an interview; he left out any mention whatsoever of the principal threats that he faced in Afghanistan. The issue of right to counsel has already been addressed; in any event, whether he had spoken to counsel or not does not satisfactorily address the issue of why he would speak to two areas of concern, but leave out any reference to what would be his principal allegations. Nor does it satisfactorily address why, after successfully reaching the country he hoped would provide him protection, he would apparently withhold details of why he fled from Afghanistan.\n[56] The Claimant's failure to mention any of these core allegations at his initial interview, in all of the circumstances, indicates to the Panel that his alleged concerns were a subsequent construct. Accordingly, the Panel draws a negative credibility inference upon the Claimant's evidence that he received threats from the Taliban, XXXX XXXX, or from his Uncle XXXX.\n[57] The Panel also notes that the Claimant did not mention any threats from his uncle during the second CBSA interview on January 7, 2016, despite confirming to the officer that there were no further unmentioned threats. When the issue of missing details from the January 7, 2016 interview versus the Claimant's BOC, as amended, was put to the Claimant by his counsel, the Claimant again spoke of wanting a lawyer to share further details. Counsel asked the Claimant whether he had an opportunity to speak to a lawyer before the January 7, 2016 CBSA interview; the Claimant responded in the negative. When counsel noted that the interview notes from that date indicated that he spoke to Legal Aid, the Claimant indicated that he had spoken to a lawyer by phone, but that he wanted a meeting with counsel face-to-face to explain; he also noted that time was very limited. The Claimant's apparent belief that circumstances were still insufficient for him to be forthright in describing his fears with Canadian immigration officials is not a satisfactory explanation and it is, therefore, rejected. He spoke to a Legal Aid duty counsel as well as had a Pashtun interpreter for the second interview. The Claimant was directly questioned with respect to his fears in Afghanistan; he was able to describe threats that he faced from the Taliban and also to advise that he was employed by the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. His failure to again make any mention of a key risk, that being the danger arising from his uncle, leads the Panel to draw a negative credibility inference as to his allegations.\nCredibility Assessment\n[58] The Panel has drawn a number of negative credibility inferences and made a number of negative findings respecting the authenticity of the Claimant's employment documentation, inconsistencies in his testimony relating to his employment and the alleged threats, and key omissions and inconsistencies from his statements to CBSA officers relating to his employment and the alleged threats. These issues all go to central aspects of the Claimant's allegations.\n[59] Given the constellation of negative credibility inferences and negative findings on central aspects of the claim, the Panel finds, as per Sheikh,33 that the cumulative effect undermines the credibility of the Claimant in general. Accordingly, the Panel finds that the Claimant is not a credible or trustworthy witness. Further, the Panel finds that this lack of general credibility extends to all relevant aspects of his testimony.\n[60] There is no further witness testimony, documentation, or any other evidence before the Panel to address the Claimant's allegations that he was employed by the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX or that he faced threats from the Taliban, XXXX XXXX XXXX his Uncle XXXX XXXX or any other individuals while in Afghanistan.\n[61] Consequently, the Panel finds that the Claimant was never an employee of the Ministry of Women's Affairs or otherwise employed in the Afghanistan government. Further, the Panel finds that the Claimant did not receive any threats from the Taliban, XXXX XXXX, his Uncle XXXX XXXX or any other individuals while in Afghanistan. Accordingly, the Panel is not satisfied that there is a prospective risk to the Claimant in Afghanistan with respect to his allegations that he was a government employee or having been the recipient of direct threats. Owing to the credibility issues, the claim is not established whether it is assessed pursuant to s. 96 or ss. 97(1) of IRPA.\nResidual Profile\n[62] It is necessary to address counsel's submission that the Claimant's travel to Canada, the United States, and India, we well as his foreign associations and activities, will place him within the risk profile, as outlined in the UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Asylum-Seekers from Afghanistan (\"UNHCR Guidelines\"), of an individual who will be perceived in Afghanistan as Westernized.34\n[63] The Panel accepts that the Claimant travelled to India and the United States, as indicated in his passport.35 The Claimant has also clearly travelled to Canada and been present here since January 2016. Given the Claimant's general credibility issues, however, the Panel is not satisfied that he has been engaged in parties and the exploration of other religious practices while abroad. The three photographs in evidence of the Claimant posing with individuals do not establish such activity.36 In any event, even if he had done so, there is no credible or reliable evidence before the Panel to indicate that such activity would come to the attention of the Taliban or other elements in Afghanistan that would cause the Claimant harm. The Panel also notes that the Claimant did not attend studies in the United States and appears to have simply transited through in order to make a refugee protection claim in Canada.37 The Panel further notes that the Claimant, in his initial CBSA interview from January 6, 2016, indicated that he remains a Muslim.38\n[64] Therefore, the remaining issue is whether, by virtue of the Claimant's travel to India, the United States, and Canada, the Claimant will be perceived as Westernized in Afghanistan. The UNHCR Guidelines indicate that individuals who are perceived to have \"adopted values and\/or appearances associated with Western countries\" may be targeted by anti-government elements.39 There are also \"reports of individuals who returned from Western countries having been tortured or killed by [anti-government elements] on the grounds that they had become 'foreigners' or that they were spies for a Western country.\"40 In the footnotes of the UNHCR Guidelines, there is a news report from October 2014 cited, which indicates that an unsuccessful Afghan asylum-seeker deported from Australia was singled out while travelling on a bus between Ghazni province and Kabul after photographs of Australia were discovered on his phone.41\n[65] There is insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence before the Panel to indicate that the Claimant has adopted and would maintain values and appearances associated with Western countries. With respect to potential danger as a result of being a returnee from Western countries, there is insufficient evidence before the Panel to indicate that such a factor will, in itself, place the Claimant at a \"serious possibility\" of persecution. The UNHCR Guidelines only refer to a single incident from 2014; the Panel was not directed to and is not aware of any further evidence before it to indicate the extent of similar incidents. The Panel notes that the UNHCR Guidelines also do not explicitly indicate that mere presence in Western countries will establish a claim for refugee protection.\n[66] Accordingly, the Panel finds that the Claimant has not established that he is at a serious possibility of persecution as a result of a potential perception that he is a Westernized individual. A claim is not established whether the issue is assessed with regard to s. 96 or ss. 97(1) of IRPA, given that the evidence does not meet even the \"serious possibility\" standard.\nCONCLUSION\n[67] The Panel concludes that the Claimant is not a Convention refugee, pursuant to s. 96 of IRPA, as he does not face a serious possibility of persecution in Afghanistan. As there is no further evidence that the Claimant would satisfy the risks delineated pursuant to ss. 97(1) of IRPA, which requires a higher standard of risk than s. 96 of IRPA, the Panel further finds that the Claimant is not a person in need of protection. Therefore, the claim is rejected.\nNo Credible Basis\n[68] As the Panel has rejected the Claimant's credibility and corroborative documents, and further credible or trustworthy evidence has not been provided, there is no credible or trustworthy evidence upon which the Panel could have come to a favourable decision. The Panel, therefore, finds that the claim has no credible basis pursuant to ss. 107(2) of IRPA.\n(signed)\nRobert L.

For the purposes of the claims for refugee protection, in accordance with subsection 167(2) of the IRPA, the Refugee Protection Division appointed the principal claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX as the designated representative for minor claimants, her children, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[4] The panel took into consideration The Chairperson's Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution when considering the process of the hearing and the facts in this case.2 All relevant factors, such as social and cultural context in which the principal claimant found herself, along with the issue of state protection was examined with consideration of the Chairperson's Gender Guidelines.\nALLEGATIONS\n[5] The complete story alleging the basis of the claimants' fears are captured in the basis of claim form (\"BOC\"). The claimants each filed their own BOC; however, the claimants relied on the allegations contained in the principal claimant's BOC. The two adult claimants, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX testified.\n[6] The claimants allege that their family is at risk from XXXX XXXX XXXX former business partner as well as from aligned religious extremists.\nIDENTITY\n[7] The claimants' identities as nationals of Bangladesh are established by their passports, copies of which are on file.2\nDETERMINATION\n[8] For the reasons that follow the panel finds that the claimants have failed to provide credible evidence that there is a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground or that on a balance of probabilities, they would personally be subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment should they return to Bangladesh.\nANALYSIS\n[9] In assessing this claim, the panel focused on the credibility of the claimants' allegations.\n[10] The claimants' allegations are found in the basis of claim form of the principal claimant. They can be summarized as follows. A business partner, XXXX XXXX, of the claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX, husband of the principal claimant showed romantic interest in the principal claimant. XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX had started a business together, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX2011.\n[11] XXXX XXXX denied that he had made romantic advances on the principal claimant and accused the principal claimant of making romantic advances towards him. Further threats were made against the claimants by family and associates of XXXX XXXX owning to his membership in the ruling Awami League and the XXXX XXXX XXXX membership in the opposition affiliated Jatiya Party.\n[12] Further, the claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX spoke out against the Awami League at a rally. This caused further threats from XXXX XXXX. This also led to an attack by Awami League affiliated persons on XXXX XXXX XXXX.\n[13] On XXXX XXXX2014, XXXX XXXX successfully forced XXXX XXXX XXXX from their business partnership. XXXX XXXX XXXX asked XXXX XXXX for money to compensate him for his part of the failed partnership. This resulted in further threats from XXXX XXXX and his associates.\n[14] XXXX XXXX XXXX left for the United States in XXXX 2014 along with the principal claimant to explore business opportunities. After one month the principal claimant returned to Bangladesh.\n[15] After the claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX returned to Bangladesh, the principal claimant was attacked in her home and threats resumed. Attempts to go to the police were fruitless.\nCredibility\n[16] For the reasons that follow the panel finds the claimants lack credibility. The claimants made an application for a visa to the United States in XXXX 2013.3 In this application the claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX states he is the owner of \"XXXX XXXX\", a XXXX.\n[17] The claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX was confronted at the hearing by the panel with this discrepancy as the US Visa application does not mention XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The claimant explained the he was unable to get the original documents for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX at the time but was working at \"XXXX XXXX\", owned by his father for a six month period at that time.\n[18] The claimant was confronted that he did not mention \"XXXX XXXX\" on his Schedule A background form at the time of making his claim.4 The claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX testified that \"XXXX XXXX\" belonged to his father and that he only worked their six months.\n[19] The panel rejects these explanations. The claimant, XXXX XXXX XXXX involvement with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX goes to the heart of this claim. The claimant had the opportunity to disclose that he was working somewhere else for a six month period at the time of his claim and failed to do so. The panel finds his explanation for not disclosing this insufficient.\n[20] The case law has established that any omission in a previous version of the facts must be examined in its context and be assessed in light of all of the evidence; a claimant's credibility cannot be impugned when the changes made to the BOC Form are minimal and the claimant has provided a plausible explanation of the corrections made (V.V. v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 1097 (CanLII) at para 34 [V.V.]).\n[21] However, \"the impact is different when omissions have to do with the facts that directly concern the very basis of a claim for refugee protection\"(V.V., above, at para 35; see Zeferino, above, at paras 31-32; Aragon v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2008 FC 144 (CanLII) at para 21).5\n[22] This matter goes to the very heart of the claim. The main basis of the claim surrounds the claimant's involvement in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX beginning in XXXX 2011 until XXXX 2014. The claimant makes no mention of any other businesses or work positions other than XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX during this time on any of his documents relating to his claim or in the supporting documents filed for this claim. The claimant on his United States visa application in XXXX 2013 mentions only XXXX XXXX and that he is the owner. The panel has to weigh the claimants explanation, that he was working there at the time and it was convenient to provide this occupation for documentation purposes. This however then is a significant omission from the claimants Schedule A on which he had no reason to lie. Further, it was open to the claimants to present documents showing family ownership or exactly who owns XXXX XXXX or the claimant's involvement at that time, they failed to do so.\n[23] Given the discrepancies and omissions the panel cannot afford the evidence of the claimants related to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX any weight.\n[24] Medical evidence provided related to injuries suffered by the claimants can be afforded little weight. They demonstrate that the claimants suffered injuries in Bangladesh, but given the serious credibility concerns regarding the claimants' explanations for these, that they resulted from his involvement with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the panel has no credible evidence on how these occurred.\n[25] Letters provided are written by the claimants or close associates who the panel had no opportunity to question. The panel affords these little weight given the credibility concerns.\n[26] Though the claimants have provided documents purporting to show registration licensing of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, on a balance the panel affords these documents little weight. The panel has no way of verifying the genuineness of these documents. As well, no original documents were available for the panel to examine. In light of all the evidence, these photocopies are of limited value.\n[27] Finally, the panel asked the claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX why he continued to have problems with XXXX XXXX, after XXXX XXXX 2014, given XXXX XXXX had succeeded in driving the claimant from their business. The claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX answered that it was because he sent a relative to ask for his money back and had made a general diary complaint to the police, which according to the claimants the police were doing nothing about. The panel does not find this credible. The panel cannot see why XXXX XXXX would continue to threaten the claimants given he had the business, the police were doing nothing about the complaint and he asked for the money back. The panel does not find it reasonable that the threats would have continued.\nFailure to claim in the United States\n[28] The claimant XXXX XXXX XXXX was asked why the claimants did not claim in the United States after he arrived there on XXXX XXXX 2014. XXXX XXXX XXXX testified that he thought his problems were over when XXXX XXXX had forced him from their business.\n[29] A reasonable person would expect that the threats the claimants had endured over a number of years, which continued through the month of XXXX 2014 would have been reason enough for the claimants to have made a claim in the United States. Further the claimants contradict themselves with this explanation on their BOC that states that the reason they left for the United States on XXXX XXXX 2014 was they were scared after a number of threats to family members by XXXX XXXX and his associates after the claimant had been forced from their business.\n[30] The claimants had more than enough reason to make a claim when they resided in a country that is a signatory to the Convention for one month in the case of the principal claimant, or six months in the case of XXXX XXXX XXXX. However, according to the principal claimant she had no problem when she returned to Bangladesh after a month. The panel rejects that explanation as inadequate and find if she was in fact experiencing the problems they had in Bangladesh prior to going to the United States they would have made a claim in the United States.\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Activity\n[31] The principal claimant alleges that she worked for an XXXX from XXXX XXXX2014 until XXXX2016. The XXXX informed women of the importance of education their daughters and of family planning.\n[32] The principal claimant was yelled at in XXXX 2016 by religious fundamentalists that what she was doing was wrong. As a result she stopped and nothing further came from this.\n[33] Though this incident is unfortunate, the mistreatment suffered was not serious enough to constitute a key denial of a core human right under section 96 of the IRPA. It also does not reach the threshold of harm under section 97 of the IRPA as it is not torture, a threat to life or so excessive as to outrage standards of decency. Therefore this incident is peripheral to this claim.\nCONCLUSION\n[34] The claimants' contradictions and inconsistencies surrounding the basis of their claim undermines their credibility, particular regarding their involvement in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Given that this claim is based on the largely on their involvement in that business, and given the other contradictions particularly that there was ongoing problems from XXXX XXXX when the panel does not see a reason why that would have continued. Finally, their failure to claim in the United States and their contradictory explanations surrounding this further undermine their credibility. The panel finds there is insufficient credible evidence to find on a balance of probabilities that the claimants are at risk in Bangladesh.\n[35] Having considered the totality of the evidence, including the claimant's testimony, as well as the cumulative credibility concerns, the panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimants did not provide sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to establish their allegations.\n[36] Having considered all of the evidence, the panel determines that there is not a serious possibility that the claimants would be persecuted in Bangladesh, or that, on a balance of probabilities, the claimants would be personally subjected to a danger of torture or face a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Bangladesh.\n[37] The panel finds that the claimants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. The panel, therefore, rejects the claims.\n(signed)\n\"M. Beatty\"\nM.

Their children, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX(collectively, the \"Minor Claimants\"), are also citizens of Afghanistan and Russia. They claim refugee protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1\nALLEGATIONS\n[2] The alleged circumstances underlying the claims are contained in lengthy detail in the Claimants' Basis of Claim (\"BOC\") forms,2 and are supplemented by the Claimants' oral testimony and supporting documents.3 The Claimants allege a fear of harm in both Afghanistan and Russia. The circumstances related to Russia are most relevant to the present decision.\n[3] The Principal Claimant was born in Herat, Afghanistan, in XXXX 1971 and subsequently resided in Kabul, Afghanistan, until 1984. His father served in various XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, including as XXXX XXXX of the XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. The Claimant's father eventually fell out of favour with the government. In 1984, the Principal Claimant moved to Russia and established a life there, becoming a citizen in 1999. In 2004, he married the Secondary Claimant, who had been born in Kabul, Afghanistan, in XXXX 1980 and who was the daughter of an XXXX XXXX, in a traditional ceremony. The adult Claimants resided in Moscow, Russia, following the marriage. They were both employed in Russia; the Principal Claimant was most recently employed there in the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and the Secondary Claimant was employed in XXXX. They had two children while living in Russia; a son, XXXX, in XXXX 2006 and a daughter, XXXX, in XXXX2007. The Claimants experienced various incidents of racism over the years while residing in Moscow on account of their ethnicity, such as frequent derogatory comments, as well as threats of and actual violence. Their children also faced racism, including in the education system, and came to be affected by it.\n[4] In XXXX 2013, the Minor Claimant, XXXX, was assaulted by another student, XXXX XXXX, at their private pre-school. XXXX father was a powerful and wealthy man, believed by the Principal Claimant to be connected to the mafia, who had assigned a bodyguard to XXXX. The bodyguard assaulted the Principal Claimant when he attempted to intervene between the Minor Claimant, XXXX, and XXXX. The Principal Claimant reported the matter to the police, but they were unhelpful in resolving the matter. Following the police report, the Principal Claimant received threatening phone calls telling him to leave Russia with his family and to not make further police reports. In XXXX 2013, a group of men visited the Claimants' home, called the Claimants derogatory names, and told the Claimants to leave. The adult Claimants took the two Minor Claimants out of school over safety concerns. In XXXX 2013, two men went to the Principal Claimant's office and attempted to extort protection money from him in exchange for his family's safety. They also told him not to complain to the police, and to also withdraw the earlier police complaint respecting the XXXX incident. Although uncertain, the Principal Claimant believed that these various incidents were related to the dispute at the preschool.\n[5] During this timeframe, in late XXXX or early XXXX 2013, the Secondary Claimant attended an appointment with a maternity doctor regarding her third pregnancy; she was advised to have an early Caesarean section due to pregnancy difficulties. After doing research, the adult Claimants learned that such an early operation would place the child's safety at risk; they believed the maternity doctor was intentionally attempting to place the child at risk due to racial prejudices.\n[6] In XXXX 2013, the Claimants decided to relocate to Indonesia over their concerns of discrimination and persecution in Russia. They believed that other areas of Russia were unsafe for minorities and so they decided relocation within Russia would not be appropriate. They also did not wish to relocate to Afghanistan due to safety concerns in that country. The Secondary Claimant and two Minor Claimants travelled to Indonesia on XXXX 17, 2013, followed by the Principal Claimant in XXXX 2013 after he visited Afghanistan. The Secondary Claimant gave birth in XXXX 2013 while in Indonesia to the third Minor Claimant, XXXX, who did not receive Indonesian citizenship, but did become a Russian citizen by virtue of the adult Claimants' status.\n[7] The Claimants departed Indonesia, where they did not have permanent status, in XXXX 2016 and travelled to the United States on tourist visas. They then travelled to the Canadian border at Fort Erie and initiated claims for refugee protection.\nDETERMINATION\n[8] For the reasons that follow, the Panel determines that the Claimants are not Convention refugees, nor persons in need of protection. Therefore, the claims are rejected.\nANALYSIS\n[9] The determinative issue in this case is internal flight alternative (\"IFA\") within Russia.\nIdentity\n[10] The Panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the Claimants have established their personal identities and identities as nationals of Russia on the basis of their Russian passports, certified true copies of which were provided by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.4\nCredibility\n[11] The adult Claimants testified before the Panel. Their testimony was generally internally and externally consistent on all material points. The Panel did not note any significant concerns with respect to intentionally misleading evidence. The Panel accepts the Claimants as credible and trustworthy witnesses insofar as their evidence regarding their backgrounds, events experienced by them, and their perception of life in Russia and Afghanistan. As will be explained below, the objective country documentation is preferred with respect to actual conditions in the relevant IFA location. This concern respecting the objective basis for the Claimants' perception of conditions in the IFA location was noted to counsel at the hearing.\nInternal Flight Alternative\n[12] The steps in an assessment of an internal flight alternative have been clearly established:5\na. Is there a serious possibility of persecution for the claimant(s) in the area of the country identified for the IFA? And,\nb. Is the proposed IFA reasonable for the claimant(s) in all of the circumstances?\n[13] At the outset of the hearing, the Panel identified three potential internal flight alternatives in Russia: Rostov-on-Don, St. Petersburg, and Novosibirsk. Although three potential IFA locations were identified by the Panel at the hearing, it is only necessary to focus on the location of Rostov-on-Don, Russia, in these reasons.\nThe Claimants do not Face a Serious Possibility of Persecution within an IFA Location\n[14] The first prong of the analysis addresses whether the Claimants would face a serious possibility of persecution within the proposed IFA locations. The Panel concludes that the Claimants would not face such a risk in Rostov-on-Don.\n[15] The adult Claimants were asked to explain their concerns with respect to the prospect of relocation to the IFA locations identified by the Panel. They addressed their concerns generally against all three locations; indeed, they characterized their concerns as applying to all cities outside of Moscow.\n[16] The Principal Claimant expressed concerns with respect to racially-motivated crimes and difficulties for ethnic minorities; general crime, such as robbery and theft; official corruption; and mafia activity. He cited an example of a news story in which police in St. Petersburg were unhelpful to a man of Afghan and Tajik ethnicity whose daughter was assaulted. He also indicated that financial problems and issues of poverty are worse in cities outside of Moscow, as well as there being a lack of employment opportunities. Further, he expressed concerns with respect to alcohol consumption by residents. The Principal Claimant was asked if there were any further concerns he would like to add regarding the identified IFA cities; he indicated that he did not have anything further to add. The Principal Claimant was asked whether he had ever personally travelled to Rostov-on-Don; he indicated that he had not been to the city.\n[17] The Secondary Claimant agreed with the concerns of the Principal Claimant regarding the proposed IFA locations. She also indicated that the Claimants' appearance would subject them to discrimination, including with respect to employment and in raising three children. She indicated that there are negative perceptions of Afghans owing to the loss of Russian lives during the Soviet-Afghan war. The Secondary Claimant also indicated that she had never travelled to Rostov-on-Don.\n[18] The Secondary Claimant, as designated representative for the Minor Claimants, was asked whether she had any concerns regarding the Minor Claimants in addition to the issues that were raised with respect to the adult Claimants. She indicated that she had no further testimony.\n[19] As noted, the Claimants alleged that they were threatened by people they believed were associated to the father of XXXX XXXX, a fellow preschool student of the Minor Claimant, XXXX.6 The BOC narrative indicates that the father was a powerful and wealthy man, although teachers at the school were uncertain as to his occupation.7 XXXX allegedly travelled with a bodyguard.8 The Principal Claimant was canvassed for details respecting XXXX father. He indicated that he did not have many details to provide, other than to reiterate that the father was wealthy, and that such individuals are often connected to the police or mafia. He indicated that he never faced the father directly, but dealt with threats from the father's bodyguards and associates. The Principal Claimant was asked by the Panel to confirm whether the problems with the father and his associates arose out of the issue with XXXX, being the preschool dispute between XXXX and the Minor Claimant, XXXX. He indicated that was the source of the problems; he also indicated that the ethnicity of the Claimants left them with a lack of effective protection by the police in the matter. The Principal Claimant indicated that he last received threats related to the dispute with XXXX father in approximately XXXX 2013. As noted, the Claimants departed to Indonesia soon after that time.\n[20] Counsel did not conduct any examination of the Claimants. In submissions, counsel relied to a fair extent on the Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2015 from the United States Department of State contained in the National Documentation Package (NDP).9 In that report, it indicates that the law prohibits discrimination based on nationality, but minorities were increasingly subjected to discrimination by government officials.10 A human rights non-governmental organization reported that by August for the year 2015, racial violence resulted in the death of five individuals, 47 injuries, and four death threats.11 While incidents were reported across twelve regions, violence tended to be concentrated in Moscow and St. Petersburg; the report does not appear to identify the other regions that experienced violence.12 The report indicates that nationalist groups were active in promoting racial violence, although reports of \"skinhead\" violence had decreased from previous years.13 While the Panel recognizes that there is mixed evidence regarding the extent that officials have pursued enforcement, including on the evidence of the Claimants, the report indicates that courts and authorities continued to take action against those perpetrating ethnic violence, including by imposing convictions upon extremists for carrying out racist violence in the Rostov oblast in February 2015.14\n[21] The Panel has also considered the other relevant documentary evidence before it respecting country conditions in Russia.15 One document of particular relevance is contained in the NDP, which is the ECRI Report on the Russian Federation from 2013, published by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance.16 That report indicates that, despite substantial efforts to address racist violence, radical nationalism is on the rise and there is a high incidence of racist violence that is predominantly directed against individuals of \"non-Slav appearance\", particularly those from the North Caucasus and Central Asia.17\n[22] The same report goes on to detail the circumstances faced by ethnic minorities in Rostov-on-Don in particular, which is comprised of \"24 distinct ethnic communities and people of more than 150 different 'nationalities'\".18 The report indicates that \"authorities and representatives of numerous ethnic groups informed ECRI that there is an atmosphere of tolerance and respect between the different communities in the region.\"19 An Advisory Committee on Inter-ethnic Issues was created under the Ministry of Internal and Information Policy, which is comprised of law enforcement authorities, Ministry staff, and leaders of various ethnic communities.20 As a result of regular meetings, dialogue, and cooperation, ethnic and other tensions have been rapidly and effectively \"diffused\".21 There is an indication that at least one group of ethnic minorities from outside the region, those from the North Caucasus, have \"felt welcomed\" and integrated well in Rostov.22\n[23] The report also addresses the situation of Muslims throughout Russia, which is the religious identity of the Claimants.23 It notes that Russia is home to 20 million Muslims, according to official records, or 23 million according to unofficial estimates.24 Muslims reported an improvement in their situation over five years at the time of the report, although there were occasional acts of violence and vandalism.25 The report also notes that Russia has provided \"good support\" with respect to social, religious, and educational projects.26\n[24] The Panel is not aware of any evidence before it, nor was it directed to any, to indicate that conditions in Rostov-on-Don respecting ethnic and religious minorities have deteriorated in any significant manner since the issuance of the ECRI report.\n[25] Although the Panel accepts that the Claimants believe that they face risks of ethnic targeting in cities throughout Russia, including with respect to the proposed IFA locations, the Panel finds that there is no objective basis to this belief with regard to Rostov-on-Don. Neither of the adult Claimants have been to Rostov-on-Don; therefore, they do not have first-hand knowledge of conditions in that city. The NDP indicates that the authorities and ethnic communities have successfully collaborated to address ethnic tensions in the city, and that there is an atmosphere of tolerance and respect experienced by the broad number of ethnic groups present there. Moreover, North Caucasians, who have faced discrimination elsewhere in Russia, have successfully integrated in the Rostov region. The Panel also notes, with respect to religion specifically, that Muslims appear to face a generally low risk of problems throughout Russia. Therefore, the Panel finds that a serious possibility of persecution on account of the Claimants' ethnic and religious identity is not established with respect to the proposed IFA of Rostov-on-Don. The Panel will address the other concerns respecting Rostov-on-Don that were raised by the Claimants, such as general crime and economic issues, within the consideration of reasonableness of the IFA as these issues are of a more generalized concern.\n[26] With respect to any potential for XXXX father, or his associates, to pursue the Claimants to Rostov-on-Don, the Panel finds that any such concern is speculative and not established on the evidence. The dispute arose over a matter of bullying in a Moscow preschool in XXXX 2013.27 The last report of threats was in or about XXXX 2013. There was not an extensive history of involvement between the parties prior to the Claimants' departure from Russia, and there is no ongoing relationship or interaction between the parties. The origin of the problems and the last report of threats are now remote in time. There is no evidence that this individual would have any ongoing interest in the Claimants if they returned to Russia and relocated outside of Moscow. Further, despite the allegation that XXXX father is wealthy and powerful, there is insufficient evidence to establish that he would have the means to learn of the Claimants' return to the country or their relocation to Rostov-on-Don. Therefore, the Panel is not satisfied that XXXX father, or his associates, pose a prospective risk to the Claimants in Rostov-on-Don.\n[27] The Panel finds, based on a consideration of the Claimants' evidence and the preponderance of evidence set out in the various country condition documents, that the Claimants do not face a serious possibility of persecution within the proposed IFA of Rostov-on-Don.\nThe Relevant IFA Location is Reasonable for the Claimants\n[28] As noted, the second step of the IFA consideration is whether the proposed IFA locations are reasonable in all of the circumstances. The Panel concludes that Rostov-on-Don, in particular, is a reasonable IFA location.\n[29] The Principal Claimant resided in Russia from 1984 to 2013, although he had occasional absences from the country of one or two years. He estimated that he resided in Russia for a total of 27 years, adjusted for any periods of absence. The Principal Claimant has approximately sixteen years of education and possesses a master's degree in XXXX XXXX, although he noted the characterization of it as a master's degree may vary outside Russia. He speaks Russian, English, Dari, and Bulgarian. From 1999 to 2004, he worked at an XXXX XXXX company in Moscow. From 2006, he had a XXXX of and had a XXXX XXXX in a Russian business that was engaged in XXXX XXXX XXXX, which were purchased abroad and resold domestically, for XXXX and XXXX XXXX. He characterized his family as being above lower class but below middle class in Russia. In his characterization of classes, he indicated that the middle class owned a house and a car, but that his family, while owning a car, only rented their home. The Panel notes that the Claimants did enroll their children in private school and that the Claimants indicated in their narrative that they did well financially in Russia.28 After the Claimants' relocation to Indonesia in 2013, the Principal Claimant found employment travelling to various countries as the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.29\n[30] The Secondary Claimant resided in Russia with the Principal Claimant following their marriage in 2004.30 The Secondary Claimant has seventeen years of education, and possesses both undergraduate and graduate degrees in XXXX. From 2004 to 2010, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX targeted at XXXX living in Moscow that focussed on XXXX XXXX XXXX. From 2010 to 2013, she was a XXXX XXXX for a XXXX XXXX XXXX in Afghanistan. After relocating to Indonesia, she was unemployed because she was looking after the XXXX XXXX and because it was difficult to find employment where they resided.\n[31] Based on their backgrounds, the Panel concludes that the adult Claimants have demonstrated a significant degree of resourcefulness, independence, and adaptability. While the Claimants expressed concern with respect to economic opportunities, including with regard to finding employment, in cities outside Moscow, their personal backgrounds are indicative of individuals that will successfully adapt to a new location. As canvassed above, the NDP information indicates that ethnic minorities, marginalized elsewhere, have integrated well into Rostov-on-Don.31 Further, the Claimants do not have first-hand knowledge of Rostov-on-Don; it is clear that their concerns regarding cities outside of Moscow is based on a general impression. The Panel is not aware of any documentary evidence before it, nor was the Panel directed to any, that indicates that the present economic circumstances in Rostov-on-Don are so problematic that individuals with the adult Claimants' profiles would be unable to establish a livelihood. Certainly, the Claimants may require a period of time to adapt to the locality; however, that does not establish the IFA as unreasonable in the circumstances.\n[32] As noted above, the Claimants expressed concerns related to other factors, such as ordinary crime and corruption. These are general conditions faced by Russian citizens. There was insufficient evidence before the Panel to conclude that these general conditions, insofar as they exist in Rostov-on-Don, are of such a nature to make the IFA location unreasonable in the circumstances of the Claimants.\n[33] Having regard to the totality of the relevant evidence, the Panel finds that Rostov-on-Don is a reasonable IFA location.\nAn Internal Flight Alternative is Available to the Claimants\n[34] The Panel has found that the Claimants do not face a serious possibility of persecution in the proposed IFA of Rostov-on-Don. Further, the Panel has found that the proposed IFA of Rostov-on-Don is reasonable in all of the circumstances. Accordingly, the Panel finds that Rostov-on-Don, Russia, is an IFA available to the Claimants.\n[35] As an IFA is available, the claims are not established whether they are assessed pursuant to s. 96 or ss. 97(1) of IRPA.\nCONCLUSION\n[36] The Panel concludes that the Claimants are not Convention refugees, pursuant to s. 96 of IRPA, as they do not face a serious possibility of persecution in Russia. The Panel further finds that the Claimants are not persons in need of protection pursuant to ss. 97(1) of IRPA. Therefore, the claims are rejected.\n(signed)\n\" Robert L. Gibson \"\nRobert L.

In assessing the credibility of a claimant and his actions, the panel is entitled to rely on its rationality and common sense. The panel is aware that the sworn testimony of a claimant is presumed to be true unless there are valid reasons to doubt it. The panel finds that the principal claimant's evidence is not credible with regard to her identity.\n[7] Section 106 of the IRPA states:\nThe Refugee Protection Division must take into account, with respect to the credibility of a claimant, whether the claimant possesses acceptable documentation establishing identity, and if not, whether they have provided a reasonable explanation for the lack of documentation or have taken reasonable steps to obtain the documentation.\n[8] Similarly, Section 11 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules requires that:\nThe claimant must provide acceptable documents establishing identity and other elements of the claim. A claimant who does not provide acceptable documents must explain why they were not provided and what steps were taken to provide them.\n[9] As noted by the Federal Court in Su, \"[t]he onus is on the claimant to produce acceptable documentation establishing his or her identity.\"2 Furthermore, the Federal Court in Duale noted that \"it is up to the claimant to establish his identity and he must make a genuine, substantive effort to do so.\"3\n[10] The burden therefore rests on the principal claimant to establish, with credible and trustworthy evidence, on a balance of probabilities, that she is who she says she is, and that she is a national of DRC.\nGabon passport\n[11] The principal claimant came to Canada on a passport issued from Gabon.4 She testified that she is not a citizen of Gabon, contrary to what is indicated on the Gabon passport. She testified that she obtained the passport with the help of a woman, who took all the necessary steps to get the file together for the passport. When asked, the principal claimant testified that she did not know what steps the woman took, and that she did not give the woman any documents. The principal claimant testified that she did go to an office to have her picture taken and provide her fingerprints, but she testified she was not sure what office it was. The claimant also testified that her birth date was incorrect, it says 1980 rather than 1982, but that she just accepted the error as she needed the passport to flee Gabon.\n[12] The panel received post-hearing biometrics5 which indicates that the principal claimant requested a visa using her Gabonese passport. According to the information in the biometrics report, the principal claimant was born on XXXX XXXX, 1980, is Franceville, Gabon, and is of Gabonese nationality. The biometrics also indicates that the principal claimant was employed as an XXXX XXXX XXXX in Libreville, Gabon.\n[13] The panel finds that the biometrics report corroborates the authenticity of the Gabonese passport, as the U.S. authorities did not have concerns regarding its authenticity. The panel notes that the claimant used the Gabonese passport to apply for a visa and to travel to the United States. The panel finds it more likely than not that the Gabonese passport used by the principal claimant is a genuine Gabonese passport, and provides it significant weight in establishing the principal claimant's identity.\n[14] Given the lack of evidence to show that the principal claimant is a Congolese citizen, as discussed below, and given that the panel found the Gabonese passport to be authentic, the panel finds that the principal claimant has Gabonese nationality as indicated on the Gabonese passport.\nElectoral card\n[15] The principal claimant submitted a DRC electoral card in support of her identity. The panel finds that the electoral card submitted is not a reliable document for the following reasons.\n[16] The panel notes that the principal claimant's electoral card says \"duplicata\" and was issued in XXXX 2016, after she was living in Gabon. When asked, the principal claimant testified that she first obtained the electoral card in 2006. She testified that she went to the enrolment centre, presented her birth certificate, had her photo and fingerprints taken, and was given the electoral card. When asked where that birth certificate is now, the principal claimant testified that she did not know, and had to get a new one to give to the Board.\n[17] When asked how she obtained this duplicate copy of her electoral card, the principal claimant testified that her uncle went and asked for the copy. She testified that since it was just a copy, he did not need to provide any documents, he simply asked for it, they checked the archives and gave him a copy of the card.\n[18] Based on her testimony that anyone can go and ask for a copy of someone else's electoral card, without providing any documents as corroboration, the panel finds this reason to doubt the reliability of the electoral card.\n[19] In addition, the Minister submitted a document analysis report as post-hearing evidence. The report concludes that based on the information before the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA), the electoral card submitted by the claimant is \"probably authentic,\" however, CBSA also noted that they believe to the document to be \"apocryphal\",6 meaning it is of doubtful authenticity. The report identified the following issues: the bar code is of low quality, it is not readable by their scanner, and the word \"sexe\" has a different font from the sample document.\n[20] The claimant was given a chance to provide submissions on the report. The claimant's counsel submitted that the document analysis report concluded that the electoral card was probably authentic, which meets the standard of proof, that identity must be established on a balance of probabilities. Counsel also submitted that it would be unfair to discount the validity of the card given that the sample it was compared to was not in evidence, and the claimant's electoral card is consistent with the appearance and content as set out in item 3.11 of the National Documentation Package.\n[21] With respect to Counsel's submissions, the panel notes that the report includes a visual comparison of the claimant's card and the sample card, of the bar code area and the word \"sexe\". It can be seen from this comparison that the bar code and the word \"sexe\" are clearly different.\n[22] The panel also notes that when compared to the example of an electoral card contained in the documentary evidence,7 the bar code on the claimant's electoral card does appear to be of different quality and the font is different for the word \"sexe\". The panel notes that this is consistent with the Report submitted by the Minister. Accordingly, the panel finds there is additional reason to doubt the authenticity of the electoral card.\n[23] For these reasons, the panel places no weight on the electoral card in support of the principal claimant's identity, and draws a negative inference with respect to the principal claimant's credibility.\nBirth certificates\n[24] The principal claimant provided a copy of her birth certificate which was issued in XXXX 2016. When asked, the principal claimant testified that her female cousin went and asked for the copy of her birth certificate, she did not need to present any sort of identification document, since it was in the archives, a copy was provided to her.\n[25] According to a Response to Information Request (RIR) on the prevalence and availability of fraudulent documents, falsified documents are easy to obtain in DRC.8 Regarding birth certificates specifically, the RIR notes that \"twenty percent of cases are falsifications: The documents are not recorded in the civil status register .... [Because of the weaknesses of the civil status system,] it is easy for an individual to obtain false documents.\"9\n[26] Based on her testimony that anyone can go and ask for a copy of someone else's birth certificate, without providing any documents as corroboration, and the contradictory documentary evidence which indicates that there is no civil status register, the panel finds there is reason to doubt the reliability of the birth certificate. As such, the panel places no weight on the document to support the principal claimant's identity.\n[27] The claimants submitted an attestation of declaration of birth (\"attestation de declaration de naissance\") for each of the minor claimants. The panel notes that the documents indicate that the principal claimant is their mother and was born in Kinshasa. When asked, the principal claimant testified that she did not provide any identification documents, she simply told the doctor the name of herself and her husband. The panel finds that these documents do not establish that the principal claimant currently has DRC citizenship.\nOther documents\n[28] The panel asked the principal claimant about other possible identity documents she could have obtained from DRC. Based on the questions asked, the principal claimant testified that she does not have a certificate of nationality, a driver's licence, or another DRC ID card. She also testified that she never had a DRC passport. When asked about possible school documents, she testified that she had some at some point, but is not sure where all her documents ended up. The claimant testified that she was a stay at home mother in DRC and as such, could not obtain a letter of employment.\n[29] The principal claimant provided a handwritten letter from her husband, who is currently in Gabon with their other child, and a copy of his DRC nationality certificate. The panel notes that the letter does not indicate the citizenship of the principal claimant. As such, the panel finds that neither document establish that the principal claimant has DRC citizenship.\n[30] The principal claimant also presented her mother's Canadian passport and birth certificate indicating that her mother was born in Lubumbashi, DRC as post hearing evidence.10 Counsel submitted that the principal claimant's relationship with her mother had already been established by CBSA when she was allowed to enter Canada,11 and since the principal claimant was born in DRC to a mother who was also born in DRC, the principal claimant is of DRC citizenship. Counsel also relied on the DRC citizenship legislation12 and the principal claimant's birth certificate. Counsel also submitted that the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) previously accepted the principal claimant's mother as a refugee with Congolese citizenship.\n[31] The panel finds that even if it can be accepted that the claimant was born in DRC, to a mother who was also born there, neither this nor the RPD's acceptance of her mother's DRC citizenship at the time of her refugee claim, establish that the principal claimant is currently a citizen of DRC. In light of the probative value of the Gabonese passport, the panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the principal claimant's mother's former DRC citizenship is not enough to establish that the principal claimant is currently a citizen of DRC.\nPort of Entry (POE) notes and intake forms\n[32] The principal claimant submitted an amendment to her Basis of Claim form narrative, as well as some of her intake forms.13 The Imm0008 form she filled out when she made her refugee claim originally indicated that she was born in Libreville, Gabon, has Gabonese citizenship, was married on XXXX XXXX, 2000, and was a visitor in DRC from XXXX XXXX, 2006 to XXXX XXXX, 2010.14 The claimant amended that form to say that she was born in Kinshasa, is a citizen of the DRC, was married on XXXX XXXX, 2009, and was in Gabon from XXXX XXXX, 2010 to XXXX XXXX, 2016 as a visitor.15\n[33] When asked about these substantial changes, the principal claimant testified that she presented the immigration officer with her Gabonese passport, and he filled out the forms accordingly. As for the date of marriage, the principal claimant testified that that was a typo. When asked she realized the forms were wrong and decided to make the changes, the principal claimant testified that she presented her electoral card and is not a citizen of Gabon, so she wanted to change that. The panel finds this explanation to be not reasonable. The panel notes that the claimant presented her electoral card to the CBSA when she made her claim, which is the same time she filled out the forms, including Imm0008, on September 16, 2016. Yet the claimant only submitted an amended Imm0008 form on October 21, 2016. The claimant could have told the CBSA officials what she alleges is the correct information initially or asked them to modify the forms before signing them on September 16, 2016.\n[34] The claimant's Counsel submitted that the Federal Court in Cetinkaya, citing Wu,16 warned of the dangers of relying on POE notes as the circumstances surrounding the taking of those statements is far from ideal and questions about their reliability will often arise. The panel notes that in the case of Cetinkaya, the Board was faulted for making adverse credibility finings against the claimant based on a lack of detail provided in the POE notes.\n[35] The panel notes that in this case, the claimant presented both her Gabon passport and her DRC electoral card to the CBSA when she made her claim. She signed the forms after they were filled out, indicating that she was from Gabon. The panel also notes that in her POE interview, she claimed to be a citizen of the DRC born in Kinshasa. As such, the panel finds the principal claimant's willingness to sign papers indicating that she was born in Libreville and was a citizen of Gabon to be all the more unreasonable. While the panel is cognizant of the circumstances in which intake forms and POE interviews are given, the intake forms are filled out in French, the only language the principal claimant indicated she speaks,17 the POE interview was conducted in French, and the principal claimant signed the Imm0008 form indicating that the information she provided was correct and exact.18 Given that the claimant did not provide a reasonable explanation for her amendment to form Imm0008, the panel draws a negative inference with respect to the claimant's credibility.\nSummary\n[36] While it is possible that the principal claimant was born in DRC, the panel finds that the principal claimant has not shown, on a balance of probabilities, that she currently has Congolese citizenship. The panel prefers the Gabonese passport to the evidence submitted by the principal claimant, which indicates that she has Gabonese nationality. Given that DRC does not allow dual citizenship,19 the panel finds that even if the principal claimant were born in DRC, she currently has Gabonese nationality and as such, no longer has DRC citizenship. As the principal claimant has not presented any credible or trustworthy evidence to establish her DRC nationality, the panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the principal claimant is not a citizen of DRC. Furthermore, the panel notes that the principal claimant withdrew her claim against Gabon at the start of the hearing and that her only allegations of risk in Gabon relate to her being a foreigner who risks return to DRC.\n[37] Based on the negative credibility findings regarding the principal claimant's national identity, the panel has reason to doubt the veracity of all of the principal claimant's evidence, including her allegations that she faces a risk in DRC. The panel therefore finds that the principal claimant has not established her personal identity or Congolese citizenship on a balance of probabilities and finds that the central allegations in this case, that she faces a risk of harm at the hands of the DRC government forces, are not credible on a balance of probabilities.\nMinor claimants\n[38] The minor claimant's came to Canada on passports from Gabon in the names XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX.20 The passports both indicate that the minor claimants were born in Libreville, Gabon, and have Gabonese citizenship. The panel finds there to be no reason on the face of the passports to doubt their authenticity and accords it significant weight in establishing the identity of the minor claimants.\n[39] The claimants submitted an attestation of declaration of birth (\"attestation de declaration de naissance\") for each of the minor claimants in the names XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.21 The attestations indicate that the minor claimants were both born in Libreville, Gabon, to parents who were born in DRC.\n[40] The principal claimant testified the same woman who helped her to obtain her passport also helped obtain the passports for the minor claimants. She testified that the minor claimants are DRC citizens given that she and her husband are DRC citizens. Having found that the principal claimant did not establish her Congolese nationality on a balance of probabilities, the panel has reason to doubt her allegations that the minor claimants have DRC citizenship as well.\n[41] The claimants submitted a copy of the nationality certificate for the father of the minor claimants. Even if the panel accepts that the minor claimants were born in Gabon, to a father who was a citizen of the DRC, the panel finds that the claimants have not shown, on a balance of probabilities, that the minor claimants currently have Congolese citizenship. The panel prefers the Gabonese passports to the evidence submitted by the claimants, which indicates that they have Gabonese nationality. Given that DRC does not allow dual citizenship,22 the panel finds that even if the minor claimants were born in Gabon to one or both parents with DRC citizenship, they currently have Gabonese nationality and as such, no longer have DRC citizenship.\n[42] As the claimants have not presented any credible or trustworthy evidence to establish the DRC nationality of the minor claimants, the panel finds that, on a balance of probabilities, the minor claimants are not citizens of DRC. Furthermore, the panel notes that the claimants withdrew their claim against Gabon at the start of the hearing and that their only allegation of risk in Gabon relates to being foreigners who risk return to DRC.\nCONCLUSION\n[43] Having considered the evidence before it, the panel finds that the claimants have not met the burden of, on a balance of probabilities, establishing their national identity.\n[44] Accordingly their claims for refugee protection are rejected.\n(signed)\n\"Catherine Smith\"\nCatherine Smith\nDecember 20, 2016\nDate\n1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act S.C.
